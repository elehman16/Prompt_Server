In its broadest sense, &#x0201c;family&#x0201d; includes both family members and others who have a caring bond with the dying person, and hence &#x0201c;significant other&#x0201d; is probably a better term. Most significant other are extensively emotionally involved throughout the disease course, and in some cases are also involved in care provision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The loss of a close person, independent of the reason, is usually a traumatic experience. All people grieve differently; some need professional help while others are resilient in their loss and do not require special interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It has been debated if grief should be medicalised or not. Dyregrov [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] means that grief should not be overgeneralised; efforts should be put in &#x0201c;separating sad, but ordinary, experiences from those that often lead to serious clinical illness (p. 9)&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Grief is defined as an internal experience in reaction to the loss of something loved and valued [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This loss can lead to the experience of losing control, and experiencing overwhelming emotions such as, fear, loneliness, loss of identity, and other difficult feelings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, despite this misery, most grieving individuals do not develop&#x000a0;mental and or physical complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A minor number of significant other in the bereavement period show increased risk for hospitalisation and death as well as depression, mental illness, and substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Ideas and assumptions about grief and coping with grief have changed over time. Lindemann stated in the 1940s that if normal grief is shared with professional help, it is possible to settle an uncomplicated grief reaction in four to six weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. More recently, Reynolds et al. argued that grief and depression are normal emotions in bereavement, but that symptoms of grief resolve more slowly than medically treated depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. For a minority of people, when normal grief turns into complicated grief the result may be considerable functional impairment, co-morbid depression, and/or other anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lindqvist and Tishelman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] suggests that patient and public involvement is needed to inspire a salutogenetic approach in palliative care, including bereavement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For many years it has been debated whether providing support for bereaved informal caregivers should be recommended in palliative guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The methods and effects of bereavement support have, however, been debated. In hostile and dysfunctional families, bereavement support may even worsen grief and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Another question in clinical practice is whether those who may benefit from bereavement support the most are among those who do not participate in the bereavement support activities that are offered to them.</p><p>Bereavement groups are believed to be beneficial as preventive interventions from social and economic standpoints. Participation is likely to be more acceptable and less threatening to potential recipients than professional interventions linked to psychiatry. Costs can be low, since groups are usually led by staff or volunteers rather than mental health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Group interventions may also lessen the likelihood of development of complicated grief including risks of mental health problems such as major depression or anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], as well as sudden death, suicide, lack of social support, and/or isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The emotional stress and grieving experienced by informal caregivers after the patient&#x02019;s death is well known, and the recommended practice of bereavement support seems intuitively sound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Nevertheless, the evidence base for measurable effects of this intervention needs to be complemented by more prospective controlled intervention studies using validated and well-known questionnaires. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether we could detect measurable effects on grief, anxiety, and depression in those participating in bereavement groups in comparison to non-participating controls. A secondary aim was to use the same methodology to compare non-participants who had wanted to participate but could not for practical reasons with non-participants who did not want to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study setting was a county in northern Sweden with 126 500 inhabitants (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;% of the full Swedish population) and an area of 49 443&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup> (2.6 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>), consisting of mountains, rural areas, and one urban area close to the only city in the middle of the county. The county is served by one hospital and a specialised palliative home care team based at the hospital that treats approximately 150 patients per year. Consecutive invitations were sent 3&#x02013;6 months after death of all palliative patients to one significant other per patient offering participation in a bereavement group. During the two-year period of this study, invitations resulted in ten bereavement groups being held at the hospital, each with three to eleven participants and jointly led by a nurse from the palliative care unit, a social worker, and a clergy member or deacon from the hospital church. All facilitators were salaried entirely from tax money, without any charity contributions. Social workers, clergy members, and deacons are formally trained for counselling during their education, while registered nurses touch on the subject during their basic training. The professionals tutoring the bereavement groups were either members of the palliative care unit (nurses) or members of the hospital staff (social workers, clergy members, deacons), and all had several years of clinical experience of counselling family members and significant other to palliative patients. Before the start of each bereavement group, the relevant facilitators met to discuss aspects of the forthcoming group including the methodology, the facilitating approach, and the main theme of the planned meeting. The bereavement group themes and methodology followed the rationale recommended by the hospital churches in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The underlying theory was the potentially positive effect of verbalisation and re-exposure of the grief experience in a safe group context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Each bereavement group met once a week for five weeks; meetings included afternoon tea and lasted for two hours. Each of the five meetings had a predefined theme: 1) presentation of the methodology and introduction of the members in the group, 2) the time of the illness until death, 3) the time of death, 4) the time after death and the funeral, and 5) depicting a metaphorical picture of the deceased and the significant other&#x02019;s life together. The meetings were held in a separate room with participants and facilitators seated around the same table. The role of the facilitators was not to lecture, but to listen, let the participants discuss, and make sure everyone had a chance to express their thoughts and emotions.</p><p>Two weeks after being invited to the bereavement group by the facilitators, each invited person was sent a package including an informed consent form, a questionnaire containing background questions, the Texas Revised Inventory of Grief (TRIG) questionnaire, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire; these questionnaires were intended to be completed before the start of the bereavement groups. In the information letter, all invited persons were also informed that new packages of questionnaires would be sent on two more occasions unless they declined the informed consent.</p><p>Based on earlier experiences, we were well aware that only a small number of those invited would participate in the bereavement groups offered. However, this also gave an opportunity to investigate any differences between participants and non-participants. Five weeks after the last meeting of the bereavement group, both participants and non-participants were sent a post-intervention package including the TRIG and HADS questionnaires. The final follow-up package including TRIG and HADS was sent about 1&#x000a0;year after the intervention to persons who had answered both earlier questionnaires (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). At all occasions, one reminder was sent to those who had not answered within two weeks. The inclusion criterion for this study was completed questionnaires at all three occasions.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participation in bereavement groups and answers to questionnaires</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12904_2016_129_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Socio-demographic questions were constructed by the authors, and covered gender, age, education, working status, relation to the deceased, time since death, living alone or not, participation in bereavement groups, and desire to participate. Open questions provided the respondents with an opportunity to comment on their experiences of any effects of participation in the bereavement groups. For non-participants, these questions gave the opportunity to describe other kinds of grief experiences and support.</p><p>The TRIG questionnaire is a 21-item patient-completed questionnaire that measures an individual&#x02019;s experience of grief. It consists of two scales: Past Behaviour and Present Feelings. In this study, only the Swedish version of the Present Feelings scale was used. Faschingbauer et al.&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] psychometric tests of the instrument has revealed that thoughts, feelings, memories, opinions and attitudes are all being tapped by this second part of the instrument. Since the main focus in this study was to assess the bereaved person&#x02019;s present grief reactions in a longitudinal design, only the second part of the instrument was used. Thirteen items were assessed on a Likert scale with five response alternatives: &#x0201c;completely true&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mostly true&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;true and false&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;mostly false&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;completely false&#x0201d;. TRIG measures grief from several different angles, including thoughts, feelings, memories, opinions, and attitude. It is used to identify grief reactions, and is suitable for measuring grief over time. It is known to show gender differences, and to reflect that spouses are likely to experience greater levels of grief than other relatives. TRIG presents grief as either normal or severe. The lower score, the more severe grief. Scores up to 39, i.e. the 50th percentile, are defined as severe grief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this study, grief was defined as either normal or severe according to Faschingbauer et al., who stated that a person with severe grief suffers from a greater life disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>To detect anxiety and depressive mood, the Swedish version of the HADS was used. The HADS consists of 14 items measuring levels of anxiety and depression in two separate subscales. Each item has four response categories, reflecting a continuum of increasing level of emotional distress in the somatically ill. Total scale scores range from 0 (no symptoms) to 21 (maximum distress) for both depressive mood and anxiety. This patient-completed scale can reliably detect the presence of depressive mood and anxiety. Its subscales have been shown to be valid measures of the severity of emotional distress, with 0&#x02013;7 points indicating &#x0201c;non-cases&#x0201d;, 8&#x02013;10 points indicating &#x0201c;doubtful cases&#x0201d;, and &#x0003e;10 points indicating &#x0201c;cases&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Numerical data were analysed using version 22 of the SPSS software package (IBM Corporation). Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used to detect differences between groups, and Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank test was used to detect longitudinal changes. Ranges, means, and 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were calculated. Groups were defined as &#x0201c;participant in bereavement group&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;non-participant unable to participate&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;non-participant not wanting to participate&#x0201d;. Missing answers were considered as missing data, and not included in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Questionnaires were sent to 246 invited persons (155 [63&#x000a0;%] women and 91 [37&#x000a0;%] men) at pre-intervention and at post-intervention five weeks after the end of the bereavement group, and to 153 persons (101 [66&#x000a0;%] women and 52 [34&#x000a0;%] men) at follow-up one year after the intervention.

However, no measurable effects on grief, anxiety, or depression could be detected following participation in bereavement groups up to one year post-intervention. Accordingly, the results raise the question of whether grievers can actually benefit from bereavement groups with this specific methodology. One must keep in mind there are very different ways of grieving. Some persons may prefer retreat, or going on with their &#x0201c;business as usual&#x0201d;, while others may just benefit from exchange and sharing their experiences in a group. However, according to answers to the open questions, the bereavement groups seemed to produce positive effects which could not be captured by the chosen outcome measures, such as a deeper insight into the grieving process and a feeling of joint experience in grief. It cannot be told how anxiety, depressive mood and grief would have evolved in participants without the intervention.</p><p>Nearly half (49&#x000a0;%) of the individuals in our study stated that they had no need for bereavement group participation. They seemed to be able to handle their grief themselves and/or with support from their social network. The results of this study indicate that we as health care staff do not have to worry about most of those persons who decline participation in bereavement groups, as they show less severe grief and anxiety than others. Support from professional staff has been shown to be necessary only when the family network is dysfunctional, with poor communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, self-reported reasons of not wanting to participate may be a potential limitation of results. For example, depending on the level of psychological strain, one might regard geographical distance or lack of time as unaffordable obstacles to participation.</p><p>This study showed differences among non-participants, between those who were unable to participate and those who did not want to participate. The latter group experienced less grief and anxiety both at five weeks and one year post-intervention. It is notable that those unable to participate also had a tendency to experience more anxiety than the participants before the time of the intervention. One potential bias is that it is not known in this study to what extent significant others were parts of the caregiving for their dying loved one. Research shows that taking part in the caregiving gives a meaning of death and capacities for resilience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Bereavement group interventions are widely used by the Swedish Church, but the present study questions whether this concept is the best way to cater for people with severe grief. Other strategies could perhaps be a better way of providing support, and a more flexible offer regarding time of day and method of support. Use of, for example, the Internet, telephone calls, and personal meetings could possibly increase the likelihood of finding ways to help people who want to participate but are unable to for any reason. The major obstacles to participation in bereavement groups for those unable to participate were overly-long travel distance (40&#x000a0;%) and work (24&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Research shows that optimal bereavement support begins with significant others being a part of the dying process, and recognised as members of the health care team, regardless of their roles of responsibility and assistance in the care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Empirical evidence shows that early intervention provided to a distressed family before the death of a terminally ill patient can ease their bereavement and reduce depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A study of a support group programme for relatives during the late palliative phase revealed a sense of belonging, created by sharing similar experiences and not being alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. An open and honest discussion between caregivers, patients, and significant others about the impending death may improve the prospect of identifying probable cases of complicated grief, anxiety, and depression. To ensure that professional support is given to those who need it most, and with optimal effects, our suggestion would be that the bereavement support begins as soon as the individual at risk is identified; that is, ideally when the patient is still alive.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we lack information about grief, anxiety, and depression among those 50&#x000a0;% who declined study participation. Reminding letters were sent once, but as stated earlier, these people were in a potentially vulnerable life situation which understandably may have decreased their willingness to participate in a scientific study. Respecting the choice of a person who has declined study participation is in accordance with the essence of the Helsinki declaration of Good Clinical Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. With regard to this, a 50&#x000a0;% response rate on three extensive packs of questionnaires during a period of one year must be seen as an acceptable answering frequency.</p><p>Another potential limitation of the study is that only 38 study participants received the intervention, which may be regarded as too low power to enable detection of an existing difference. Our clinical opinion is that if relevant differences in treatment effects are not detected in an intervention group of 10 to 15 persons, in spite of 10&#x000a0;hours counselling with three experienced facilitators, treatments are difficult to motivate as &#x0201c;value for money&#x0201d;. As this study compared 38 intervention persons with 86 controls, we regard the results as clinically interesting. However, attendance rate was high at meetings so the results may give a reasonable picture.</p><p>Usually, the respondents are those most in favour of the intervention; but despite this, the present study did not succeed in detecting an impact of the intervention. TRIG may seem to be a blunt assessment tool, only measuring &#x0201c;grief&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;severe grief&#x0201d; and not able to identify possible risk groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. On the other hand, the HADS has been shown to be a valid scale measuring anxiety and depression separately, as originally suggested by its authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Still, both questionnaires are used worldwide, allowing valid comparisons to be made with other studies. The differing findings from the open-ended question and the results from TRIG and HADS suggest that further qualitative research is needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Before the bereavement group intervention, most respondents (81&#x000a0;%) reported levels of severe grief.

No differences in levels of depression were detected between any groups either before or after the intervention.</p><p>Open-ended questions revealed anonymous, mostly positive effects of participation in bereavement groups which were not captured by the questionnaires measuring grief, anxiety, and depression.
