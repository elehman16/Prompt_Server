The original study has been described previously <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> and further detail on study methods is also provided in Table S1 of File S1. Briefly, patients were randomized (2&#x02009;:&#x02009;1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1) to once&#x02010;daily injections of IDegLira, insulin degludec or liraglutide (open&#x02010;label), with patients stratified for the following factors: baseline glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) concentration [HbA1c &#x02264;8.3 or &#x0003e;8.3% (&#x02264;67 or &#x0003e;67&#x02009;mmol/mol)]; concomitant oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) treatment (metformin background or metformin&#x02009;+&#x02009;pioglitazone background); and participation in a substudy involving a standardized meal test and continuous glucose monitoring <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0009">IDegLira (insulin degludec 100&#x02009;U/ml plus liraglutide 3.6&#x02009;mg/ml), insulin degludec (100&#x02009;U/ml) and/or liraglutide (6&#x02009;mg/ml) were all administered subcutaneously. The IDegLira dosing unit is defined as a dose step, with one dose step comprising 1 unit of insulin degludec and 0.036&#x02009;mg liraglutide in a volume of 0.01&#x02009;ml. IDegLira was started at 10 dose steps (10&#x02009;U insulin degludec plus 0.36&#x02009;mg liraglutide, once daily).</p><p id="dom12498-para-0010">As in the original 26&#x02010;week trial, adjustment of IDegLira was performed twice weekly based on the mean of three consecutive daily fasting self&#x02010;monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements immediately before dose adjustment. Adjustments occurred in two dose steps (2&#x02009;U insulin degludec and 0.072&#x02009;mg liraglutide) to the fasting glycaemic target of 4.0&#x02013;5.0&#x02009;mmol/l (72&#x02013;90&#x02009;mg/dl). Insulin degludec treatment was initiated with 10&#x02009;U, and titrated twice weekly to the fasting glycaemic target of 4.0&#x02013;5.0&#x02009;mmol/l (72&#x02013;90&#x02009;mg/dl) based on the mean SMBG (fasting) from three preceding measurements as described for IDegLira. IDegLira, at the maximum allowable dose of 50 dose steps, provides 50 units of insulin degludec and 1.8&#x02009;mg of liraglutide. There was no limit to the titration of insulin degludec. Liraglutide treatment was started at 0.6&#x02009;mg/day and subsequently increased by 0.6&#x02009;mg in weekly dose escalation steps to a maximum dose of 1.8&#x02009;mg/day. Liraglutide dose was to remain unchanged after dose escalation to 1.8&#x02009;mg/day. In the extension phase, the twice&#x02010;weekly adjustment of IDegLira and insulin degludec, aiming at the same fasting glucose target, was to be continued.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0011">The primary endpoint of DUAL 1 was change from baseline in HbA1c at 26&#x02009;weeks of treatment. The 52&#x02010;week secondary endpoints included change from baseline in HbA1c concentration, percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets of &#x0003c;7 and &#x02264;6.5%, and changes from baseline in laboratory&#x02010;measured fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body weight, insulin dose and nine&#x02010;point SMBG profiles. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses were performed to examine whether the effects of IDegLira (regarding HbA1c, insulin dose and hypoglycaemia) were consistent across the range of baseline BMI categories.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0012">Protocol&#x02010;defined safety variables are presented in Table S1 of File S1. With respect to relationship to trial product, &#x02018;probably&#x02019; related adverse events (AEs) were those with good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal relationship, &#x02018;possibly&#x02019; related AEs were those for which a causal relationship was conceivable and could not be dismissed. AEs determined to be &#x02018;unlikely&#x02019; to be related to trial products were those that did not fit into either one of the above categories. Certain types of AEs (pancreatitis or suspicion of pancreatitis, neoplasms, thyroid disease requiring thyroidectomy and cardiovascular disease) were adjudicated by an independent external adjudication committee (EAC) that was blinded to treatment assignment (Table S2, File S1). The EAC was divided into three subcommittees that evaluated events according to areas of expertise: cardiovascular events (two cardiologists and two neurologists); pancreatitis events (two gastroenterologists); neoplasms; and thyroid disease requiring thyroidectomy (two oncologists and one endocrinologist). Diagnostic criteria for the individual adjudicated AEs were established via a specific EAC Charter before the trial initiation. Positively adjudicated events were those AEs which the EAC confirmed met these predefined criteria. Calcitonin monitoring was included in the trial, supervised by an independent calcitonin monitoring committee of thyroid experts.</p><sec id="dom12498-sec-0007"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="dom12498-para-0013">An analysis of covariance (<sc>ancova</sc>) model was used for efficacy analysis (HbA1c) on the full analysis set, with treatment, previous OADs, baseline HbA1c stratum, substudy participation and country as fixed factors, and the corresponding baseline value as covariate. The last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach was used to impute missing values for endpoints derived at 52&#x02009;weeks of treatment. Changes from baseline after 52&#x02009;weeks of treatment in body weight, laboratory&#x02010;measured FPG, and endpoints derived from nine&#x02010;point SMBG profiles were analysed separately using a similar <sc>ancova</sc> model to that used for the primary endpoint; however, for end&#x02010;of&#x02010;trial dose, baseline HbA1c was included as a covariate instead of baseline dose. The number of confirmed hypoglycaemic episodes was analysed using a negative binomial regression model with a log&#x02010;link function and treatment, previous OADs, baseline HbA1c stratum, substudy participation and country as fixed factors, and the logarithm of the exposure time as offset <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>.

The overall rate of AEs was similar with IDegLira and insulin degludec and lower than with liraglutide (407.9 vs 383.3 vs 507.3 events per 100 PYE, respectively). During the 52&#x02010;week treatment period, the proportion of patients with AEs leading to withdrawal was lower with IDegLira (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14, 1.7%) and insulin degludec (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9, 2.2%) than with liraglutide (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26, 6.3%). This appeared to be attributable to AEs occurring during the early weeks of the main trial. When only the 26&#x02010;week extension phase was considered, withdrawals because of AEs were fewer, and there were similar rates for all three treatment groups (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, 0.6%; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, 0.2%; and n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2, 0.5% for IDegLira, insulin degludec and liraglutide, respectively). The increased numbers of AEs possibly or probably related to treatment and withdrawals attributable to AEs in the liraglutide group were related to the higher frequency of GI events shortly after initiating liraglutide. The incidence of nausea was similar in all three treatment groups during the extension phase (Figure S5, File S1).</p><table-wrap id="dom12498-tbl-0002" xml:lang="en" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Summary of adverse events</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><thead valign="bottom"><tr style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000"><th id="dom12498-ent-0054" style="border-bottom:solid 1px #000000" align="left" valign="bottom" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th colspan="2" align="left" id="dom12498-ent-0055" valign="bottom" rowspan="1">

The overall rate of SAEs was 6.7 per 100 PYE with IDegLira, 8.9 per 100 PYE with insulin degludec and 9.3 per 100 PYE with liraglutide. The majority of SAEs were unlikely to be related to trial product, but 10 SAEs reported in 9 patients (four SAEs with IDegLira, one with insulin degludec and five with liraglutide) were possibly or probably related to trial product.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0022">The definition of a treatment&#x02010;emergent AE has been described previously <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>. There were five AEs reported as pancreatitis by the investigators (three treatment&#x02010;emergent AEs: two with IDegLira and one with liraglutide; two non&#x02010;treatment&#x02010;emergent AEs: one with insulin degludec and one with liraglutide), all of which were adjudicated by the blinded EAC. Of these, one treatment&#x02010;emergent AE (reported as acute pancreatitis in connection to a metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma), was positively adjudicated in the liraglutide group, and one non&#x02010;treatment emergent AE was positively adjudicated in a patient who had been in the insulin degludec group. Additionally, 16 AEs of increased lipase and/or amylase (one screening event during the main trial and 15 treatment&#x02010;emergent AEs: 7 with IDegLira, 2 with insulin degludec and 6 with liraglutide) were identified using predefined searches of the safety database and assessed by the EAC. Of these, one treatment&#x02010;emergent AE (reported as increased lipase) was adjudicated as pancreatitis in the liraglutide group. All of the positively adjudicated events were considered unlikely to be related to the trial drug by the local investigator. The EAC did not assess causality with respect to trial product for the adjudicated events.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0023">A total of 38 treatment&#x02010;emergent cardiovascular events in 24 patients were assessed by the EAC. Of these, 20 events in 13 patients were positively adjudicated (eight with IDegLira, eight with insulin degludec and four with liraglutide), six of which were classified as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), while the remaining 14 events were classified as non&#x02010;MACE (Table S2, File S1). Of the six MACE, four occurred in the IDegLira group (two myocardial infarctions and two cardiovascular deaths) and one (myocardial infarction) in each of the insulin degludec and liraglutide groups. Of the two cardiovascular deaths positively adjudicated in the IDegLira group, one was attributed to sudden death for unknown reasons and one was a result of cardiopulmonary arrest caused by sepsis. Out of the 14 non&#x02010;MACE, 4 occurred in the IDegLira group [coronary revascularization (4)], 7 occurred in the insulin degludec group [coronary revascularization (4), unstable angina pectoris (2), heart failure (1)] and 3 occurred in the liraglutide group [coronary revascularization (2), unstable angina pectoris (1)]. Furthermore, two non&#x02010;treatment cardiovascular events were sent for adjudication, one of which was confirmed as a non&#x02010;MACE (coronary revascularization) in a patient previously on liraglutide.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0024">No medullary thyroid carcinomas were reported, and there were no EAC&#x02010;confirmed thyroid neoplasms. An increase in pulse was observed in the IDegLira (mean 1.8&#x02009;beats/min) and liraglutide (mean 1.4&#x02009;beats/min) groups, whereas pulse remained unchanged with insulin degludec. The ETD regarding mean change in systolic blood pressure from baseline to week 52 between IDegLira and insulin degludec was &#x02212;1.54&#x02009;mmHg (95% CI &#x02212;2.89, &#x02212;0.19; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0256), while there was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure between IDegLira and liraglutide. Regarding diastolic pressure, there was no significant difference between treatment groups from baseline to week 52. An increase from baseline to end of treatment in lipase was observed in the IDegLira and liraglutide groups (mean 8.3 vs 12.5&#x02009;units/l, respectively), whereas a decrease was seen in the insulin degludec group (&#x02212;7.1&#x02009;units/l). A lesser absolute mean increase was observed for amylase with the groups treated with IDegLira or liraglutide. No clinically relevant changes in other biochemical or haematological variables, physical examination, fundoscopy or ECG findings were observed from baseline to end of treatment in any of the treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="dom12498-sec-0009"><title>Discussion</title><p id="dom12498-para-0025">The 52&#x02010;week data followed the trends of the 26&#x02010;week results (shown in Figures <xref rid="dom12498-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, <xref rid="dom12498-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A, <xref rid="dom12498-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>; Figures S3 and S5, File S1) from the DUAL I trial and show sustainability of the glucose&#x02010;lowering effect of IDegLira in insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve patients with T2D previously inadequately controlled on OADs. No new safety issues were observed with the longer exposure. The mean HbA1c concentration with IDegLira at 52&#x02009;weeks [6.4% (47&#x02009;mmol/mol)] was significantly lower compared with either insulin degludec [6.9% (52&#x02009;mmol/mol)] or liraglutide [7.1% (54&#x02009;mmol/mol)]. The prespecified sensitivity analyses were consistent with these results (Table S3, File S1). The superior glucose&#x02010;lowering effects relative to insulin degludec or liraglutide were observed irrespective of baseline BMI. A higher percentage of patients receiving IDegLira achieved HbA1c &#x0003c;7.0% (ADA target) or &#x02264;6.5% (AACE/IDF target) compared with the percentages for insulin degludec and liraglutide. This improvement in glucose control with IDegLira occurred despite the fact that IDegLira and insulin degludec were titrated to an identical prebreakfast plasma glucose target.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0026">In contrast to basal insulin degludec insulin used alone, GLP&#x02010;1RAs, such as liraglutide, address postprandial glucose with glucose&#x02010;dependent stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion and glucose&#x02010;dependent suppression of glucagon <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. The combined effects of IDegLira on fasting glucose and of liraglutide on postprandial glucose are the presumed mechanism for the advantages of IDegLira.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0027">Compared with insulin degludec alone, IDegLira was associated with a 37% lower mean daily insulin dose at 52&#x02009;weeks. This difference in insulin dose was observed for all baseline BMI categories. Despite the lower insulin dose in the IDegLira group, the mean FPG was close to the glycaemic target and similar in both groups. As might be expected with a substantially lower insulin dose and a weight&#x02010;decreasing effect from the liraglutide component, weight gain was avoided with IDegLira, compared with weight gain with insulin degludec. The presence of the insulin component in IDegLira was associated with a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia than liraglutide but a significantly lower incidence than with insulin degludec, despite the lower mean HbA1c concentration achieved.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0028">During the 26&#x02010;week extension of the DUAL I trial, IDegLira continued to be generally well tolerated without any safety concerns in relation to the comparators in terms of standard safety assessments, consistent with the initial 26&#x02010;week main phase of the trial. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, over 52&#x02009;weeks of treatment, the cumulative incidence of confirmed hypoglycaemia was 37% lower with IDegLira than with insulin degludec, despite glycaemic control being significantly better with IDegLira (lower HbA1c). This lower risk of hypoglycaemia with IDegLira compared with insulin degludec was observed across all four categories of baseline BMI, and was statistically significant for the two highest categories.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0029">A greater proportion of patients randomized to liraglutide withdrew during the 26&#x02009;weeks of the main phase, compared with IDegLira or insulin degludec <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> primarily because of the higher frequency of adverse GI events with liraglutide that were deemed probably or possibly related to treatment, but a similar proportion of completers in each group continued in the extension phase. During the extension trial, GI side effects were infrequent: all three treatments showed very low rates of nausea.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0030">With respect to limitations, this trial was open&#x02010;label because the different treatment regimens required different titration schemes and different injection devices. A double&#x02010;dummy design to achieve blinding was regarded as unfeasible because it would have increased the number of injections to an unacceptable level. The trial assessment was based on objective laboratory values. The analyses of key endpoints by categories of baseline BMI were not prespecified.</p><p id="dom12498-para-0031">In summary, data from this DUAL I extension trial show that the glucose&#x02010;lowering effect of IDegLira was sustained for a full year without compromising safety and mitigated the side effects seen with use of the components individually. Compared with insulin degludec, IDegLira was associated with a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c concentration, significantly lower risk of hypoglycaemia, and no (mean) weight gain over the 52&#x02010;week treatment period. Compared with liraglutide, IDegLira was associated with a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c, significantly greater reduction in FPG during the entire trial period, and fewer GI adverse events, especially at treatment initiation. With its effective glycaemic control and lower incidence of side effects, IDegLira could be an attractive alternative for insulin&#x02010;na&#x000ef;ve patients to current treatment intensification options such as initiation of either basal insulin or GLP&#x02010;1RAs alone. Because of the lower frequency of GI events compared with GLP&#x02010;1RAs and the lower frequency of hypoglycaemia compared with basal insulin, and because both active ingredients can be co&#x02010;administered with a single&#x02010;daily injection using a simple pen device, IDegLira may also help overcome clinical inertia with respect to intensifying therapy <xref rid="dom12498-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="dom12498-sec-0011"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p id="dom12498-para-0033">S.
