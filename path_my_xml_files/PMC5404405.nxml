However, there are no established therapeutic strategies, and candidate pharmacological therapies have yet to demonstrate efficacy in reducing or preventing cognitive decline after stroke, using randomized controlled trials in the acute stroke setting.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Randomized controlled trials examining the use of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) symptomatic therapies such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) and memantine have shown some clinical benefits in vascular dementia (VaD) but have not been granted U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration approval for use in VaD primarily because of inconsistent efficacy with respect to activities of daily living and global function.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Approaches targeting multiple pathogenetic mechanisms, such as biological therapies, have hinted at a breakthrough, but the available evidence has also been limited to date.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Actovegin is a deproteinized pyrogen- and antigen-free hemodialysate manufactured from calf blood by ultrafiltration. It contains &#x0003e;200 bioactive constituents (with molecular weight &#x0003c;5 kDa) and exhibits a range of pleiotropic effects.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Actovegin improves oxygen utilization and uptake, as well as energy metabolism and glucose uptake in mitochondria, thereby enhancing oxidative metabolism in the brain.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Actovegin has been shown to possess neuroprotective potential; it ameliorated A&#x003b2;<sub>25&#x02013;35</sub>-induced neuronal apoptosis by reducing caspase-3 levels in a dose-dependent manner and decreasing reactive oxygen species content in hippocampal neurons.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The effects of Actovegin on cerebral metabolism, mortality, and cognitive performance have also been assessed in animal models of cerebral ischemia.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Actovegin facilitated [<sup>14</sup>C] glucose uptake into the brain under hypoxic conditions and normalized metabolic parameters, measured as the concentrations of glucose, lactate, creatine phosphate, and adenosine triphosphate normalized in 2-year-old rats. Most recently, a study in a rat model of transient global cerebral ischemia found that Actovegin significantly decreased hippocampal CA1 cell death and improved spatial learning and memory.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Actovegin received its market authorization in 1976 in Germany; in 1995, production was transferred from Germany to Linz, Austria. Actovegin is registered for clinical use in Austria, Russia, countries of The Commonwealth of Independent States, some Eastern European, and Asian countries. Actovegin was never introduced to the U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration; therefore, it is not marketed in North America. In the clinical setting, Actovegin has been used for around 40 years for the treatment of various neurological disorders, including cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline of various origins. It is also prescribed for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease and diabetic polyneuropathy. In randomized, placebo-controlled trials, Actovegin has been shown to improve cognitive performance in patients with age-associated memory impairment.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Two pilot studies in stroke patients have shown treatment benefits with Actovegin based on many cognitive and neurological deficit measures. It has provided some evidence on the effects of Actovegin in acute ischemic stroke, but these have never been tested in a multicenter randomized study.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Apart from its clinical properties, it has been suggested that Actovegin also has ergogenic effects. This is, however, not based on scientific evidence; the speculation emerged because Actovegin has repeatedly been used as a performance-enhancing drug by professional cyclists and by Olympic athletes, possibly to accelerate muscle injury repair and improve endurance. Late in 2000, Actovegin was included on the World Anti-Doping Agency active list, but it was removed again after 2 months because of insufficient direct evidence demonstrating an ergogenic effect of Actovegin.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The overall safety profile of Actovegin seems favorable, and its clinical use for &#x0003e;35 years has not identified any unacceptable safety concerns. Indeed, the Actovegin summary of product characteristics<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> states that only in rare cases, patients prone to hypersensitivity may develop allergic reactions (medication fever and anaphylactic shock), urticaria, flush, and myalgia. In contrast, AChEIs and memantine have side effects which occur commonly in patients, including gastrointestinal effects (diarrhea or constipation), headache, and dizziness.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>The ARTEMIDA study (A Randomized Trial of Efficacy, 12 Months International Double-Blind Actovegin) was designed to test the hypothesis that Actovegin would confer cognitive benefits in patients with acute ischemic stroke.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In addition, we wanted to explore whether the therapeutic effects are sustained after treatment cessation and provide evidence of efficacy and safety tolerability of Actovegin for the symptomatic effect on PSCI.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study Design, Treatment Regimen, and Procedures</title><p>ARTEMIDA was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study assessing the effects of Actovegin on cognitive functioning in patients with PSCI.

The study consisted of a screening and randomization period (&#x02264;7 days post-stroke), a 6-month double-blind treatment period and a 6-month follow-up period (Figure I in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stroke.ahajournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.014321/-/DC1">online-only Data Supplement</ext-link>). During double-blind treatment, patients were randomized to receive either intravenous Actovegin (0.9% sodium chloride; 2000 mg/250 mL daily for &#x02264;20 infusions followed by 1200 mg/d orally [two 200 mg tablets 3&#x000d7; daily]) or placebo for 6 months. Actovegin and placebo were then discontinued, and patients were followed up for a subsequent 6 months. Patients were hospitalized in stroke units for first or recurrent stroke and received standard stroke care in accordance with local guidelines which included general supportive care, treatment of acute complications, rehabilitation, and antiplatelet therapy; nootropic agents were excluded. Visits were scheduled at baseline, at the end of the infusion period, then every 4 weeks until the end of 6 months treatment, and a single visit 6 months after the end of treatment. Adverse events (AEs), treatment compliance, and concomitant medication use were reported during each visit. The study protocol was approved by each respective institutional review board or ethics committee and followed established Good Clinical Practice guidelines. All patients gave written informed consent to participate in the study.

Changes in MoCA and NIHSS score were analyzed using ANCOVA models, including treatment, grouped center, baseline score, and in addition for MoCA, number of years of education. The least squares (LS [population margin mean]) means, mean differences between treatments, and associated 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated from the ANCOVA models.</p><p>The ADAS-cog has been widely used as the primary efficacy outcome in AD clinical trials and has been used to assess cognitive impairment in stroke trials along with other instruments.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The ADAS-cog+ is an expanded version of the ADAS-cog, which has increased sensitivity in detecting patients with mild cognitive impairment and may be particularly useful in vascular cognitive impairment<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>; however, it has never been used in clinical trials to assess the effects of treatments on cognition in stroke patients. Generally, in clinical trials, outcomes may be measured in different ways.

This is the first prospective randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of Actovegin on cognition in patients who had experienced a recent mild-to-moderate ischemic stroke.</p><p>Actovegin treatment was commenced 5 to 7 days after stroke onset to obtain credible cognitive function data at starting point, and PSCI diagnosed by MoCA<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> was similar in the placebo and Actovegin groups at baseline. Patients with previously diagnosed dementia were excluded; however, it cannot be ruled out that patients may have had prestroke mild AD or vascular cognitive impairment-not dementia.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> PSCI represents vascular cognitive impairment by definition, but vascular and degenerative components often overlap and contribute to cognitive decline over the long term.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>Most patients in this study had multiple vascular risk factors, which could have triggered covert cerebrovascular disease. However, neither AD biomarker assessments nor specific magnetic resonance imaging protocols for detecting white matter abnormalities were included in the study design. This is a potential limitation of this study because patients with white matter lesions or AD changes could have been less susceptible to treatment or had a worse trajectory of cognitive decline after stroke.</p><p>The dosing regimen of Actovegin for this trial reflected current labeling, although oral treatment was for a longer period, thus the dosing regimen in the current study was exploratory to some extent. Our assumption that a 6-month treatment period would be sufficient to show benefits was based on data obtained in large-scale clinical trials on AChEIs for the treatment of vascular cognitive impairment.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The primary efficacy outcome in our study was the change from baseline in ADAS-cog+ at 6 months using the last observation carried forward approach. A statistically significant LS mean treatment difference of 2.3 points in ADAS-cog+ score was achieved in the Actovegin group at 6 months and increased to 3.7 points at 12 months. The mean total ADAS-cog+ scores improved in both groups over 12 months; however, the change was more prominent in the Actovegin group at 3, 6, and 12 months and was supported by the secondary efficacy end point. It is noteworthy that a statistically significant improvement in Actovegin was sustained over 6 months after treatment withdrawal. Significantly more patients receiving Actovegin met the definition of responder comparing to placebo. The proportion of responders increased over time in both treatment groups, which can be partially explained by the spontaneous recovery observed in mild stroke survivors in the placebo group. However, the difference between treatments remained similar at all time points in favor of Actovegin.</p><p>It is debatable whether a statistically significant difference of 2.3 points achieved in ADAS-cog+ score reflects clinically meaningful change. In phase III trials, AChEIs have produced modest cognitive improvements (1&#x02013;2 points on ADAS-cog), but AChEIs have not been granted U.S. Food &#x00026; Drug Administration approval for use in VaD primarily because of inconsistent efficacy with respect to activities of daily living and global function.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> According to The European Medicines Agency guidelines, when choosing efficacy end points in clinical trials in patients with mild cognitive impairment and dementia, it is necessary to demonstrate the clinical relevance of results.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> However, it is also recognized that the inclusion of 2 coprimary end points addressing cognition and functional activities of daily living might be difficult. Currently used cognitive scales have demonstrated a ceiling effect which means that they are not sensitive enough to detect small changes in cognition, whereas complex neuropsychological batteries may be difficult to implement in large clinical trials. Also it is noteworthy that the VaD trials evaluated functional efficacy with the same measures used in AD trials. Stroke patients with cognitive impairment may have noticeable impairments in their daily functioning, not only because of affected cognitive domains, such as executive functions, but also because of motor or language deficits. It explains the fact that in VaD populations, demonstration of functional benefit is more difficult to achieve given the high prevalence of physical disability because of stroke.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In addition, the extent to which individuals are capable to compensate for this deficit and adjust daily activities is highly variable. Therefore, clinical relevance, assessed by instrumental activities or health-related quality of life, may also be greatly confounded by differences in social status and occupational environment.</p><p>The MoCA was chosen as the other secondary supportive cognitive end point. Although the MoCA is considered a sensitive screening instrument to detect PSCI in clinical practice,<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> further research is needed to validate its use as a tool to detect treatment effects and clinically meaningful longitudinal changes in cognitive function.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The thresholds used to define test positivity on scales such as MoCA have been derived from community-dwelling older adults and are not well established in stroke survivor cohorts; it was also not prespecified in this study.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Nevertheless, our results showed a similarity in cognition changes assessed by MoCA and ADAS-cog+ with statistically significant differences in favor of Actovegin sustained during the whole study, which was detected on MoCA scores with Actovegin treatment at month 3 onwards. However, the use of the MoCA as a secondary efficacy end point in our study and the related findings were exploratory, and its validity in testing cognitive changes over time should be tested in further trials.</p><p>A trend toward a reduction in the incidence of dementia was detected with Actovegin versus placebo, but this study was designed to determine symptomatic efficacy rather than dementia prevention, which requires large samples and long follow-up, and this study did not provide an opportunity to detect a clinical transformation from vascular mild cognitive impairment to overt dementia.</p><p>Other secondary end points assessed neurological deficits and functional recovery after stroke. The LS mean differences in NIHSS between groups did not reach statistical significance at any time point. At months 3 and 6, the median Barthel Index score was 100.0 for both groups, but more patients in the Actovegin group had a score of &#x02265;95 points compared with the placebo group. Actovegin treatment was started &#x02264;7 days after stroke onset, whereas an acute stroke management within the first 12 to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms is generally recommended. In addition, the study population consisted of patients with mild-to-moderate stroke; therefore, a high rate of spontaneous recovery under placebo might be expected and a ceiling effect cannot be ruled out. The aforementioned reasons might partially explain the similar neurological outcomes observed in both groups after 6 months of treatment. The study was also not primarily designed to assess stroke outcomes. Summary results from the EuroQoL EQ-5D and the BDI-II also showed similar responses in both groups. However, it is important to note that baseline scores for quality of life and depression were not collected because they were not easily accessible in the immediate poststroke state.</p><p>The incidence of TEAEs and deaths was similar between treatment groups. Although ischemic strokes occurred more frequently in the Actovegin group, the difference was not statistically significant (post hoc analysis) and they were not likely to occur at any given time point (eg, during infusion). The rate of recurrent ischemic stroke is not unexpected in this population; the risk of recurrence is higher within the first year (4.7%&#x02013;15%) and is even higher in the first 3 months (9.5%&#x02013;20%).<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> It is noteworthy that the number of male patients with recurrent ischemic stroke was 73.3% in the Actovegin group and 40.0% in the placebo group; the same misbalance was found with regards to smokers: 53.3% in the Actovegin and 30.0% in the placebo group. The clinical use of Actovegin for 4 decades is supported by a favorable safety profile with a low incidence of AEs, and there have been no reports from previous studies or spontaneous reports of AEs associated with stroke.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Therefore, a specific reason for this isolated finding, which we consider to be coincidental, has not yet been identified.</p><p>Limitations of this trial include missing data for the primary measure, ADAS-cog+ score, which consists of individual questionnaires that make up the primary efficacy end point. Missing data were recognized as a potential source of bias; however, this was addressed using a combination of 2 potentially conservative approaches (worst score imputation for partially complete ADAS-cog+ assessments, and last observation carried forward for completely missing ADAS-cog+ assessments). For data missing at baseline and month 3, it was not feasible to account for patients who did not have any baseline assessment or undertake imputation of missing month 3 ADAS-cog+ score based on baseline score as part of the planned analyses. As above, missing data for the individual questionnaire items were imputed using the worst score rather than the last nonmissing item score from the previous visit because this approach was considered to be a more conservative strategy, similar to that commonly adopted for binary end points where missing data are imputed as failure. The study showed an overall missing rate for the primary outcome in &#x02248;9% of randomized patients, a rate that is comparable between treatment groups at baseline and month 3.</p><p>In conclusion, Actovegin has been shown to be effective in improving cognitive outcomes in a prospective randomized controlled trial which, to some extent, had an exploratory design and several limitations. Further studies with robust designs may help to establish the optimal dosing regimen and treatment duration for Actovegin in PSCI, and whether or not Actovegin improves neurological deficits and has an effect on activities of daily living and QoL in parallel with its effects on cognitive outcomes and disease progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the participating centers&#x02019; staff and patients for their efforts and commitment during the trial; Ulf Vigonius, Martin Eeg, and Gediminas Puras for their contribution to the design of the study; Alexander Knyazev for scientific advice; and Alexander Kroll and Ella Palmer of Synergy Vision, London, United Kingdom for technical and medical writing assistance with the preparation of this report.
