The cost of added pharmacist and other staff time (e.g. added 1h of nutritionist, 1h of nursing and 1h of physical therapist for each patient during the study period) was derived from an average of the participating VHA provider&#x02019;s annual wage in the three sites. The staff time was calculated based on an average time spent by providers of each discipline of 3 participating sites in the group medical visits which were tracked quarterly using activity logs to include the time spent in the preparation of and during the group medical visits, phone follow-ups with the patients, and time spent in case discussions with other providers and chart documentation of the clinical encounters [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].

Hyper or hypoglycemic events that required unscheduled visits to the health care provider occurred in 5/117 (4.3%) of patients in the group visit arm and in 7/133 (5.3%) of patients in the standard care arm (p = 0.71).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Discussion</title><p>A 13-month pharmacist-led group medical visit intervention in Type-2 DM added to standard care was similar to standard care in achieving improvement from baseline in the overall cardiovascular risk composed of hemoglobin A1c, systolic blood pressure, and LDL cholesterol. There was no significant change from baseline in health-related quality-of-life between the two study arms. Despite this additional intervention, the increase in per-person outpatient expenditure from baseline was significantly lower in the group visit versus the standard care arm, both during the study intervention period and at 13-months after study interventions. The overall VHA healthcare costs/person were comparable between the study arms during the study period; then decreased by 6% for the group visit to levels lower than the baseline but increased by 13% for the standard care arm 13 months post-study.</p><p>Compared to our previous single-site studies of pharmacist-led group medical visits [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195898.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the current multi-site study failed to achieve a significant improvement over standard care in the overall cardiovascular risk. The reasons can be multi-factorial, part of which can be attributed to the smaller effect achieved in this multi-site effectiveness study (A1c reduction of -0.27% versus -0.9% in previous) [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195898.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the longer duration of the current study (with higher risk of regression to the mean) and the remarkable performance on A1c reduction by standard care (-0.14% versus 0.0% in previous) [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195898.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These results are in contrast to the multi-site study by Edelman and colleagues with primary care physicians conducting group visits [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which demonstrated a significant reduction in blood pressure over standard care, but from a mean baseline systolic pressure of 150&#x02019;s mmHg. Our study population had lower mean systolic pressure (135&#x02019;s mmHg) and LDL cholesterol levels (90&#x02019;s mg/dL) at baseline and suggests that group visits may not be superior when baseline values are already at or near guideline recommended targets.</p><p>Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires frequent medical visits for control of glycemia and associated cardiovascular risk factors [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which may explain the steady rise in healthcare costs in participants from both study arms during the study intervention period. However, pharmacist-led group visits had a lower outpatient expenditure compared to standard care, and overall lower healthcare costs after the study period to levels lower than baseline. We speculate that the multi-disciplinary care in the group visit program was potentially offsetting additional physician visits needed to achieve optimal chronic disease management. It has also been shown that the group setting helps in improving efficiency when it comes to education, lifestyle modification and discussion of care barriers as opposed to intervention to only one individual at a time [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195898.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Group medical visits can also provide peer support of participants toward lifestyle changes, and a focused environment for diabetes care without the competing demands of non-diabetes related issues that often surface in routine primary care visits, and access to special expertise in diabetes education without going to another clinic appointment [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Of note, some of the healthcare cost savings in the group visit arm was offset by the rise in medication costs during the study period, which could be explained by an increased prescription activity and possibly patient adherence, a rise that stabilized after completion of the study interventions. Edelman and colleagues showed that a multi-disciplinary group medical visit model with physician providers resulted in cost-savings 2 years after the completion of the intervention [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Our study built on Edelman&#x02019;s results to show that group visits can be led by clinical pharmacists without physician involvement, and health care cost reductions can be achieved after 13 months to below the baseline levels.</p><p>The findings also suggest that addition of pharmacist-led care was safe with similar hospitalizations and death compared to standard care, which can have significant implications. The capacity of the current health system to provide chronic disease care with an expanding diabetes epidemic is diminishing as the demand for health care providers increases [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. By allowing clinical pharmacists to practice to the &#x0201c;top of their license&#x0201d; in an integrated care delivery model such as the VHA&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0195898.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], physicians can potentially focus on higher acuity, more complicated patients. We also showed how a weekly intensive phase achieved a rapid improvement in glycemic control, an effect that reached a plateau when switched to quarterly sessions. These findings suggest that the frequency of visits is proportional to the degree of disease control and would allow policy makers to make a balanced decision on the adequate follow-up frequency, likely accounting for the patient&#x02019;s underlying risk of adverse events.</p><p>Our study has limitations. First, only ~40% of individuals contacted agreed to participate which suggests that group visits may not fit all patients with T2DM. Second, we included only patients who sought care in VHA hospitals, a cohort that is mostly male in a non-fee-for-service system. Third, we only included individuals who are suitable candidates for algorithm-based care for which these findings cannot be extrapolated to individuals with conditions within the exclusion criteria such as pregnancy or dialysis.</p><p>In conclusion, addition of pharmacist-led group medical visits in T2DM achieved similar improvements in cardiovascular risk factors than usual care while outpatient care costs decreased. Furthermore, thirteen months after the completion of the intervention, healthcare costs in group medical visits decreased to below baseline levels compared to the steady rise in cost in usual care. Future studies should be conducted in the non-VHA setting to assess the generalizability of the results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195898.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195898.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195898.s002"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195898.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the position or policy of the Department of Veterans Affairs.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0195898.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>Centers for Disease Control</collab>. <chapter-title>The Burden of Chronic Diseases and Their Risk Factors: National and State Perspectives 2004</chapter-title>
