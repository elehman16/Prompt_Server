However, beneficial clinical effects are rarely observed before several weeks into treatment. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has a long-standing safety record for pain relief and has been used in adults and young people. In adults with severe treatment-resistant depression, a single dose of N<sub>2</sub>O had significant antidepressant effects, with maximum antidepressant effects observed 24 h after administration. However, the antidepressant effects of N<sub>2</sub>O have never been investigated in adolescents with a confirmed diagnosis of depression in a prospective trial. The aims of this study are to (1) investigate whether a single inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O administration leads to antidepressant effects in adolescents with depression at 24 h, (2) determine whether combined N<sub>2</sub>O and SSRI administration (commenced after N<sub>2</sub>O intervention) provides a clinically significant improvement in mood over and above the benefits from SSRI administration alone, and, (3) investigate whether the effect seen following N<sub>2</sub>O administration can be used as a predictor of SSRI treatment response.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In this study, we will use a single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled design. Patients aged between 12 and 17 years with major depressive disorder will be recruited. This study will consist of two phases: phase A and phase B. During phase A, participants will be randomised to receive either inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O or placebo (air) for 1 h. In phase B, participants will receive open-label pharmacological treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine and will be followed over a 12-week period. Participants will undertake mood assessments at 2 and 24 h after N<sub>2</sub>O or placebo administration (phase A) and weekly during the 12-week follow up in phase B.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We expect an antidepressant effect from a single dose of inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O compared with placebo at 24 h after administration. Additionally, we expect that subjects treated with N<sub>2</sub>O will also show greater improvements than the placebo group after 6 and 12 weeks into fluoxetine treatment because of potential additive antidepressant effects. Such findings would be of clinical importance because currently children and adolescents often do not experience any symptom alleviation for several weeks following the initiation of SSRIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=371725">ACTRN12616001568404</ext-link>.

Approximately 6.3% of Australians aged between 16 and 24 years have experienced an affective disorder in the last 12 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used for the pharmacological treatment of depressive disorders. SSRIs are amongst the most frequently prescribed antidepressants and are known to increase the availability of the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) in the brain, which is thought to contribute to their antidepressant effects. However, the complete mechanism of action of SSRIs is still not fully understood. In particular, the question why antidepressant effects are often observed only after a delay of several weeks into treatment, despite the fact that single doses of SSRI administration can lead to significant changes in activation of brain regions that are known to be associated with mood and emotion regulation (i.e., the amygdala, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The described delay in the onset of antidepressant effects after SSRI administration can put young patients at risk for exacerbation of low mood and other associated depressive symptoms, such as self-harm or suicide. Thus, two major child and adolescent health issues are highlighted and must be urgently addressed: first, whether there is a treatment strategy that can bridge the gap between the initiation of SSRIs and observed (possibly also additional) clinical benefits, and second, the need to investigate the predictors of response to SSRI treatment, which in turn could save significant time allocated to treatments with little or no effect.</p><p id="Par24">Strong biological and recent clinical evidence has suggested that nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has significant antidepressant effects in adults, in particular in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The underlying mechanism of action of N<sub>2</sub>O is thought to be through the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, because N<sub>2</sub>O serves as an antagonist of this particular receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Numerous animal studies and human trials have investigated the use of NMDA antagonists in targeting behaviours or symptoms that may be associated with depression. For example, in murine models, the administration of ketamine, which, like N<sub>2</sub>O, is an NMDA antagonist and anaesthetic, showed a reduction in depression-like behaviour, such as increased mobility in the forced-swim test, shorter latencies in the novelty-suppressed feeding test and a reduction in learnt helplessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this context, authors of a recent systematic review of studies investigating the use of ketamine to treat TRD in humans suggested it to be associated with a rapid onset of antidepressant effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, in a trial where inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O was administered in adults with TRD, Nagele et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], found a significant improvement in depressive symptoms as rated by the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at 2 and 24 h and 1 week (in a subset of participants) following administration. These findings are significant because in the underlying neurobiology of depression, the NMDA receptor is thought to play a decisive role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. NMDA antagonists, such as N<sub>2</sub>O and ketamine, work by blocking the NMDA receptor, which inhibits a further inhibiting interneuron (GABAergic), resulting in a release of glutamate. Whilst the blocking of the NMDA receptor leads to this sequential effect which impacts three neurons, it has been hypothesised that the blocking of the NMDA receptor leads primarily to an almost immediate antidepressant effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The mechanism of action of SSRIs differs from that of the NMDA antagonists, because it may take a period of weeks following administration before the desensitisation of central nervous system 5-HT receptors occurs, which has been hypothesised to lead to an increase of 5-HT within the synaptic cleft (i.e., antidepressant effect). Therefore, the use of N<sub>2</sub>O, a safe inhalational anaesthetic, has the potential to be a novel, fast-acting and non-intrusive treatment strategy for patients with severe depressive disorders while awaiting onset of SSRI antidepressant activity. Furthermore, in the hospital setting, N<sub>2</sub>O has been used for several decades with an excellent record with regard to safety and effectiveness.</p><p id="Par25">Whilst the described mechanisms of action in depression of NMDA antagonists and SSRIs are not fully understood, animal models have shown that the administration of NMDA antagonists is associated with changes in specific brain areas which are also related to mood, such as the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Most notably, such areas are also highly 5-HT-modulated areas of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Given the significant overlap in neurocircuits, an increase in brain function in terms of improved top-down control in mood-related neurocircuits may be used to explain any possible additive treatment effects of the administration of both N<sub>2</sub>O and SSRIs (e.g., fluoxetine), as well as for investigating N<sub>2</sub>O as a potential predictor of SSRI response. Whilst the significant antidepressant effects of N<sub>2</sub>O in a cohort of adults with TRD has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], such research questions have never been investigated in minors.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives and hypotheses</title><p id="Par26">The objectives and hypotheses of the present study are threefold:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par27">

As per recommendation by the local ethics committee, the study does not either prescribe or restrict participation in psychological therapy. This is at the discretion of the participants and their treating clinicians. The type of psychological therapy and number of sessions over the study period will be recorded for each participant on the basis of a report from the participant&#x02019;s treating clinician. Access to other treatment strategies will be accounted for in the statistical analysis of the data and will be reported upon completion of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par43">The primary endpoint for the first aim of the study (to investigate the therapeutic effects of the administration of N<sub>2</sub>O as a single-dose inhalational anaesthetic, phase A) is the assessment of mood symptoms approximately 24 h after administration. Mood symptoms will be measured using psychometric instruments, including the BDI, HDRS and CDRS-R. Further endpoints will be mood changes after 6 weeks (secondary endpoint) and 12 weeks (tertiary endpoint). For the second and third aims of the study (to determine whether the additive effects of N<sub>2</sub>O and SSRI administration provide a clinically significant improvement in mood over and above the benefits from SSRI administration alone [Phase B] and to investigate N<sub>2</sub>O as a possible predictor of SSRI treatment response, respectively), the endpoints will be measurements of mood (indicated by the BDI, HDRS and CDRS-R) at the weeks 6 and 12 follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Recruitment</title><p id="Par44">Participants will be recruited from PMH. Referrals to the study will also be accepted from general practitioners, local paediatricians and local developmental services, as well as from Headspace clinicians (Headspace is an early intervention service for youth with mental health disorders). Participants who discontinue the study will be not be replaced.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding procedure and assignment of condition</title><p id="Par45">The personnel and the location for providing N<sub>2</sub>O-based treatment, as well as the psychiatric team and related locations for psychiatric examinations, will be completely separated. Medical records for N<sub>2</sub>O/placebo administration will be kept separate from the psychiatric assessment case report forms until completion of the entire trial. Participants and their families will be blinded to the nature of the inhaled gas and will be informed that they can receive either one or the other of the two conditions during phase A. Group assignment to either N<sub>2</sub>O or placebo will be performed by a clinical pharmacist using a random number generator for all participants. Randomisation according to this generator will occur on a 1:1 basis with a permuted block randomisation schedule created by the PMH Pharmacy Department. Apart from the inhalational mixture, the sessions for administration of N<sub>2</sub>O and placebo will be indistinguishable in regard to their setting, setup and monitoring.</p><p id="Par46">The order of group assignment will be kept in a secure location. Each allocation will be sealed in individual envelopes and stored in order. Individual envelopes will be opened only upon the arrival of the participant for the administration of N<sub>2</sub>O or placebo mixture. The only person who has access to the random group allocation will be the study nurse and/or study anaesthetist who will administer the inhalational treatment or placebo in theatre. At the end of each treatment day, the group allocation protocol and treatment supply log will be resealed and kept in a secure location. This will be the only role for the nurse/anaesthetist, who will have no contact with the psychiatric team or the patient/family throughout the study duration to ensure continuous blinding. N<sub>2</sub>O and medical air will be supplied by piped theatre supply from PMH (regulated by biomedical services) and not via cylinders. The nature of the gas will therefore be obscured and known only to the study nurse/anaesthetist. The study will be unblinded only in the unlikely occurrence of an adverse event requiring unblinding to ensure patient safety.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data preparation and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par47">This trial will yield data relating to the participants&#x02019; demographics, medical history, measures of mood during phase A and phase B, and blood samples indicating fluoxetine levels during phase B of the trial. All data will be de-identified upon collection, will be entered by one designated person on the research team, and will be securely stored. Only the research team will have access to the data. Hard copies of the data and questionnaires will be kept in a locked cabinet in a locked room within a secure building.</p><p id="Par48">The primary outcome measure (HDRS) will be statistically analysed using a between-subjects mixed effects linear model. Dose-response curves will also be plotted for both groups (i.e., group that received N<sub>2</sub>O and the group that received the placebo gas). Any differences between the two dose-response curves may highlight the difference between the interventions received in phase A. Because this is a pilot study, each group will have a maximum of 15 participants. These analyses will also be repeated for the BDI and HDRS scales. Additionally, correlational analyses (Pearson&#x02019;s/Spearman&#x02019;s rho, depending on data distribution) between fluoxetine levels and relevant symptom changes (HDRS and BDI) will be calculated. SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) will be used for these analyses.</p><p id="Par49">Power analysis using G*Power showed that a sample size of 30 participants detecting effect sizes of <italic>f</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.25 with an &#x003b1; error&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05 will produce power of 0.75 when using analysis of variance with repeated measures (within-between factors, number of measurements&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, correlation among repeated measures&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5, non-centrality parameter &#x003bb;&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.5, critical <italic>F</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.20, numerator <italic>df</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1, denominator <italic>df</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). Whilst the power of the present study is slightly less than the conventional 0.08, it is noted that this is a pilot study, and it is anticipated that these data will inform future investigations with larger sample sizes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial management</title><p id="Par50">This trial will be managed by FDZ and RMS, with assistance from JWYW and KCR. Stringent records will be kept in a master file and will include records of adverse events. In the unlikely event of an adverse event, records will be submitted by a study-specific data and safety monitoring committee, and committee members will be independent of the study team. With regard to the possible occurrence of an adverse event in phase A, N<sub>2</sub>O is widely used and has minimal side effects that are usually transient and vary between individuals. However, participants who experience an adverse event following the N<sub>2</sub>O or placebo administration will be followed in the recovery area and assessed and managed by a consultant anaesthetist until they are stable and cleared for discharge from the hospital. The chief investigator will be informed of the adverse event as soon as possible after its occurrence. All participants will be continuously monitored, and treatment with N<sub>2</sub>O and placebo will be conducted in a theatre with a high degree of supervision. A medical practitioner will be available at all times to assess and manage side effects if they emerge. For example, an ondansetron sublingual wafer (4&#x02013;8 mg depending on weight) will be available to treat nausea and vomiting during the study period.</p><p id="Par51">Stopping rules have also been developed for this trial, and the development of these rules has been done taking into consideration common and serious adverse events which can occur in adolescents being treated for a major depressive episode with antidepressant medication. Because it may be difficult to disentangle whether an adverse event is due to treatment or part of the depressive disorder, this study will be halted and reviewed if the following number of adverse events occur: an event of a completed suicide, two events of attempted suicide, four individual reports of an increase in non-suicidal deliberate self-harm, three individuals reporting the development of hypomania or two patients reporting the development of mania, and one report of severe psychotic symptoms requiring hospitalisation or intensive community-based treatment. The rates of the following possible adverse events have been estimated from the Treatment of Adolescent Depression Study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], because it has published results based on the largest available cohort of comparable patients. If patient symptoms worsen during the trial, they may be excluded from the study and will not be replaced. However, they will receive a care plan, and the study doctors will facilitate access to community-based mental health care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par52">Findings of the proposed project have the potential for both an immediate and lasting impact. Given the very large effect sizes found in the administration of inhaled N<sub>2</sub>O in the adult cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], we expect the administration of N<sub>2</sub>O in an adolescent cohort to yield similar results. Short-term impacts can include the alleviation of depressive symptoms for participants within 24 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and depending on their duration, further research will need to determine how to overcome the time until the onset of the observable clinical benefits of SSRIs (in the present case, fluoxetine). Such findings could be of great impact because currently some children and adolescents with depressive symptoms may not experience any symptom alleviation up to several weeks following the initiation of SSRIs. Further, such effects would be beneficial to both the children and their families and therefore allow the children to re-engage with typical daily activities at an earlier point in time. This is in line with national mental health reviews that have advocated for the early intervention in patients with mental health disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Additionally, earlier re-engagement may have far-reaching and long-term benefits because it may minimise the disruption to children&#x02019;s developmental trajectories.</p><p id="Par53">As with any new research findings, if the present study were to show some first beneficial effects of N<sub>2</sub>O administration, such findings would need replication. In addition to the proposed immediate and lasting clinical impacts for children and adolescents, there is potential for this novel therapy to move from the bench to the bedside to inform both clinical practice and service delivery. In addition to the mental health setting, the possible immediate reduction in depressive symptoms following N<sub>2</sub>O administration may have application in general or specialist health settings where depressed children and adolescents may present (e.g., theatre) or have long lengths of stay as inpatients (e.g., rehabilitation). There could also be merit in pursuing a more translational research perspective by focusing on the design, training, financing, and policy and procedural requirements of this promising intervention. This is made even more possible by increased funding opportunities for this type of research. Although a lot of clinical research does not find a way into practice (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]), there now exist many knowledge translation and implementation frameworks, theories and models, and an accompanying literature of applied research which can guide the researcher, clinician, policy maker and/or educator to ensure that this potential new treatment option becomes standard practice for improving mental health in children and adolescents.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par54">This article describes protocol version 8, dated 17 November 2016, and was prepared with reference to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.
