The primary outcome was the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases not initiating TB treatment by 3 mo after presentation. Secondary outcomes included time to TB treatment and mortality. Unblinded randomisation occurred on a weekly basis. Xpert and smear microscopy were performed on site.

</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>In 2012, about 8.6 million people developed active tuberculosis (TB)&#x02014;a contagious mycobacterial disease that usually affects the lungs&#x02014;and at least 1.3 million people died from the disease. Most of these deaths were in low- and middle-income countries, and a fifth were in HIV-positive individuals, who are particularly susceptible to TB. <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the bacterium that causes TB, is spread in airborne droplets when people with active disease cough or sneeze. The characteristic symptoms of TB include a cough, weight loss, and night sweats. Diagnostic tests for TB include microscopic examination of sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs), growth (culture) of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> from sputum, and molecular tests (for example, the automated Xpert MTB/RIF test) that rapidly and accurately detect <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in sputum and determine its antibiotic resistance. TB can be cured by taking several antibiotics daily for at least six months, although the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB is making the disease harder to treat.</p></sec><sec><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>To improve TB control, active disease needs to be diagnosed and treated quickly. However, sputum microscopy, the mainstay of TB diagnosis in many high-burden settings, fails to identify up to half of infected people, and mycobacterial culture (the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of TB diagnosis) is slow and often unavailable in resource-limited settings. In late 2010, the World Health Organization recommended the routine use of the Xpert MTB/RIF test (Xpert) for TB diagnosis, and several low- and middle-income countries are now scaling up access to Xpert in their national TB control programs. But although Xpert performs well in ideal conditions, little is known about the impact of its implementation in routine (real-life) settings. In this pragmatic cluster-randomized trial, the researchers assess the health impacts of Xpert in a large TB/HIV primary health care clinic in South Africa, an upper-middle-income country that began to scale up access to Xpert for individuals showing symptoms of TB (individuals with presumptive TB) in 2011. A pragmatic trial asks whether an intervention works under real-life conditions; a cluster-randomized trial randomly assigns groups of people to receive alternative interventions and compares outcomes in the differently treated &#x0201c;clusters.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers assigned everyone with presumptive TB attending a TB/HIV primary health care clinic in Cape Town to receive either Xpert for TB diagnosis or routine sputum microscopy and limited culture. Specifically, Xpert was requested on the routine laboratory request forms for individuals attending the clinic during randomly designated Xpert weeks but not during randomly designated routine testing weeks. During the 51-week trial, 982 individuals were assigned to the Xpert arm, and 1,003 were assigned to the routine testing arm, but because clinic staff sometimes failed to request Xpert during Xpert weeks, only 882 participants in the Xpert arm received the intervention. In an &#x0201c;intention to treat&#x0201d; analysis (an analysis that considers the outcomes of all the participants in a trial whether or not they received their assigned intervention), 13% of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases in the Xpert arm did not initiate TB treatment by three months after enrollment (the trial's primary outcome) compared to 25% in the routine testing arm. The proportion of participants with microbiologically confirmed TB and the proportion initiating TB treatment were higher in the Xpert arm than in the routine testing arm. Finally, the time to treatment initiation was lower in the Xpert arm than in the routine testing arm, particularly among HIV-infected participants.</p></sec><sec><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that, in this primary health care setting, the provision of Xpert for TB diagnosis in individuals with presumptive TB provided benefits over testing that relied primarily on sputum microscopy. Notably, these benefits were seen even though a substantial proportion of individuals assigned to the Xpert intervention did not actually receive an Xpert test. The pragmatic nature of this trial, which aimed to minimize clinic disruption, and other aspects of the trial design may limit the accuracy and generalizability of these findings. Moreover, further studies are needed to discover whether the use of Xpert in real-life settings reduces the burden of TB illness and death over the long term. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that the implementation of Xpert has the potential to improve the outcomes of TB control programs and may also improve outcomes for individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these websites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001760">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001760</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The World Health Organization provides information (in several languages) on all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/en">tuberculosis</ext-link>, including general information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/laboratory/en/">tuberculosis diagnostics</ext-link> and specific information on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://who.int/tb/laboratory/mtbrifrollout/en/index.html">roll-out of the Xpert MTB/RIF test</ext-link>; further information about the World Health Organization's endorsement of Xpert MTB/RIF is included in a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/advisory_bodies/stag_tb_report_2010.pdf">Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Tuberculosis report</ext-link>; the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/en/">&#x0201c;Global Tuberculosis Report 2013&#x0201d;</ext-link> provides information about tuberculosis around the world, including in South Africa</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stoptb.org/">Stop TB Partnership</ext-link> is working towards tuberculosis elimination and provides <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stoptb.org/countries/acsm/heroes.asp">patient stories about tuberculosis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish); the Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative (a not-for-profit organization) also provides <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tbvi.eu/about-tb/personal-stories.html">personal stories about tuberculosis</ext-link>

In the absence of dramatic improvements in socio-economic status among individuals at risk for TB, TB control rests on diagnosing prevalent and infectious TB cases, instituting appropriate treatment, and thereby reducing ongoing transmission. Until recently, the mainstay of TB diagnosis in settings with high TB burden was sputum smear microscopy. Smear microscopy, while cheap and easy to implement, has low sensitivity and will therefore detect only TB cases with substantial bacterial load and advanced disease. Sputum culture, while considered the gold standard for pulmonary TB diagnosis, is often available only at the level of a reference laboratory and is most often too slow to be able to guide therapy. This is particularly the case in settings with high HIV prevalence, where the mortality associated with late or inaccurate diagnosis of TB is high <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Lawn1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In order to prevent transmission and improve outcomes for individual patients, a diagnostic test that detects TB disease at lower bacterial burdens and provides rapid results in order for treatment to be instituted is needed.</p><p>The Xpert MTB/RIF test is a real-time PCR assay for simultaneous detection of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> and rifampicin resistance <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Helb1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Based on validation and feasibility data <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, the Xpert test was recommended for use in TB diagnosis by the World Health Organization in late 2010. Since then, through preferential pricing for low- and middle-income countries, a number of countries have attempted to scale up access to Xpert MTB/RIF in national TB control programmes <xref rid="pmed.1001760-World2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. South Africa has committed to provide access to Xpert testing for all individuals with presumptive TB through a staged roll-out strategy nationwide.</p><p>While significant data exist on the specificity and sensitivity of Xpert testing <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Steingart1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, there are limited data available on the impact of implementing Xpert on health outcomes in routine programmatic settings <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Kwak1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001760-Theron1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As a result, there remains controversy as to how Xpert should be implemented in different health systems and who should be tested. We aimed to assess the impact of using Xpert for TB diagnosis on yield of TB cases and the timing of TB treatment initiation in a large primary health care clinic, through a pragmatic randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the University of Cape Town Human Research Ethics Committee (366/2009), and complies with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Study Design and Pre-Specified Outcomes</title><p>This was a prospective cluster-randomised trial of Xpert implementation compared to the pre-existing routine diagnostic algorithm of smear, culture, and drug susceptibility testing (DST) in a primary care clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, South Africa. This trial, an extension of an earlier validation and feasibility study <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, was registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201010000255244) 1 mo after the study started based on the realisation of the importance of trial registration.</p><p>The pre-specified primary outcome was the proportion of bacteriologically confirmed TB cases that had not initiated appropriate treatment by 2 mo after enrolment. For analysis, the denominator for this outcome included all participants diagnosed with bacteriologically confirmed TB (smear, culture, or Xpert) during the 2-mo period after enrolment. As there were a number of TB cases diagnosed late in this period, the time period to assess treatment initiation was extended (at the time of data analysis) to 3 mo after enrolment.</p><p>Secondary outcomes were time to diagnosis, time to TB treatment, all-cause mortality, and the number of clinic visits prior to appropriate TB treatment. Two of these secondary outcomes, time to diagnosis and the number of clinic visits prior to treatment, are not reported on here, as data were of poor quality and inconsistently available. Analyses of TB treatment initiation by HIV status, TB treatment outcomes, and yield of rifampicin-resistant TB were conducted post hoc.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Study Site</title><p>The study was conducted in a large primary health care clinic in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. Khayelitsha is a peri-urban township with an estimated population of 400,000 <xref rid="pmed.1001760-City1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Antenatal HIV prevalence is estimated at 33%, and TB case notification at 1,200/100,000 <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Mdecins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Ubuntu Clinic is a specialised primary care clinic providing integrated HIV and TB services. In 2011, 1,443 individuals received TB treatment at Ubuntu Clinic, and by December 2011, 6,296 clients were receiving antiretroviral HIV treatment through the clinic. In September 2009, a small decentralised laboratory providing sputum smear microscopy, staffed by one laboratory technician, was established on site at Ubuntu Clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Study Intervention and Randomisation</title><p>All adults, aged 18 y and over, presenting at Ubuntu Clinic with presumptive TB were included in the study. The definition of presumptive TB employed in Cape Town includes any of the following: cough of 2 wk or more, weight loss, drenching night sweats, fever of 2 wk or more, chest pain on breathing, or blood-stained sputum. Individuals already receiving anti-TB treatment for 3 d or more were excluded. The study was designed as a pragmatic trial, in order to provide minimal disruption and to reflect normal routine clinical practice. Clinic staff and investigators were unblinded to the intervention. Individual informed consent at study inclusion was waived for this study based on the pragmatic nature of the trial. Randomisation occurred on a weekly basis in order to allow efficient laboratory functioning and use of resources. Each week was randomly allocated as either Xpert or routine diagnostic testing, with the schedule generated prior to the study (using Random.org) by the principal investigator.</p><p>Patients in both study arms gave two sputum samples as per routine practice in Cape Town. Diagnostic testing for the sputum samples in each arm is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001760-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Diagnosis in the routine arm was based on the policy for diagnostic testing for individuals with presumptive TB in the City of Cape Town. Briefly, diagnosis was primarily based on smear, with culture and DST for those considered at high risk of drug-resistant TB, and where clinically indicated (predominantly among HIV-infected individuals). Individuals considered to be at high risk for drug-resistant TB included those previously treated for TB, health care workers, and those with any prison contact.</p><fig id="pmed-1001760-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001760.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Diagnostic testing algorithm for each study arm.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1001760.g001"/></fig><p>Participants enrolled during each designated Xpert week had Xpert requested on the routine laboratory request forms.

In the central laboratory, a 0.5-ml portion of the sediment was cultured in mycobacterial growth indicator tubes with PANTA and OADC using the BACTEC MGIT 960 system (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, Maryland). Susceptibility to rifampicin was confirmed using the line probe assay MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany). DST was performed on NaOH-treated pellets for smear-positive sputum and on cultured isolates for smear-negative sputum.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Participant Follow-Up</title><p>Participants were followed up at two time points after study inclusion: at 2&#x02013;3 mo to assess whether TB treatment was initiated, and at 6 mo to assess mortality. All participants were initially tracked through the clinic TB diagnosis and TB treatment registers to determine status and outcomes. For participants with a negative TB diagnosis and those with a positive diagnosis who were not started on treatment, follow-up consisted of a home visit, with subsequent phone contact if the participant could not be contacted through the home visit. Verbal informed consent was required for collection of follow-up data via telephone contact, and written consent for direct contact with participants.</p><p>Additionally, all participants were tracked through district (Cape Town metropole) TB and HIV treatment registers to ascertain whether TB treatment was initiated elsewhere. These registers were also used to ascertain TB treatment outcomes. Participants who could not be followed directly at either of the two follow-up time points were also tracked through regional and national death registries via name and civil identification number, respectively.

Mortality was defined as death regardless of cause.</p><p>The proportion of participants initiating treatment and time to TB treatment initiation were calculated from the date of participant enrolment, with data censored at death. As ascertainment of TB treatment initiation or not by 3 mo was assumed to be complete, data were not censored for loss to follow-up in Kaplan Meier analyses. Similarly, ascertainment of death was assumed to be complete at 6 mo after enrolment.</p><p>Analyses were based on intention to treat (ITT), regardless of which diagnostic tests were performed, and per protocol, based on which tests were actually conducted. Response rates and category membership were compared using design-based F-tests to take into account the cluster sampling.

The study was interrupted for a total of 9 wk during the study period because of technical or safety issues in the on-site laboratory and sick leave of laboratory staff. During these periods, no participants were recruited, and routine practice was followed.</p><p>During the study weeks, the intervention was not always correctly assigned. During 23 of the 51 wk of the study, more than 10% of participants in that week received the incorrect intervention, most commonly routine testing instead of Xpert (participant flow diagram, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-1001760-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A review of data and processes suggests that a number of issues contributed to this. The most common cause of incorrect intervention assignment was a failure to request Xpert testing during Xpert weeks, generally resulting from the absence of the specific study health care worker for short periods of time in the clinic consulting room, whereby clinic staff requested sputum tests as per routine. This occurred despite extensive training, and was unfortunately not detected until near the study end. In addition, at the start of some weeks, both routine and study staff continued the intervention that was in place the previous week and this was not corrected until sometime during the week.</p><fig id="pmed-1001760-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001760.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Participant flow diagram.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pmed.1001760.g002"/></fig><p>The ITT analysis included all 1,985 participants (982 in the Xpert arm and 1,003 in the routine arm), while the per protocol analysis, based on whether participants received Xpert or not, excluded participants where no sputum sample was available, yielding 1,945 participants in total (882 in the Xpert arm and 1,063 in the routine arm).

The proportion of individuals with bacteriologically confirmed TB who had not initiated TB treatment by 3 mo, the primary outcome, was significantly lower in the Xpert arm than in the routine arm. In addition, the proportion of participants with microbiologically confirmed TB and the proportion initiating TB treatment were both significantly higher in the Xpert arm. These gains were combined with shortened times to treatment, leading to significant improvements in overall TB treatment initiation and the proportion of participants successfully treated for TB.</p><p>These benefits were seen despite inadequate application of the intervention. This was a pragmatic trial aiming to provide minimal disruption and change to normal clinic practices. However, the pragmatic nature of the trial resulted in compromised trial conduct. Based on a retrospective review of practices, we do not feel that the inadequate application of the intervention was due to any systematic biases by health care staff. There was no evidence that Xpert was more likely to be requested for patients who might be considered to be at higher risk of TB or MDR-TB. As there was no significant difference between the Xpert arm and the routine arm in the proportion of smear-negative HIV-infected participants for whom culture was requested, this is not expected to have contributed to the higher rate of bacteriologically confirmed TB in the Xpert arm, nor to the proportion of participants initiating TB treatment rapidly after presentation. Overall, we feel that the problems with application of the intervention were predominantly because of the crossing over of the intervention using the weekly randomisation schedule and the difficulties of trying to introduce additional steps into a well-established clinical process.</p><p>Similarly, the intervention was unblinded, and this is also a limitation of the study design chosen. The study also included only participants who gave sputum samples and were diagnosed with TB at the study clinic. Considerably more patients than these were registered for TB treatment at the clinic. The majority of these additional patients were diagnosed elsewhere but were transferred to the study clinic to receive treatment. A small group of patients were started on TB treatment without attempting to produce a sputum sample, against the diagnostic algorithm in place at the clinic. These patients were therefore not included in the study.</p><p>Conduct of the study in a single, well-researched clinic may also be considered a limitation. However, differences in the patient populations served by different clinics suggest that a large number of clinics would be required if the study were to be conducted across multiple clinics, and, for this study, it was not logistically or economically feasible to install on-site laboratories in multiple smaller clinics. Comparisons before and after the introduction of new diagnostic algorithms are also subject to confounding by concurrent changes in practices. Overall, although there were several limitations with the pragmatic approach chosen in this study, we believe that the results obtained represent the closest to those that would be seen under programmatic conditions, while balancing a comparison with a valid control group. More interventionist approaches are unlikely to reflect routine practice.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the benefits of Xpert testing were particularly evident among HIV-infected individuals in this study. The HIV epidemic has had a dramatic impact on TB case notifications in this region, and tackling HIV-associated TB will be key to controlling the TB epidemic <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Lawn2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. HIV infection is associated with paucibacillary disease, and consequently, sputum smear microscopy performs particularly poorly in this patient group <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Getahun1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In Khayelitsha, many patients are diagnosed with TB on clinical grounds only. Indeed, given the prior lack of a TB diagnostic test with improved sensitivity in HIV-infected individuals, clinical TB diagnosis has been the focus of considerable training in the study clinic over many years prior to this study. Despite this, by 3 wk after presentation, close to double the proportion of HIV-infected participants had initiated TB treatment in the Xpert arm compared to the routine arm, and the proportion who started treatment without bacteriological confirmation was more than halved.</p><p>More extensive and more rapid treatment initiation might be expected to reduce mortality, particularly among HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts. There was, however, no difference in mortality between study arms, overall or among HIV-infected individuals. The recent, larger XTEND study, also in South Africa, similarly found no difference in mortality with Xpert versus smear microscopy, although, contrary to the current study, Xpert did not significantly increase the proportion treated for TB <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Fielding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Unfortunately, data on CD4 cell counts was inconsistently available, and we were not able to assess mortality in the subgroup of patients with low CD4 levels, where we might expect to see the greatest mortality benefit.</p><p>Xpert also resulted in limited clinical impact in the TB-NEAT study <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Theron1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. While initial default from treatment was reduced, very high (more than 40%) proportions of patients in both the Xpert and smear microscopy arms had received treatment by 8 wk, and there was no difference in TB-related morbidity in that large multicentre study. The authors postulate that any potential benefits from Xpert are masked by high levels of rapid empiric treatment initiation among smear-negative patients <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Theron2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In our study population, empiric treatment is less common, and there is greater reliance on culture to subsequently confirm disease. While the provision of culture for all patients with presumptive TB might be considered ideal, the delay in receiving results means that most patients are treated empirically anyway. We may, however, have underestimated empiric treatment by including only participants producing sputum samples. Nonetheless, under these conditions, Xpert significantly reduced the proportion of patients who started TB treatment without bacteriological confirmation of disease, while simultaneously increasing the overall proportion starting treatment. This suggests that with Xpert more of the right patients initiated treatment.</p><p>While there is a high prevalence of microbiologically confirmed TB in our study population, the yield from sputum smear microscopy was particularly poor, primarily as most smear microscopy was conducted in the on-site laboratory. This is in contrast to previous routine data among the same population, where microscopy was performed in the central laboratory, and yield was higher <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Mdecins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Although this was a newly established laboratory, it passed all external quality assessment proficiency testing, and the laboratory technologist was experienced. This low microscopy yield reflects the reality of smaller, decentralised laboratories with a single laboratory technician <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Ridderhof1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Encouragingly, the quality of Xpert testing in this same laboratory was consistently high <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Boehme1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>One of the major benefits of the Xpert MTB/RIF test is expected to be increased case detection for MDR-TB, through greater access to rifampicin susceptibility testing. No difference in confirmed rifampicin-resistant TB was found in this current study; however, the study was not powered to detect such a benefit, and significant efforts had been made to improve the detection of rifampicin resistance in this setting prior to this study <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. One of the principal benefits of Xpert for patients with rifampicin-resistant TB will be more rapid treatment initiation, which might be expected to reduce both early mortality and transmission.</p><p>Recent reports have raised concern about false-positive Xpert results among patients who have been previously treated for TB <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Boyles1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Reassuringly, patients found to be Xpert-positive and culture-negative were not more common among those who were previously treated for TB. These results suggest that instances of false-positive results, although concerning, may be uncommon, and reinforce the need to interpret all diagnostic tests in the context of clinical presentation.</p><p>While every effort was made to ensure accuracy of follow-up data to confirm TB treatment initiation and deaths, it is possible that the data were incomplete, and some participants may have died or initiated treatment elsewhere without these events being captured in our data. However, this potential bias is not likely to be different across the study arms and is therefore not expected to influence the study conclusions. Another potential limitation is the lack of culture as the gold standard for TB diagnosis for all participants. However, the study aimed to assess the impact of Xpert in comparison with routine practice, and culture is generally available only for a proportion of those with presumptive TB, or not at all, in high-burden settings. The provision of culture for all participants would have, therefore, altered routine practice in this setting.</p><p>Controlling the TB epidemic in high-burden settings, particularly those with high HIV prevalence, such as in Khayelitsha, will require the implementation of new tools and programmes that do more than just provide incremental benefit over current strategies. While Xpert is considerably more costly than smear microscopy&#x02014;with implementation expected to result in substantially increased health system costs in the short to medium term&#x02014;it does offer the chance to impact TB morbidity and mortality over the long term <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Menzies1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. This randomised trial demonstrates that implementation of Xpert for TB diagnosis in this setting has the potential to improve both programme and individual outcomes and therefore deliver the longer term population outcomes promised by modelling studies <xref rid="pmed.1001760-Langley1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001760.s001"><label>Datafile S1</label><caption><p>
