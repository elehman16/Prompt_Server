chain and closed kinetic chain exercises on the static and dynamic balance of ankle joints
in young healthy women. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty women in their 20s were randomly
assigned to two groups of ten women each: an open kinetic chain exercise group and a
closed kinetic chain exercise group. Each group performed five sets of exercises three
times per week for four weeks. Exercise intensity was increased once after two weeks. The
subjects&#x02019; Romberg&#x02019;s test results and their limits of stability were measured to evaluate
their static and dynamic balance. The data were analyzed using a two-way repeated measures
analysis of variance test. [Results] In the results of Romberg&#x02019;s test, the main effect of
the time showed a significant difference in the trace length with eyes closed (Effect
size: d=0.97). In the result of limits of stability, the interaction effect showed a
significant difference in the backward, and the main effect of the group showed a
significant difference in the forward. [Conclusion] The open kinetic chain and closed
kinetic chain exercises both improved the balance of the subjects. The closed kinetic
chain exercise was more effective at improving the dynamic balance of young healthy women
than the open kinetic chain exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Balance</kwd><kwd>Closed kinetic chain</kwd><kwd>Open kinetic chain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The ankle bears more weight per unit area than any other joint in the body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle joint is important for the
balance strategy of the body<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is
a person&#x02019;s ability to keep their center of gravity within the base of support or by
restoring their center of gravity to that position under the force of gravity. Balance is an
important factor that affects stability when standing and walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sensory modalities involved in maintaining balance incorporate somatoafferent,
vestibular, and visual input in order to assess the body&#x02019;s current position and external
disturbances and feedback from previous efferent movement strategies. Consequently, the
motor process coordinates the trunk and lower limb muscles into combined postural strategies
to decrease body sway and maintain it within the base of support<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Improving mobility (e.g., the ability to change walking speed and direction) is a common
rehabilitation goal for patients. One essential aspect of mobility is accelerating or
decelerating the body effectively while maintaining dynamic balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This aspect is closely related to a person&#x02019;s ability to
adapt to different physical circumstances<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, a woman wearing high-heeled shoes must change their
balance mechanism in order to adapt to kinematic changes in the musculoskeletal system that
occur while wearing such shoes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. If
balance is impaired, falls, which are a major source of morbidity and disability in the
aging population, can easily happen<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The term &#x0201c;kinetic chain&#x0201d; is used to describe how the body moves, with the limbs functioning
either in an open kinetic chain (OKC) or a closed kinetic chain (CKC) condition. The
difference between these two conditions is determined by whether the terminal ending of the
limb is free or fixed&#x02014;for example, whether one is moving against a hard or soft surface<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
OKC and CKC exercises generate different patterns of muscle activities and ligament
forces<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. CKC exercises activate antagonistic muscle groups across multiple
joints and therefore cannot be used to isolate or examine a single muscle group<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Examples of CKC exercises include
push-ups, pullups, squats, and lunges. All types of CKC exercises may be performed with or
without weights<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conversely, OKC
exercises isolate specific muscle groups, which is useful for strengthening and evaluation
purposes.</p><p>A study was conducted to analyze the balance and function recovery of the extensor muscles
of the knees and to re-establish joint stability. In this study, OKC and CKC exercises have
also been employed in rehabilitation programs to treat patellofemoral disturbances<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, different
rehabilitation exercises, such as OKC flexion and extension exercises, were employed for the
non-operative and post-operative management of joint disorders. The results of these studies
are helpful in the design of efficient OKC exercises used during rehabilition and
performance enhancement programs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have reported that using the Thera-Band in exercises for strengthening the
lower extremities improves balance ability. Therefore, conducting strengthening exercises
with a Thera-Band is a suitable home-based exercise program for improving balance for
activities of daily living<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the past, many studies analyzed the knee joint&#x02019;s relation to knee disease and the knee
muscles by performing OKC and CKC exercises. The purpose of the present study was to analyze
how balance was affected by OKC and CKC exercises that were performed on the ankle joint by
women in their 20s who were able to decrease their balance ability by wearing high-heeled
shoes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty women in their early 20s participated in the present study. None of the subjects had
musculoskeletal or neurological impairments, a history of ankle surgery or vestibular
deficits, or a history involving athletics, and none had received any training for muscle
strengthening within the past six months.</p><p>The procedures of the experiment were explained to the participants, who voluntarily agreed
to participate and signed informed consent forms. Each participant was randomly assigned
either the OKC exercise group or the CKC exercise group, each of which consisted of ten
women. The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Namseoul
University (NSU-151005-2). And participants provided informed consent prior to
participation.</p><p>In order to measure the physical characteristics of the subjects, Body Composition
Analyzers (Inbody 720, Biospace, Seoul, Republic of Korea) were used. In order to measure
each subject&#x02019;s balance ability, a professional balance assessment and training platform
(BT4, HUR labs Oy, Tampere, Finland) was used before and after each exercise.</p><p>Each subject&#x02019;s balance was measured using Romberg&#x02019;s test, and their limit of stability
(LOS) was measured. To obtain the Romberg&#x02019;s test results, each subject was asked to bend one
leg along the anterior-posterior axis of the balance platform at 30 degrees and stand on the
opposite leg in order to maintain as stable a stance as possible<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> for 60 seconds once with their eyes open (EO) and once
with their eyes closed (EC). The measured variables were trace length (TL), Mean X, and Mean
Y. To measure LOS, each subject&#x02019;s feet were aligned along the heel and medial malleolus
landmarks printed on the top of the platform. Each subject was then instructed to shift her
body weight (using her ankle joints as the primary axis of motion without changing their
feet&#x02019;s position) in different directions (one direction at a time) as quickly as possible
following the appearance of a target on the monitor. Each direction of the target was
randomly selected by the researcher and displayed for eight seconds only once each<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measured directions were forward
(FW), backward (BW), left (LT), and right (RT).</p><p>Before the exercise period began, the physical characteristics of each subject were
measured. The exercises were performed on each subject&#x02019;s non-dominant side<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each subject kicked a ball to determine
their dominant lower extremity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
exercise protocols of either the OKC or the CKC exercise were performed for 60 minutes,
which was based on a referred study<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The exercise protocol consisted of a warm-up exercise for 10 minutes, the main exercise for
40 minutes, and a cool-down exercise for 10 minutes (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Exercise protocol (for four weeks)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Exercise</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">OKC</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CKC</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Warm-up (ankle stretching for 10

strategy are the three movement strategies used to counter anterior-posterior translational
motion. The purpose of the present study was to analyze static and dynamic balance using a
Thera-Band and a towel to perform either OKC or CKC exercises on the ankle joint.</p><p>In the present study, in the results of the Romberg&#x02019;s test, the main effect of time showed
a significant different in TL with EC. A previous study investigated the effects of OKC and
CKC exercises on knee extensor strength and balance in patients that recently had a stroke.
In this study, there were significant differences in knee extensor strength and balance
ability between the pre- and post-exercise of all groups<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another previous study examined the effects of OKC and CKC
exercises on muscle activation of the paretic lower limb and balance in chronic stroke
subjects. The study reported that anterior-posterior and medio-lateral sway velocities
decreased both with eyes open and eyes closed with CKC exercise. These findings indicate
that CKC exercise can improve balance in chronic stroke patients, and this improvement may
carry over into an improvement in functional performance<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Maintaining balance requires the ability to accept and inhibit the
afferent stimulation of visual sensory, vestibular sensory, and somatosensory input.
Measuring a subject&#x02019;s balance with their eyes open can identify their visual sensory,
vestibular sensory, and somatosensory function. Measuring a subject&#x02019;s balance with their
eyes closed can measure their vestibular sensory and somatosensory function without visual
sensory function<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the subjects&#x02019; Romberg&#x02019;s test results showed a statistically
significant difference in TL with EC between the pre- and post-exercise. These findings
indicated that static balance could be improved without visual sensory function because the
OKC and CKC exercises improved vestibular sensory and somatosensory function, which allow a
person to maintain balance.</p><p>Although the subjects were given what appears to be a simple instruction (sway as little as
possible), undisturbed upright stance control is, in fact, a complex task based on an
integrated process involving predominantly visual and, when available, tactile and
proprioceptive cues<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The visual system
assists in the maintenance and orientation of an erect posture. The conscious and
unconscious correction of posture is possible through visual input. Although the visual
system is an important reference source of verticality and for the maintenance of the
natural oscillation of the body within the limits of stability, it is not essential to
postural control; maintaining balance with one&#x02019;s eyes closed is possible<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the current study, no significant difference was shown in the other variables with EO.
These findings shows that visual feedback, which requires a subject&#x02019;s eyes to be open,
provided information that helps maintain postural control. The participants used visual
information and could maintain balance with a one-leg stance without any difference between
the first measurement and the measurement after four weeks.</p><p>In the present study, in the results of the LOS, the interaction effect showed a
statistically significant difference in BW, and the main effect of the group showed a
statistically significant difference in FW One previous study investigated the effect of OKC
and CKC exercise on the dynamic balance ability of the ankle joints of healthy young adults.
The results of this study showed that the balance of the subjects in both exercise groups
improved, but the improvement was only statistically significant in the CKC group. This
study concluded that CKC exercise appears to be more effective at improving dynamic balance
ability than OKC exercise within a six-week training period<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study examined whether the quadriceps femoris muscles are
activated differently in OKC and CKC tasks. The study reported that the CKC exercise
promotes more balanced initial quadriceps activation than OKC exercise<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study investigated the effects of OKC and CKC
exercise on knee joint function and on knee joint position sense in normal adults. The
results of this study suggested that both OKC and CKC exercise increased knee joint
proprioception. In particular, this study found that CKC exercise could be more useful than
OKC exercise for improving proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study analyzed the therapeutic effects of OKC and CKC
exercises on the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). The study reported that
CKC exercises were more effective than OKC exercises for this purpose<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. A study reported that the improvement of dynamic balance
was significantly higher in the CKC group than in the other groups in the study. Another
study to examine the exercise effects of OKC aimed and CKC exercise on balance in chronic
stroke subjects. Anterior-posterior medio-lateral sway velocities (both with EO and EC)
decreased with the application of CKC exercise. These findings indicate that CKC exercise
can improve balance in chronic stroke patients, which may carry over into an improvement in
functional performance<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. During CKC
exercises, a group of muscles and joints works simultaneously, whereas in OKC exercises,
they work separately. The effects of CKC exercise are remarkable; the co-contractions and
complex actions of many muscles can greatly enhance joint stability<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, in the results of the LOS, the interaction effect of the time and
group was statistically in FW. This result is likely due to the changes in dynamic balance
before and after exercise caused by both the OKC and CKC exercises. Additionally, the main
effect of the group showed there was a statistically significant difference in the BW. These
findings indicated that CKC exercise is more effective than OKC exercise because of the
simultaneous muscle contractions and actions in CKC exercise compared to the separate
actions of OKC exercise.</p><p>In the present study, OKC and CKC exercise using the ankle joint was performed by healthy
young women for four weeks. As the Romberg&#x02019;s test, the main effect of the time showed a
significant difference in TL with eyes closed. As the results of the LOS, the interaction
effect showed a significant difference in the BW, and the main effect of the group showed a
significant difference in the FW. Both OKC and CKC exercise improved the static balance of
the subjects in this study, and the CKC exercise improved dynamic balance more than the OKC
exercise. These results can be useful in the formulation of both home exercise and clinical
exercise programs intended to improve balance training by allowing therapists who formulate
these programs to choose the most effective exercises for these programs.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the authorship
