proprioceptive exercises to examine the effects of combined exercises on functional ankle
instability. [Subjects and Methods] Experiments were conducted with 30 adult males and
females. The study subjects were randomly assigned to either a control group (Group A), a
muscle strengthening exercise group (Group B), or a combined muscle strengthening and
proprioceptive exercise group (Group C) consisting of 10 subjects each. In Group A,
measurements were only conducted before and after the experiment without any intervention,
whereas the exercise programs for Group B and Group C were implemented three days per week
for four weeks. [Results] Muscle strength showed significant increases in Groups B and C
compared with the control group during plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, inversion, and
eversion. The Cumberland ankle instability tool showed significant increases in Group B
and Group C compared with Group A and significant increases in Group C compared with Group
B. [Conclusion] Applying combined muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises to
those who have functional ankle instability is more effective than applying only muscle
strengthening exercises.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Functional ankle instability</kwd><kwd>Strength</kwd><kwd>Cumberland ankle instability tool</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>According to recent studies on lower extremity injuries, ankle sprains have the highest
incidence rate, reaching 206 per 100,000 persons per year, and they most frequently occur in
children and adolescents<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional ankle instability (FAI) refers to the subjective feeling of an ankle giving-way
that remains as a result of an ankle sprain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of FAI include muscle weakening and the lack of
proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, both
muscle strength and proprioception have been associated with ankle instability. For
instance, muscle strengthening exercises and well-planned proprioceptive exercises can help
those who develop FAI after an ankle injury, particularly with their normal activities, and
can prevent unnecessary operations<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since
chronic ankle instability is related to the combination of the lack of proprioceptive sense
and eversion muscle weakening, combined exercise programs focused on improving
proprioception and muscle strength are necessary<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Cumberland ankle instability tool (CAIT) is the first tool to measure the degree of
FAI. This evaluation tool consists of nine questions and has high reliability and
validity<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Isokinetic dynamometers are
often used to measure ankle muscle strength. They can measure and analyze muscle functions
such as peak torque, average power, and total works simultaneously in one muscle contraction
exercise, have higher objectivity and accuracy than muscle function evaluations through
isometric or isotonic exercises, and can evaluate muscle functions precisely using diverse
angular velocities<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although both insufficient muscle strength and the lack of proprioceptive sense exist
simultaneously in those with FAI, studies on them are insufficient. Therefore, the purpose
of this study was to implement a combination of exercises for these two problems and to
examine the effects of the combined exercises using ankle muscle strength and CAIT
scores.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>In this study, experiments were conducted on 30 healthy adult males and females in their
20s selected from among students at a university in the Gwangju region through open
recruitment. Subjects were selected who had an ankle giving way as a result of a past
ankle sprain and who had a CAIT score not exceeding 24 points. The purpose of this study
was explained to the subjects, and their written agreement to the experiment was obtained.

strengthening exercise group (Group B), or a combined muscle strengthening and
proprioceptive exercises group (Group C) consisting of 10 subjects each. In Group A,
measurements were only conducted before and after the experiment without any intervention,
whereas the exercise programs for Group B and Group C were implemented three days per week
for four weeks.</p><p>As Group B exercises, a total of four types of exercises, plantar flexion, and
dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion, were performed for 10 minutes using TheraBands (The
Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA). The Group C exercise program consisted of the same
exercises as those implemented in the muscle strengthening group (Group B) followed by
proprioceptive exercises. For the proprioceptive exercises, subjects stood on their
instable foot on an indoor floor with the knee on the other side bent to 90&#x000b0;, placed the
instable foot on an Aerostep, and marched in place on a Posturomed for 50 sec, with each
being performed in order of precedence<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. A total of four sets were performed for 10 minutes. Warm-up
exercises and cool-down exercises were performed for five minutes each.</p><p>In this study, a Biodex III isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY,
USA) was used to measure ankle muscle strength. Wearing a pair of shoes, each subject
reclined the chair by 30&#x000b0;, placed his/her feet on the measuring plate at 0&#x000b0;, placed
his/her knee joints at 20&#x02013;30&#x000b0;, and took a posture so that the patellae and the center of
the ankles were aligned parallel to each other; the trunk, femoral region, and ankles were
fixed using straps to minimize the range of errors due to compensation. Plantar flexion
and dorsiflexion were measured once with a movement that began from 40&#x000b0; plantar flexion,
progressed to 20&#x000b0; dorsiflexion, and then returned to plantar-flexion. Inversion and
eversion were measured once in the aforementioned posture with a movement that began from
30&#x000b0; inversion, progressed to 20&#x000b0; eversion, and returned to inversion. Each subject was
allowed to rest for one minute after each movement. The angular velocity was set to 60&#x000b0;;
this is best for measuring muscle strength because it is easy and safe, and a large number
of motor units are necessary at low angular velocities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, measurement at this angular velocity is highly
reliable<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The degree of FAI was
examined using the CAIT.</p><p>The descriptive statistics of the means and standard deviations of all data measured in
this study were produced using the PASW version 18.0 statistical program. Shapiro-Wilk
tests were conducted to determine the normal distribution of each measurement item. The
extended c<sup>2</sup> test and one-way ANOVA were performed to test the homogeneity of
the groups. Differences among Group A, Group B, and Group C were analyzed using one-way
ANOVA. Duncan tests were conducted as post-hoc analyses. To verify the significance of all
statistical analyses, the significance level &#x003b1; was set to 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of the between-groups comparison of peak torque at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0;

has not been clearly established despite the fact that ankle sprains have been extensively
researched and investigated<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repeated
ankle sprains induce FAI<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and injuries
to the muscles, ligaments, and tendons around the ankle<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and the lack of proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> have been reported as the causes of FAI. In this study, combined
muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises were applied to subjects who had FAI, and
the effects of the exercise were examined using muscle strength and the CAIT.</p><p>Isokinetic dynamometers help to quantify and understand current conditions of the ankle.
Peak torque can be defined as the maximum torque produced during the five repetitions and
has been known as the most important index of an individual&#x02019;s muscle strength<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, when combined muscle strengthening and proprioceptive
exercises were performed, peak torque showed significant increases in Groups B and C
compared with Group A at an angular velocity of 60&#x000b0; during plantar flexion, and
dorsiflexion, inversion, and eversion. These results are consistent with the results of
previous studies indicating that when muscle strengthening exercises were applied to
subjects who had FAI, muscle strength increased significant<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The CAIT is a simple, valid, and reliable FAI evaluation tool. In a previous study<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, when dynamic neuromuscular training was
applied to the ankle for six weeks, the CAIT score improved from 4 points to 27 points<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, Groups B and C showed
significant increases compared with Group A, and when Groups B and C were compared with each
other, Group C showed significant increases compared with Group B. Based on this,
proprioceptive exercises in combination with muscle strengthening exercises helped to
improve ankle stability<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
combined muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises are more effective than muscle
strengthening exercises only.</p><p>The limitations of this study include that the intervention was only applied for four weeks
and that the subjects were limited to individuals in their 20s. The effects of combined
muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises could be determined with greater accuracy
in future studies if the intervention is applied for at least six weeks and the results are
measured in subjects from diverse age groups. In conclusion, the current study found that
applying combined muscle strengthening and proprioceptive exercises to individuals who have
FAI is more effective than applying only muscle strengthening exercises.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lambers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Ootes</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ring</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Incidence of patients with lower extremity injuries
