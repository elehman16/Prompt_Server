It affects around 1 in 12 men and 1 in 10 women of working age. Although this condition can settle with time (typically taking 1 to 3 years), for some people it causes severe symptoms and needs referral to hospital. Our aim is to evaluate the clinical and cost-effectiveness of two invasive and costly surgical interventions that are commonly used in secondary care in the National Health Service (NHS) compared with a non-surgical comparator of Early Structured Physiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We will conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 500 adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of frozen shoulder, and who have radiographs that exclude other pathology. Early Structured Physiotherapy with an intra-articular steroid injection will be compared with manipulation under anaesthesia with a steroid injection or arthroscopic (keyhole) capsular release followed by manipulation. Both surgical interventions will be followed with a programme of post-procedural physiotherapy. These treatments will be undertaken in NHS hospitals across the United Kingdom. The primary outcome and endpoint will be the Oxford Shoulder Score (a patient self-reported assessment of shoulder function) at 12 months. This will also be measured at baseline, 3 and 6 months after randomisation; and on the day that treatment starts and 6 months later. Secondary outcomes include the Disabilities of Arm Shoulder and Hand (<italic>Quick</italic>DASH) score, the EQ-5D-5 L score, pain, extent of recovery and complications. We will explore the acceptability of the different treatments to patients and health care professionals using qualitative methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The three treatments being compared are the most frequently used in secondary care in the NHS, but there is uncertainty about which one works best and at what cost.

A shoulder surgeon&#x02019;s hospital care experience in the UK, however, suggests that the term frozen shoulder is often overused and misused, with incidence in the general population around 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although viewed as a self-limiting condition, long-term follow-up data are scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Based on a series of 233 patients with a mean follow-up of 4.4 years from onset of symptoms, 59% had normal or near normal shoulders, 35% had mild-to-moderate symptoms with pain being the most common complaint and 6% had severe symptoms at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Recent systematic reviews have identified large gaps in the evidence-base and uncertainty in the effectiveness of treatments for frozen shoulder and a need for high-quality primary research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From searching the Health Technology Assessment (HTA) website and the ISRCTN register, there was no large-scale, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) of interventions for primary frozen shoulder being undertaken.</p><p id="Par36">The aim of our research is to provide evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness for commonly used interventions in the National Health Service (NHS) for the management of frozen shoulder in secondary care. We used the findings of a national survey of health care professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to inform the decision to compare Early Structured Physiotherapy (ESP) and intra-articular steroid injection with the two most frequently used and more costly surgical interventions, i.e. manipulation under anaesthesia (MUA) and arthroscopic capsular release (ACR). As evidence about patient experiences of a frozen shoulder is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], participants will be interviewed to explore their experience and acceptability of treatment 12 months after enrolment into the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p id="Par39">Patients with primary frozen shoulder will be identified through clinical examination and plain radiographs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The clinical examination will include the key diagnostic assessment of restriction of passive external rotation in the affected shoulder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The affected shoulder is manipulated to stretch and tear the tight capsule and to improve range of movement. Surgeons will use an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid to the glenohumeral joint whilst the patient is under the same anaesthetic unless it is contraindicated. Post-operative analgesia, including nerve blocks, will be provided as per usual care in the treating hospital.

Arthroscopic release of the contracted rotator interval and anterior capsule will be performed, followed by MUA to complete the release of the inferior capsule. Surgeons will use at their discretion additional procedures like posterior capsular release and subacromial decompression. Supplementary steroid injections, which slightly increase the risk of infection and morbidity, will also be used at the surgeon&#x02019;s discretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

This PPP is not intended to be identical to ESP because it is applied in a very different context. The research literature is uninformative, but we pre-specified two &#x02018;focussed physiotherapy&#x02019; interventions on the basis of established good practice. These are provision of an information leaflet containing education, advice on pain management and function; and instruction on a graduated home exercise programme. All participants randomised to MUA or ACR will undergo all elements of this focussed physiotherapy package unless there is a specific clinical reason for them not to do so. The interpretation of the Delphi survey results was as for ESP. A steroid injection will be avoided during PPP.

The OSS is a 12-item measure with five response categories and a range of scores from 0 (worst) to 48 (best) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It has been validated against the professionally endorsed Constant Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and responsiveness over a 6-month period following surgical intervention has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The OSS will be completed at the hospital at baseline (i.e. day of randomisation) and posted to trial participants at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomisation.

A 5-point improvement, with a standard deviation (SD) of 12, can be found on the OSS (standard effect size of 0.42) in shoulder patients treated conservatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and with complication-free surgery (author AR, unpublished data, 2014). The developers of the OSS agree that this improvement represents a minimal clinically important difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This larger effect size will be required to justify the greater costs and potential risks associated with surgery. A smaller mean difference of 4 points on the OSS (standard effect size of 0.33) is expected to distinguish between MUA and ACR. To observe the above effect sizes with 90% power and 5% two-sided significance, adjusting for a conservative estimate (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4) of the correlation between OSS over 12 months and allowing for 20% attrition, a total sample size of 500 patients is required (ESP: 100; MUA: 200; ACR: 200).

Assuming that 50% of frozen shoulder patients presenting in secondary care meet the inclusion criteria and 40% consent (based on the PROFHER trial experience comparing surgical versus conservative care in shoulder fracture patients) that leaves around 40 patients per million to be recruited into the trial. To recruit 500 trial participants from trusts that serve around a half-million catchment area we expect to need 25 hospitals to recruit for a minimum of 1 year. This estimate, however, requires no delays in set up or problems at any time after that, all surgeons at a site to participate, and all potential participants to be screened for eligibility. Our experience is that it will be feasible to set up 25 hospitals; however, up to 30 months will be required to meet our recruitment target.</p><p id="Par69">To assess their feasibility to successfully recruit we will ask sites to complete an Expression of Interest Form. The study will be endorsed by the British Elbow and Shoulder Society (BESS) and publicised at the annual BESS conferences.

A Trial Site Manual will be prepared for hospital staff which will include guidance on consenting patients into the trial and how to answer questions that might arise during consent. In addition, a poster will be provided to publicise the trial to hospital staff and patients.

Trial coordinators will provide support and guidance to staff when required.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Assignment of interventions</title><p id="Par72">The RN or assessing clinician will identify patients who have been referred for a frozen shoulder to an outpatient hospital clinic. In the clinic, a designated individual within the shoulder team (e.g. surgeon, physiotherapist) will complete a CRF to confirm whether the patient is eligible or not; and when applicable, approach the patient about the study. The RN will then provide an information sheet and answer any questions. The patient can agree to consent at that time or take up to a week to decide.</p><p id="Par73">When the patient does not consent, a further CRF will be completed by the RN to briefly record the reason for the patient not consenting and their treatment plan.

The hospital site will be reimbursed for the completion of CRFs which will be signed off by the trust and trial sponsor using a Clinical Trial Agreement. No checks regarding data quality of the postal questionnaires will be made on immediate return to YTU. A trial coordinator will, however, as a duty of care, check whether the participant has responded to the last EQ-5D-5 L question that &#x02018;I am extremely anxious and depressed&#x02019; and check free-text responses to questions on whether the participant could be at risk of harm.

For each sub-group analysis, the estimated treatment by sub-group means with associated confidence intervals will be reported along with the <italic>p</italic> value for the interaction term.</p><p id="Par83">To explore the potential effect of patients&#x02019; knowledge of which treatment they received (allocation cannot be blinded) and their experience of this treatment on the results of the trial as measured by the primary outcome, we will take two approaches. First, eligible patients will be asked at baseline if they have any treatment preference (physiotherapy, no preference or surgery; and if surgery, which type) and their expectations of the effectiveness of each treatment. These preferences and expectations will be descriptively explored by trial arm as well as for compliant and crossover patients. Separate secondary analyses of the ITT primary outcome model will be conducted including an interaction of the randomised treatment with: treatment preferences, preference rating of the allocated treatment, effectiveness expectations of each treatment and effectiveness rating of the allocated treatment. In addition, at the end of the 12-month follow-up period, patients will again be asked to indicate their treatment preference in the event of a similar shoulder problem given their experience over the past 12 months. Patient preferences at 12 months&#x02019; follow-up will be tabulated against baseline preferences and against the allocated treatment. Second, it is possible that patients&#x02019; knowledge and experience of treatment may result in non-response at follow-up. A logistic regression model will be used to identify predictors of non-response and will include all baseline data and primary outcome assessments before any missing values. If any variables are found to be predictive of non-response they will be included in the model specified for the primary analysis.</p><p id="Par84">All unadjusted secondary outcomes will be reported descriptively (mean, SD, median, minimum and maximum for continuous data and counts and percentages for categorical data). The following outcomes will be analysed using the same ITT methods as the primary analysis adjusting for the same covariates: <italic>Quick</italic>DASH, pain question and extent of recovery (assessed by a &#x02018;need for further treatment&#x02019; rating scale). Separate logistic regression models will be used to determine treatment-group differences in having experienced at least one complication or adverse event.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p id="Par85">The economic evaluation will determine the relative cost-effectiveness of three interventions for the treatment of frozen shoulder. A cost-utility analysis will compare the incremental health outcome, measured in terms of QALYs, with the incremental cost among the three treatment options. Costs and QALYs will be evaluated from the perspective of the NHS and Personal Social Services, consistent with that used by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">Health-related quality of life will be assessed during the trial period using the EQ-5D-5 L instrument. The EQ-5D profiles generated for each patient will be valued using a set of estimated preferences based on the UK population that will be generated by the EuroQoL group during the period of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The summary of the EQ-5D utility scores at each follow-up point by each treatment arm will be presented and the overall difference in utilities between the arms will be examined through an appropriate model. QALYs will be estimated using the area-under-the-curve analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p id="Par87">Health care resource data will be collected at different time points using patient self-administered questionnaires and hospital CRFs and compared with the relevant Health Resource Group. Cost per patient will be estimated by multiplying the use of resource use by their associated unit costs. Unit costs will be sourced from the NHS Reference Costs databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], the Personal Social Services Research Unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], the <italic>British National Formulary</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] and other published literature. Though the primary perspective of the cost analysis will be that of the NHS and Personal Social Services, data on indirect costs associated with patient private expenses, days lost from work and from normal activities (e.g. household chores, shopping) will also be collected and included in a secondary analysis.</p><p id="Par88">Cost and QALY data will be synthesised to generate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mean difference in costs to the mean difference in QALYs between treatments. Multivariate regression models will be used to assess the heterogeneity in costs, QALYs and cost-effectiveness. Multiple imputation techniques will be used to address the statistical issues related to the presence of missing data in the economic evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In order to characterise the uncertainty in the data, structural, scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses will be conducted. The uncertainty will be presented using a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve which shows the probability of the surgical interventions being more cost-effective than ESP conditional on a maximum value being attached to an additional unit of health outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p id="Par89">For the longer term, and if it is appropriate, QALYs for each patient will be calculated by extrapolating results of the trial-based analysis to a longer time horizon. For example, by assessing the long-term impact on health-related quality of life and costs at 5 years as at this time around 40% of patients continue to have from mild-to-severe symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The potential value of further research in this area will be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Nested qualitative study</title><p id="Par90">The trial will be supplemented by a qualitative study that will focus on the following objectives to complement the trial objectives: to explore the experience and acceptability of the different treatments to patients and health care professionals; and to provide important patient-centred insight to further guide clinical decision-making. We will also explore, as a subsidiary aim, participants&#x02019; experiences of taking part in a surgical trial.</p><p id="Par91">Up to 45 of the trial participants will take part in the interviews and will be drawn from those who have experienced the three trial treatments. As gender and diabetes can have an impact on outcome from shoulder surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] effort will be made to include interviews with both men and women, and those with and without diabetes. The interviews will take place at approximately 12 months after enrolment into the trial to mirror the primary time point in the analysis. Interviews will be semi-structured with open questions. A flexible interview schedule will be developed following a literature review, discussions with the research team, patients with frozen shoulder, a physiotherapist and surgeon with expertise in this area. Interviews will be open and flexible to allow participants the opportunity to introduce new topics, and generate a detailed, personal perspective upon the topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We will continue to interview men and women to a point of theoretical saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]; in short, until no further useful conceptual categories emerge.</p><p id="Par92">Interviews will be ideally undertaken face-to-face although, given the geographic spread of participants, it may be more practical to perform some interviews by telephone or face-time interviews on-line (e.g. Skype); it is expected that up to 50% of interviews will be performed in this way. Interviews will be conducted by a qualitative researcher and audio-recorded with permission; and recordings will be transcribed in full.</p><p id="Par93">We will also interview 10 to 15 health care professionals (physiotherapists and surgeons) about their experience of delivering the treatment. An interview schedule will be developed to address areas such as: clinical decision-making; treatment preference; and barriers to, and facilitators of, positive outcome of treatments.</p><p id="Par94">To reflect the exploratory nature of this study, and to ensure that the participants&#x02019; perspective is at the heart of any insight generated, data analysis will be undertaken inductively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, our analytic approach is underpinned by constructivism, which takes the stance that qualitative research findings are not &#x02018;discovered&#x02019; but co-constructed by the researcher and participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Qualitative finding are thus an interpretation. Through a process of constantly comparing data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], we will develop initial tentative conceptual categories and then further abstract these categories into overarching themes that will help us to understand the experience. We will use NVivo qualitative data analysis software version 11 to assist our organisation of qualitative analysis. All interviews will be analysed by the researcher conducting the interviews with a second qualitative researcher coding a subset of interviews and commenting on the development of conceptual categories. The aim of this is not to reach consensus but to challenge the emerging interpretation and ensure interpretive rigour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. We will develop our conceptual categories and themes collaboratively in team meetings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Update of systematic review</title><p id="Par95">To place the RCT findings in the context of current evidence at the end of the trial, we will update the HTA systematic review about the management of frozen shoulder incorporating the proposed RCT and any other new RCTs completed since the original searches were undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The review protocol will be registered on an international prospective register of systematic review (PROSPERO) prior to the analysis of the trial being undertaken. We will update the results of the review incorporating UK FROST and any other new RCTs.

Once received, causality and expectedness will be determined by the CI. SAEs that are unexpected and related to the trial will be notified to Research Ethics Committee (REC) within 15 days for a non-life threatening event and within 7 days for a life-threatening event. For non-serious AEs, the central office will be notified within 5 days of the event being known. All (S)AEs will be reported to the DMEC, TSC and TMG. Expected adverse events for this shoulder condition include: infection; bleeding; delayed wound healing; conversion of planned day-case procedure to overnight stay for control of pain; post-procedural worsening of shoulder pain; injury to adjacent structures like nerve, tendon, bone or joint; recurrent stiffness requiring further treatment; and transient hyperglycaemia, steroid flare or joint sepsis following corticosteroid injection; injuries related to heating or cooling of tissues.
