The original protocol was published in <italic>Trials</italic> in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and we hereby report its updated protocol including the statistical analysis plan, as we would like to implement two important changes to the original protocol. One change is about the required sample size, reflecting the smaller number of dropouts than had been expected. Another change is in the organization of the primary and secondary outcomes in order to make the report of the main trial results as pertinent and interpretable as possible for clinical practices.</p><p>The trial completed recruitment of all participants on 13 March 2015, and completion of the last follow-up is expected in September 2015. This updated protocol and statistical analysis plan were drafted without knowledge of the randomization code, which will not be broken before acceptance of the current paper for publication.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial overview</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>SUN(^_^)D is an assessor-blinded, parallel-group, multicenter randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The trial has three steps with two randomizations (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Randomizations were performed at first recruitment for Step I (cluster randomization by site) and at start of Step II (individual randomization). Step I has two arms, in which sertraline will be started from 25 mg/d and titrated up to 50 mg/d or up to 100 mg/d, the minimum and the maximum of the standard prescription range in Japan, respectively. Step II has three arms, in which sertraline will be continued as in Step I, mirtazapine will be added to sertraline, or sertraline will be switched to mirtazapine. In Step III, all the treatments will be at the discretion of the treating physician.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_985_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Treatment of a major depressive episode is commonly divided into the acute phase treatment, which aims at the prompt reduction of acute symptoms, and the continuation treatment, which not only seeks to reduce further the symptoms but also to prevent symptom relapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The acute phase treatment usually lasts 6 to 12 weeks, and it is recommended that the continuation treatment be continued 4 to 9 months after the acute phase treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In our study, therefore, Steps I and II represent the acute phase treatment, whereas Step III corresponds with the continuation treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study is being conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments as well as the Ethics Guideline for Clinical Research (2008 revision, Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, Japan).

id="Sec17"><title>Sample size and power</title><p>The clinical question for REPORT #2 is the main hypothesis of this trial. Previous studies using PHQ9 in the acute phase treatment of major depression have shown that, on average, the PHQ9 scores will drop from 15 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) at baseline to 10 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) at the end of treatment, with a mean change of 5 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). We expect a difference of 20 % (1 point) in the PHQ9 change scores among the intervention arms and consider this a clinically meaningful difference in effect. With the alpha error set at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, in order to detect a between-group difference of 1 point (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) in the reduction of PHQ9 scores from baseline, we need 522 per group and 1,566 in total for Step II. Assuming a dropout rate of 10 % and a remission rate of 10 % at week 3, we need 1,934 participants at Step I.</p><p>The sample size required for REPORT #1 was determined as follows. Assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient to be 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], with alpha error at 0.05 and statistical power at 0.80, to detect a difference of 1 point on PHQ9 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), that is, to detect an effect size of 0.2 at week 9, we need 66 patients at each of 30 sites. We therefore need 1,980 patients at Step I.</p><p>Altogether, we concluded that 2,000 patients would be needed to have enough statistical power to examine our primary outcomes for REPORTS #1 and #2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Datasets to be analyzed</title><p>The analyses will be performed according to the intention to treat (ITT) principle.

updated protocol, we have merged Step I with Step IIIa and Step II with Step IIIb into two main reports in order to present the results of this complex trial in the most clinically informative way. These two reports will focus on Step I randomization and Step II randomization, respectively, and both will focus on the acute phase treatment up to 9 weeks as their primary outcome but supplement this with other benefit and harm outcomes for the acute phase treatment, as well with benefit and harm outcomes for the continuation treatment up to 25 weeks.</p><p>REPORT #1 will examine the clinical questions for Step I through Step IIIa, as originally postulated in the published protocol. For this report, however, we have changed the primary outcome from &#x0201c;Change in PHQ9 from 1 through 3 weeks&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;Change in PHQ9 from 1 through 9 weeks&#x0201d; (which was one of the secondary outcomes in the original protocol), in order to fully examine our clinical question comparing the 50 mg/day arm and 100 mg/day arm up to the end of the acute treatment phase. Week 9 was chosen as the primary outcome because the acute phase treatment usually is considered to last 6 to 12 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In order to focus on the effect of the choice of the initial dosage of the first-line treatment with sertraline through the acute treatment phase as defined, we will concentrate on those who did not remit and were subsequently randomized at week 3 to continue on sertraline (hence, a random third of those who had not remitted by week 3), those who had remitted and were therefore continued on sertraline, and those who had dropped out of the protocol treatment by week 3 and subsequently received treatments at physician&#x02019;s discretion, in order to abide by the ITT principle for Step I randomization (see blue cells in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>REPORT #2 will deal with the clinical question for Step II and Step IIIb, as originally postulated in the published protocol, and has set the primary outcome for Step II as its primary outcome.</p><p>The required sample size at Step I remained the same for REPORT #1 by assuming the same magnitude to effect to detect at week 9 instead of at week 3. The sample size required at Step II for REPORT #2 also remained the same; however, we reduced the initial sample size to be recruited into Step I in order to ensure this sample after we reviewed the observed proportion of patients who had entered into Step I but subsequently dropped out of the protocol treatment and could not be randomized at Step II (from 20 % to 10 %).</p><p>All these changes were discussed and agreed upon by the Steering Committee of the SUN(^_^)D trial before the randomization code is broken.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec33" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This paper presents the updated protocol and the detailed statistical analysis plan for the SUN(^_^)D trial in order to avoid risks of reporting bias and data-driven results.
