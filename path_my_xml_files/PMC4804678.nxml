Effective bowel preparation to clean the colon prior to the study is essential. Numerous studies have looked at safety and efficacy of different bowel preparation protocols. There is no standard bowel preparation regimen, but it is agreed that success of the procedure depends highly on the quality of the bowel preparation. Residual fluid or stool in the colon impedes the endoscopist&#x02019;s ability to view the mucosal lining, visually assess for pathologic lesions or abnormalities, and in some cases complete the procedure.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>Potential barriers to successfully completing the bowel preparation regimen have been previously identified as ease of administration, palatability of the preparation, the volume of preparation that must be consumed, restrictions of activities to complete the preparation, and adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, bloating, and/or abdominal pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Additionally, we suspect that incomplete understanding regarding the importance of the completeness of bowel preparation might also contribute to decreased compliance. Abbott reported that noncompliant patient behavior may be attributable to confusion, disappointment, misunderstanding, and fear and that compliance increases when the patient understands the rationale for the procedure, the preparation for the procedure, and the potential complications.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>St Christopher&#x02019;s Hospital for Children, located in North Philadelphia, serves a diverse pediatric patient population, with a significant proportion of socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals who may have limited health literacy. Feedback from endoscopists and nursing staff indicated that, in general, bowel preparation quality was not ideal and compromised the ability to visualize mucosal lining. Parents also stated they had difficulties following the bowel preparation regimen as prescribed.</p><p>Based on these observations, we hypothesized that implementation of an instructional cartoon directed at pediatric patients and their parents highlighting the importance of an adequate bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy would improve the quality of the bowel preparation and parent/patient experience with the preparation process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333794X14548199"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a prospective randomized single blinded pilot investigation to evaluate the efficacy of an informational cartoon developed by our group that highlights key points and importance of bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy. This study was conducted in the outpatient clinic setting in the Section of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition at St Christopher&#x02019;s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia, PA, from October 2011 to June 2013.</p><sec id="section3-2333794X14548199"><title>Participants: Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria</title><p>The inclusion criteria were as follows: children ages 7 to 14 years, followed at the St Christopher&#x02019;s Hospital for Children Gastroenterology clinic (main campus), undergoing elective, outpatient, first time colonoscopy for any indication (including diarrhea, abdominal pain, failure to thrive). Exclusion criteria were as follows: non-English speaking, admitted to the inpatient service, seen at the satellite clinic, and previous history of undergoing a colonoscopy.</p><p>As this was a pilot study, our target sample size was 15 patients in each group. We anticipated that with groups of this size, we would be able to establish trends in the data that would suggest benefit to a larger study. We enrolled 27 total subjects and acquired data on 23.</p></sec><sec id="section4-2333794X14548199"><title>Study Design</title><p>Patients were considered for the study if a decision was made at their clinic appointment to schedule a colonoscopy for any indication and the inclusion criteria were met. After consent and assent were obtained, patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups. The control group received the standard verbal and written bowel preparation instructions by the office nurse at their clinic appointment prior to colonoscopy. The clinic uses a bowel preparation regimen that includes a low residue diet, PEG-3350 (238 g in 1.5 L sports drink 1 day prior to procedure), and bisacodyl (10 mg daily for 2 days prior to procedure). The intervention group received the standard bowel preparation instructions plus the 1-page informational cartoon. Our research coordinator reviewed the cartoon with the family at the office visit, and the families then took the cartoon home with them. Patients in both groups were instructed to contact the office if they had questions about the bowel preparation. On the day of the procedure, the parent filled out a questionnaire to collect demographic information and answer questions about the bowel preparation experience. The endoscopist assigned an Ottawa scale score to quantify the quality of the bowel preparation.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2333794X14548199"><title>Intervention</title><p>Our group developed the content of the 1-page color cartoon, and independent artists were consulted to create the artwork. The cartoon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2333794X14548199">Figure 1</xref>) depicts a child experiencing the progression of scheduling, preparing for, and undergoing a colonoscopy. This includes the appointment at his gastroenterologist&#x02019;s office when the procedure is explained, the diet he must follow prior to the procedure, the consumption of the bowel preparation, and the events on the day of the procedure. The message of the cartoon highlights that a successful colonoscopy depends on following the diet and bowel preparation regimen prescribed by the doctor before the procedure.</p><fig id="fig1-2333794X14548199" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Bowel preparation cartoon.

Cleanliness is assessed for the right colon, the mid colon, and the rectosigmoid individually, and the fluid value is a global value for the entire colon.

Demographic information was collected, including patient&#x02019;s date of birth, gender, race and ethnic group, and highest level of education completed by the parent. The parents were asked if they understood why it was important to complete the bowel preparation, if they understood the directions for completing the preparation, how much of the preparation their child was able to complete, and how satisfied they were with the experience of preparing for the colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="section8-2333794X14548199"><title>Randomization and Blinding</title><p>Each patient was randomly assigned to either the control or intervention group by a computer-generated randomization program.

One study reported that as much as 37% of patients required repeat examination because of inadequate bowel preparation. Repeating the study is costly and poses additional safety hazards for the patient, including risks of repeating the procedure and repeated exposure to anesthesia, a significant concern particularly in the pediatric population.</p><p>A study of adult colonoscopies by Lebwohl et al<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> found that suboptimal preparation was statistically more likely in Medicaid patients when compared with non-Medicaid patients. In another study, compliance with printed instructions in patients sent home from the emergency department was found to be only 36%,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> which may have been due to functional illiteracy of patients who were unable to comprehend written instructions.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The National Institutes of Health recommends that written materials distributed to patients be geared to a fourth- to eighth-grade reading level to maximize information disseminated to patients with limited health literacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>McDermott<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> was the first to describe the use of cartoons as visual aids for medical and health education of adults and children in 1989. Delp and Jones<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> then published a study in 1996 comparing outcomes of adult patients who received printed discharge instructions with and without cartoon drawings. They demonstrated improved comprehension of and compliance with instructions in patients who received the cartoon drawings. Their findings were even more pronounced when they compared education level of the patients. In a study by Shaikh et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> which looked at a demographic of financially disadvantaged adult patients with low level of education, the patients who received an educational pamphlet demonstrated superior bowel preparation quality. Another adult study of inpatients by Rosenfeld et al demonstrated improved quality of bowel preparation by providing patients with a short counseling session and written materials regarding the preparation.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In 2012, Tae et al published a study of adult patients undergoing colonoscopy in Korea and found improved quality of bowel preparation in patients who received cartoon visual aids.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2333794X14548199" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>We hypothesized that adding an educational cartoon to highlight the importance of taking the bowel preparation to the standard verbal and written teaching instructions would improve the outcome of bowel preparation in children. However, these results showed that objective quality of bowel preparation was not improved when a supplemental educational cartoon was used. The study was designed with an initial premise (based on anecdotal reports) that in the patient population at St Christopher&#x02019;s Hospital for Children, the overall quality of bowel preparation was only fair. This was perceived as a problem requiring further brainstorming to solve. However, in our study population, we found that the objective quality of bowel preparation to be good overall, regardless of which group the patient was assigned. Therefore, with bowel preparation that was already good, it may have been difficult to improve on it in a clinically meaningful way by adding to the teaching that is already being provided by the office nurse.</p><p>We also hypothesized that parents of patients who were randomized to the intervention group would report increased understanding about why the bowel preparation process was important, would report higher compliance, and would report increased satisfaction with the process when compared with controls. We found that, overall, all the patients enrolled in the study responded to the survey questions positively. Survey data were collected from the parents and not from the child directly. Anecdotally, our research coordinator reported that patients who received the cartoon seemed very engaged in the process of learning about colonoscopy preparation.</p><p>The primary limitation to this study was the small sample size, which may not reflect the challenges in the greater patient population. One barrier to enrollment was exclusion of non-English-speaking patients, for whom the addition of a visual learning aid may be of greater benefit as this subgroup represents a significant portion of patients seen in the gastroenterology clinic at St Christopher&#x02019;s Hospital for Children. Translating the cartoon into other languages including Spanish would potentially include those families who would benefit most. Outpatient colonoscopies are also scheduled at several satellite offices, which were unable to recruit patients due to lack of availability of appropriately trained staff to enroll patients and teach the cartoon.</p><p>The most significant finding was the overall negative correlation between level of education of the parent and the Ottawa score (which corresponds to a positive association between education and quality of bowel preparation, since the Ottawa scale has 0 as the ideal). This correlation was also seen in the control group, but not the intervention group. In the intervention group, receiving the cartoon equalized the average Ottawa scores between higher and lower education levels, but did not improve the scores to the level of the highly educated parents in the control group. We made an assumption that the parent completing the questionnaire was the same parent helping the child with bowel preparation at home.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-2333794X14548199"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quality of bowel preparation was good in the overall study population. Objective quality of bowel preparation was not improved when a supplemental educational cartoon was used in this pilot study. Small sample size was a limitation of this study.</p><p>We believe this initial pilot study has provided insight into the role of parental education on quality of bowel preparation prior to colonoscopy in children. There may be benefit to further investigation of educational cartoons specifically in parents with less than college level education or non-English-speaking families in a larger population of patients. Future studies should also focus on logistical and resource barriers beyond education to adequate bowel preparation.
