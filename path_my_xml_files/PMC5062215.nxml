Tracheal intubation is one of the best methods of securing a patient's airway. Tracheal intubation, usually simply referred to as intubation, is the placement of flexible plastic tube into the trachea to maintain an open airway. It is frequently performed in critically injured, ill, or anesthetized patients to facilitate ventilation of the lungs, including mechanical ventilation, and to prevent the possibility of asphyxiation or airway obstruction. The most widely used route is orotracheal, in which an endotracheal tube (ETT) is passed through the mouth and vocal apparatus into the trachea. It can be performed with local or topical anesthesia or with sedation only. Intubation is normally facilitated by using a conventional laryngoscope, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, or video laryngoscope to identify the glottis. For sedation, drugs that may be used include fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, dexmedetomidine, and remifentanil. Each drug has advantages and disadvantages. Newer drugs such as remifentanil have disadvantages of narrow therapeutic index and in familiarity regarding infusion kinetics.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Midazolam is a benzodiazepine which acts by binding to receptor complex which facilitates GABA action (major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain). Midazolam is water soluble, nonirritant to tissues. It has distribution half-life of 6&#x02013;30 min and elimination half-life of 1&#x02013;4 h. Midazolam is metabolized in liver and its metabolite is inactive. Propofol is a sedative/hypnotic which also enhances GABA activity and induces depression of the central nervous system, so it can be used as an alternative to benzodiazepines for intravenous (i.v.) sedation. Propofol has distribution half-life of 2&#x02013;4 min and elimination half-life ranging from 30 to 60 min. Propofol undergoes hepatic metabolism into four inactive metabolites. Rapid onset and prompt recovery make it an ideal choice for sedation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To compare efficacy and safety of i.v. propofol versus i.v. midazolam in fiberoptic endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Following parameters were observed:</p><p>

Group I patients were given propofol, and Group II patients were given midazolam as sedative agents for fiberoptic orotracheal intubation. Fiberoptic orotracheal intubation was done in both the groups. Age, weight, sex, body mass index (BMI), and Wilson score were comparable in Groups I and II. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded which included pulse rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean arterial pressure, ECG changes, and SpO<sub>2</sub>. The intubation score was noted according to the movement of vocal cords, presence of coughing, and limb movements along with the patient comfort score that included the 5-point fiberoptic intubation score and the 3-point comfort score. Any complication or any other drug used during the procedure was noted. After intubation, routine general anesthesia was administered.

The patients in group propofol showed better satisfaction score. Ninety percent patients in group propofol had an excellent satisfaction score whereas only 60% patients in group midazolam had excellent satisfaction. These findings coincide with the study done by various authors in their respective studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In our study, we conclude that propofol is a better sedative agent for fiberoptic intubation and provides better patient satisfaction in comparison to midazolam with similar hemodynamic profile, intubating conditions, and rate of complications. Midazolam has been shown to have adverse hemodynamic and airway stability when combined with another sedative/hypnotic,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but when used alone it appears to be quite reassuring.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] By using a median sample size, this study supports the observations made by various other authors in previous similar studies. We expect the present study to add to the existing knowledge on this subject.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Conflicts
