Long-term AIT research has led to the development of 5-grass pollen tablets, currently indicated for the treatment of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (AR).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A post-hoc analysis was conducted using the Average Adjusted Symptom Score (AAdSS) to compare the effect of treatment of AR with 5-grass pollen tablets versus placebo treatment. Using the results of the VO34.04 and VO53.06 trials and economic data, cost-effectiveness analysis of 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was performed from the Italian third-party payer perspective with cost data derived from a study of 2008 updated to 2011. Also a societal perspective was considered by using the costs related to the losses of productivity by following the human capital approach. Using the results of the analysis, the estimated receiver-operating characteristic curve was plotted to evaluate medication effectiveness in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and a decision tree constructed to model the possible outcomes and costs for adults and paediatric patients with a low, medium, and high AAdSS. Finally, probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the results as well as their consistency at an assumed cost-effectiveness threshold of &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results indicate that compared to the placebo, the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment provides a benefit of 0.127 QALYs in medium AAdSS patients and of 0.143 QALYs in high AAdSS patients. The 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was found to cost &#x020ac; 1,024/QALY for patients with a medium AAdSS and &#x020ac; 1,035/QALY for patients with a high AAdSS. Of all the simulations performed in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, 99&#x000a0;% indicated that the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment was below the threshold of &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY in patients with medium and high AAdSS, whereas it was found to be dominated in 67&#x000a0;% of simulations related to patients with low AAdSS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The 5-grass pollen tablet is a cost-effective treatment for adult AR patients with a medium or high AAdSS. This finding should be carefully considered when deciding the management strategy for these patients.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a significant health problem that the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates affects approximately 20&#x000a0;% of the world&#x02019;s adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The severity of AR may vary considerably, depending on both individual and environmental factors. In severe cases, treatment of AR requires a high consumption of pharmaceutical agents, such as antihistamines or corticosteroids, and can cause temporary inability to work or to carry out routine activities, leading to an overall temporary decline in quality of life (QoL). As indicated by the pharmacoeconomic literature on allergy to grass pollen, sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) and subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) have a more favourable cost-effectiveness profile than traditional treatments aimed only at treating the symptoms of allergy (rhinitis and asthma) in both adults and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Recent studies that have directly compared the costs of SCIT and SLIT have also indicated that treatment with the latter is more cost effective because of the cost reduction in terms of medical intervention needed for SCIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>In Italy, a multicentre study was conducted in 2006 to collect cost data for sublingual treatment with the grass pollen extract Staloral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Comparison of these data with the data regarding the cost of traditional treatment provided to symptomatic patients showed that although the average annual cost of SLIT was greater (&#x020ac; 311 vs. &#x020ac; 180), the use of SLIT led to a decrease in the amount expended on symptomatic drugs of between 22&#x000a0;% (in cases of rhinitis) and 34&#x000a0;% (in cases of rhinitis and asthma) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As additional efficacy data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] indicate that treatment with the newly available 5-grass pollen tablets provides further clinical benefit, investigation of whether this benefit represents not only a clinical but also a pharmacoeconomic improvement would be very useful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Structure of the Model</title><p>A decision model was developed to support the decision makers, with the aim of ensuring an optimum allocation of resources, and a discrete model was structured on the basis of a decision tree (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) that reconstructs the main results of the VO34.04 and VO53.06 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The VO34.04 study took the Average Rhino-conjunctivitis Total Symptom Score (ARTSS) as the primary endpoint and the Average Rescue Medication Score (ARMS) as the secondary endpoint, and also considered the Average Adjusted Symptom Score (AAdSS), an endpoint based on the previous two endpoints. The VO53.06 study took the AAdSS as primary endpoint. The ARTSS corresponds to the average number of daily symptoms (from 1 to 6) experienced along a range of severity of 0&#x02013;3, for a maximum total score of 18, whereas the ARMS attributes a score of 0&#x02013;3 to a patient&#x02019;s AR symptoms according to the type of rescue medication used. The AAdSS weighs the clinical endpoint for the consumption of symptomatic drugs, thus permitting classification of the trial results according to whether a patient has a low, medium, or high AAdSS. By expressing the effectiveness of SLIT directly in relation with the cost reduction associated with the consumption of symptomatic drugs, the AAdSS is particularly useful for indicating the effectiveness of 5-grass pollen tablets in terms of this reduction. It was also possible to verify the improvement in QoL by using the threshold resulting from the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] curve estimated in the VO34.04 trial. The ROC curve returns a level of sensitivity and specificity for a test carried out on a dichotomic variable. The sensitivity and specificity indicators can be used to estimate the reliability of a null hypothesis in probabilistic terms as a discrimination threshold is varied. In the VO34.04 trial, the null hypothesis tested the AAdSS not to result in QoL improvement, and the discrimination threshold for a probability of 50&#x000a0;% was proven to be AAdSS&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.45. In the decision model, the patients, all of whom presented with a low, medium, or high AAdSS in line with the distribution of cases presented in the VO34.04 trial, were assigned to either a 5-grass pollen tablet treatment group or a placebo treatment group. In each group, an improved or stable QoL corresponded to the treatment given to the group to which the patient was assigned. According to the results of the VO53.06 trial, this improvement occurred when the difference between the AAdSS scores in the 5-grass pollen tablet group before treatment and after treatment for 4&#x000a0;years, during which the patients were administered 5-grass pollen tablets for the first 3&#x000a0;years and simply followed up the remaining year, was more than 1.45 points.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Structure of the decision tree. <italic>AAdSS</italic> average adjusted symptom score, <italic>QOL</italic> quality of life</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40261_2013_67_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Perspective</title><p>The model was populated with effectiveness and cost indicators, with the latter reflecting the Italian National Health Service (SSN&#x02014;Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) perspective. To consider the results from a societal perspective in terms of the impact of AR on QoL and the performance of daily activities, including work tasks, productivity losses in terms of lost work days were evaluated using the human capital approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Effectiveness Estimate</title><p>The final endpoint was the difference in QoL with placebo, obtained from the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment in patients with a low, medium, or high AAdSS. The difference between the AAdSS for the 5-grass pollen tablets and the placebo (not administered with 5-grass pollen tablets but administered with symptomatic treatments) resulting from the VO34.04 and VO53.06 trials was converted in difference in QoL by using the discrimination threshold of AAdSS&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.45 resulting from the ROC curve, at which clinical improvement for adult patients may reflect an improvement in QoL in more than 50&#x000a0;% of cases.

Results are summarised in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the cost-effectiveness plane, which simulates the incremental costs and QALY resulting from the variation of the compliance, AAdSS, and costs characterised by the level of AAdSS, whereas Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> categorises the results of the simulation according to the corresponding ICER and assigns a probability to each scenario corresponding to variations in cost parameters and costs. The results indicate that in 99&#x000a0;% of cases, the cost-effectiveness ratio is below &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY, which is the maximum willingness-to-pay threshold considered sustainable from empirical observation of past decisions of the leading international regulatory agencies. The medium and high AAdSS CEAC in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> starts from 0.7 and 0.75, indicating that the cost-effectiveness ratio is dominant in 70&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% of cases with a medium or high AAdSS, whereas the low AAdSS CEAC starts from 0.67, indicating no improvement in patients with a low AAdSS despite increased treatment costs. In only 33&#x000a0;% of cases with low AAdSS is the ICER below the threshold of &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Cost-effectiveness ratio acceptability curve (CEAC). <italic>AAdSS</italic> average adjusted symptom score, <italic>ICER</italic> incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40261_2013_67_Fig3_HTML" id="MO5"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study estimated the cost-effectiveness ratio of the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment by comparison of the 5-grass pollen tablets treatment with placebo treatment based on a decision tree populated with hypothetical data. This assessment produced results that can be considered favourable from a sustainability point of view. The cost-effectiveness ratio acceptability curve based on the multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the cost-effectiveness ratio remains below the &#x02018;critical&#x02019; threshold of &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY in nearly all scenarios simulated. This study has several strengths that contribute to the robustness of these findings. First, the effectiveness data that were used to constitute the structure of the model were taken from a double-blind randomised controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Second, the use of the AAdSS as an effectiveness indicator permitted identification of a direct relationship between the outcome and the decrease in the consumption of resources (e.g. corticosteroids, diagnostic testing, etc.), which in part offsets the cost of 5-grass pollen tablets and thus makes a decisive contribution to the sustainability of NHS resources. Nevertheless, this study also faced several limitations. Although it used data derived from randomised controlled clinical trials, the model fits hypothetical scenarios. However, previous model-based studies of economic evaluation of AIT have provided significant findings in the understanding of the cost effectiveness of this treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite being estimated on the basis of the existence of a direct relationship between symptoms and the consumption of resources, the reliability of the cost-related part could be significantly improved if it were based on the resources actually consumed by patients using the microcosting method. Similarly, the utility coefficients, which were extrapolated using the ROC curve, could be measured directly by administering a questionnaire, such as the Euroqol (EQ&#x000a0;5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], to AR patients. In fact, the EQ5D appears to be particularly appropriate for assessing AR, as severe or moderate AR may be presumed to have an impact on the patient&#x02019;s ability to perform everyday activities (e.g. sport, work, etc.) and his/her psychological condition. It is also true that the multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis conducted on the deterministic results of the study gives a sufficient safety margin as to the sustainability of the cost-effectiveness ratio, which would presumably remain below the threshold of &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY in any case, even if the model was populated with real data and different discount rates (varied between 1.5 and 5&#x000a0;% in the sensitivity analysis) were used. In particular, the discount rate potentially appears be one of the most sensitive parameters as the time horizon is limited to 4&#x000a0;years. In this sense, this study provides added value with respect to the previous economic assessments of the use of SLIT vaccines to treat AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Of note, the finding that the cost effectiveness of 5-grass pollen tablet treatment increases with the severity of AR symptoms agrees with the findings of a recent report regarding the higher clinical efficacy of the 5-grass pollen tablet treatment in patients with more severe AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this analysis, the study centres were grouped into tertiles (low, middle, and high tertiles) according to the symptom severity scores observed in the placebo patients at each centre to assess the difference in the average score between the treatment and placebo groups in each tertile. The results indicated an increased treatment effect in the most severe patients, independent of the symptom score used, during pollen season. Of note, a recent study showed that the 5-grass pollen tablet is more cost-effective than the tablet containing only one grass, i.e. <italic>Phleum pratense</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This could be related to the fact that a 5-grass pollen preparation fits better with patient&#x02019;s sensitisation profile, as shown by laboratory studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and botanical observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and thus may result in higher clinical effectiveness.</p><p>Lastly, attention should be drawn to the need to examine the administration of SLIT from an organisational point of view. The results of the clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] used in the model show that the treatment is, in all cases, effective only when at a compliance rate of 75&#x000a0;% or greater. However, sensitivity analysis showed that increased levels of compliance result in an increase of the ICER which, anyway, remains under the &#x020ac; 30,000/QALY threshold even though a 100&#x000a0;% compliance is assumed. This percentage is clearly of fundamental importance for the NHS when considering the level of investment that will be remunerative in terms of health gains. Thus, awareness that treatment effectiveness depends on a high level of patient compliance and adherence, which could be achieved with adequate education both at the specialist allergy centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and by general practitioners when providing SLIT, must be a primary consideration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This analysis, performed using the optimal tools to estimate the cost effectiveness of a medical treatment, shows that the 5-grass pollen tablet is cost effective in adult patients with grass pollen-induced seasonal allergic rhinitis who have a medium or high average adjusted symptom score compared to standard drug treatment. This finding should be carefully considered when deciding the management strategy in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis, who, in contrast, are generally treated by symptomatic drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Prof. Americo Cicchetti, Dr Matteo Ruggeri, and Dr Marco Oradei for all analyses performed.</p><sec id="d30e979"><title><bold>Declaration of funding</bold></title><p>Stallergenes Italy sponsored the present study.</p></sec><sec id="d30e985"><title><bold>Declaration of financial/other relationships</bold></title><p>Ilaria Dell&#x02019;Albani, Franco Frati and Paola Puccinelli are employees of Stallergenes Italy.
