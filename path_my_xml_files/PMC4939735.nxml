Written informed consent include images relating to individual participants was obtained from each participant during a preoperative visit. We explained this is a single-blind study (i.e., subject unaware of group allocation until completion of the study). The study protocol is retrospectively registered with the Korean Clinical Trials Registry (KCT0001711).</p><p id="Par10">Between April 2014 and September 2014, patients between 18 and 80&#x000a0;years of age with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status score between I&#x02013;III and who required radial arterial catheterization for continuous blood pressure monitoring under general anesthesia, were enrolled. Patients with a history of atherosclerosis, hemorrhagic shock, morbid obesity, Raynaud&#x02019;s disease, or peripheral vascular disease were excluded. Subjects were allocated to either the bevel-up (bevel facing upwards) or bevel-down (bevel facing downwards) group by block randomization. Random numbers generated using a computer-generated randomization table were sealed in an opaque envelope. An operator with experience of more than 100 US-guided radial artery catheterization procedures performed the cannulation.</p><p id="Par11">Following induction of general anesthesia, radial arterial catheterization was performed. With the arm in supination, the wrist was extended over a roll with the hand dorsiflexed at 45&#x000b0;. An observer recorded the time taken (using a stopwatch) by the anesthesiologists to achieve successful US-guided radial artery catheterization. Following antiseptic preparation of the insertion site, an US probe connected to a US system (S-nerve&#x02122;; Sonosite, Bothell, WA, USA) was used to identify the radial artery in the short-axis view. Using a short-axis approach, a 20-gauge intravenous cannula (BD Angiocath Plus&#x02122;; Becton Dickinson Medical [S] Pte Ltd, Tuas, Singapore) was placed beneath the center of the transducer at an angle of 30&#x02013;45&#x000b0;; no local anesthetic was administered prior to catheterization. The puncture needle was inserted with the bevel facing upward in the bevel-up group, and downward in the bevel-down group. When the needle was inserted into a radial artery, an image of its tip appeared on the US screen as a dot within the lumen of the vessel (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Entry of the needle into the artery was indicated by adequate return of free-flowing arterial blood. The diameter (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) and depth of the artery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) (the latter defined as the distance from the skin to the outer wall of the artery) were measured from the US image.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The puncture needle is inserted perpendicular to the transducer (left image) and appears on theultrasound screen (right image) as a dot within the lumen of the radial artery</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12871_2016_202_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Failure of cannulation was defined as more than three attempts at cannulation, because of the possibility for numerous attempts.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">US-guided radial artery cannulation under the short-axis view was more successful on the first attempt using the bevel-down approach, which was also associated with reduced insertion time and posterior wall puncture. The effect of bevel direction under US-guided vascular access has not previously been investigated during radial artery catheterization. The bevel-down approach is associated with reduced posterior wall hematoma during internal jugular vein catheterization compared to the bevel-up approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The incidence of posterior wall puncture using the short-axis approach is reportedly between 31&#x000a0;% and 56&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] although in our study the incidence was lower. It appears that the bevel-down approach could facilitate the avoidance of posterior radial arterial wall injury during US-guided radial arterial catheterization. We suspect that a similar mechanism might be involved in arterial line cannulation. The average diameter of the radial artery is approximately 2.5&#x000a0;mm, while the bevel length at the distal end of the needle is 1.1&#x000a0;mm, with the needle tip cut obliquely at an acute angle. There appears to be insufficient space between the needle tip and posterior vessel wall. We speculate that sharp tips may be more likely to transfix the artery using the bevel-up approach.</p><p id="Par20">The long-axis approach affords improved visualization of the needle tip at the time of puncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is often difficult to maintain visualization of the needle tip when performing a procedure using the short axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, the short-axis approach, which was used in the present study, benefits from the fact that novice users can locate the vessel more easily and achieve vascular access more rapidly compared to the long-axis approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Users also rated the short-axis approach as being more straightforward, although not significantly. Several measures to increase the success rate of the short-axis approach have been suggested. These include using a visible marker (i.e., a suture on the midpoint of the US probe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Subcutaneous injection of saline also improves the success rate of the short-axis method in pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, such measures require additional interventions. We suggest that merely changing the bevel direction might improve the success rate and reduce the incidence of posterior wall hematoma. Moreover, our method can be applied to already-established techniques. Accidental hematoma of the posterior wall of the radial artery may occur due to other factors such as the ability of the operator, characteristics of ultrasound equipment, distance from needle entry to transducer, or other factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Further studies are necessary to prospectively compare complication rates, particularly posterior radial artery wall penetration, of both approaches during US-guided radial arterial catheterization.</p><p id="Par21">A limitation of our study was that the operator could not be blinded to the type of cannulation technique, which represents a possible source of bias. Still another potential limitation was that cannulation was performed by an experienced operator; results achieved might not be applicable to novice users. A third limitation was not including challenging cases, such as peripheral vascular disease patients due to concern of radial arterial catheterization related vascular infarct and thrombosis. All of these might prevent full generalization of our results. We also excluded the more difficult to catheterize patients such as those who were obese. Patients in shock or with low blood pressure were not included.</p><p id="Par22">A larger study population may be needed to demonstrate the benefit of using the bevel down approach during US-guided radial arterial catheterization for challenging cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par23">We conclude that the use of the bevel-down approach during US-guided radial artery cannulation under a short-axis view improves the first-attempt success rate compared to the bevel-up approach. The bevel-down technique is associated with reduced insertion time and posterior wall hematoma.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Abbreviations</title><p id="Par24">ASA, American society of anesthesiologist; BMI, body mass index; CI, confidence interval; IQR, interquartile range; US, ultrasound</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the study participants for their participation in this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par25">This study was supported by Inha University Hospital research grants.
