Specifically, the adolescent period is characterized by a strong increase in fear of negative social evaluation relative to a consistent decrease in general fears (Westenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). Furthermore, social phobia, the clinical form of social anxiety, typically has its onset in adolescence (age of onset between 10 and 16.6&#x000a0;years, Wittchen and Fehm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2003</xref>). The course of social phobia is chronic and it has been shown that the strongest predictor of recovery is late age of onset of social fears (DeWit et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1999</xref>), underscoring the need for (preventive) interventions directed at social fears in children and adolescents.</p><p>Cognitive models of anxiety propose that the tendency to interpret ambiguous information as threatening plays a causal role in the etiology and maintenance of pathological anxiety (Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1985</xref>). There is overwhelming evidence in adults that such threat-related interpretive biases and anxiety are related (Mathews and MacLeod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1994</xref>) and such evidence is accumulating in children and adolescents. Hadwin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1997</xref>), for example, revealed that anxiety is associated with threat-related interpretations in a non-selected (i. e. selection was not based on specific criteria) sample of children (7 to 9-years-old). B&#x000f6;gels and Zigterman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2000</xref>) showed that in a clinical sample, children and adolescents with an anxiety disorder (separation anxiety, social phobia, or generalized anxiety) interpreted ambiguous situations as more negative than children with externalizing problems (clinical control group) or a non-clinical control group (mean age entire sample&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.5&#x000a0;years). The role of a negative interpretive bias regarding <italic>social</italic> information in <italic>socially anxious</italic> adolescents has also been demonstrated; high socially anxious adolescents (mean age 13.6&#x000a0;years) interpreted short scenarios regarding social interactions as more negative than adolescents with an average level of social anxiety (Miers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>). This relationship between threat-related interpretive bias and childhood anxiety tends to be moderated by age; interpretive bias seems to be associated with anxiety in older children (above 11&#x000a0;years), but less so in younger children (Cannon and Weems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Weems et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>). The evidence for the influence of gender on the relationship between interpretive bias and anxiety is more mixed. While several studies have shown that gender did not moderate the link between interpretive bias and anxiety (Leitenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1986</xref>; Weems et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>), a recent study showed that interpretive bias was significantly related to anxiety disorder status for females, but not for males (Cannon and Weems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>).</p><p>It is assumed that this threat-related interpretive bias is not an incidental epiphenomenon of anxiety, but that it plays a causal role in the maintenance and the development of an anxiety disorder (Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1985</xref>; Muris and Field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). While correlational studies presented above confirmed the relationship between interpretive bias and anxiety, studies with a pure experimental design are necessary to confirm the <italic>causal</italic> relationship. In adults, there is now sound empirical evidence that a threat-related interpretive bias can causally influence anxiety. Mathews and Mackintosh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>) developed a Cognitive Bias Modification procedure to modify interpretations (CBM-I) in adults. Participants read short ambiguous social scenarios that ended with a word fragment requiring solution. Correct solution of the fragment disambiguated the story either positively or negatively, depending on the assigned condition. In this way, participants in the positive CBM-I condition were trained to impose positive interpretations on ambiguous information, while participants in the negative condition were trained to interpret such information in a negative way. The computer program proved to be successful in modifying interpretive biases and subsequent effects on anxiety were observed, providing evidence consistent with a causal link between interpretive bias and anxiety. It appears to be a robust finding, as the effects have been replicated several times in adult samples of unselected individuals (Holmes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007b</xref>) and effects have been observed on interpretive bias 24&#x000a0;h later (Yiend et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2005</xref>). The ability to modify threat-related interpretive biases with effects on anxiety not only has important theoretical implications (causality), but also important clinical implications. In adults, it has been shown that training individuals with high levels of anxiety to interpret ambiguous information in a positive way using CBM-I reduced their negative interpretive bias and associated self-reported anxious feelings (Mathews et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>; Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>).</p><p>There are three recent studies that have examined modification of interpretive bias in <italic>children</italic> (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>; Vassilopoulos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Children in Muris et al.&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>) study completed a computer game &#x0201c;Space odyssey&#x0201d; that consisted of an imaginary journey to an unknown planet. During the journey they encountered different ambiguous situations that can be interpreted in a positive or negative way. Children in the positive training condition received reinforcement for choosing positive outcomes, whereas children in the negative training condition received reinforcement for choosing negative outcomes. Results revealed that interpretive bias was successfully modified using this CBM-I procedure and that increase in negative interpretations was particularly pronounced in children with high levels of anxiety (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). These CBM-I effects in children were later replicated, without replicating the moderating effects of pre-training anxiety (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). In addition, training affected avoidance tendencies; children in the negative training condition placed themselves further away from new situations and objects on a map depicting the new planet. This suggests generalization of the trained interpretive bias, which is interesting, as there are inconsistent findings regarding generalization to other tasks and domains in adults (Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010a</xref>). Note however that effects on anxiety were not investigated and changes in interpretations were quite small (partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05). The latter could possibly be due to the relative young age of these children (first study: 10.0&#x000a0;years; second study: 10.7&#x000a0;years), as negative interpretive biases appear to be related to anxiety in older children (&#x0003e;11&#x000a0;years, Cannon and Weems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). Vassilopoulos et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>) selected high socially anxious children, who were trained over three sessions to endorse positive rather than negative interpretations. Again it was shown that CBM-I training was successful in changing interpretations, and, more importantly, children in the training condition showed reduced trait social anxiety. Taken together, these findings in children are promising with regard to the modification of interpretations and effects on anxiety.</p><p>The goal of the current study was to examine whether CBM-I can modify interpretations and anxiety in adolescents. CBM-I is a computerized training to modify threat-related interpretive biases that has proven to be effective in adults and promising in children. In the current study, CBM-I was applied to adolescents, as adolescence is characterized by a sharp increase is social anxiety (Westenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>) and specifically in this age period, anxiety is associated with threat-related interpretive biases (Cannon and Weems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). The first aim was to examine whether CBM-I can modify threat-related interpretations in adolescents. Therefore, adolescents were randomly allocated to either a positive CBM-I condition to learn to interpret ambiguous social information in a more positive way or to a placebo-control condition. The second aim was to examine generalization of the modified interpretive bias to a new task containing new stimuli. A recognition task was presented before and after CBM-I to examine generalization of the trained interpretive bias. The third aim was to examine factors that might influence CBM-I effects. As previous research with children has shown that level of anxiety could moderate the effects of training (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>), pre-training levels of trait anxiety and interpretive bias were assessed. The final aim was to examine the effects of CBM-I on state anxiety.</p><p>It was hypothesized that 1) following training, adolescents in the positive condition would interpret ambiguous information significantly more positive and less negative than adolescents in the placebo-control condition, when controlling for age and gender. It was also hypothesized that 2) trained interpretive bias would generalize to a new task and 3) that pre-training level of trait anxiety and interpretive bias would moderate the effects of training. Lastly, 4) we predicted that adolescents in the positive training condition would feel less anxious following training than adolescents in the placebo-control condition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The current study had no inclusion or exclusion criteria and all adolescents from a class level were invited to participate. The sample consisted of 170 adolescents (79 boys and 91 girls) drawn from a public secondary school (two education levels: &#x0201c;havo&#x0201d;: senior general secondary education and &#x0201c;vwo&#x0201d;: pre-university education) in the Netherlands. Adolescents ranged in age from 14&#x02013;16&#x000a0;years (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.5, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5) and 98.2% was born in the Netherlands. The study was approved by University of Amsterdam&#x02019;s Ethical Committee (Department of Developmental Psychology) and passive informed parental consent was obtained for all participating adolescents.</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to either the positive CBM-I (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;88) or the placebo-control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;82) condition. For ethical reasons, the positive training condition was not compared to a negative training condition. Due to technical difficulties (losing connection with the server that ran E-prime), the computer program sometimes stopped, resulting in lost data. Twelve participants were lost between the start of the experiment and the end of CBM-I, resulting in 158 adolescents who finished the complete CBM-I program and the post-training state anxiety assessment (81 participants in the positive training condition and 77 in the placebo control condition). In total, 144 adolescents completed the second recognition task, thus generalisability effects were analyzed for these 144 participants (75 participants in the positive training condition and 69 in the placebo control condition).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Materials</title><p><bold>CBM-I</bold> A social scenario-based training was used to modify interpretive bias (Mathews and Mackintosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>). Dutch scenarios that were successfully used in previous experiments with non-selected adults (Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007b</xref>) were modified to reflect social situations that are relevant for young adolescents. A small pilot study confirmed the age appropriateness of the scenarios. The training consisted of five blocks of 10 scenarios that were presented on a personal computer. In each block, participants in the positive CBM-I group received eight positive modification scenarios and two probe scenarios, while participants in the placebo-control condition received four valenced scenarios (two positive and two negative), four neutral scenarios, and two probe scenarios. The modification scenarios were created to train participants to make a positive emotional interpretation of an initially ambiguous social situation. Each scenario consisted of three lines that were ambiguous in terms of valence. In the final sentence, a word was left out of the sentence. After disappearance of the scenario, the omitted word was presented as a word fragment and disambiguated the scenario in a positive way. Participants were instructed to press a spacebar when they felt they knew what the word was, and then to press the key corresponding to the first missing letter. This ensured that the time taken to respond to the word was not contaminated by variance in the time taken to locate the correct letter key. The computer program only continued when a correct response was given. Following the solution of the word fragment, a comprehension question appeared that could extend to future emotional implications beyond those actually stated in the scenario. Participants answered the question by pressing Y for <italic>yes</italic> and N for <italic>no</italic>. They subsequently received feedback (<italic>correct</italic> vs. <italic>wrong answer</italic>) to reinforce the interpretation. An example of a modification scenario, with the completed word fragment in parentheses, is as follows:<disp-quote><p>You are working on a school assignment with some other</p><p>children at your house. You turn on your favorite music</p><p>and based on their reactions, you understand that they</p><p>...... your choice of music.</p><p>l-ke (like)</p></disp-quote>Then the comprehension fragment followed:<disp-quote><p>Did your friends approve of your choice of music?</p></disp-quote></p><p>Participants in the placebo-control condition received two positive and two negative scenarios. In the negative variant of the previous example, participants would for example receive &#x02018;disl-ke&#x02019; (dislike). Participants in this placebo-control condition also received neutral scenarios that had no emotional content, nor did they contain any ambiguity. An example is as follows:<disp-quote><p>After the summer holidays, you are going back to school.</p><p>As you arrive, you cannot help noticing</p><p>that the outside of the school has been</p><p>pa-nt-d (painted)</p><p>Has your school changed its appearance?</p></disp-quote></p><p><bold>Test of Interpretive Bias: Reaction Times</bold> Probe scenarios were included in the training procedure to assess change in interpretation style. Probe scenarios were also three-lines in length and described an initially ambiguous situation. However, both groups received the same probe scenarios with the same word fragments; one positive and one negative valenced word fragment per block, resulting in a total of five positive and five negative probes. The speed of correctly resolving these probe word fragments was the dependent measure (CBM-I effects on interpretive bias).</p><p><bold>Test of Generalization: Recognition Test</bold> To assess generalization of modified interpretive bias to a new task containing new scenarios, participants completed a recognition task before and after CBM-I. Each task consisted of two parts with part two being the actual assessment of interpretive bias. In part one, seven ambiguous social scenarios were presented (different scenarios were used for the pre- and post-training test). Each scenario had a title and consisted of three lines. A word was missing in the final sentence that was presented as a word fragment after pressing the space bar. Again, participants were asked to complete the fragment as quickly as possible, yet the valence of the story remained ambiguous. Afterwards, a comprehension question with relevant feedback appeared on the screen and participants were asked to answer the question.In the second part of the recognition test, participants saw the title of the ambiguous scenario, this time together with two interpretations of the scenario; a positive interpretation and negative interpretation. Participants rated each sentence independently for its similarity in meaning to the original scenario (presented in part one). A 4-point scale was used, ranging from 1 (<italic>very different</italic>) to 4 (<italic>very similar</italic>). Endorsement of positive versus negative interpretations in this second part was the dependent measure (generalization of CBM-I effects to the recognition task).</p><p><bold>Anxiety Assessment</bold> As previous studies with adults observed effects of interpretation training on state anxiety (a transitory anxious state) assessed with the Spielberger State Trait Inventory (STAI, Mathews et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>; Mathews and Mackintosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>), state anxiety in the current study was assessed with the Dutch State version of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (ZBV-K, Bakker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1989</xref>; STAI-C, Spielberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1973</xref>). Pre-training level of trait anxiety (the stable tendency to react with anxious feelings to a stressful situation) was assessed with the Dutch Trait version of the STAI-C (Bakker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1989</xref>; Spielberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1973</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment took place in the school&#x02019;s computer room. Participants were informed about the procedure and that specific task instructions would appear on the computer screen. The computer-program (E-prime version 2.0) presented the STAI-C trait and state questionnaire first. Participants then completed the first recognition task.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> Afterwards, they were randomly assigned to either the positive CBM-I condition or the placebo-control condition. Participants were specifically instructed to imagine themselves in each of the presented situations. An option for rest was given after each block, resulting in four short breaks. After CBM-I, participants completed the STAI-C state for the second time and completed the second recognition task. At the end of testing, participants were debriefed. The session took approximately 45&#x000a0;min.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Correlational Analyses</title><p>We examined the relationship between interpretive bias, anxiety, gender, and age (assessed before CBM-I) using correlational analyses (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;158, see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A pre-training interpretive bias index was calculated by subtracting mean similarity scores of positive interpretations from mean similarity scores of negative interpretations, with positive scores indicating a threat-related interpretive bias. Results indicated that interpretive bias scores were positively associated with trait and state anxiety, revealing that, consistent with previous findings, higher levels of anxiety were associated with a stronger threat-related interpretive bias. In addition, gender was significantly correlated with trait and state anxiety; females reported more state and trait anxious feelings. Furthermore, gender was also significantly correlated with pre-training interpretive bias; girls had stronger threat-related interpretations than boys. When directly comparing male and female adolescents, it was shown that female adolescents felt significantly more state and trait anxious than males, respectively <italic>t</italic>(149)&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006, <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5 (state anxiety girls <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30.4, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.7 vs. boys <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28.8, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.6) and <italic>t</italic>(156)&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.0, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6 (trait anxiety girls <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31.5, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.3 vs. boys <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27.8, <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.5).

The adolescent age period is associated with an increase in social anxiety (Westenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>) and it has been argued that interpretive biases play a causal role in (social) anxiety (Beck et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1985</xref>; Muris and Field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Indeed, there is empirical support that interpretive biases causally influence anxiety in adults (Mathews and Mackintosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>), while in children it has been shown that expectancy (interpretive) biases predict anxiety symptoms (Warren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2000</xref>). The results of the present study showed that it is possible to modify interpretations of ambiguous social situations in a more positive direction in unselected adolescents. Adolescents trained to interpret information more positively were significantly quicker in solving positive solutions of ambiguity than adolescents in the placebo-control condition. In addition, when confronted with new ambiguous information presented in a new task, adolescents who followed the CBM-I training interpreted this information more positively and less negatively than adolescents in the control condition. This suggests that the trained interpretive bias generalized to a new task. Subsequent analyses revealed that the CBM-I training was especially effective in adolescents who had a negative interpretive bias. Gender did not moderate the effects of training, which is consistent with earlier findings from CBM-I studies with children (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; Vassilopoulos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Meanwhile, gender was associated with both anxiety and interpretive bias; female adolescents were more anxious and had a stronger tendency to interpret ambiguity negatively than male adolescents (see also Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). Note, that no CBM-I training effects were observed on state anxiety.</p><p>The results concerning the successful modification of interpretations in adolescents are in line with previous findings in unselected children (Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>) and unselected adults (Mathews and Mackintosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>). As no effects on state anxiety were observed, state dependent mood effects are an unlikely explanation for the differential effects on interpretations. The finding that the more vulnerable individuals were especially affected by the modification procedure is also consistent with Muris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>; but see Muris et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>). However, vulnerable children (i.e. highly anxious) in Muris et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>) were more affected by the <italic>negative</italic> interpretive bias training; they acquired a stronger negative interpretive bias than low anxious children. Note that the current findings paint a more positive picture for vulnerable adolescents; adolescents with a pre-training threat-related bias were more affected by the <italic>positive</italic> training than adolescents without a threat-related bias. This is a promising finding in the light of potential application of CBM-I in clinically anxious adolescents. It seems that individuals at risk (either highly anxious or characterized by a negative interpretive bias) are more susceptible to anxiety-relevant influences. While in a context that encourages threat-related cognitions, their malleability might result in stronger maladaptive threat-related cognitions, in a context that encourages non-threatening cognitions, their malleability might result in stronger adaptive cognitions. This line of reasoning is consistent with recent theorizing (differential susceptibility model, Belsky <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>) and gene by environment interaction studies showing that certain children are more affected, both for better and for worse, by their environments (Belsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2007</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, CBM-I effects were observed on a recognition task, indicating that the trained interpretive bias generalized to a new task containing new ambiguous stimuli. This is important as it shows that adolescents did not learn a task-specific strategy or a task-specific interpretation style, but that a more general interpretive style was acquired that influenced the processing of new ambiguous information. While the recognition task differs from the training procedure in several aspects, there is also overlap. In both tasks, ambiguous scenarios are presented, explicitly, in a written format, and with sentences appearing one by one. The observed effects on the recognition task could therefore be seen as evidence of close generalization. Future research is necessary to examine whether far generalization of the trained interpretive bias can be observed. Interpretive bias tasks that deviate more from the training procedure could be included in future studies; for example using more visual, pictorial stimuli as faces or film fragments (Amir et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>), or real life social interaction (Voncken and B&#x000f6;gels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, no effects of CBM-I were observed on state anxiety. The positively trained adolescents were not less state anxious after training than the adolescents in the placebo-control condition. This is inconsistent with some of the earlier CBM-I studies in unselected adults (Mathews and Mackintosh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2000</xref>; Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2007b</xref>; Yiend et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2005</xref>, Exp 1). However, there are also studies failing to observe the effects on state anxiety in unselected adults (Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2007a</xref>; Yiend et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2005</xref>, Exp. 3). Several explanations for the lack of CBM-I effects on state anxiety can be offered in relation to limitations of the current study. First, absence of CBM-I effects on state anxiety might be related to the fact that state anxiety was assessed with the STAI-C questionnaire, which is a general measure of anxious feelings and sensations. As the training targeted dysfunctional thoughts regarding social situations, the content of training does not match the content of the questionnaire. A match between the training (social anxiety) and the questionnaire could be achieved by measuring specifically social anxiety (for example with the Social Anxiety Scales for children and adolescents (SAS, La Greca <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1998</xref>).</p><p>Second, the lack of CBM-I effects on state anxiety could also be related to the distinction between the concepts of state anxiety and trait anxiety/anxiety vulnerability. Mediation analyses of CBM-I effects have revealed that altered interpretive bias was related to changes in trait anxiety, while the altered interpretive bias was not related to changes in state anxiety (Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2010b</xref>). This suggests that it is important to examine CBM-I effects on trait anxiety and not (only) state anxiety. As trait anxiety has been conceptualized as the tendency to react anxiously to a stressor (Bakker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1989</xref>; Spielberger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1973</xref>), including a stress task containing ambiguity after CBM-I might reveal differential mood effects. Support for this hypothesis has been observed in adults (Mackintosh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2006</xref>; Wilson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2006</xref>). Participants received a stress task following CBM-I. The stress task consisted of different video clips depicting real-life rescue operations that contained ambiguity, as the outcome of the event remained ambiguous until a clip&#x02019;s final seconds. Results revealed that in both studies, exposure to positive training was associated with less increase in anxiety in response to viewing the stressful accident videos. This is corroborated by findings from cognitive bias modification of attentional bias showing that such a training did not affect state anxiety directly in unselected individuals, but affected stress vulnerability (for children see Eldar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; for adults see Macleod et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>).</p><p>Third, the lack of CBM-I effects on state anxiety might be related to the role of imagery. Research has shown that mental imagery plays an important role in information processing and emotions (Holmes and Mathews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2005</xref>; Holmes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>). In the current study, participants were instructed to imagine the described situations. However the instructions were minimal and there was no practice in vividly imagining the scenarios. Increasing the use of imagery during CBM-I training might be relevant to obtain effects on anxiety (cf. Lothmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>).</p><p>Fourth, participants were unselected adolescents with an average level of anxious feelings (mean STAI-C trait and state scores between 4th and 6th decile). Compared to highly anxious adolescents, there is less room for CBM-I to reduce anxious feelings. Future studies might add, on the one hand, an assessment of positive emotions and self-esteem as positive CBM training might be associated with an increase in positive feelings (Dandeneau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>), and on the other hand, CBM-I training might be applied to highly anxious adolescents or clinically anxious adolescents who have higher levels of anxiety and interpretive bias and therefore more room for improvement in both cognitions and mood (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>; Vassilopoulos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). In addition, participants received a single session of interpretation training. Multiple sessions of training spaced over several days might be necessary for anxiolytic effects to occur (Mathews et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>; Salemink et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Vassilopoulos et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>). Future studies could examine the effects of multiple sessions of training and examine the duration of the training effects. The inclusion of booster sessions might optimize effects when results show that effects diminish over time.</p><p>Finally, the absence of training effects on anxiety could also be due to the possibility that in adolescents interpretations are not causally related to anxiety (see for example Alfano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref> for divergent findings regarding the role of cognitions in childhood anxiety). Future research is necessary to investigate more closely the (causal) relationship between anxiety and cognitions in adolescents.</p><p>In sum, CBM-I was successful in modifying interpretations in unselected adolescents and stronger effects were observed in individuals who had a threat-related interpretive bias at pre-test. These findings are promising when considering training adolescents at risk or adolescents with a clinical diagnosis to interpret ambiguity more positively. Future prevention and intervention trials are necessary to test the long-term clinical and preventative effects of the CBM-I training more rigorously. Note that on-line versions of the training could be developed that could contribute to the problem of long waiting lists and individuals who avoid seeking treatment due to shame or fear of stigmatization. Such a technological innovation could have 24/7 availability and has the potential to be widely disseminated in a way that just is not possible with other types of prevention or intervention programs. However, future studies are required to examine the effects of CBM-I on mood and vulnerability as no effects were observed on state anxiety in the current study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are grateful to Mari&#x000eb;lle Wullaert for help with collecting the data used in this study.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alfano</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Beidel</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cognition in childhood anxiety: conceptual, methodological, and developmental issues</article-title><source>Clinical Psychology Review</source><year>2002</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>1209</fpage><lpage>1238</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0272-7358(02)00205-2</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12436811</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amir</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Beard</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bower</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Interpretation bias and social anxiety</article-title><source>Cognitive Therapy and Research</source><year>2005</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>433</fpage><lpage>443</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/s10608-005-2834-5</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bakker</surname><given-names>FC</given-names></name><name><surname>Wieringen</surname><given-names>PCW</given-names></name><name><surname>Ploeg</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Spielberger</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name></person-group><source>Handleiding bij de Zelfbeoordelings Vragenlijst voor Kinderen (ZBV-K).
