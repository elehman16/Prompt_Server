Subjects of the original POWER PE trial (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;99) were contacted and asked to undergo retesting three years after cessation of the intervention. All original measures were completed including: sitting height, standing height, weight, calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), whole body, hip and spine bone mineral content (BMC), lean tissue mass, and fat mass. Physical activity was recorded with the bone-specific physical activity questionnaire (BPAQ) and calcium intake was estimated with a calcium-focussed food questionnaire. Maturity was determined by Tanner staging and estimation of the age of peak height velocity (PHV). Twenty-nine adolescents aged 17.3&#x000b1;0.4 years agreed to participate. Three years after the intervention, there were no differences in subject characteristics between control and intervention groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). Three-year change in weight, lean mass, and fat mass were similar between groups (p&#x0003e;0.05). There were no significant group differences in three-year change in BUA or BMC at any site (p&#x0003e;0.05), although the between-group difference in femoral neck BMC at follow-up exceeded the least significant change. While significant group differences were not observed three years after cessation of the intervention, changes in bone parameters occurred in parallel for intervention and control groups such that the original benefits of the intervention observed within the treatment group were sustained.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is well recognised that efforts to prevent osteoporosis are likely to be more successful and economical than attempting to manage and rehabilitate fragility fractures. Childhood and adolescence are recognised as especially opportune times to intervene in order to maximise peak bone mass and strength during growth with the view to offset age-related loss. Many pediatric exercise interventions have elicited significant musculoskeletal benefits <xref rid="pone.0039133-Fuchs1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-McKay1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Heinonen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Stear1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Witzke1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-MacKelvie1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Whether those benefits are sustained in the longer term has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>The <italic>Preventing Osteoporosis With Exercise Regimes in Physical Education</italic> (POWER PE) trial was an 8-month in-school jumping intervention for adolescent boys and girls (mean age 13.8 years). Participants in the intervention group performed a regime of jumping activities for 10 minutes at the start of each physical education (PE) class, twice per week for the course of a school year. Controls undertook their usual low intensity PE warm-up. Sex-specific improvements in bone accrual were observed in jumpers, but not controls. Specifically, boys increased whole body bone mineral content (BMC) and calcaneal broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA), and girls improved BMC at the femoral neck and spine <xref rid="pone.0039133-Weeks1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Favourable changes in body composition were also observed <xref rid="pone.0039133-Weeks2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>Longitudinal observational data exists to support a relationship between childhood physical activity and bone mass in later life <xref rid="pone.0039133-VanLangendonck1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>; however, very long term re-examination of experimental cohorts to examine maintenance of skeletal benefits into old age are required if causal inferences are to be made. As trials involving such long term monitoring from childhood into old age have limited feasibility, medium-term re-examination is the only practical alternative.

In fact, only very few studies have examined whether exercise benefits to the pediatric skeleton are sustained to any degree after cessation of an exercise intervention. Our goal, therefore, was to determine if the positive bone, muscle and fat changes from an eight-month, in-school, adolescent, jumping intervention were sustained three-years after cessation of the activity. Consequently, although the original skeletal improvements at the hip, spine, whole body, and calcaneus in the jumping group were sustained, group differences did not reach significance at 44 months. Of note, a trend for greater accumulation of fat was observed in controls at 44 months.</p><p>Previous pediatric exercise interventions have predominantly targeted prepubertal children, to the extent that very little adolescent data has been reported. Given the reported relationship of physical activity and bone to maturity <xref rid="pone.0039133-Weeks5" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, examination of exercise effects in older children was warranted. The POWER PE trial <xref rid="pone.0039133-Weeks1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> was designed to specifically target peripubertal adolescents.</p><p>Some evidence suggests that the osteogenic benefits of exercise in childhood can be sustained at the femoral neck <xref rid="pone.0039133-Fuchs2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Gunter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, lumbar spine <xref rid="pone.0039133-Gunter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and tibia <xref rid="pone.0039133-Binkley1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The examination of only short duration (i.e. one year) maintenance <xref rid="pone.0039133-Fuchs2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, prepubertal cohorts <xref rid="pone.0039133-Binkley1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Fuchs2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0039133-Gunter1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, and single sex participants <xref rid="pone.0039133-Kontulainen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, however, limit the generalizability of those observations. A single trial has examined maintenance of skeletal changes in an adolescent cohort of girls. Those data indicated that lumbar spine bone gains following a nine-month jumping intervention were maintained for 12 months <xref rid="pone.0039133-Kontulainen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Our data provides additional evidence that 1) the skeletal benefits of brief jumping bouts during adolescence may endure for at least three years, 2) trends are also evident at the femoral neck and whole body, and 3) the effect is apparent when inclusive of boys and girls. While a group-by-time main effect could not be detected (likely due to low subject numbers), we found that the greater absolute values of bone mass attained by jumpers than controls immediately post intervention were sustained by a paralleling of bone growth trajectories during the following three years. Notably, our results show that the apparent maintenance effect endures from the time of peak height velocity until a time nearing the achievement of peak height.</p><p>Despite the known inadequacies of BMI as an index of body composition or fatness, we chose to include it as an outcome measure for the purpose of comparison with others' work. While waist circumference is a better predictor of obesity-related disease than BMI or weight <xref rid="pone.0039133-Janssen1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, BMI has nevertheless been associated with coronary heart disease <xref rid="pone.0039133-Rexrode1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, metabolic syndrome <xref rid="pone.0039133-Katzmarzyk1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and progression of osteoarthritis of the knee <xref rid="pone.0039133-Reijman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Although there was no significant between-group difference in BMI at 44 months, a trend for lower BMI in jumpers was observed, reflecting perhaps a divergent pattern of lean and fat tissue development between groups following the intervention.</p><p>That positive skeletal changes were observed in the original POWER PE trial suggests the window of opportunity for eliciting bone benefits during childhood remains open well into puberty. Given that peak bone mass is typically achieved in the third decade life, it is possible that the temporal opportunity to enhance skeletal strength may be greater than is generally accepted. In fact, we have previously shown that calcaneal BUA of young adult men maintains an upward trajectory through 25 years of age <xref rid="pone.0039133-Weeks6" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Utilising exercise then to optimise peak bone mass remains a potentially effective strategy into young adulthood. Although some data exists, it has not been definitively established if late uptake of exercise in young adulthood can be notably osteogenic, nor whether any such late onset bone gains would be maintained over the long term.</p><p>The primary study limitation to be acknowledged is the considerable subject drop-out between 8-month and final 44-month measures. As is typical during long-term randomised controlled trials, participant relocations and loss of interest accounted for the majority of loss. There were no difference in baseline characteristics between subjects who dropped out and those who returned for three-year retesting. The issue was managed statistically with the use of intention to treat analysis and the imputation of missing values. Unlike our original study, our remaining sample size was not sufficient to explore sex-specific outcomes and thus, our investigation was based on a group analysis only.</p><p>In conclusion, while between-group differences were not significant at 44 months, our findings suggest that osteogenic benefits of an 8-month in-school jumping intervention for adolescents can be sustained for at least three years (into young adulthood) and that positive trends in fat tissue mass may also occur. Furthermore, those trends can be achieved from a very simple, twice-weekly 10 minute intervention amenable to high school implementation with no disruption to existing physical education activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the staff and students at Pacific Pines State High School for their commitment to and participation in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Competing Interests: </bold>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>The study was supported by an Arthritis Australia Grant-in-Aid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arthritisaustralia.com.au">www.arthritisaustralia.com.au</ext-link>).
