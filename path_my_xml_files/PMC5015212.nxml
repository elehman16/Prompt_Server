In many such settings, including Malawi, the high burden of disease and severe shortage of skilled healthcare workers has led to task-shifting of outpatient TB care to lay health workers (LHWs). LHWs improve access to healthcare and some outcomes, including TB completion rates, but lack of training and supervision limit their impact. The goals of this study are to improve TB care provided by LHWs in Malawi by refining, implementing, and evaluating a knowledge translation strategy designed to address a recognized gap in LHWs&#x02019; TB and job-specific knowledge and, through this, to improve patient outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are employing a mixed-methods design that includes a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial and a process evaluation using qualitative methods. Trial participants will include all health centers providing TB care in four districts in the South East Zone of Malawi. The intervention employs educational outreach, a point-of-care reminder tool, and a peer support network. The primary outcome is proportion of treatment successes, defined as the total of TB patients cured or completing treatment, with outcomes taken from Ministry of Health treatment records. With an alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80, a baseline treatment success of 0.80, intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.1 based on our pilot study, and an estimated 100 clusters (health centers providing TB care), a minimum of 6 patients per cluster is required to detect a clinically significant 0.10 increase in the proportion of treatment successes. Our process evaluation will include interviews with LHWs and patients, and a document analysis of LHW training logs, quarterly peer trainer meetings, and mentorship meeting notes. An estimated 10&#x02013;15 LHWs and 10&#x02013;15 patients will be required to reach saturation in each of 2 planned interview periods, for a total of 40&#x02013;60 interview participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will directly inform the efforts of knowledge users within TB care and, through extension of the approach, other areas of care provided by LHWs in Malawi and other low- and middle-income countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrails.gov/ct2/show/NCT02533089?term=NCT02533089&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02533089</ext-link>.

Task-shifting of less complex healthcare tasks to lay health workers (LHWs) is increasingly employed to address this shortage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite the availability of effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality, with 9.6 million people falling ill and 1.5 million lives lost globally due to TB in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The greatest proportion of new TB cases is in Africa, and over 95&#x000a0;% of TB deaths occur in low-income countries (LICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In response to the high TB burden and severe healthcare worker shortages in these settings, outpatient TB care is among the tasks commonly shifted to LHWs.</p><p>LHWs are community members who have received some training but are not healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Randomized trials show that LHWs improve access to basic health services and TB treatment outcomes by providing care and adherence support in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, insufficient training and supervision are recognized barriers to LHWs&#x02019; effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. LHW training is typically conducted off-site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], an approach that is expensive in both direct and opportunity costs due to disruption in care provision and thus limits training. Given their relative low cost and proven effectiveness, educational outreach and reminder knowledge translation (KT) strategies offer a promising solution to addressing LHW training needs by increasing incorporation of best evidence into LHW practice.</p><p>Malawi has among the lowest healthcare worker to population ratios, with 1.9 physicians and 28.3 nurses/midwives per 100,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In response to this severe health worker shortage, Malawi scaled up its LHW cadre to &#x0003e;10,000. As the primary providers of outpatient TB care, LHWs have a pivotal role in addressing the high TB burden in Malawi, with 17,723 new TB notifications in 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In spite of ongoing efforts, poor treatment adherence remains an important contributor to the high TB burden in Malawi, with treatment completion rates ranging from 58&#x000a0;% to 70&#x000a0;% in our recent study in Zomba District [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Despite their critical role, LHWs (termed <italic>health surveillance assistants</italic> [HSAs] in Malawi) in our recent study identified lack of disease- and job-specific training as the key barriers to their role as TB care providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The aims of this project are to address this knowledge-to-action gap by refining, implementing, and evaluating a KT strategy designed to improve LHW TB knowledge and counseling skills and, through this, to improve both TB care provided by LHWs and TB outcomes.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>Our goal is to improve TB care provided by LHWs in Malawi by refining, implementing, and evaluating a KT strategy designed to facilitate incorporation of evidence into routine LHW practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific objectives</title><p>The specific objectives of our research are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Improve TB outcomes by implementing and evaluating a KT strategy developed and tested by our group to address an identified gap in care provided by LHWs in Malawi</p></list-item><list-item><p>Identify barriers to and facilitators of scalability and sustainability of this KT strategy, as well as its potential to address other gaps in care provided by LHWs</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>We will use a mixed-methods design that includes (1) a multicenter, pragmatic, cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention and (2) a process evaluation employing qualitative methods including interviews with LHW participants and patients, as well as a document analysis of training logs, quarterly peer trainer meetings, and mentorship meeting notes, to gain an understanding of barriers to and facilitators of the implementation, scalability, and sustainability of the intervention.

This project will include all health centers (HCs) providing TB care among the 109 HCs in 4 of the 6 districts in which DI operates, excluding the district included in our preliminary study and an additional district that declined to participate. As TB care is provided at HCs on a rotating basis, patients receive care from several LHWs during treatment. Given this system of care, a cluster RCT (with allocation at the HC level) was chosen to prevent contamination. HCs will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio based on a superiority framework using a computer-generated random number list prepared by a study team member without knowledge of the districts or HCs themselves, and they will be allocated by a second study team member. Once generated, the randomization information will be provided to a second study team member who will assign HCs as intervention or control sites by applying the random number list to the HC list provided by the district health offices. Randomization will be stratified by district, HC funding (MOH-funded vs non-MOH-funded), and HC designation as a priority site for support and mentorship. These stratification variables are chosen to address district-level variations in operationalization of TB policy and the potential for LHWs at priority sites to receive additional clinical training relevant to TB care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Tuberculosis-focused lay health workers (TBLHWs) at participating HCs will be contacted by the DI district office in collaboration with the MOH district health offices. TBLHWs are general LHWs who receive 2&#x000a0;weeks of additional TB training and are responsible for TB care at the HC level. TBLHWs were selected as peer trainers by the MOH on the basis of their status and responsibilities as the local heads of TB care. In our previous work, we found TBLHWs to be effective in this role, as they were seen as experts by general LHWs, particularly after they were trained and had assumed the role of peer trainer. All LHWs routinely providing TB care will be eligible and invited to participate in the training, with refusal to participate being the only exclusion criterion. HCs and TBLHWs will be enrolled by the study coordinator (SC).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The trial will include all HCs providing TB care among the 109 HCs in 4 of 6 districts in which DI operates, excluding the district in which the pilot study was conducted and another district that declined to participate.

The LHW side provides a reminder to trigger an adherence discussion during patient interactions and supports side effect management and constructive approaches to addressing nonadherence. On the basis of our earlier work and heuristic testing, minor changes were made to the tool and a drug-dosing reference was added to it. Usability testing was then conducted with the tool to further refine it before implementation. This involved two cycles of iterative testing, each with three or four participants, including both previously trained LHWs and LHWs not previously trained with the original tool. As no appropriate patients were available at either HC during usability testing, participants were asked to role-play using the tool, with other HSAs or study team members playing the part of patients. &#x0201c;Patients&#x0201d; were provided with simulated cases based on real cases, with the goal of evaluating use of the tool with realistic patient examples, ranging from patients with newly diagnosed TB to complex and/or difficult cases.

Given the severe resource constraints of the Malawi healthcare system and the design of this intervention to specifically address an identified gap in care provided by LHWs to patients with TB, usual care was considered the most appropriate compactor against which to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention in order to inform decision makers regarding scale-up and sustainability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Informed consent</title><p>LHW participants in the educational intervention are HC personnel, who receive routine training and supervision. LHWs at intervention sites routinely involved in care of patients with TB will be encouraged but not required to attend training sessions. The educational intervention and point-of-care tool will be revised in collaboration with and approved by the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) to ensure consistency with national TB treatment guidelines. As undergoing training is a routine expectation of HC staff and the training will be approved by the NTP, individual consent is not required for participation in the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Blinding</title><p>Given the nature of the intervention, blinding of participants is not possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data collection</title><p>A digital copy will be made of TB registers of all participating districts at the end of the 1-year trial period. Data will be double-entered and verified by a data manager.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary trial outcome of interest is the proportion of patients with TB successfully treated (final value), defined according to the World Health Organization criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as the total number of patients cured and completing treatment. Secondary trial outcomes include the proportion of default cases (treatment interrupted for at least 2 consecutive months) and proportion of successes among cases with HIV coinfection. All outcomes will be assessed for 1&#x000a0;year following completion of LHW on-site peer-led training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Although 109 HCs are available for participation in the 4 study districts, we expect that a small number do not routinely provide TB care. In addition, on the basis of our experience in the preliminary study, where several clusters were lost because of staff shortages necessitating transfer of TB cases or failure of HCs to accrue eligible TB cases in small, remote HCs, we have estimated the sample size for the present study conservatively as follows. With an alpha of 0.05, a power of 0.80, a baseline successful treatment completion of 0.80 at 1&#x000a0;year, an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.1 based on our pilot study data, and an estimated 100 clusters (HCs that provide TB care), a minimum of 6 patients are required per cluster to detect a clinically significant 0.10 increase in the proportion of successful treatment completion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>Summary statistics, including measures of central tendency and range, will be calculated and presented for each district, including number of HCs included, number of individuals receiving the intervention, number of LHWs trained at each site, baseline characteristics (proportion of pulmonary and nonpulmonary TB cases), proportion with TB-HIV coinfection, and TB outcomes across the trial arms by district.</p><p>The primary analysis will use multilevel modeling to compare proportion of treatment successes among the control and intervention groups, with analysis adjusted for correlation due to clustering and stratification. Multilevel modeling will also allow us to examine similarities and differences between and within districts (strata) and healthcare centers (clusters) in outcomes and for planned subgroup analysis. Analysis will be conducted on an as-randomized basis and performed using R statistical software.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Process evaluation</title><sec id="Sec22"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>Interview participants will include LHWs who have received the intervention and patients and/or guardians who begin TB treatment on or after the trial start date and who are followed at a participating HC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>LHWs who have completed the educational outreach training and patients with TB of participating HCs who begin TB treatment during the trial period presenting for TB care on days the study research assistant (RA) is collecting data will be eligible for participation in the qualitative study. Exclusion criteria for interview participants include patients with TB who are younger than 18&#x000a0;years of age and unaccompanied by a parent or guardian, patients and/or guardians or LHWs who are unwilling or unable to give informed consent, patients who are not usually treated at the participating HC, and patients deemed by the local healthcare team to be too ill to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Participant recruitment and informed consent</title><p>Two to four participants from each group (LHWs and patients) will be selected in each data collection period from each district and a maximum of two from any one HC. LHWs will be selected for interviews using mixed purposive sampling. A list of trained LHWs compiled by the peer trainers will provide the initial sampling frame. LHWs will be selected from among those on the list to represent the range of LHW characteristics in terms of gender, age, years of experience, and HC characteristics (rural vs urban). Three LHWs chosen to reflect the range of responses (positive to negative) in the first round of interviews will be selected to be interviewed at both study onset and conclusion. The study, SC, or RA will be introduced to the general LHWs by the peer trainers. LHWs will then be approached in person (or by phone if the selected LHW is not present on site at the time of the HC visit) by the SC or RA, who will use a recruitment script.</p><p>Convenience sampling will be used to select patients and/or guardians for interviews. Patients will be selected to represent the range of characteristics in terms of age, gender, and TB characteristics (new vs recurrent, pulmonary vs nonpulmonary). The SC or RA will attend HCs on days identified by HC staff as typically busy. The SC or RA will be introduced to patients by the LHWs working in the HC during HC visits. After being introduced, the SC or RA will approach patients in person, using a recruitment script.</p><p>Written informed consent will be obtained in person by the SC or RA prior to beginning the interview. In order to ensure participant understanding, in addition to providing the consent form in Chichewa, the SC or RA will read the consent form out loud. Participants will then be given an opportunity to read the consent form and to have any questions they may have answered by the study team. Once all questions are answered to the participants&#x02019; satisfaction, the participants will be asked if they wish to participate; if they agree, the form will be signed and witnessed. For patients under 18&#x000a0;years of age, consent will be obtained from the child&#x02019;s parent or guardian using the same process, and assent will be obtained for children old enough to participate in interviews after parental consent has been obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Process evaluation outcomes of interest include barriers to and facilitators of implementation, scalability, sustainability, and identification of potential program improvements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Interviews will be conducted with LHWs and patients at 2 time points during the trial, with an estimated 10&#x02013;15 participants from each group required each time to reach saturation and allow for sampling from all participating HCs, for a total of 40&#x02013;60 participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Data collection</title><p>Interviews will be conducted with LHWs and patients at two time points to assess barriers to implementation and sustainability: in the first 3&#x000a0;months after training and in the last 3&#x000a0;months of the trial. Two or three LHWs will be interviewed both times in order to capture change within and across individuals over time. Participants will be interviewed by a trained RA fluent in English and Chichewa using a semistructured interview guide to ensure key areas of interest are addressed and to allow for emergence of novel themes. Interviews will be conducted in a private location (at or near the participants&#x02019; HC) at a time convenient to participants, with interviews expected to last 30&#x02013;60 minutes. Interviews will be audio-recorded digitally using unique numeric identifiers only.</p><p>Training logs and quarterly peer trainer and mentorship meeting notes will be collected by the RA for analysis.

Interviews will be audio-taped, transcribed verbatim, and translated by an RA. Twenty percent of transcripts will be retranslated by a second RA as a quality check. Should discrepancies in conceptual equivalence be observed, all transcripts will be translated by a second interpreter, and discrepancies will be resolved by consensus. Interviews and training log entries will be analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Two study team members will read and code the transcripts, training logs, and meeting reports independently, with discrepancies resolved through consensus. NVivo 10 software (QSR International, Doncaster, Australia) will be used to code and organize data into themes. Themes will be sought within and across individuals, participant groups, and data collection periods to allow for assessment of change and emergence of themes over time. Results from qualitative data sources will be triangulated using the technique of integration, with data from all sources considered in detail to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the barriers to and facilitators of the sustainability and scalability of the intervention as well as use of the approach to address other gaps in care provided by LHWs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Data management</title><p>The electronic copy of the recruitment list will be password-protected and stored on a secure server, maintained separate from the unique numeric identifier list, and accessible only by the principal investigators, an SC, and an RA.

Identifying data (name, village name, and TB number) will be used to verify records from double data entry only. Once verified, the name, village name, and TB number will be removed from the database, and records will be maintained using a unique identification number only. No personal identifiers will be collected from interview participants. Only unique numeric identifiers will be used for audio recordings and transcripts. Audio recordings will be destroyed once analysis is complete.</p><p>Consent forms, training logs, and quarterly peer trainer and mentorship meeting notes will be stored in a locked cabinet in a locked room and accessible only by the principal investigator, SC, and RA.

LHWs provide a potential solution to addressing the severe healthcare worker shortages and high TB burdens in these settings. However, to date, expansion of the LHW cadre and task-shifting of outpatient TB care in Malawi have failed to achieve the desired impact. The aim of our project is to refine, implement, and evaluate a KT intervention previously piloted in a single district in Malawi. The intervention is designed to improve uptake of evidence into routine practice of LHWs providing TB care in Malawi. Given the increasing role of LHWs in low- and middle-income countries, approaches to addressing knowledge gaps among LHWs through adequate training and supervision are essential to improving health outcomes.</p><p>The results of this study will inform the NTP efforts of the Malawi MOH, which is keen to implement the NTP nationally if proven effective. In addition, this project has the potential to generate principles that will inform programs to improve practice in other areas of care provided by LHWs in Malawi and in other LICs.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p>This study is currently in the early stages of implementation.
