However, the current trial sought to determine if IV-ibuprofen would also have a significant effect on the onset of pain. Therefore, the first dose of study drug was administered prior to the surgical procedure. The study drug was infused over 30 minutes through either a peripheral or a central venous catheter. After surgery, all patients had access to PCA morphine.</p><p>Previous clinical studies demonstrated that despite having access to morphine, patients receiving IV-ibuprofen not only used less morphine, but also reported lower pain scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. The placebo control was chosen to accurately assess the treatment effect associated with IV-ibuprofen, utilizing both pain scores and the morphine-sparing model.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Population and Interventions</title><p>The trial was conducted in an in-patient setting at a total of eight surgical hospital sites. Six of the eight sites were in the United States: Dekalb Medical Center (Decatur, GA), Arkansas Surgical Hospital (North Little Rock, AR), Foundation Surgical Hospital (Bellaire, TX), Memorial Hermann-Memorial City Hospital (Houston, TX), Methodist Hospital (Arcadia, CA), and Springhill Memorial Hospital (Mobile, AL). Two of the eight sites were in South Africa: Johannesburg General Hospital (Johannesburg, Gauteng, RSA) and Eugene Marias Hospital (Pretoria, Gauteng, RSA). Enrollment was open to adults between ages 18 and 80 years who were scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement, reconstruction or arthroplasty, with an anticipated hospital stay and anticipated concomitant need for IV morphine analgesia for at least 28 hours post-procedure. Patients were required to weigh more than 30 kg, have adequate venous access as well as the ability to perform a pain intensity report, and not have a narcotic dependence or a known tolerance to opioids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Patients were randomized to receive either 800 mg of IV ibuprofen or placebo and the clinical trial duration was 7 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). The first dose of study drug was administered at the induction of anesthesia, prior to the surgical procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). Four subsequent doses of study drug were to be administered every 6 hours over the next 24 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>). After the patient received five scheduled doses of study drug, additional doses could be administered as needed every 6 hours through the 120-hour treatment period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study timeline.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pme0011-1284-f1"/></fig><p>Upon discharge from the operating room, all patients had access to intravenous morphine via a PCA pump. Initial settings were a 1 mg demand dose with a 5-minute lockout. If adequate pain control was not achieved the demand dose of morphine could be increased to 2 mg every 5 minutes, and additional morphine could be administered at the treating physician's discretion. However, basal infusions of morphine were not allowed. A data safety monitoring committee reviewed all serious adverse events reported during the study.</p><p>All patients received general anesthesia using various anesthetics such as propofol or a member of the flurane drug family along with fentanyl for intraoperative narcotic maintenance (fentanyl dose was per the discretion of the anesthesiologist). Intraoperative use of any other analgesics including nonsteroidal agents was prohibited. Neuraxial anesthesia (local anesthetics and narcotics) were prohibited. Single shot and catheter-based regional techniques were also prohibited.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy Assessments</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of IV-ibuprofen compared with placebo for the treatment of surgical pain during hours 6&#x02013;28 post-operatively, demonstrated by patient self-assessment of pain with movement (VASM), using a visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary objectives included several efficacy measurements to help elucidate the analgesic effect of perioperative IV ibuprofen in the 6&#x02013;28 hour time period including 1) the patients' self-assessment of pain at rest measured by the VAS assessed at rest (VASR), 2) pain measured by the verbal rating scale (VRS), and 3) differences in post-operative morphine consumption between groups.</p><p>Prior to the scheduled 6-hour post-operative pain assessment, a VASM and VASR were performed as soon as the patient was awake and alert enough to properly perform the procedure. On average, patients were able to perform this assessment at 2.81 hours post-operatively. An additional secondary endpoint (deemed early post-op pain) examined the differences between treatment groups at this time.</p><p>Pain assessments were performed at the following time points: immediately following surgery as soon as the patient was awake enough to comply with study procedures, at hours 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and then 2 hours after any subsequent doses of study medication that was administered in the 28&#x02013;72 hours post-operative period. Additionally, after the 28-hour mark, scheduled VAS scores were obtained each day until the study drug was discontinued.</p><p>The VAS used was a standard 100-mm scale. VRS pain assessment measured a patient's self-report of pain on a numerical scale from 0 (no pain) to 4 (severe pain at rest and with movement). Additional measurements of efficacy included in the study were incidence of treatment failure, time to GI motility, time to resumption of ambulation, time to resumption of liquid intake and solid diet, incidence of opioid related side effects, and length of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>The safety profile of 800 mg IV-ibuprofen infused every 6 hours vs placebo was evaluated through comparison of treatment-emergent adverse events, as well as vital signs, clinical chemistry values, hematology and coagulation values, and transfusion requirements. Investigators were asked to report any adverse medical events (new events or worsening conditions) that occurred during the seven day study and to grade the event by intensity (mild, moderate, severe), record action taken with the study drug, causality to the study drug, required treatment, outcome, and time of resolution. Vital signs and laboratory results were monitored closely to investigate the effects of treatment, including renal-related effects and any possible impact on bleeding, during screening, at baseline, at hours 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 hours after study drug administration, and daily through day 5 or discharge. Requirements for transfusions of blood products (including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets) were also collected. Clinical laboratory assessments included clinical chemistry (sodium, potassium, chloride, total carbon dioxide, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase). Hematology and coagulation assessments included white blood cell count and differential, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, and prothrombin time or INR. Lab results were assessed during screening, baseline, and on study days 1, 2, 3, and 5 or at discharge. Adverse event monitoring continued through day 14. In the event that a patient was discharged before the end of the study, safety assessments were conducted by follow-up visit or telephone.</p><p>Patients were also evaluated with a combined safety assessment: 1) occurrence of diffuse pruritus; 2) occurrence of overt respiratory depression; 3) need for post-operative urinary indwelling catheter (after initial removal of surgical catheter); 4) incidence of post-operative vomiting or need for anti-emetic medication; and 5) the Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale. The initial Combined Safety Assessment was performed following surgery upon reversal of anesthesia, and then at post-operative hours 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis Methods</title><p>The study population consisted of patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication.</p><p>A literature review of morphine dosing shows that there is a correlation between dose and patient age and weight. In an attempt to ensure a more balanced overall randomization, treatment groups were stratified by age (&#x02264;45 and &#x0003e;45&#x02013;80 years) and weight (&#x02264;75 kg and &#x0003e;75 kg). Patients greater than 80 years of age were excluded to reduce variability because these patients generally require significantly less morphine for pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>]. Data obtained from an earlier study on IV-ibuprofen were used in the sample size considerations. A sample size of 67 per group provided 90% power to detect a 20% reduction in pain-area under the curve (AUC) with movement with a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 using a two-sided two-sample (independent) <italic>t</italic>-test. Sample size estimates were done using NCSS/PASS software (NCSS, Kaysville, UT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>]. Analysis of the primary efficacy parameters was conducted on the study population.</p><p>The AUC from 6 to 28 hours for the VAS assessed with movement (AUC-VASM [6&#x02013;28]) was the primary efficacy endpoint, and the analysis of variance (<sc>anova</sc>) was applied. The primary model included factors for study center, treatment group, age group, weight group and their interactions. Interactions that were not statistically significant at the 20% level were removed from the model before computing the test for treatment difference, while interactions that were statistically significant at the 20% level were retained as alpha-level adjustments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>].</p><p>Frequency and percent of treatment failure was compared across treatment groups using a Chi-square test, while the time to treatment failure was evaluated using survival methods. Median time to treatment failure was calculated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier approach and the treatment groups were compared with a log-rank test.</p><p>Computation of the AUC measures utilized all available information. Exact times of observations were imputed whenever available. Since the trapezoidal rule was used to compute the AUC, any absent scheduled observations were estimated by linear interpolation from the observations on either side of the missing data point, utilizing direct-likelihood mixed model repeated measures methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>].</p><p>Adverse events were coded using MedDRA preferred terminology and MedDRA system organ classifications, and the adverse events were also coded as serious or non-serious using FDA definitions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Results</title><p>A total of 185 patients were enrolled at eight clinical sites in the United States and South Africa. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> presents the demographics and characteristics for the study population (all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study medication).

Administered orally, ibuprofen is effective in blocking pain and inflammation, in part by preventing the production of prostaglandins. An intravenous formulation of ibuprofen has the potential to arrest the inflammatory cascade triggered by surgical procedures and to reduce or prevent the development of post-operative pain. A previous randomized, placebo controlled trial in surgical patients, including those undergoing orthopedic procedures, evaluated pain reduction and the opioid sparing effect of IV-ibuprofen during multimodal post-operative pain management and demonstrated that 800 mg IV-ibuprofen dosed every 6 hours produced a significant reduction in pain and morphine use in surgical patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>]. This study involves the first report of pre-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen.</p><p>NSAIDs carry warnings for cardiovascular and gastrointestinal risk and should be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure, renal impairment, a risk for blood clots, and/or a history of ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. The only other available injectable NSAID, ketorolac, includes additional warnings for use in geriatric patients and is contraindicated for use in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. Additionally, it carries a black box warning against pre-operative administration, and according to the package insert, can only be administered for 5 days or less [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. Therefore, the introduction of an NSAID that can be used safely prior to surgery adds another therapeutic modality to treat post-operative pain.</p><p>IV-ibuprofen, 800 mg administered every 6 hours starting with the onset of anesthesia in orthopedic surgery patients, reduced both pain and morphine consumption post-operatively. When compared with patients receiving placebo, patients receiving 800 mg IV-ibuprofen experienced less pain beginning in the early post-operative period and continuing at least through hour 28. There was a significant reduction in pain with movement and at rest with IV-ibuprofen as measured by the AUC-VAS during the 6&#x02013;28-hour post-operative period. There was also a significant reduction in mean morphine consumption in the 6&#x02013;28-hour post-operative period in patients receiving IV-ibuprofen.</p><p>The safety analysis encompassed all 185 patients that participated in the study, 164 of which experienced treatment emergent-AEs (serious and nonserious). There was no difference in the general incidence of AEs between the IV-ibuprofen and placebo treatment groups. Events related to bleeding and coagulation times, and transfusion requirements, did not differ between the two groups. There were no deaths reported in this study. There were a total of 11 SAEs occurring in nine patients, with no statistically significant difference in the incidence of SAEs between the patients receiving placebo and the patients receiving IV-ibuprofen. The SAEs were consistent with those typically observed in patients undergoing surgery and treated with anesthesia and morphine.</p></sec><sec sec-type=""><title>Conclusions</title><p>Pre- and post-operative administration of IV-ibuprofen significantly reduced both pain and morphine use in orthopedic surgery patients in this prospective randomized controlled trial. The 800 mg dose provided patients with analgesic benefit and narcotic reduction. Post-operative pain control protocols can now consider inclusion of IV-ibuprofen as an option to offer patients a significant analgesic benefit while reducing the risks associated with morphine administration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Practice guidelines for acute pain management in the perioperative setting.
