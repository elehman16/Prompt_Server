The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of one recently designed prophylactic knee brace and two neoprene knee sleeves upon performance of healthy athletes. Thirty-one healthy male athletes (age&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21.2&#x000b1;1.5) volunteered as participants to examine the effect of prophylactic knee brace/sleeves on performance using isokinetic and functional tests. All subjects were tested in four conditions in a random order: 1. nonbraced (control) 2. using a neoprene knee sleeve 3. using a knee sleeve with four bilateral metal supports and 4. using a prophylactic knee brace. The study design was a crossover, randomized, controlled trial. Subjects completed single leg vertical jump, cross-over hop, and the isokinetic knee flexion and extension (at 60, 180, 300&#x000b0;/sec). Data were collected from the above tests and analyzed for jump height, cross-over hop distance, peak torque to body weight ratio and average power, respectively. Comparisons of these variables in the four testing conditions revealed no statistically significant difference (p&#x0003e;0.05). The selected prophylactic brace/sleeves did not significantly inhibit athletic performance which might verify that their structure and design have caused no complication in the normal function of the knee joint. Moreover, it could be speculated that, if the brace or the sleeves had any limiting effect, our young healthy athletic subjects were well able to generate a mean peak torque large enough to overcome this possible restriction. Further studies are suggested to investigate the long term effect of these prophylactic knee brace and sleeves as well as their possible effect on the adjacent joints to the knee.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prophylactic knee braces (PKBs) are designed on the premise that they can protect players from sustaining debilitating injuries without inhibiting knee mobility and they have been utilized in sports without conclusive evidence regarding their efficacy in protecting the knee joint ligaments from injury <xref rid="pone.0050110-Schlegel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050110-Baltaci1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>However, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons position paper and several studies have illustrated that the available off-the-shelf PKBs generally provide 20&#x02013;30% greater knee ligament protection <xref rid="pone.0050110-Rishiraj1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>With regard to the effect of PKBs on different aspects of knee function, it is claimed in some studies that knee brace use has the potential to restrict performance and may lead to early fatigue <xref rid="pone.0050110-Styf1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050110-Hansen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, while others claim that it has no negative effect on the performance <xref rid="pone.0050110-Sforzo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050110-Greene1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0050110-Tegner1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect that a PKB and two neoprene knee sleeves had upon the performance of an athlete as measured by selected laboratory parameters. The concept for manufacturing the tested PKB was to produce a low-cost PKB from components readily available in Iran as most manufactured PKBs are not available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty-one healthy male collegiate athletes volunteered as participants.

Sixty and 180&#x000b0;/sec are reasonable and comfortable test velocities that seems to meet the essential requirements of testing validity and the need for information about muscle performance at the functional range. The velocity of 300&#x000b0;/sec was chosen as a high range to test the performance in the high velocity athletic activities. Moreover, as the higher test velocities incorporate lower reliability, more repetitions were necessary to avoid the concerns regarding the reliability of the tests.

In comparing the NBR with the PKB and two neoprene sleeve conditions, during the SLVJ and the cross-over hop, no significant performance differences were noted. Likewise, in the isokinetic tests, wearing the PKB or sleeves did not cause a significant change in the PTBWR or the average power generated by the study participants during any of the test velocities.</p><p>There are two methods of dynamic muscle force determination that are used frequently in the lower body. One of them is isokinetic dynamometry, which gives information about the strength of specific muscles or muscle groups at a specific velocity. Since the muscular strength and power are two parameters that are recognized as influencing an athlete's performance, isokinetic torque and power were investigated in the present study as a means of understanding the effect of PKB and knee sleeves on the knee performance. The other method of determining dynamic muscular force is using a vertical jump test, which provides information about the mechanical work accomplished by the whole kinematic extensor chain. Both methods have been extensively utilized and validated in the sporting field <xref rid="pone.0050110-Kovaleski1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Since the range of abnormal performance may increase with the addition of a second test <xref rid="pone.0050110-Zachazewski1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, two functional tests were utilized in this study in conjunction with the isokinetic dynamometry.</p><p>Among the studies which assessed the effect of PKBs on the performance with similar methodologies to the present one, the results of Birmingham's study were homogeneous. Birmingham investigated the effect of the DonJoy Defiant knee brace on isokinetic peak torque at 90&#x000b0;/sec during knee flexion and extension in participants who had undergone ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) reconstruction, and had completed a physical therapy rehabilitation protocol. This study showed that wearing the brace decreased the flexion torque generating capacity of the knee by 7.3% which was statistically significant. However, no significant negative brace effect was exhibited for extension torques <xref rid="pone.0050110-Birmingham1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Likewise, in the present study, at the velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec, PKB reduced the amount of torque generated in the flexion more than extension (3.2% and 0.4% reduction for flexion and extension respectively) comparing to the torques for the control condition, yet these reductions were not statistically significant. One of the reasons that the effect of the PKB was not significant could be the differences in the type of participants who were examined in our study and Birmingham's study (i.e. ACL-reconstructed vs. healthy). As it is shown in some studies, discrepancies in the extent to which the knee brace effects knee performance may be due to participants' current situation, including symptoms exhibited and muscle strength <xref rid="pone.0050110-Sforzo1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050110-Lu1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Owing to the fact that all participants of the present study were young male athletes and that they were able to generate a mean peak torque of 282 percent of their body weight (normative measures according to Biodex ranges from 265% to 343%), it may be speculated that these participants were perfectly able to overcome the possible resistive load imposed by the PKB and neoprene sleeves. Moreover, it is possible that the potential inhibitory effect of the PKB/sleeves was not detectable given the sensitivity of the measuring devices or methods utilized in this study.</p><p>Studies by Ramsey and DeVita support the idea that supportive knee braces may evoke motor pattern changes that offer protection to ACL deficient patients <xref rid="pone.0050110-DeVita1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050110-Ramsey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. According to the DeVita's study, the knee joint torque variables and powers were not significantly affected by the knee brace and this coincides with the results of the current study. Furthermore, DeVita found that while wearing the functional knee brace, healthy participants were not as responsive to the brace effects as ACL-deficient patients according to the lower limb moments, especially in the knee joint <xref rid="pone.0050110-DeVita2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Singer studied the effects of two types of knee supports on the mechanics of walking in healthy participants; a knee sleeve with bilateral hinges and a hinged-post-shell brace, and as such, this brace and knee sleeve were similar to those tested in the present study. The results revealed that flexion and extension torques of knee and other joints of the lower limb were not significantly different between brace and non-braced conditions. In addition to this, there were no statistically significant differences between the brace and sleeve <xref rid="pone.0050110-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>Although the methods of the previous studies are unlike the current study, within all of them the effect of knee supports on two influential parameters in sports performance, i.e. muscular strength and power, were investigated <xref rid="pone.0050110-Kovaleski1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Thus, as the findings of the aforementioned studies did not reveal any negative effect of knee sleeve/braces on knee torques and power in the healthy participants, it may be concluded that these results are compatible with those of the present study.</p><p>Analyzing the results of current study has shown that wearing neither the PKB nor the neoprene knee sleeves have significantly changed the isokinetic variables in any of the three fast to slow angular velocities. Again, according to functional tests there was also no significant difference between control and PKB/sleeves condition which is consistent with the results of a study by Blataci, who examined the effects of braces of similar design on vertical jump and one-leg hop test. Therefore, the results of the functional tests have supported the findings of the isokinetic tests.</p><p>In general, conventional PKBs and those that were utilized in the present study can be divided into two groups: (1) those with metal frames, and (2) knee supports with neoprene as their basic structure. The simple neoprene sleeve was utilized in the current study to understand the possible limitations that neoprene can cause when it is used as the base structure in a knee support design. In the present study, no inhibitory effect of neoprene was found; therefore, considering the positive effect of neoprene sleeves on the proprioception, utilizing them in PKBs seems quite efficient <xref rid="pone.0050110-Baltaci1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050110-Ramsey1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0050110-Theoret1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. As a result of the fact that the PKB used in the present study had a metal frame and firm plastic shells, it may provide the knee ligaments with more support than the neoprene sleeve with four metal supports <xref rid="pone.0050110-France1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that we have only assessed the effects of bracing on the knee joint isokinetics and function. Further studies may be helpful to also investigate the interaction and compensation of adjacent joints to the knee (i.e. ankle and hip).</p><p>In this study the immediate effect of the braces were assessed; this immediate change of the knee kinetics probably predicts the subsequent changes of the knee kinetics. Thus the result of the immediate effect can be used as a guideline for indication of PKBs and knee sleeves until there will be any data regarding the long-term and on the field effects of them.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study showed that the tested PKB and neoprene knee sleeves had no significant negative effect on the knee performance of male athletes, which is desirable according to the purpose of wearing theses braces; that is, these knee supports protect the knee and at the same time they do not deteriorate the performance of the athlete. In addition, no differences were observed according to whether neoprene sleeves were utilized or not; thus, coaches can choose any of these types of knee support as prophylactic or protective equipment according to the needs, type of sport, and risk of injury of the athletes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the contributions of Ahmad Khodadad, athletic trainer, in recruiting participants.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0050110-Schlegel1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Schlegel TF, Steadman JR (1997) Knee Orthoses for Sports-Related Disorders.
