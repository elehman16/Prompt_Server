We analyzed efficacy and safety according to prior treatment in the phase 3 TOURMALINE-MM1 study of ixazomib-lenalidomide-dexamethasone (ixazomib-Rd) <italic>versus</italic> placebo-Rd. Patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma received ixazomib-Rd or placebo-Rd. Efficacy and safety were evaluated in subgroups defined according to type (proteasome inhibitor [PI] and immunomodulatory drug) and number (1 <italic>vs.</italic> 2 or 3) of prior therapies received. Of 722 patients, 503 (70%) had received a prior PI, and 397 (55%) prior lenalidomide/thalidomide; 425 patients had received 1 prior therapy, and 297 received 2 or 3 prior therapies. At a median follow up of ~15 months, PFS was prolonged with ixazomib-Rd <italic>vs.</italic> placebo-Rd regardless of type of prior therapy received; HR 0.739 and 0.749 in PI-exposed and &#x02013;na&#x000ef;ve patients, HR 0.744 and 0.700 in immunomodulatory-drug-exposed and -na&#x000ef;ve patients, respectively. PFS benefit with ixazomib-Rd <italic>vs.</italic> placebo-Rd appeared greater in patients with 2 or 3 prior therapies (HR 0.58) and in those with 1 prior therapy without prior transplant (HR 0.60) <italic>versus</italic> those with 1 prior therapy and transplant (HR 1.23). Across all subgroups, toxicity was consistent with that seen in the intent-to-treat population. In patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma, ixazomib-Rd was associated with a consistent clinical benefit <italic>vs.</italic> placebo-Rd regardless of prior treatment with bortezomib or immunomodulatory drugs. Patients with 2 or 3 prior therapies, or 1 prior therapy without transplant seemed to have greater benefit than patients with 1 prior therapy and transplant.

For example, outcomes for thalidomide-exposed patients have been shown to be worse than for thalidomide-na&#x000ef;ve patients following treatment with bortezomib<sup><xref rid="b12-1021767" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and with lenalidomide-dexamethasone.<sup><xref rid="b13-1021767" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Until 2012, bortezomib was the only PI available so subsequent treatment with other drugs of the same class was not possible outside of a clinical trial.

Given the widespread use of PIs and immunomodulatory drugs as first-line therapy, it is important to determine their impact on the overall and relative efficacy of new agents for the treatment of RRMM. The TOURMALINE-MM1 study included patients with prior exposure to PIs and the immunomodulatory drugs thalidomide and lenalidomide, and patients with and without prior transplant.

The study was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines and appropriate regulatory requirements, and with approval of Institutional Review Boards at individual enrolling institutions. All patients provided written informed consent. A total of 722 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive oral ixazomib 4 mg (ixazomib-Rd arm, N=360) or placebo (placebo-Rd arm, N=362) on days 1, 8, and 15 of 28-day cycles, with oral lenalidomide 25 mg on days 1&#x02013;21 and oral dexamethasone 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Stratification factors were number of prior therapies per investigator assessment (1 <italic>vs.</italic> 2 or 3), International Staging System disease stage (I or II <italic>vs.</italic> III), and prior PI exposure (yes <italic>vs.</italic> no); patients were not stratified by prior thal/R exposure or thalidomide-refractoriness.

Per protocol, the study continued in a double-blind, placebo-controlled manner to gain more mature OS data; a second preplanned analysis (median follow up of ~23 months) was conducted for safety and survival. Time-to-event distributions were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology, with stratified log-rank tests and Cox models (alpha=0.05, two-sided) used for comparisons of time-to-event endpoints. A stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to assess inter-arm differences in response rates.

Importantly, ixazomib-Rd was associated with a particular clinical benefit <italic>vs.</italic> placebo-Rd in patients with multiple prior therapies (HR 0.580; median PFS not estimable with ixazomib-Rd <italic>vs.</italic> 12.9 months with placebo-Rd), and this was seen regardless of the type of prior therapies received.

Across other subgroups of patients with 1 prior therapy there was a clear PFS benefit with ixazomib-Rd <italic>vs.</italic> placebo-Rd, including those with high-risk cytogenetics. One possibility suggested by preliminary findings is that tumors relapsed post-transplant may have a distinct biology with a less differentiated phenotype and lower expression of c-myc.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021767" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The benefit (HR 0.44) in patients with no prior transplant but prior melphalan-containing therapy suggests that the difference is not due to prior alkylator therapy but possibly due to the transplant itself or, although speculative, due to the myeloablative dose of melphalan administered before the transplant. Several published data have previously suggested a link between c-myc levels and the sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors.<sup><xref rid="b25-1021767" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b27-1021767" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors appear to target different clones (less <italic>versus</italic> more differentiated phenotypes, respectively), which might explain in part their synergistic action and the increased benefit observed with ixazomib-Rd.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021767" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> As the study was not powered to detect a statistical difference between the subgroups, and the transplant <italic>vs.</italic> non-transplant analysis was retrospective and post-hoc rather than a prespecified subgroup analysis, this finding is hypothesis-generating and further investigations to characterize the tumor biology are ongoing.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021767" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>As seen in the overall population,<sup><xref rid="b18-1021767" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> the addition of ixazomib was associated with limited additional toxicity when compared with placebo-Rd across all patient subgroups. Overall, the safety profile of ixazomib-Rd was similar regardless of number and type of prior therapies and was consistent with that reported for the overall patient population. Rates of all-grade AEs, grade &#x02265;3 AEs and SAEs were similar between subgroups and were aligned with the rates seen in the overall study population.

There were no consistent differences in all-grade or grade &#x02265;3 AEs in patients with 1 <italic>vs.</italic> 2&#x02013;3 prior therapies.

The findings in patients with 1 prior therapy and transplant are hypothesis-generating and further investigations are ongoing. Together, these findings support the results from the primary analysis of TOURMALINE-MM1, further demonstrating that the all-oral regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone represents an effective and tolerable treatment option for patients with RRMM.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would also like to acknowledge writing support from Jane Saunders of FireKite, an Ashfield company, part of UDG Healthcare plc, during the development of this manuscript, which was funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and complied with Good Publication Practice 3 ethical guidelines (Battisti et al., Ann Intern Med 2015;163:461&#x02013;4).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-1021767"><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.</p></fn><fn id="fn2-1021767"><p>Check the online version for the most updated information on this article, online supplements, and information on authorship &#x00026; disclosures: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.haematologica.org/content/102/10/1767">www.haematologica.org/content/102/10/1767</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-1021767"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brenner</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gondos</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Pulte</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group>
