Shaping the Health of Adolescents in Zimbabwe (SHAZ!) was a randomized controlled trial of a combined intervention package including life-skills and health education, vocational training, micro-grants and social supports compared to life-skills and health education alone. SHAZ! was originally envisioned as a larger effectiveness trial, however, the intervention was scaled back due to contextual and economic conditions in the country at the time. SHAZ! enrolled 315 participants randomly assigned to study arm within blocks of 50 participants (158 intervention and 157 control). The intervention arm participants showed statistically significant differences from the control arm participants for several outcomes during the two years of follow up including; reduced food insecurity [IOR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.83 vs. COR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.68, p-0.02], and having their own income [IOR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2.05 vs. COR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.67, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02]. Additionally, within the Intervention arm there was a lower risk of transactional sex [IOR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.64, 95% CI (0.50, 0.83)], and a higher likelihood of using a condom with their current partner [IOR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.79, 95% CI (1.23, 2.62)] over time compared to baseline. There was also evidence of fewer unintended pregnancies among intervention participants [HR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.61, 95% CI (0.37, 1.01)], although this relationship achieved only marginal statistical significance. Several important challenges in this study included the coordination with vocational training programs, the political and economic instability of the area at the time of the study, and the difficulty in creating a true standard of care control arm. Overall the results of the SHAZ! study suggest important potential for HIV prevention intervention packages that include vocational training and micro-grants, and lessons for further economic livelihoods interventions with adolescent females. Further work is needed to refine the intervention model, and test the impact of the intervention at scale on biological outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02034214">NCT02034214</ext-link>

Adolescents (aged 15&#x02013;19) in Zimbabwe experience a particularly high burden of HIV, with females twice as likely as males to be HIV infected (6% vs 3%, respectively) <xref rid="pone.0113621-Zimbabwe1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Over the last decade, Zimbabwe has faced a severe economic and political crisis, fuelled by a government-led land redistribution program that, by 2008, had resulted in a collapse of the agricultural sector, skyrocketing inflation, massive unemployment, and widespread civil unrest <xref rid="pone.0113621-Mlambo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113621-Tibaijuka1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This overarching context has exacerbated a situation in which adolescent women already face highly constrained access to educational and economic opportunities, and health services <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113621-Cluver1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and has likely helped to fuel the rising epidemic among girls and adolescent women.</p><p>Research has shown that the inequitable burden of HIV among adolescent women is driven, at least in part, by structural factors, defined as environmental, social and economic barriers to an individual's HIV prevention and health-seeking or treatment behavior <xref rid="pone.0113621-Auerbach1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113621-Sumartojo2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Specific factors that have been linked to HIV risk among adolescent women in sub-Saharan Africa include poverty and income inequality; lack of educational opportunities; gender inequalities in social structures and relationships; and gender-based or intimate partner violence <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113621-Coates1" ref-type="bibr">[6,12&#x02013;15]</xref>. Within this context, in addition to early marriage, selling sex becomes one of the few means available to supplement or generate income. While few may result to full-time sex work, many adolescent women trade sex for food, mobile air time and other expenses <xref rid="pone.0113621-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, a phenomenon observed throughout Zimbabwe and the sub-Saharan African region <xref rid="pone.0113621-Calves1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113621-Wood1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. The associated sexual risks, including exposure to violence, have been linked to HIV infection <xref rid="pone.0113621-Dunkle1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>In an effort to address these so-called structural drivers of HIV, a new generation of research and programming has emerged to promote HIV prevention among young and adolescent women <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Such efforts have included interventions to increase gender equity, provide conditional and non-conditional cash transfers, and offer microcredit or other livelihoods opportunities <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[12,14,30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113621-Pronyk3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. For instance, IMAGE (Intervention for Microfinance and Gender Equity) merged a curriculum of gender equity and HIV/AIDS education with microfinance for women in South Africa. While no reduction in HIV incidence was observed from its community randomized controlled trial (RCT), results demonstrated effects on related outcomes such as increased assets <xref rid="pone.0113621-Pronyk2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, a 55% reduction in intimate-partner violence <xref rid="pone.0113621-Pronyk2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and increased condom use <xref rid="pone.0113621-Pronyk3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In Zimbabwe, an RCT of 25 primary schools studied the effects of providing school fees to orphaned girls. HIV was not directly measured, but the study found an 82% reduction in school drop-out and marriage rates after two years, and more equitable gender attitudes <xref rid="pone.0113621-Hallfors1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Recently, an RCT of a cash transfer (CT) program among 1,289 girls attending school in Malawi found lower odds of HIV (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14&#x02013;0.91) and HSV-2 (OR 0.24, 95% CI, 0.09&#x02013;0.65) among those who received CTs compared to those that did not <xref rid="pone.0113621-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>While these studies provide reason for optimism about economic structural interventions for women and girls, most efforts have neglected those arguably at greatest risk: adolescent women participants who have completed or left school. As Gibbs et al point out in a recent review of structural interventions <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gibbs1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, microcredit and gender transformative interventions tend to work best among mature women, and while cash transfers have shown promising effects for school-based adolescents, these approaches leave out those who have completed school or who do not have the interest or ability to continue their education &#x02013; even when school fees or other support is provided.</p><p>However, finding effective approaches for this group is challenging. In an evaluation of the Tap and Reposition of Youth (TRY) program, which rolled-out microcredit with business training and mentoring among out-of-school adolescent women (aged 16&#x02013;22 years) in Kenya, marginal improvements were seen in gender attitudes, but not in SRH knowledge, and there was a 66% drop out rate. In the formative phase of the SHAZ! (Shaping the Health of Adolescents in Zimbabwe) <xref rid="pone.0113621-Dunbar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, the authors of this paper tested a combined microcredit and life skills intervention among 50 out-of-school female orphans aged 16&#x02013;19 years in Zimbabwe. While HIV knowledge increased (16% vs 38%, p&#x0003c;0.001), no statistically significant changes were reflected in future aspirations, sexual activity, or condom use, and at 6 months, only 20% had begun repayment. Furthermore, the economic situation in Zimbabwe (as described above) ultimately proved microcredit to be unfeasible, and potentially harmful, as it led some to engage in new livelihoods strategies, including cross-border trading, that placed them at increased risk of sexual harassment and violence <xref rid="pone.0113621-Dunbar1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Subsequent improvements in SHAZ!, the topic of this paper, have addressed these findings through the use of a combination approach that applies economic alternatives that focus on training and support, and economic opportunities that do not demand repayment.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Shaping the Health of Adolescents in Zimbabwe: SHAZ! Pilot Intervention</title><p>SHAZ! began with formative work in 2000,which showed that poverty and gender inequalities increased adolescent women's HIV risk <xref rid="pone.0113621-Chinake1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, and that that maternal orphans were most vulnerable <xref rid="pone.0113621-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Results of a formative phase evaluation of a micro-credit intervention ((4), also described above) led to a radical re-design of the model, based not only on the pilot data, but also on the concepts of agency and gendered poverty as described in Naila Kabeer's Theory of Women's Empowerment <xref rid="pone.0113621-Kabeer1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0113621-Kabeer2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This theory posits that empowerment is a process by which one develops increased access to resources (informational, social and economic) and greater agency (or control), ultimately improving capabilities, or the capacity to effect outcomes in one's own life. The resulting SHAZ! Pilot Intervention &#x02013; the evaluation of which is described in this paper &#x02013; represents a radical modification of SHAZ!, from micro-credit to livelihoods training and micro-grants. The redesign was guided by input from young women and community advisors to find an appropriate and effective structural intervention approach addressing the needs of out-of-school adolescent girls and women, in this challenging political, social and economic context.</p><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0113621-g001">Figure 1</xref> depicts how we hypothesized the SHAZ! Pilot Intervention would improve HIV and sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes among our target population. The program included four main activities (described in detail below) to comprise the full intervention: (1) providing adequate and consistent HIV and sexual and reproductive health services; (2) conducting life skills-based HIV education; (3) improving economic opportunities through vocational training, guidance counseling and a micro-grant; and (4) integrated social support. We hypothesized that these activities would work together to increases knowledge, and improve social and economic indicators; enabling participants to reduce risky behaviors and optimize healthy ones. We further hypothesized that taken together, these improvements will lead to reduced HIV acquisition, and unintended pregnancy.</p><fig id="pone-0113621-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0113621.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>SHAZ!

It consisted of 14 modules delivered to groups of 25over 4&#x02013;6 weeks on: HIV/STI and reproductive health; relationship negotiation; strategies to avoid violence; and identification of safe and risky places in the community. Participants also attended a six-weeks-long home-based care training conducted through Red Cross Zimbabwe to gain skills around safely caring for people living with HIV.</p></sec><sec id="s1a3"><title>Livelihoods (Intervention participants only)</title><p>The Livelihoods intervention consisted of financial literacy education and a choice of vocational training at local training institutes. Courses were 6-months-long, conducted in English, with a practical and a theoretical component. In spite of encouragement to venture outside of accepted gender norms, the most popular courses were hairdressing, garment-making, and receptionist/secretarial and nurse-aid training. Participants who successfully completed a vocational training developed business plans that were supported with a micro-grant in the form of capital equipment, supplies or additional training. The resources purchased with these micro-grants were valued at $100 US dollars or less per participant.</p></sec><sec id="s1a4"><title>Integrated Social Support (ISS) (Intervention participants only)</title><p>Integrated social support undergirded the livelihoods component.

Pilot Intervention evaluation was originally envisioned as a large-scale trial of 1,000 participants, powered to detect changes in HSV-2 incidence as a proxy for HIV. However, during the scheduled time for intervention roll-out in 2005, Zimbabwe experienced major economic and political challenges that forced delays and a scaling-back of the study. As described briefly above, these changes included a national land-reform initiative that included political violence and which destroyed Zimbabwe's economic productivity. The land reform measures also lead to massive inflation which, at its peak in 2008, was estimated at 6.5 sextillion percent <xref rid="pone.0113621-Hanke1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In 2005, Zimbabwe also instituted operation <italic>murambatsvina (or drive out filth)</italic>a large-scale Zimbabwean government campaign to forcibly clear slum areas across the country. The campaign began in May of 2005, and lasted for several months, including targeting of the community where our intervention study was to take place. According to United Nations estimates, the operation affected at least 700,000 people directly through loss of their home or livelihood, and/or internal displacement, and indirectly affecting approximately 2.4 million people <xref rid="pone.0113621-Tibaijuka2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Given these developments, we felt it was critical to assess first, through a smaller scale Pilot Intervention study, whether the intervention would be feasible, and potentially effective in this volatile context. We therefore powered the study to detect effects on proximal (rather than HIV) outcomes. The main aims of the Pilot Intervention Study were to: assess: a) the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a cohort of adolescent female orphans who adhere to the intervention; b) changes in behavioural and structural risk factors; and c) trends in HIV and HSV-2 incidence, and unintended pregnancy.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This research was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe, the committee for the protection of human subjects at the University of California San Francisco and the institutional review boards at RTI International and Pangaea Global AIDS.

II was an individual RCT assessing feasibility and potential efficacy. We compared the full intervention (e.g. all the components described above) to a control condition of life-skills (including home-based care training)and reproductive health services alone. Neither participants nor study staff were blinded to study arm assignment. After the final follow up visit, control participants who successfully completed 80% of training sessions and study visits were supported to enrol in an equivalent vocational training course. A qualitative component accompanied the quantitative RCT, the findings from which are outside the scope of this paper and will be presented elsewhere.

Enrolment took place between February and August 2006 with the last study visit taking place in December of 2008 as scheduled. All participants gave written informed consent.

Because of loss to follow-up, it was not possible to determine either causes or consequences of migration among those who left the area during the course of the study. The microgrant opportunity should have been expected to reduce migration, but we were unable to evaluate this anticipated consequence of the SHAZ! intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Qualitative program monitoring data</title><p>Among the 24 participants who did not complete vocational training or develop a business plan, specific reasons for non-completion were difficult to assess; however programmatic monitoring data collected during guidance counselling visits revealed that participants faced language barriers, and family demands during hours that vocational training was offered. Due to the availability of training programs and the timing of completion of the required Life-skills and Red Cross components of the study, participants in the intervention arm completed their vocational training programs later than expected. Thus 78% of intervention participants had yet to fully complete intervention activities at the time of the 18 month follow up visit.</p><p>Program monitoring data also revealed that some control participants may have translated study reimbursements ($5/visit) into economic opportunities such as paying for school fees, or buying goods and selling them at a higher price.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Effect of Intervention on Structural and Sexual Behavioural Factors</title><p>

The evaluation revealed promising effects of intervention participation on structural and behavioural outcomes, such as significant improvements and/or expected trends among intervention participants in improving economic factors (food security and income) and decreasing HIV risk factors (e.g. transactional sex, condom use and experience of violence). While we did not observe expected trends between study arms in HIV or HSV-2 incidence, it is important to note that we saw an impressive 40% reduction in unintended pregnancy of borderline statistical significance despite not being powered for that outcome. Such results suggest important potential for the SHAZ! model to mitigate HIV risk among out-of-school adolescent female orphans, even in challenging economic contexts, and echo findings from the IMAGE study as reported in the introduction. Findings are also consistent with preliminary data from a recent &#x0201c;Stepping Stones/Creating Futures&#x0201d; evaluation that assessed life skills and livelihoods training among 233, 18&#x02013;24 years olds, both men and women, in Durban, South Africa. This evaluation showed a 50% increase in income earned by women at three months post intervention, and a decrease in reports of transactional sex (from 72% to 55%) <xref rid="pone.0113621-Gibbs2" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, on many of the outcomes studied, a review of &#x0201c;pre-post&#x0201d; indicators (across all study participants, not stratified by study arm)reveal highly statistically significant improvements for critical social factors (e.g. social support received, relationship power) that were not statistically different across arms. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have been the case. First, given the individual RCT design, it was difficult to define a true &#x0201c;standard of care&#x0201d; control arm. Because the study team felt ethically obligated to offer access to the same HIV and SRH education and services, and due to the fact that we followed up control participants who did not show up for study visits, the control condition received far more care and support than they would have had they not been enrolled in the study. In other words the control condition likely provided more benefit than a true control condition or standard of care would have. These factors would have underestimated the full effect of the intervention and/or reduced our ability to detect the marginal intervention effects of the combined intervention. It is also possible that the evaluation period or the length of the intervention was too short to capture the hypothesized benefits of the livelihoods intervention over and above the control condition on longer term behavioral or health outcomes. Because only 22% of intervention arm participants were able to fully complete vocational training prior to the 18 month visit, the benefits of economic activity related to that training may not have been realized until after the final study visit. Furthermore, participants and study staff could not be blinded to which study group was assigned, which may have impacted participation, behaviors and assessment of outcomes. However, ACASI was used to collect most of the behavioral and economic outcome data, and ensured that the collection of data was not biased based on study arm assignment. There may also have been some &#x0201c;contamination&#x0201d; across arms where control participants converted study reimbursements ($5/study visit) into economic opportunities - such as paying for school fees or buying and selling goods at a higher price. Although we did not capture this activity in a systematic way, program monitoring data indicate this did occur among some participants. A detailed analysis of qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of study participants is underway and may shed light on some of these remaining questions.</p><p>Another limitation when researching sexual behaviour among adolescents in longitudinal studies is related to sexual behaviour and age effects. While our population range was 16&#x02013;19, the mean age of participants at baseline was 18 years, corresponding to the mean age of sexual debut for women in Zimbabwe <xref rid="pone.0113621-Cremin1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>.We therefore expected that sexual activity in our study would likely increase over the two year period; however we hoped that is would remain steady or increase less among intervention participants. While we did not see any difference between study arms, it is important to note that all study participants reached the age of 18 by the end of follow up, however only 59% had initiated sexual activity and almost all who had initiated sexual activity(92%) reported only one sexual partner during the course of the study. In the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health survey conducted in 2005/2006 (close to the time period when SHAZ! was rolled out) reported initiation of sexual activity increased from 32.1% among 15 to 19 year olds to 83.5% among women 20 to 24, and the age of sexual debut was lower for those with less education and greater poverty <xref rid="pone.0113621-Zimbabwe2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>.This suggests that participants in both the SHAZ! Pilot Intervention and control arms were no more likely to initiate sexual activity than the general population, and may have had reduced risk for sexual initiation by participating in study.</p><p>Finally, the environment in Zimbabwe (particularly the hyper-inflation) at the time made it difficult to test &#x0201c;proof of concept&#x0201d;, and, as mentioned, only 60% of the participants ultimately received a micro-grant due, in part to the overarching context, and to difficulties in completing vocational training courses and developing business plans. While this was an important finding in itself for ongoing program improvement, such challenges rendered it difficult to determine the full effect of the economic intervention. It is important to note that in-spite of the overarching economic challenges, however, intervention participants did experience improvements in economic factors, suggesting that the SHAZ! Pilot Intervention had an impact even in a highly challenging setting. Ongoing analysis of qualitative data, not yet fully analyzed, will hopefully be of use in interpreting the findings presented in this paper.</p><p>In spite of these challenges, the study had several strengths, primarily the rigorous RCT design, the community-based process to design the intervention, and the use of ACASI and &#x0201c;young&#x0201d; face-to-face interviewers to improve the reporting of sensitive behaviors, and objective measures of biological outcomes. In addition, retention was higher than expected given the political and economic turmoil during the period, and the chaotic lives of adolescent orphans who are often shuttled between extended family households. This seems to reflect strong motivation among participants, and effective retention and outreach efforts by the study team. Adjusting the analyses for censoring did not change the findings of the study.</p><p>Given the urgent need to identify strategies that effectively reduce HIV risk among adolescent women in sub-Saharan Africa, it is critical that researchers and program staff take the lessons-learnt from the SHAZ! Pilot Intervention and apply them to ongoing and future programs and evaluations. Such lessons include, for example, that any future fielding or testing of the model should incorporate a wider-range of livelihoods options in the local language from basic short courses to more advanced training opportunities, with flexible hours to better meet the varying needs of adolescent women. These changes would help ensure that a greater proportion of participants could take full advantage of the economic opportunities provided. In addition, we recommend that future studies be implemented in a range of setting, including more stable economic and political environments than the one provided by Zimbabwe during the study period, to assess the broad potential of the model to be effective through the sub-Saharan African region. The extreme economic crisis in Zimbabwe at the time hindered the ability to fully evaluate the model and limits generalizability to more stable contexts. Finally, we recommend that any future evaluations consider other experimental and quasi-experimental designs that allow comparisons among amore true standard of care controls. For example, evaluators could consider phased roll-outs at a community level, where intervention communities are compared to those that are yet to receive the intervention. This would allow the research community to more clearly assess the effect of the intervention compared to standard of care.</p><p>This study reflects the challenges inherent in rigorously evaluating structural interventions among most-at-risk populations, where they are needed most. Through this evaluation, SHAZ! emerges as a promising model to build on towards preventing HIV among and improving the overall health and well-being of adolescent women. Ongoing work to address the inequitable burden of HIV among adolescent and young women in Africa, incorporating the lessons-learned from this study, is of critical importance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113621.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
