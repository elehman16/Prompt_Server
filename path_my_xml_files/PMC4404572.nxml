Considering the loss of potential years of productive life, the importance of successful resuscitation of paediatric victims cannot be overemphasized, although paediatric OHCA is an infrequent event.</p><p>In paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), high-quality chest compressions are essential to successful resuscitation. The 2010 European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and American Heart Association guidelines emphasize deeper (at least one third the anterior&#x02013;posterior (AP) diameter of the chest) and faster (at least 100 compressions per minute) chest compressions, with complete chest recoil after each compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These guidelines further indicate that rescuers may use either a one-hand or two-hand compression technique for a child victim, thereby allowing rescuers to adapt the technique to the victim&#x02019;s size and rescuer&#x02019;s strength. The one-hand technique has also been recommended for children based on the suppositions that less force is required for paediatric chest compressions and that the one-hand technique is associated with a lower risk of internal organ injury. However, the guideline that allows for two different compression methods for children might lead to confusion among inexperienced lay rescuers. Also, teaching both techniques may contribute to poor skill acquisition of basic life support among the general public.</p><p>Evidence supporting these suppositions is lacking, and there have been few comparative studies to determine which compression method is most likely to provide high-quality chest compressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These child manikin studies suggested that the two-hand technique generated higher compression pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and compression rate decreased faster with a one-hand technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, other quality indicators of chest compressions, such as compression depth and complete chest recoil, were hardly investigated. Furthermore, the participants of all previous studies were well-trained healthcare providers; therefore, their results cannot be applied to inexperienced laypersons. Additionally, no study has assessed compression quality of the one-hand technique comparing the right and left hands.</p><p>Hence, the aim of this study was to assess whether the quality of chest compressions as defined by adherence to current guidelines performed by inexperienced rescuers in a paediatric manikin model differed between three techniques: right one-hand, left one-hand, and two-hand. We hypothesized that the quality of chest compressions using a two-hand technique would be superior to the quality of compressions using a right or left one-hand technique, and using the dominant hand would have an advantage over using the non-dominant hand.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>We performed a prospective, randomised, crossover study approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). A total of 36 medical students, who had received CPR training within the past 1 year based on current guidelines, were recruited voluntarily over 6 months, using IRB-approved study posters throughout the Yonsei University College of Medicine. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic information, including age, gender, weight, height, and dominant hand, was recorded. We excluded participants with previous experience in performing CPR in real situations or with any medical condition that contraindicated the physical exertion required for CPR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Before beginning the study, each participant received a 5-minute demonstration with instructions about performing one-hand and two-hand chest compressions on children. During these instructions, high-quality chest compressions defined by deeper and faster compressions and complete chest recoil were also emphasised. The participants were blinded about the type of data being recorded. They were allowed to have a practice session to familiarise themselves with performing chest compressions using the Q-CPR<sup>TM</sup> compression sensor connected to HeartStart MRx (Philips Healthcare, Andover, MA, USA). This equipment recorded chest compression quality parameters, such as compression rate, compression depth, and residual leaning. All compressions were performed on Little junior<sup>TM</sup> (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway), a 6-year-old child manikin, with an AP diameter of 5.5 inch (14.0 cm). During compressions, the participants kneeled on the floor beside the manikin, to mimic the conditions of out-of-hospital CPR.</p><p>Each participant performed 2-minute continuous chest compressions without ventilation using the three techniques: right one-hand, left one-hand, and two-hand. Between each 2-minute period of compressions, the participant rested for 10 minutes to minimise fatigue. To avoid potential bias, no audiovisual feedback was provided to the participants during the experimental session. The order in which the three compression techniques were performed by each participant was randomly assigned by a randomization code using permuted block randomization for Williams 6*3 (sequence*method) crossover design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Chest compression quality data, including compression rate, compression depth, and residual leaning, were collected and analysed using the HeartStart Event Review Pro Hospital Edition, Version 4.1.2 (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway). Residual leaning was defined as &#x02265;2.5 kg residual force on the chest at the end of the release phase of each compression. The residual leaning rate was defined as the ratio of the number of compressions with residual leaning to the total number of compressions. To examine trends in chest compression performance over time, each 2-minute chest compression period was divided into six consecutive 20-second epochs. All chest compressions were recorded with a video recorder, and all trials were reviewed to count the number of times the hand(s) slipped on the compression sensor. At the end of the experimental session, participants used a visual analogue scale (0 mm, extremely easy to 100 mm, extremely difficult) to rate the subjective difficulty of chest compressions with each technique. Before and after the experimental session, the participants were asked which compression technique they preferred. The primary endpoints were mean chest compression rate and depth. Additional endpoints included the residual leaning rate, the number of slipped compressions, and the subjective degree of compression difficulty. Data were extracted by one investigator (MJK), who was blinded to the compression technique performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute INC., Cary, NC, USA). The sample size power was calculated according to our primary endpoints. Based on Udassi&#x02019;s report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], we chose 125 compressions/min as the mean compression rate and 32.9 mm as the mean depth of chest compression, using the two-hand technique. Differences between the three techniques of 10 compressions/minute and 5 mm mean compression depth (assuming a standard deviation of the differences of 20 and 10, respectively) were selected as the minimum clinically significant values. Using these values, we calculated that a sample size of 6 participants in each sequence group would be adequate, at a significance level of 0.05 (two sided) with 80% power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The total sample size was thus 36.</p><p>Discrete variables are presented as rate (%) and continuous variables as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD. The chest compression performance variables and subjective degree of difficulty were analysed using a linear mixed model for Williams crossover design. Three fixed effects were included: period effect, sequence effect (between-subject effect), and group effect (within-subject effect). Differences in the preferred chest compression technique between before and after the trial were analysed using a generalized McNemar&#x02019;s test. A linear mixed model was also used to compare trends in chest compression performance over time. Fixed effects were compression technique (between-subject effect), time (within-subject effect), and compression technique by time interaction. Additionally, we performed <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses to estimate the time points at which the compression depth significantly declined between 20-second epochs. In the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, the least square means of the three techniques were estimated at each epoch and compared by a linear mixed model. A <italic>p</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant and the significance level was adjusted using the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons for the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient demographics</title><p>All 36 participants successfully completed the study.

This indicates that all three techniques allow inexperienced rescuers to not only achieve the recommended compression rate but also maintain this rate for 2 minutes of continuous compressions.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that the compression depth using the two-hand technique was greater than that of the left or right one-hand technique. These results are consistent with those of two previous simulated paediatric resuscitation studies. Stevenson et al. reported that two-hand chest compressions produced significantly higher mean and peak pressures than one-hand compressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Udassi et al. likewise showed a trend towards higher compression depth and peak compression pressure with the two-hand technique, although the difference between two-hand and one-hand techniques was not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In this study, the depth difference between one-hand and two-hand techniques was 2.4&#x02013;3.3 mm. As there is no study that has identified the correlation of compression depth with treatment outcome in paediatric victims, it is difficult to determine the clinical significance of our result. For adult victims, Vadeboncoeur et al. reported that each 5-mm increase in mean chest compression depth significantly increased both survival in general and survival with favorable functional outcome, with an odds ratio of 1.29 and 1.30, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Our study also showed that compression depth continued to decline over time during the 2-minute trial period, although the decline was most prominent between the first and second epoch. The pattern of compression depth decay over time was comparable for all techniques, thereby suggesting that rescuer fatigue affected all techniques similarly. Udassi et al. reported no significant differences between two-hand and one-hand techniques for compression depth or peak compression pressure over time during simulated 5-minute paediatric CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. One possible explanation for the difference between their results and ours is that unlike the previous research, our participants were inexperienced rescuers who were not as capable of detecting deterioration in their technique due to lack of experience, and so may not attempt to compensate as much. With the manikin used in our study, a compression depth of 46.7 mm (one third the AP diameter) should be achieved to meet the current guidelines. However, we did note that almost all participants failed to achieve the recommended chest compression depth during every technique. Although our inexperienced participants may not be capable of compressing to a sufficient depth, other studies also showed that well-trained health care practitioners could not achieve the recommended depth in child manikins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This implies that child manikins may differ from real children in resistance and stiffness of the chest wall.</p><p>Complete chest recoil is another important aspect of high-quality CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; however, the influence of compression method on residual leaning rate has not been investigated. In this study, the residual leaning rate was higher with the two-hand technique than the left or right one-hand techniques. The posture of the two-hand technique with both arms forming an isosceles triangle will aid rescuers in loading their weight on the chest wall comfortably during each compression. Although this posture is helpful to achieve deeper compression, the risk of incomplete recoil would be increased. Interestingly, participant height was also associated with the residual leaning rate, and there was also a tendency for height to correlate inversely with the amount of recoil allowed. This result is consistent with that of a previous study in which the authors reported that rescuers &#x0003e;170 cm in height exhibited significantly more residual leaning than rescuers &#x0003c;170 cm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We used the Q-CPR&#x02122; compression sensor on the manikin&#x02019;s chest for recording chest compression quality parameters, and the hand position of the participants was predetermined on the sensor. Therefore, we could not determine whether the techniques differed in their ability to maintain the correct position of the hand(s). Instead of directly evaluating correct hand position, we recorded the number of times the hand slipped on the sensor. In Peska&#x02019;s study, 65.6% of participants preferred the two-hand compression technique, partly because it was easier to maintain their balance with that technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, our results did not demonstrate a difference among techniques for the number of times the hand(s) slipped. Our participants did think that performing chest compressions using the two-hand technique was easier than the other techniques. Unfamiliarity with the one-hand technique might have contributed to its subjective difficulty. Also, for such a reason as mentioned, the majority of participants favoured the two-hand compression technique both before and after the experimental session, which was consistent with the findings of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Handedness is the tendency to consistently favour the use of one hand/arm for performing selected tasks. In general, dominant arm performance is better for activities requiring precision of inter-joint coordination (e.g., cutting paper with scissors), whereas non-dominant arm performance is more specialized for control of steady-state limb position (e.g., holding a piece of paper for cutting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Contrary to our expectations, chest compression quality was similar for the right and left one-hand techniques. This suggests that arm dominance does not affect compression depth and rate. Sainburg and Kalakanis reported that during rapid targeted reaching movements, the right and left hands showed a similar time course of improvement in final position accuracy over repeated trials, and the final accuracy was similar for both hands after task adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These findings are consistent with our results. Indeed, performance of chest compressions may be affected by multiple factors, such as age, gender, and muscle power of the rescuer, in addition to handedness.</p><p>There were limitations to this study. First, the study used a child manikin to simulate paediatric cardiac arrest. Although various child manikins are widely used in paediatric CPR training and studies investigating CPR performance, they may not exactly replicate the characteristics (e.g., stiffness, resistance) of the paediatric thorax. Therefore, our findings may not be applicable to actual clinical settings. Additionally, our use of only a 6-year-old child manikin indicates that our results may not reflect chest compression performance on children of all ages. Second, our use of the Q-CPR<sup>TM</sup> compression sensor to record chest compression quality parameters may have affected the results, as the participants were not familiar with performing compressions on it. However, we attempted to minimise this confounding factor by allowing a practice session before starting the experimental session. Third, most participants were right-handed (as are most Koreans), so we were unable to examine the effect of handedness on chest compression quality. The participants were also young and healthy; thus, our results may not be generalisable to other rescuers. However, most parents are also young and healthy, and the benefits of a two-hand technique may be better suited for older and less healthy individuals who may have more difficulty providing the compression force required for the one-hand technique. Fourth, although the medical students who participated in the study were inexperienced in real-world CPR, they would have had more knowledge of resuscitation, anatomy, and physiology than a normal population. Additionally, our participants were more likely to be enthusiastic and confident, considering that they all actively responded to posters advertising the study. These characteristics of our participants hinder generalization of our results to inexperienced rescuers. Fifth, participants were aware that they were being evaluated and videotaped. This may have led to the Hawthorne effect, in which the participants performed better than they would in a real-life situation. Conversely, they may have performed compressions less effectively because no actual child required resuscitation. Nevertheless, except for the issue of the participants&#x02019; handedness, it is likely that these limitations would have affected chest compression performance similarly for all techniques. Finally, we did not include ventilation despite the fact that ventilation is more important in asphyxia-induced arrest (the most common etiology in paediatric victims). We do acknowledge that this was a simulation study limited to the investigation of compression and suggest that further studies are needed to explore these limitations in a clinical context.</p><p>In this study of simulated paediatric CPR performed by inexperienced rescuers, we demonstrated that the mean compression rate did not differ among three chest compression techniques, nor did the compression rate change over a 2-minute period of continuous chest compressions for any technique. The mean compression depth using the two-hand technique was greater than that of the left or right one-hand technique, but most participants did not achieve the recommended depth with any technique. Moreover, the chest compression depth declined over time during all three techniques. The incomplete chest recoil occurred more frequently with the two-hand technique than with the one-hand technique. The performance of chest compressions was similar for the right and left one-hand techniques. These findings are important for instructors as well as for team members who watch CPR quality during actual resuscitation. By knowing tendencies of different techniques, they can use this information to recognise these specific problems with performance.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>YSP designed this study with MJK and SHK.
