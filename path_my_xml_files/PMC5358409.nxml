However, intestinal spasms often result in a prolonged examination time, increased operating difficulties, decreased polyp detection rate, and failure to complete the procedure clinically. Therefore, exploring alternative approaches that can reduce the pain in patients during colonoscopy is of utmost importance, and finding the optimal preoperative administration to improve the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy is also necessary. This study aimed to investigate the effects of the prophylactic administration of pinaverium bromide before colonoscopy and the effects of pinaverium bromide alone at different time points or combined with scopolamine butylbromide.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was performed on a cohort of 1000 patients who underwent colonoscopy in outpatient clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital. The patients were randomly assigned to the following groups: Group A, given oral pinaverium bromide (100 mg, three times a day) one day before examination combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide (20 mg) 10 min before colonoscopy; Group B<sub>0</sub>, given pinaverium bromide alone on the day of colonoscopy (100 mg, three times a day); Group B<sub>1</sub>, given pinaverium bromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) one day before colonoscopy; Group B<sub>2</sub>, given pinaverium bromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) two days before colonoscopy; and Group C, given scopolamine butylbromide alone (20 mg) before colonoscopy. The successful rate of colonoscopy, procedure time, degree of abdominal pain, and polyp detection rate were recorded and compared among all groups.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The successful rate of colonoscopy in Group B<sub>1</sub> (82.0%) and Group B<sub>2</sub> (83.0%) was significantly higher than that in Group B<sub>0</sub> (62.0%, all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The time to reach the ileocecal region in Group B<sub>1</sub> and Group B<sub>2</sub> were lower than those in Group B<sub>0</sub> (all <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).

Nonanesthetic colonoscopy is popular in clinical practice in China. However, the intestinal spasms often result in a prolonged examination time, increased operating difficulties, decreased polyp detection rate, and failure to complete the procedure clinically. Previous studies have shown that colonoscopic examination could not be completed in 2.4% patients because of pain associated with the procedure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition, re-examination was refused in 20.7% of patients due to a high fear factor. Therefore, exploring alternative approaches that can reduce the pain in patients during colonoscopy is of utmost importance, and finding the optimal preoperative administration to improve the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy is also necessary. In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of the prophylactic administration of pinaverium bromide before colonoscopy and the effects of pinaverium bromide alone at different time points or combined with scopolamine butylbromide on the successful rate of colonoscopy, procedure time, abdominal pain, and polyp detection rate, in order to provide insights in the application of pinaverium bromide during nonanesthetic colonoscopy in China.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This randomized controlled trial was performed on a total of 1000 patients, who visited the outpatient clinic of Wuhan Union Hospital from August 2015 to June 2016 for a routine colonoscopy, and patients were randomly assigned in a controlled fashion into five groups (<italic>n</italic> = 200 in each group): Group A, given oral pinaverium bromide (100 mg, three times a day) one day before examination combined with intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide (20 mg) 10 min before colonoscopy; Group B<sub>0</sub>, given pinaverium bromide alone on the day of colonoscopy (100 mg, three times a day); Group B<sub>1</sub>, given pinaverium bromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) one day before colonoscopy; Group B<sub>2</sub>, given pinaverium bubromide alone (100 mg, three times a day) two days before colonoscopy; and Group C, intramuscularly given scopolamine butylbromide alone (20 mg) before colonoscopy. Pinaverium bromide alone at different time points or combined with other medication were randomly assigned according to the random number table. The individuals in each group were randomly assigned to different treatment groups. Patients with the following conditions were excluded from this study: Colon surgery, an incomplete intestinal obstruction or evidence of previous severe intestinal stenosis, severe cardiopulmonary disease, pregnancy, and administration of antispasmodic or anticholinergic medications within one month before the procedure. Colonoscopy was performed by an experienced gastroenterologist who was also responsible for evaluating the examination duration, the degree of abdominal pain, and polyp detection, which were recorded by the assistants.

ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Nonanesthetic colonoscopy involves intermittent air insufflation and constant rotation of the endoscope, which, due to the anatomical characteristics of the intestine, can easily stretch and pull the intestines to form loops. The stretch might induce intestinal spasms, especially when patients are under stress, which might lead to abdominal pain and other discomforts. In the most severe cases, patients might not be able to tolerate the pain and the examination needs to be terminated early. Therefore, gastroenterologists are constantly exploring alternative, effective, and safe approaches to reduce the discomfort and pain in patients during colonoscopic examination. In the past, intramuscular injections of anisodamine or diazepam were given before colonoscopy, but general anesthesia is more commonly used in recent years. Although these methods can partially reduce intestinal cramps and alleviate abdominal pain, they are also often accompanied with various adverse reactions such as dry mouth, dysuria, drowsiness, palpitations, and dizziness. In addition to the adverse effects of short-acting anesthetics on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems, the need for anesthesiologists and additional personnel during colonoscopy significantly increases the cost of surgery. Furthermore, if operation-induced intestinal looping occurs when the patient is under general anesthesia, the risk of intestinal injury increases whereas the overall safety factor decreases.</p><p>Pinaverium bromide is a highly selective L-type calcium channel blocker that regulates visceral hypersensitivity and abnormal intestinal movement by inhibiting calcium influx.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Pinaverium bromide not only promotes regular bowel movement and reduces colonic transit time but also partially relieves abdominal pain by lowering the pain threshold in patients through modulating visceral hypersensitivity. Pinaverium bromide has been used to alleviate the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and pains related to colon cramps.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Its inhibitory effect on intestinal smooth muscle contraction primarily reduces ineffective and transient spastic contractions but does not affect the spontaneous contraction of the intestine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] During colonoscopy, air is intermittently insufflated to dilate the intestine, which in turn causes pain in the patients. A previous study has shown that pinaverium bromide could inhibit the activities of reagents that induced colon contractility;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] however, it could also alleviate pain by reducing sigmoid pressure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Pinaverium bromide has no anticholinergic activity and has a very low systemic absorption rate, with only 10% of the oral dose going into blood circulation. Of the 10% present in the circulation, 95&#x02013;98% is bound to plasma proteins and is excreted through the intestinal tract after being metabolized in the liver. Therefore, pinaverium bromide acts mainly on the gastrointestinal tract with high selectivity and has no adverse cardiovascular effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>It has previously been reported that pinaverium bromide was a simple and effective reagent in preventing abdominal pain caused by intestinal cramps during colonoscopy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In the current study, we demonstrated that abdominal pain and discomfort were significantly reduced when patients were given pinaverium bromide 1&#x02013;2 days before colonoscopy. In addition, significant sense of intestinal relaxation, ease of endoscope maneuver, and a shortened procedure time were observed during colonoscopy. However, the study also found that pinaverium bromide taken two days before examination had no additional beneficial effect over pinaverium bromide taken one day before colonoscopy. This indicated that the administration of pinaverium bromide alone one day before procedure was as effective as pinaverium bromide administered two days before colonoscopy. Pinaverium bromide could alleviate the symptoms of abdominal pain in routine colonoscopy.</p><p>Scopolamine butylbromide is a synthetic, peripheral cholinergic receptor blocker that ameliorates the hyperreactivity of cholinergic receptors in the preganglionic sympathetic neurons and reduces the overcontraction of visceral smooth muscles.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In contrast, an M-cholinergic receptor blocker, anisodamine, can inhibit peripheral cholinergic activities but its therapeutic dose has no significant inhibitory effect on excessive smooth muscle spasm. Meanwhile, the highly water-soluble and nearly lipid-insoluble properties of scopolamine butylbromide prevent it from passing through the blood-brain barrier.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has no antagonistic effect on central M-cholinergic receptors and has very weak activities in the central nervous system, and therefore rarely causes dry mouth or other clinical adverse reactions. A study has shown that scopolamine butylbromide is safe and effective for endoscopic examination and treatment of the gastrointestinal system.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The current study revealed that the combined use of pinaverium bromide and scopolamine butylbromide achieved significantly better results than pinaverium bromide or scopolamine butylbromide used alone.</p><p>This study had certain limitations that should be taken into consideration. This was only a single-blind trial. In addition, the sample size was a little small.</p><p>In summary, the study demonstrated that pinaverium bromide alone taken one day before colonoscopy can effectively alleviate abdominal pain, facilitate the completion of routine colonoscopy, and reduce the examination time. Preoperative administration of pinaverium bromide has improved the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy. Moreover, the combined use of pinaverium bromide one day before the colonoscopy and intramuscular injection of scopolamine butylbromide shortly before colonoscopy demonstrated even better therapeutic effects, with significantly enhanced polyp detection rate. In conclusion, the combination of pinaverium bromide and scopolamine butylbromide treatment is inexpensive and safe, does not show significant adverse effects and significantly improves patient compliance. Therefore, the combination of pinaverium bromide and scopolamine butylbromide might be a promising and novel approach in the preoperative administration to improve the quality of nonanesthetic colonoscopy.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
