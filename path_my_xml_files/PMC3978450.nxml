Aggressive treatment for patients whose disease is rapidly progressing (progressors) may preserve joint function. However, it is very difficult using standard technologies to identify progressors. Identification of progressors is also important as most anti-inflammatory treatments are associated with side effects emphasizing that only those who are in most need of aggressive treatment (that is, progressors) should be appropriately treated, which may improve the benefit-risk ratio of these therapies.</p><p>In RA, the periarticular bone and cartilage undergo major destructive changes, whereas the altered turnover of the synovial membrane results in an expansion of the synovial membrane. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the most prominent component of these tissues and the most abundant ECM protein is type I collagen. However, type II collagen is the most abundant protein in cartilage and the most investigated collagen with arthritides. Destruction of the ECM is mediated by enzymatic cleavage by different proteases, though predominantly by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMPs have been shown to be highly up-regulated with RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the tissue destruction with specific MMPs elevated with disease is a central player in inflammatory disease, such as RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The action of MMPs on ECM results in the release of small protein 'fingerprints' into the circulation, which may be used as markers of tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It seems reasonable to hypothesize that connective tissue destruction mediated by MMPs could be associated with disease progression in RA.</p><p>Type I collagen can be degraded by several proteinases and in the process yields various products, namely CTX-I, ICTP, PINP and C1M (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). CTX-I is a measurement of Cathepsin K-mediated destruction of type I collagen and is the standard measure for bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. ICTP is a triple cross-linked carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen generated by MMPs and destroyed by Cathepsin K and, therefore, not related to bone type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Lastly, PINP is widely used as a measure of type I collagen formation in bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Biochemical markers of type I collagen</bold>.

This ELISA does not recognize intact type I collagen, other collagens, or the products of other proteinase-mediated collagen degradation. C1M is a product of MMP-2, -9 and -13 cleavage of type I collagen, but not MMP-3, -8 or Cathepsin K cleavage. Therefore, C1M is not a biomarker of hard tissue (that is, bone), but a biomarker of soft tissue destruction, due to the destruction of the fragment by Cathepsin K. Therefore, it represents another pool of type I collagen degradation than PINP, CTX-I and ICTP, namely, exclusively MMP-mediated connective tissue destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether MMP-mediated type I collagen destruction, measured by serum levels of C1M, could be a novel biochemical marker for identification of progressors in RA. We investigated whether baseline levels of serum C1M were correlated with structural status and progression of RA, by measuring change in joint space narrowing, total Sharp score and erosion, in the placebo group of the biomarker study of the LITHE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We, furthermore, investigated whether serum C1M levels were altered following treatment of RA with an anti-IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in the biomarker study in the LITHE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Lastly, we investigated if the change in C1M at four weeks was related to change in one year radiographic measures and if including the standard biomarker (C-reactive protein, CRP) of RA increased the predictive value of C1M.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>LITHE study</title><p>The LITHE Biomarker study formed part of the LITHE study (ClinicalTrials.goc: NCT00106535), which was a two-year phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of TCZ (4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg every four weeks) + MTX (10 to 25 mg/week) in patients with moderate to severe active RA with an inadequate response to MTX. RA was diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and had to have lasted for six or more months before entering the study. Moreover, the patients had to have radiographically confirmed joint erosion.</p><p>The LITHE Biomarker study included 585 patients followed for the first 52 weeks from baseline. Biomarker patients were equally distributed among the treatment groups; placebo (PBO; <italic>n </italic>= 199), 4 mg/kg TCZ (TCZ4; <italic>n </italic>= 200) and 8 mg/kg TCZ (TCZ8; <italic>n </italic>= 186). Stable non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid (&#x02264;10 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) doses were continued throughout the study. Every 4 weeks, patients received an infusion of TCZ 4 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg, or placebo for a total of up to 13 infusions in 52 weeks. Serum for biomarker research was collected following overnight fasting at baseline, at weeks 4, 16, 24 and 52 and non-fasted at Week 2. All samples were stored below -70&#x000b0;C until assay.</p><p>Patients who failed to respond to treatment during the study, that is, experienced &#x02264;20% improvement from baseline in both swollen (SJC) and tender joint counts (TJC) at Week 16, could receive blinded rescue therapy from Week 16, and subsequently, 12 weeks later (at Week 28) if there was still &#x02264;20% improvement. First-step rescue patients receiving PBO + MTX switched at Week 16 to TCZ 4 mg/kg + MTX. Patients receiving 4 mg/kg TCZ + MTX switched to 8 mg/kg + MTX and patients on 8 mg/kg + MTX discontinued treatment. Second-step rescue at Week 28 consisted of TCZ 8 mg/kg + MTX, which were offered through to Week 52 if inadequate response persisted after three doses of first-step rescue therapy. Patients who did not respond after three doses of second-step rescue discontinued treatment. The patients from the PBO + MTX group, who received rescue therapy, were designated escapers. Half of the patients receiving PBO + MTX at baseline were receiving first step rescue therapy at Week 52. Only six patients were on second step rescue therapy at Week 52 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Study design of the PBO + MTX group (<italic>n </italic>= 199) in the LITHE biomarker study</bold>.

Radiographs were assessed with joint space narrowing (JSN), the total Genant-modified Sharp scoring system (mTSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and erosion by two independent readers, who were blinded to treatment assignment, chronological order of radiographs and patients' clinical responses. The average score of the two readers was used in the analysis. The visual analog scale of pain (VAS) and disease activity score-28-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) were assessed at baseline, and at weeks 24 and 52.

All patients in the LITHE study provided written informed consent. According to Danish law, it is not required to get ethical approval when measuring biochemical markers in previously collected samples, hence, there was no ethical approval for this particular study of C1M in the LITHE serum samples. The study was conducted according to the Principal of Good Clinical Practice and according to the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical markers</title><p>CRP was quantified in patients at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks.

Spearman's ranked correlation was conducted on baseline level of serum C1M, age, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, VAS pain, DAS28-ESR, HAQ, JSN and mTSS. The same correlation test was applied to compare baseline C1M with change in CRP, VAS pain, HAQ, DAS28-ESR, JSN and mTSS at weeks 24 and 52.</p><p>Multiple regression analysis was performed on log-transformed data for delta structural progression (JSN, mTSS and erosion score) and C1M, with the cofounders age, BMI, disease duration, baseline CRP and baseline structural status.</p><p>Changes from baseline in serum C1M levels were studied as a function of time and treatment. Differences between the levels of serum C1M at each time point were compared by two-way ANOVA. The level of change from baseline in C1M for escape patients and non-escape patients in the PBO groups was assessed by two-way ANOVA.</p><p>To test if CRP increased the predictive value of C1M to predict progression, high and low levels of C1M and CRP were determined as higher and lower the respective median. This provided four groups: 1: High C1M and high CRP, 2: High C1M and low CRP, 3: Low C1M and high CRP and 4: low C1M and low CRP. Odds ratio for structural progression (JSN and mTSS) were assessed between group 4 and the other groups.

Selecting the patients who will benefit from a specific treatment would be an advantage in inflammatory arthritis diseases in particular, as most, if not all, anti-inflammatory treatments are associated with severe, but manageable, side effects. In this study we investigated if a novel assay detecting a protein fingerprint of type I collagen degradation could be a novel biochemical marker for identification of progressors in RA. We also investigated the change in serum C1M levels following treatment with TCZ and the predictive value of C1M in combination with CRP. We found that 1) C1M levels were associated with disease progression, 2) C1M levels were correlated with disease activity at baseline, 3) baseline C1M was a significant predictor of structural progression, 4) TCZ dose-dependently inhibited the level of C1M as early as two weeks after initiating treatment, and 5) change in C1M at 16 weeks after treatment initiation was related to the level of radiographic changes over one year. The current findings contribute to the literature and the scientific field by demonstrating that quantifying specific tissue destruction may aid in selecting the RA patients in most need of aggressive treatment.</p><p>Serological biochemical markers are receiving increased attention in drug development and for guiding evidence-based patient management decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A range of traditional markers may provide valuable in managing RA, such as CRP, ESR, and the interleukins-1 and -6. However, these markers are systemic biomarkers. A newer class of molecular biochemical markers, also assessed by simple ELISA technologies, provides independent and additional information reflecting structural changes within the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These markers - protein fragments - are referred to as protein fingerprints, because they are end results of specific pathological events, proteolytic degradation of, that is, the joint structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The protein fingerprint degradation markers of type I, II and III collagen have been studied and all three have been shown to be descriptive of disease progression and response to anti-inflammatory therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In this study, we further show that C1M is highly correlated to CRP levels (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), indicating that type I collagen degradation in RA is related to inflammation. Therefore, exploring C1M in RA will indicate the state of the specific inflammatory structural changes and not the systemic state of the inflammation. Due to the relationship between C1M and CRP, we have not investigated the difference between the biomarkers in predicting progressors of disease.</p><p>Interpreting biochemical markers found in serum is associated with many limitations, as several different tissues at different rates may produce, and thus contribute to the total pool of, the molecular marker. Type I collagen is abundant in many tissues throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Bone in particular may be a prime candidate contributing to the serological C1M pool as it is naturally being constantly renewed. However, C1M has been shown not to be correlated with bone metastases, which have high and very aggressive bone resorption, and, furthermore, not to recognize MMP-3, -8 and Cathepsin K-cleaved type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, C1M is a biochemical marker with increased accuracy for connective tissue turnover. Other biomarkers of type I collagen degradation have previously been described in the literature in relation to RA. ICTP, a C-terminal degradation fragment of the mature type I collagen, has been shown to be related to the severity of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as disease activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has been shown to be useful for assessing the effect of potentially disease modifying therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. ICTP in synovial fluid and serum has been shown to be correlated to radiographic measures of joint destruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, RA disease duration has shown to be a cofounder in ICTP levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. ICTP has also been described to be correlated to disease activity in reactive arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Another marker of type I collagen, CTX-I, a marker of Cathepsin K-mediated type I collagen degradation reflecting bone resorption, has previously been described to predict disease progression, albeit only in the worst quartile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown in a study of early RA patients that CTX-I at baseline, adjusted for cofounders, was significantly associated with radiographic progression in the RA MRI erosion score and classical radiographs over one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A drawback of this study, however, was that there was a considerable overlap in CTX-I between progressors and non-progressors. The same group of investigators has shown that the relationship between elevated serum levels of CTX-I and subsequent joint destruction still existed at 10-year follow-up. However, the relationship was weaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the assessment of C1M as a marker of structural progression in RA, we have utilized radiographic changes (JSN, mTSS and erosion score) after 24 and 52 weeks. The significance level of the correlation between C1M and radiographic scores was strongest at 52 weeks, especially with mTSS. This is due to the low sensitivity of the radiographic scores to changes in joints over a short period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The low sensitivity led to high variation in scores at 24 weeks. The variation decreased when assessing the radiographic scores at 52 weeks and hence increasing the statistical power. JSN is a visualization of the space between the joints and a reduction in JSN indicates loss of cartilage and meniscal damage, hence only a part on the JSN could is associated with type I collagen, which partly could explain the lack of correlation.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the effect of concomitant intake of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and corticosteroid. These medications could have an influence on the level of C1M, but this contribution cannot be studied in this setting. Especially, prednisolone intake influences the level of inflammation and joint damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, patients already take stable doses of prednisolone and/or other drugs at the time they enter the study, hence the effect of the drugs might be obliterated in the baseline measurements of C1M. Moreover, the study population of this investigation has long disease duration at baseline and profound joint damage, hence the study population is in an advanced disease stage. It is therefore not a disease population in which a biomarker of progression is needed. A study population with shorter disease duration is more ideal for this type of study. However, the disease progression of these patients is not as profound and an even larger study population would be needed. Our present study aims at identifying progressors of disease by the biomarker by which this study population is adequate, due to the rapid progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that a simple serum biochemical marker measurement is able to predict fast progressors in RA and we also illustrated that C1M could be used as an efficacy marker. It is critical to effectively treat tissue destructive diseases, such as RA, early to suppress inflammation and prevent destruction of the joint.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: body mass index; C1M: type I collagen degraded by MMPs; CRP: C-reactive protein; CTX-1: degradation product of c-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen; DAS: Disease Activity Score; ECM: extracellular matrix; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; ESR: erythrocyte sedimentation rate; HAQ: Health Assessment Questionnaire; JSN: joint space narrowing; MMP: matrix metallo-proteinase; mTSS: modified total Sharp score; MTX: methotrexate; PBO: placebo; RA: rheumatoid arthritis; SJC: swollen joint count; TCZ: tocilizumab; TJC: tender joint count; VAS: visual analog scale</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>ASS, ACBJ, DJL, IB and MK are full time employees at and CC and MK hold stock in Nordic Bioscience.
