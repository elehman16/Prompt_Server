In this parallel-group, randomized, controlled, open-label trial, we aimed to evaluate whether an oral supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks could improve physical performance and muscle strength parameters in a group of community-dwelling healthy older women. Eighty healthy women attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program were divided into two equal groups of 40, and 32 of the treated women and 33 control completed the study. We considered a change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) score as the primary outcome and changes in the peak torque (PT) isometric and isokinetic strength of the lower limbs, 6-minute walking test (6MWT), handgrip strength and endurance as secondary outcomes. Body composition was assessed with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT). The mean difference between the two groups on pre-post change were finally calculated (delta) for each outcome. After 8 weeks, there were no significant differences between the groups&#x02019; SPPB, handgrip strength or DXA parameters. The group treated with HMB scored significantly better than the control group for PT isokinetic flexion (delta = 1.56&#x000b1;1.56 Nm; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03) and extension (delta = 3.32&#x000b1;2.61 Nm; <italic>p</italic> = 0.03), PT isometric strength (delta = 9.74&#x000b1;3.90 Nm; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), 6MWT (delta = 7.67&#x000b1;8.29 m; <italic>p</italic> = 0.04), handgrip endurance (delta = 21.41&#x000b1;16.28 s; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02), and muscle density assessed with pQCT. No serious adverse effects were reported in either group. In conclusion, a nutritional supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks in healthy elderly women had no significant effects on SPPB, but did significantly improve several muscle strength and physical performance parameters.</p><sec id="sec001"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02118181">NCT02118181</ext-link>

[<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The issue of sarcopenia also seems to be particularly relevant to older women, who on average have lower amounts of muscle mass than men, and twice the rate of decline in strength. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Among the interventions that might delay progression to sarcopenia, dietary supplementation seems to be worth investigating. Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) has recently been considered for its multiple muscle-sparing properties: it enhances whole-body protein synthesis, increases collagen synthesis, inhibits protein degradation, and increases cholesterol synthesis in the muscle cell membrane. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] HMB supplementation reportedly has positive effects on several conditions characterized by severe muscle mass loss, such as end-stage congestive heart failure, cancer and chronic renal disease. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Although older people are particularly liable to sarcopenia, limited research is available on HMB supplementation in this age group. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Some studies on the elderly have shown a substantial positive effect of HMB supplementation on body composition and physical performance parameters, [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] but they were often based on analyses that did not distinguish between the genders, they focused mainly on patients with wasting diseases, and body composition measurements or physical performance parameters were often lacking.

The aim of our study was therefore to evaluate whether an oral supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks could improve physical performance, muscle strength and body composition parameters in a group of healthy elderly women attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was conducted at the Geriatrics Department of Padova University between 01 February and 30 June 2014. Women over 65 years of age were recruited on a voluntary basis from among older people attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program at public gyms in Padova. This training mainly consisted of aerobic exercises designed to improve speed of muscle contraction, and only a small part of it was dedicated to resistance exercises, essentially to improve handgrip strength.</p><p>Candidates were excluded if they showed signs of renal failure, chronic or acute infection, a history or evidence of malignancy in the past 5 years (except for non-melanoma skin neoplasia), significant cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases, uncontrolled metabolic diseases (diabetes, anemia or thyroid disease), or electrolyte abnormalities, or if they were already using dietary supplements other than cholecalciferol. During a screening visit, their healthy condition was ascertained by trained medical personnel based on their medical history, a clinical examination, and routine biochemical tests (e.g. glycemia, renal and liver function tests, proteins, electrolytes, and a complete blood count). During the follow-up, all participants continued their fitness program and their attendance was monitored and recorded twice a week.</p><p>The study was designed in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and approved by the Ethical Committee (IRB) of Padova on 12 December 2013 (<xref rid="pone.0141757.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0141757.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Files).

Walking time was recorded as the best performance achieved in two walks at the participant&#x02019;s usual pace along a corridor 4 m long. For the chair stands test, participants were asked to rise 5 times from a seated position as quickly as possible with their hands folded across their chest. For the standing balance tests, participants were asked to stand in 3 increasingly difficult positions (with their feet side by side, then in semi-tandem and full tandem positions) for 10 s each. Each test was scored from 0 (worst) to 4 (best), and the scores for all three tests were combined to obtain a composite score of 0 to 12, higher scores reflecting better physical function.</p><p>The secondary outcome measures concerned muscle strength and physical performance:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>isometric knee extension torque and isokinetic (flexion and extension) strength were tested on the dominant side using a dynamometer chair (Easytech s.r.l., Florence, Italy). Participants were positioned upright with straps to fix their hips to the chair. Participants were asked to reach their maximal voluntary contraction for each of the three measurements, then to stop contracting 3 to 5 s after reaching their maximum effort. Each measurement was repeated 3 times and patients rested for 3 min between trials. The highest peak torque (PT) was used for the analysis.[<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The coefficient of variation (CV) for double determinations in 20 women was 7.5% for isometric and 7.7% for isokinetic strength. Previously-ascertained intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), standard errors of measurement (SEM), and minimum differences needed to be considered real (MD) for isokinetic strength measured in 20 women (aged between 65 and 85 years) by three different clinicians were: ICC = 0.92; SEM &#x000b1;5.9 Nm; and MD = 16.3 Nm [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>];</p></list-item><list-item><p>6-minute walking test (6MWT).

They were asked to grip the dynamometer, progressing smoothly up to their maximal strength in response to a voice command, without any wrenching or jerking motion. Three measurements were obtained with a 1 min rest between trials and the highest measurement was used in our analyses.

Forearm length was measured from the olecranon to the ulna styloid process, and tibia length from the medial malleolus to the medial condyle. A pQCT scout view was obtained to establish an anatomical reference line bisecting the medial edge of the end of the distal radius or tibia. Starting from this reference line, scans were obtained at sites 4% and 66% along the length of the shaft for the radius, and at sites 4%, 14%, 38%, and 66% along the length of the tibia. The following parameters regarding muscle and fat mass were considered: muscle density (mg/cm<sup>3</sup>), muscle and fat areas (mm<sup>2</sup>), and the ratio of fat to muscle (%). Muscle and fat areas were calculated at the sites 66% along the length of the tibia and radius. The muscle cross-sectional area included the areas of blood vessels, tendons and ligaments because they have the same attenuation coefficients as muscle; the fat mass area included both extra- and intramuscular fat.

There may be several reasons to explain these findings. First, it may be that the follow-up was not long enough to detect any improvement in SPPB score, which is a more complex measure than those assessing muscle power. Having said that, we feel that our short follow-up probably improved our participants&#x02019; compliance with the treatment. Second, our participants had high baseline scores for the SPPB, gait speed and chair stands time (probably because they exercised regularly), and this may have made any further improvement impossible. This ceiling effect seems to be particularly relevant for an item like the SPPB score, which is by nature categorical and consequently less sensitive to changes than a continuous numerical scale. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Analyzing gait speed and chair stands time as continuous variables did not substantially modify our results, however, suggesting that the SPPB is less sensitive than other measures of physical performance and muscle strength. Finally, it may be that the effects of HMB supplementation induce significant differences in measures that test muscle mass changes rather than muscle contraction speed, leading to significant differences in muscle density and muscle strength tests, but not in SPPB total or single-item scores. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It is also worth adding that our findings coincide with those of another study on healthy older people with high baseline SPPB scores. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Like ourselves, Stout et al. reported finding no significant improvements in healthy older men and women in the get-up-and-go test (which has similar characteristics to the SPPB). [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Further research is needed on this aspect because the SPPB is an important predictor of various outcomes in older people. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>As for the secondary outcomes investigated, isometric and isokinetic muscle strength are important in the elderly: low levels of isokinetic and isometric strength are significantly associated with various negative outcomes in older women, such as falls, low bone mineral density, hip fractures, and functional limitations in activities of daily living. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Our study shows that an oral supplement containing HMB was able to improve both isometric and isokinetic muscle strength in active older women attending a mild fitness program. It is worth noting, however, that both these outcomes dropped somewhat in the control group at the follow-up by comparison with the baseline assessment, probably because the fitness program focused mainly on improving muscle contraction speed. Our results are consistent with other studies in which HMB was administered together with intensive resistance training (a type of exercise that would suffice alone to improve these parameters). [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Although our study design (with no group taking a placebo) may limit their generalizability, our findings could be of clinical importance in the longer term because HMB supplementation might help to slow the physiological decline in muscle strength (estimated to occur at a rate of about 10&#x02013;15% per decade). [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] On the other hand, we found no significant improvement in handgrip strength after HMB supplementation&#x02014;a result consistent with another study reporting a substantial increase in the strength of the lower limbs, but not of handgrip. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Further studies are needed to clarify these results, given the importance of handgrip strength as a reliable parameter of several negative outcomes in the elderly. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Albeit with the limitations due to it being an open-label trial, another important finding of our study is that HMB supplementation was able to improve handgrip endurance and 6MWT as well. Most of the activities of daily living demand a submaximal force [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], so the ability of oral HMB supplementation to improve these two items could be clinically important in delaying disability in older people.</p><p>The significant improvements observed in isometric and isokinetic strength, as well as in 6MWT and handgrip endurance, were associated not with any increase in muscle mass (as assessed by DXA), but with an increase in muscle density (investigated using pQCT). This morphological change might reflect a lower quantity of intramuscular fat and could be seen as an indication of better muscle quality. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>In addition, the significant improvements that we identified were obtained with lower doses of HMB than those used in other studies in older people. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Most researchers seem to agree that the optimal dosage of HMB is 3 g a day delivered in 3 equal doses. While this strategy might be appropriate in other conditions affecting older people (such as wasting diseases, loss of appetite, or gastrointestinal diseases), it might interfere with compliance in older people who are fit. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Moreover, HMB is an amino acid precursor and several works have shown that an excessively high protein intake is associated with a decline in renal function [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], so it may be that higher doses of HMB have a paradoxical effect on strength and physical performance. Be that as it may, the results that we obtained with a single daily intake of a low dose of HMB are encouraging and warrant further studies on healthy older people with a longer follow-up.</p><p>The present study has some limitations that need to be mentioned. First, it was not a double-blind trial, so we cannot rule out the possibility of the differences emerging between the two groups being due partly to the treatment group&#x02019;s expectations. We also identified only small changes in muscle strength and physical performance parameters that, though statistically significant, might well be clinically irrelevant; this was probably due to the short follow-up considered. A second limitation lies in that only women were involved, so our findings may not be applicable to men too. A part of the literature suggests, however, that women experience a more severe muscle loss than men [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], and they are more liable to protein malnutrition. [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Third, only women regularly attending a fitness program twice a week were included, and it may be that different results would emerge in other settings. Moreover, they are volunteers and also this aspect could add a bias in the interpretation of our findings. Another methodological limitation is that the changes between follow-up and baseline have a non-normal distribution probably due to the limited sample size included. Although GLM is fairly robust also for non-normal variables, the results should be interpreted with this consideration in mind. Another possible methodological limit could be considered the number of statistical tests performed that should be carefully considered in interpreting our findings. Finally, plasma or urinary HMB levels were not measured as markers of compliance in our study, although we did assess compliance frequently by means of weekly phone calls and a face-to-face interview during the study. A strength of our work, on the other hand, concerns the global assessment of physical performance and muscle strength, explored using reliable tests, such as DXA for body composition (the preferred method for assessing body composition in older people) [<xref rid="pone.0141757.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and pQCT, which enables muscle composition to be estimated too.</p><p>In conclusion, a nutritional supplement containing 1.5 g of calcium HMB for 8 weeks in our sample of healthy elderly women attending a twice-weekly mild fitness program had no significant effects on their total or single-item SPPB scores, but it did significantly improve several muscle strength and physical performance parameters. These findings suggest a role for HMB supplementation (at lower doses than those previously considered optimal) for fit elderly people too, with a view to preventing or delaying the age-related decline in some physical performance parameters. Further research is needed and should also compare the SPPB with other physical performance parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141757.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Protocollo.docx: Original protocol approved by our IRB.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0141757.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141757.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>Pdf: Protocol (translated in English).</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0141757.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0141757.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0141757.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our sincerest gratitude goes to the gym coordinator, Flavio Martinello, for helping with recruitment.
