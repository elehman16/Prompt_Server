Although, bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the disease process, it has become evident that their presence alone is not sufficient to cause the tissue destruction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The etiological significance of biological and behavioral risk factors for periodontal diseases, such as smoking, advancing age, oral hygiene, and systemic diseases like diabetes mellitus has already been established.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Other factors such as stress, depression and anxiety are not yet confirmed as absolute risk conditions, but have been identified in some observational studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Development of periodontal disease is related to the presence of periopathogenic bacteria and also conditions that alters the host resistance to these bacteria. Several studies have shown a positive correlation between psychological factors and a periodontal disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] on the contrary few studies have shown no correlation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Psychiatric patients seem to be more prone to periodontitis compared to patients without psychiatric disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>A marker commonly used to study the function of the hypothalamus&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;adrenal cortex axis during stress is the salivary concentration of cortisol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Hence, the detection of biochemical marker can provide information about ongoing tissue destruction. Several studies have explored the associations among stress, cortisol, and a periodontal disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>], but the association between cortisol and periodontal parameters and psychological factor is not clearly understood.</p><p>The relationship between psychological factors and periodontitis necessitates carefully designed studies as it is known that psychological states can interfere with the course of chronic diseases. The understanding of this relationship may allow for an improvement in the prevention and treatment of periodontal diseases.</p><p>Thus, aim of this study was to evaluate gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and salivary cortisol in anxious and non-anxious patients with chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This cross sectional study was conducted in Department of Periodontology, Manipal College of Dental Sciences Mangalore, Manipal University, India. A total of 45 subjects of both genders with an age range of 35-60 years were included in the study. Out of 45 patients, 30 patients were recruited from the Out-Patient Department of Periodontology, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, Manipal University and 15 patients were recruited from the Department of Psychiatry Kasturba Medical College Hospital, Attavara, Mangalore, Manipal University. The study has been approved by Institutional Ethical Committee and Review Board. All individuals signed an informed consent before taking part in the study.</p><p>Study inclusion criteria were as follows: Individuals in the chosen age range with minimum 20 teeth excluding third molars; not on treatment for anxiety and no previous reported history of anxiety; no antibiotics taken prior to 6 months of the initial examination and did not require antibiotic premedication for any systemic condition; no periodontal surgery performed in the areas to be treated within the last months.</p><p>Subjects with systemic conditions associated with the periodontal disease or on medication related to periodontal alteration or psychotropic drugs; smoker or alcoholic; severe malocclusion or orthodontic treatment; pregnant and lactating females; were excluded from the study.</p><p>The subjective and objective psychological evaluation was carried out for each individual using Spielberger State &#x02014; Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] rating scales. This was followed by a full-mouth periodontal probing and charting to record the periodontal status of each patient.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>STAI[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</title><p>It consists of two self-report scales. Each of which has 20 items followed by a four-point scale. They measure two different dimensions of anxiety: State anxiety and trait anxiety.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] The trait anxiety scale requires that subjects describe to the way they generally feel. The state of anxiety is defined as a transitory emotional state or condition of the human mind characterized by consciously perceived unpleasant tension and feelings of apprehension.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] The range of possible scores varies from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 80 on both the scales.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>HAM-A[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</title><p>In this scale anxiety level of the subject will be assessed by an experienced psychiatrist. There are 14 items, each of which is rated 0-4 on an unanchored severity scale, with the total score of 0-56. A score of 14 has been suggested as the threshold for clinically significant anxiety.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Periodontal evaluation</title><p>After all questionnaires were completed, periodontal clinical examination was carried out using a Williams probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). The clinical attachment level (CAL) and probing pocket depth (PPD) were measured at mesio-buccal; mesio-lingual; mid-buccal; disto-buccal; disto-lingual, and mid-lingual sides each tooth, excluding third molars. The plaque index (PI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] was used to record the presence of plaque at disto-facial, facial, mesio-facial, and lingual surfaces. Only plaque of the cervical third of the tooth was evaluated. The gingival condition was assessed using the gingival index (GI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] at four surfaces: Disto-facial papilla, facial margin, mesio-facial papilla and entire lingual gingival margin. All clinical data were collected by a single examiner, who had been calibrated prior to the commencement of the study. A case of chronic periodontitis was defined as subjects with CAL &#x02265;3 mm and PPD of &#x02265;4 mm in at least 30% of the teeth examined.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>The subjects were categorized into three groups of 15 (<italic>n</italic> = 15) each based on psychological parameters and periodontal clinical examination as follows:</p><p>Group 1 (control) (<italic>n</italic> = 15)</p><p>Individuals with clinically healthy gingiva and anxiety score of HAM-A &#x0003c; 14, STAI &#x0003c; 40.</p><p>Group 2 (chronic periodontitis patients without anxiety) (<italic>n</italic> = 15)</p><p>Patients with chronic periodontitis and anxiety score of HAM-A &#x0003c; 14 STAI &#x0003c; 40.</p><p>Group 3 (chronic periodontitis patients with anxiety) (<italic>n</italic> = 15)</p><p>Patients with chronic periodontitis and with the anxiety score of HAM-A &#x0003e; 14 and STAI &#x0003e; 40.</p><p>Cortisol levels were assessed from saliva and GCF samples, which were collected from the participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>GCF collection</title><p>All the samples were collected on the subsequent day (8 am-10 am) to prevent the contamination of GCF with blood associated with the probing of inflamed sites. Only one site per patient was selected as a sampling site. In Group 1 to standardize site selection and to obtain adequate fluid volume, sampling was predetermined to be from the mesio-buccal region of the maxillary right first molar, in the absence of which the left first molar was sampled. In Groups 2 and 3, sites with the greatest clinical signs of inflammation, CAL &#x0003e; 2 mm were identified using a Williams probe (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). The supra gingival plaque from the sites to be sampled were carefully removed using ultrasonic scaler. Then sites were isolated with the cotton rolls and gently air dried. A standardized volume of 2 &#x003bc;l GCF was collected from each test site by an extracrevicular approach using volumetric micro capillary pipettes, (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company, USA.) calibrated from 1-5 &#x003bc;l. Each sample collection was allotted a maximum of 20 min; some test sites in the healthy group that did not express any volume of GCF were excluded from the study. Micropipettes suspected to be contaminated with blood and saliva was also excluded. The collected GCF was transferred immediately to plastic vials prefilled with 100 &#x003bc;l of phosphate buffer saline of pH 7 and stored at &#x02212;70C till the time of analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Saliva collection</title><p>Saliva samples were collected from all patients after GCF collection. To avoid contamination of the oral cavity as a result of food intake, the patients were instructed not to eat or drink 1 h prior to sampling. Patients were asked to rinse their mouth with distilled water. One ml of unstimulated saliva was collected using drooling method in a 5 ml sterile plastic test tube. All samples were immediately centrifuged for 3000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatants were then frozen at &#x02212;70C, pending analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Cortisol level analysis</title><p>Cortisol in saliva and GCF was measured using an ELISA kit UBI, United Biotech Inc. 211 S Whisman Road suite E, USA (Catalog Number: SH-101).</p><p>(UBI-MAGIWEL&#x02122; United Biotech., Inc., USA), according to the manufacturer's instruction manual.

The various methodologies applied in these studies as well as the absence of a control group and a lack of control for confounding variables for periodontal disease makes it difficult to conclude on the actual effects of psychosocial factors over periodontal pathogenesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>This cross sectional study included 45 patients subdivided into 3 groups.

This psychometric tool has been used by an experienced psychiatrist in the current study to diagnose anxiety. Only those who had significant cut-off score for anxiety (&#x0003e;14) were included in Group 3. Detailed clinical interview along with HAM-A assessment by the psychiatrist was carried out in the other two groups to exclude anxiety. Since HAM-A detects only the current psychopathology, STAI was used by the study group to assess their preexisting anxiety level. STAI has also been used by many earlier studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Those who had significant cut off score (&#x0003e;40) were included in Group 3. In the present study, state anxiety was statistically significant in Group 2 compared to Group 1 but the anxiety level was much lesser than the cut-off value, which was in turn supported by HAM-A. This may be due to situation bias or incorrect information supplied by few of the participants.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies, which found the association between psychosocial factors and chronic periodontitis were partly attributed to psychological causation because other potential risk factors for periodontal disease were not controlled. Few studies found an association between psychological factors and periodontitis without controlling the level of the dental plaque.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Whereas other studies did not consider diabetes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] and smoking[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] as confounding factors.</p><p>All the clinical measures such as PI, GI, PPD, and CAL were statistically different among the three groups. Plaque accumulation was minimal in the control group, but similar between Group 2 and Group 3, which was statistically not significant; this may be due to the exclusion of very poor oral hygiene. GI score was higher in Group 3 when compared to Group 1 and 2, but it was not statistically significant. These results are in agreement with previous studies by Klages <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] and Johannsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The increased level of gingival inflammation in these subjects can be explained by both an indirect and direct influence, in which the indirect influence would involve behavioral changes. The direct influence might involve modulation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary Adrenal axis HPA axis, leading to an endocrine imbalance and consequently lowered host resistance as suggested by Genco.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]</p><p>Analysis of free cortisol (active form of cortisol) in serum is usually time consuming and expensive and not suitable for clinical routine. Salivary cortisol levels were demonstrated to have an excellent correlation with free serum cortisol levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>] In the present study unstimulated saliva was collected from all the participants. Most methods of saliva collection are easy to perform, non-invasive, rapid, and generally require no special equipment or expertise. Salivary analysis may offer a means of assessing subject-level (as opposed to site-level) risk or status.</p><p>Since most forms of periodontal disease are site specific, one more approach is to measure the substances in GCF that correlate with the level of disease activity and tissue destruction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] GCF is derived from the periodontal pocket and thus, contains molecules that reflect the periodontal disease process. It represents a local site-specific sample as suggested by Kinane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] In the current study GCF samples were collected from a site associated with a maximum CAL and signs of highest disease activity. To avoid the possibility of dilution of GCF by saliva upper second molars were not considered during the time of sample collection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>]</p><p>In the current study cortisol level ranged from undetectable level to detectable limit. GCF cortisol levels in Group 2 were higher than Group 1, but much lesser compared to Group 3. GCF cortisol concentrations in Group 3 were &#x0003e;10 times as high as those of the controls. It has been suggested that elevated levels of cortisol can suppress several host response mechanisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] This could lead to an impaired immune system function, which might increase the risk for periodontitis.</p><p>In the current study, GCF cortisol levels were less compared to salivary cortisol levels. This was in accordance with a previous study by Johannsen <italic>et al</italic>..[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In a previous study by Axtelius <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] higher cortisol concentrations in GCF from the inflamed site was found. This may be due the different methodology and study population used in the study. A sensitive ELISA kit is used to quantify cortisol level from the selected sites. This avoided pooling of GCF samples from multiple sites compared to the study by Axtelius <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] which used 2-4 filter paper disks around each tooth and 4-8 teeth per patient measured separately in a quadrant.</p><p>The results of the present study indicated a statistically significant association between the levels of salivary and GCF cortisol with PPD and CAL of Group 3, which was supported by previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] In our study, CAL showed high statistical significance in Group 3. Since CAL can be regarded as a result of an inflammatory burden from the past into the present, in contrast to PPD level which reflects the current pathophysiological status of periodontitis, the findings from our study may be attributed to dysregulation of the stress system, in which the HPA axis is chronically activated due to anxiety in patients with chronic periodontitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] The presence of anxiety as a symptom of dysregulation of HPA axis may have an add-on effect on the progression and severity of the periodontal disease.</p><p>A relationship between stress-related hormones and periodontitis could be explained, at least in part, by the inhibitory effects of activation of the HPA axis on the inflammatory immune response, because all components of immune response are inhibited by cortisol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>] During the activation of the HPA axis, the T-helper phenotype of an individual is influenced by inhibition of IL-12 and stimulation of IL-10 secretion by macrophages. These changes have major suppressive effects on immune and inflammatory responses and increasing susceptibility, which in turn makes local periodontal tissues vulnerable to pathogenic microorganisms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>Analysis of cortisol in saliva has certain merits over GCF as larger volume of the sample can be collected using simple methods with less chair side time, also ease of storage of sample. So it can be easily incorporated in clinical practice.</p><p>A single sample of saliva and GCF was the limitation of the study. Furthermore, there was unequal gender distribution, the effect of gender on salivary gland secretion and in turn on cortisol level could not be assessed.</p><p>One of the major strength of the study was that the anxiety level was assessed by subjective and objective rating scale whereas most of the studies use only subjective rating scales, which are less reliable. Besides this, present study comprised a control group and confounding factors like smoking, poor oral hygiene, and systemic disease like diabetes were taken into consideration. Subjects with other psychiatric illness and those anxious with history of past anxiety episode, who were on medication were excluded. Cortisol level estimation was evaluated in saliva and GCF which is non-invasive and less expensive compared to serum assessment of cortisol. In the present study ELISA technique was used, which is economic, sensitive, and reliable compared to other techniques. This is one among very few studies in which clinical, psychological (subjective and objective) and biochemical parameters were studied simultaneously in psychiatric population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The findings in this study demonstrated a possible link between chronic periodontitis and anxiety. Anxiety acts as one of the modifying factor in the progression of chronic periodontitis. There were statistically significant differences between the anxious and non-anxious chronic periodontitis subjects with respect to biochemical inflammatory marker in GCF and saliva. Salivary and GCF cortisol levels are a biomarker for evaluating a part of the etiopathogenesis of chronic periodontitis. Additional controlled, longitudinal studies may expound the significance of salivary and GCF cortisol as a potential marker for periodontal disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was partially supported by the grant approved by the Manipal University, Manipal, Karnataka, India</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal disease</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>1990</year><volume>322</volume><fpage>373</fpage><lpage>82</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">2405268</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Birkedal-Hansen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Role of cytokines and inflammatory mediators in tissue destruction</article-title><source>J Periodontal Res</source><year>1993</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>500</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8263720</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Johannsen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Asberg</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>S&#x000f6;der</surname><given-names>PO</given-names></name><name><surname>S&#x000f6;der</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anxiety, gingival inflammation and periodontal disease in non-smokers and smokers-an epidemiological study</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2005</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>488</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15842264</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haber</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kent</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cigarette smoking in a periodontal practice</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1992</year><volume>63</volume><fpage>100</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1552463</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Beck</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Methods of assessing risk for periodontitis and developing multifactorial models</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1994</year><volume>65</volume><fpage>468</fpage><lpage>78</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8046563</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grossi</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Zambon</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>AW</given-names></name><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Dunford</surname><given-names>RG</given-names></name><name><surname>Machtei</surname><given-names>EE</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Assessment of risk for periodontal disease.
