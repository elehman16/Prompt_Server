In conjunction with a multicenter randomized trial of fidaxomicin versus vancomycin for CDI treatment, we tested the hypothesis that fidaxomicin promotes VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species colonization less than vancomycin. Stool was cultured for VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species before and after therapy. For patients with negative pretreatment cultures, the incidence of VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species acquisition was compared. For those with preexisting VRE, the change in concentration during treatment was compared. The susceptibility of VRE isolates to fidaxomicin was assessed. Of 301 patients, 247 (82%) had negative VRE cultures and 252 (84%) had negative <italic>Candida</italic> species cultures before treatment. In comparison with vancomycin-treated patients, fidaxomicin-treated patients had reduced acquisition of VRE (7% vs 31%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;.001) and <italic>Candida</italic> species (19% vs 29%, respectively; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.03). For patients with preexisting VRE, the mean concentration decreased significantly in the fidaxomicin group (5.9 vs 3.8&#x000a0;log<sub>10</sub> VRE/g stool; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.01) but not the vancomycin group (5.3 vs 4.2&#x000a0;log<sub>10</sub> VRE/g stool; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;.20). Most VRE isolates recovered after fidaxomicin treatment had elevated fidaxomicin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs; MIC<sub>90</sub>, 256&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), and subpopulations of VRE with elevated fidaxomicin MICs were common before therapy. Fidaxomicin was less likely than vancomycin to promote acquisition of VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species during CDI treatment. However, selection of preexisting subpopulations of VRE with elevated fidaxomicin MICs was common during fidaxomicin therapy.</p><p><italic>Clinical Trials Registration</italic>.

Current practice guidelines recommend metronidazole for treatment of mild to moderate CDI and vancomycin for severe cases and in the setting of multiple recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C2">2</xref>]. Although these antibiotics are effective in suppressing <italic>C. difficile</italic>, they are nonselective agents that also cause significant disruption of the indigenous microbiota of the colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C5">5</xref>]. For example, oral vancomycin achieves high concentrations in the intestinal tract, resulting in marked suppression of anaerobic organisms, including <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>]. Such disruption of the indigenous microbiota may predispose patients to recurrent CDI and intestinal colonization by healthcare-associated pathogens such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and <italic>Candida</italic> species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C8">8</xref>]. In a previous study, we demonstrated that both oral metronidazole and oral vancomycin promoted persistent overgrowth of VRE in stool of patients with CDI with preexisting VRE colonization, resulting in frequent contamination of skin and environmental surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C4">4</xref>]. Antibiotic-induced overgrowth of <italic>Candida</italic> species in the gastrointestinal tract is an important factor that predisposes to <italic>Candida</italic> infection and dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C9">9</xref>]. These findings highlight the need for new CDI treatments that cause less disruption of the indigenous microbiota.</p><p>Fidaxomicin (formerly OPT-80) is a naturally occurring 18-member macrocycle being developed as a therapy for CDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C11">11</xref>]. Fidaxomicin is minimally absorbed after oral administration and achieves high concentrations in the intestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C11">11</xref>]. The compound has excellent in vitro activity against <italic>C. difficile</italic> (minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms [MIC<sub>90</sub>], 0.125&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), moderate activity against VRE (MIC<sub>90</sub>, 4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), but minimal activity against <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species (MIC<sub>90</sub>, &#x0003e;1024&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) and other gram-negative organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C11">11</xref>]. In a phase II clinical trial, fidaxomicin was effective in suppressing <italic>C. difficile</italic> but did not reduce <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic> group concentrations; in a separate group of patients with CDI, oral vancomycin treatment caused marked suppression of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>]. In a phase III clinical trial, oral fidaxomicin was as effective as oral vancomycin for the treatment of CDI but was associated with a significantly reduced recurrence rate (13% vs 24%), presumably because it caused less disruption of the anaerobic microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C12">12</xref>]. Here, we tested the hypothesis that oral fidaxomicin promotes acquisition and overgrowth of VRE less than oral vancomycin because it has activity against many VRE species but lacks activity against many intestinal anaerobes, including <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species. To further investigate the importance of limiting alteration of the anaerobic microbiota during CDI therapy, we examined the effects of the treatment regimens on colonization by <italic>Candida</italic> species, because neither agent has activity against fungi and because the gastrointestinal tract is an important reservoir for <italic>Candida</italic> species.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and Study Design</title><p>The double-blind, randomized, phase III clinical trial of 10 days of fidaxomicin versus 10 days of vancomycin for treatment of CDI enrolled 548 subjects (265 were treated with fidaxomicin, and 283 were treated with vancomycin) in multiple hospitals in the United States and Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C11">11</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="CIS440F1">1</xref>). Patients were given a diagnosis of CDI on the basis of symptoms of diarrhea and a positive result of a stool toxin assay, using commercial enzyme immunoassays. Patients with fulminant CDI or toxic megacolon were excluded. A randomly selected subset of patients had stool samples collected prior to and at the end of therapy for measurement of drug levels. The stool samples were frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. At the completion of the trial, the samples were transferred to a central laboratory for assessment of VRE and yeast colonization. Information regarding demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, and antibiotic therapy was collected prospectively through the standardized clinical study report. The Cleveland Veterans Affairs Medical Center's Institutional Review Board approved this laboratory study protocol.

This finding has important clinical and infection control implications. VRE is an important healthcare-associated pathogen in North America and Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>], and the intestinal tract is an important reservoir for <italic>Candida</italic> species infection, particularly in immunocompromised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C14">14</xref>]. Many patients with CDI who acquire VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species colonization have multiple risk factors for the development of infection (eg, older age, immunocompromise, and presence of devices) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C15">15</xref>]. In addition, patients with CDI pose a high risk for transmission of VRE because diarrhea is associated with increased shedding of VRE into the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C4">4</xref>]. Oral vancomycin and metronidazole promote persistent high concentrations of VRE in stool, further increasing the risk for shedding of VRE into the environment and onto skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C4">4</xref>]. Our findings suggest that fidaxomicin may provide an effective alternative therapy for CDI that is less likely to promote colonization with VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species.</p><p>It is microbiologically plausible that fidaxomicin may be less likely than vancomycin to promote colonization with VRE and other pathogens. We demonstrated that oral vancomycin treatment significantly reduced <italic>Bacteroides</italic> levels in stool, whereas fidaxomicin treatment did not. These data are consistent with the findings of Louie et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C6">6</xref>]. We also found that many VRE strains in North American hospitals are susceptible to low levels of fidaxomicin. The inhibitory activity against VRE may prevent the establishment of colonization by susceptible strains. Notably, of the 7 fidaxomicin-treated patients who acquired VRE, 4 (57%) acquired isolates with elevated fidaxomicin MICs. Because neither fidaxomicin nor vancomycin has inhibitory activity against fungi, the differences in inhibition of anaerobic intestinal bacteria by these agents are likely to explain the lower frequency of acquisition of <italic>Candida</italic> species in the fidaxomicin group. The reduction in concentrations of preexisting <italic>Candida</italic> species in patients treated with fidaxomicin may be due to recovery of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species and other anaerobes; however, it should be noted that a statistically significant but more modest reduction in <italic>Candida</italic> species was also seen in the vancomycin group.</p><p>Nearly 20% of patients with CDI were colonized with VRE prior to initiation of CDI therapy. It is likely that this percentage would have been even higher if only US hospitals had been included in the study. In 2 previous studies in hospitals in California and Cleveland, Ohio, prevalences of coexisting VRE colonization at the time of CDI diagnosis were 41% and 62%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C16">16</xref>]. In 44% of patients with preexisting VRE colonization, fidaxomicin therapy was associated with a reduction in VRE concentration to undetectable levels. For fidaxomicin-treated patients with persistent VRE colonization at the end of treatment, the fidaxomicin MICs of VRE isolates were higher at the end of treatment (MIC<sub>90</sub>, 256&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL; range, 1&#x02013;&#x0003e;256&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL) than prior to treatment (MIC<sub>90</sub>, 4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL; range, 2&#x02013;256&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL), suggesting that resistance to fidaxomicin had emerged during therapy. The presence of fidaxomicin resistance did not correlate with rifampin resistance, suggesting that mutations leading to rifampin resistance are not responsible for the elevated fidaxomicin MICs.</p><p>Our data suggest that the new detection of VRE with elevated fidaxomicin MICs after fidaxomicin therapy may be due to expansion of subpopulations of VRE with elevated fidaxomicin MICs due to selective pressure during therapy rather than to de novo emergence of resistance (eg, mutations in RNA polymerase genes). We found that a majority of patients colonized with VRE with elevated fidaxomicin MICs after therapy had detectable minor subpopulations of these organisms present in stool samples prior to therapy.</p><p>Surprisingly, we found that vancomycin treatment was associated with reduction of VRE to undetectable levels in 37% of patients. Because oral vancomycin treatment results in high concentrations in the intestinal tract that are higher than the MICs of many VRE strains, it is possible that vancomycin might have eliminated colonization or suppressed VRE levels below the limit of detection (approximately 1&#x000a0;log<sub>10</sub>&#x000a0;CFU/g of stool) in some patients. The reduction in VRE was not attributable to relatively low MICs in the preexisting VRE strains (vancomycin MIC range, 25&#x02013;1024&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/mL). In contrast to the present study, we found that vancomycin therapy was associated with reductions in preexisting VRE to undetectable levels in only 1 of 19 colonized patients in a previous study in a Veterans Affairs hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C3">3</xref>].</p><p>Our study has some limitations. Assessment of acquisition of VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species was based on stool samples obtained at the end of treatment, so subsequent acquisition occurring after CDI treatment could have occurred in some patients. However, for many of the study patients, additional stool samples were analyzed after completion of therapy, and results were similar to those for samples obtained at the end of therapy (data not shown). Because all patients were treated for CDI, there was no untreated control group. Therefore, we cannot definitively state that the vancomycin or fidaxomicin therapy was the cause of VRE or <italic>Candida</italic> species acquisition or persistence (ie, other antibiotics received prior to the diagnosis may have contributed). However, we have previously demonstrated that the concentration of VRE in stool of colonized patients decreases significantly by 1&#x02013;2 weeks after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS440C7">7</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we found that fidaxomicin did not suppress <italic>Bacteroides</italic> organisms and was less likely than vancomycin to promote acquisition of VRE or <italic>Candida</italic> species during CDI treatment. However, the ability of fidaxomicin to suppress established VRE colonization appeared to be limited because of the selection of subpopulations of VRE with elevated MICs to fidaxomicin. Additional studies are needed to determine whether fidaxomicin is less likely than vancomycin to promote colonization with other healthcare-associated pathogens (eg, antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacilli) and to assess whether use of fidaxomicin for CDI therapy will be associated with reduced risk for VRE and <italic>Candida</italic> species infection and transmission. There is also a need for studies to determine the mechanism of fidaxomicin resistance in VRE strains.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Notes</title><p><bold><italic>Financial support.</italic></bold>&#x02003;This work was supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs, Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (grant 5R44AI63692-4).</p><p><bold><italic>Supplement sponsorship.</italic></bold>&#x02003;This article was published as part of a supplement entitled &#x0201c;Fidaxomicin and the Evolving Approach to the Treatment of <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> Infection,&#x0201d; sponsored by Optimer Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p><p><bold><italic>Potential conflicts of interest.</italic></bold>&#x02003;C.
