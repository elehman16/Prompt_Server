Accumulating evidence indicates that vitamin D receptor (VDR) activation lowers unfavorable RAS activity; however, more human intervention studies evaluating whether this mechanism could influence diabetic kidney disease are needed. We previously reported that both vitamin D levels and genetic variation at the VDR predict human RAS activity, and that vitamin D therapy can lower RAS activity in non-diabetics. The VALIDATE-D study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, intervention study designed to extend these findings by evaluating whether direct VDR activation in diabetes lowers circulating and local renal-vascular tissue RAS activity (Aims 1 and 2) in a manner similar to the action of ACE inhibitors (Aim 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Forty subjects with type 2 diabetes, microalbuminuria, and without chronic kidney disease will be recruited to undergo detailed assessment of the RAS before and after randomization to calcitriol 0.75 mcg/day or placebo. Primary analyses will evaluate whether calcitriol therapy reduces circulating and renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in comparison to placebo. All subjects will thereafter be treated with lisinopril and followed for 3.5&#x000a0;months to evaluate whether combination therapy (calcitriol&#x02009;+&#x02009;lisinopril vs. placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;lisinopril) additively or synergistically improves renal-vascular function, and lowers proteinuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The VALIDATE-D study is the first human intervention study to evaluate whether direct VDR activation can lower the human RAS in diabetes, compared to the effect of an ACE inhibitor, and whether this mechanism can translate to clinically relevant endpoints for diabetic kidney disease.

Observational and limited interventional studies have supported a renoprotective benefit to higher vitamin D levels and vitamin D supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; however, there is a need for more dedicated human intervention studies to confirm these findings. One of the main proposed mechanisms linking vitamin D with renal-vascular and kidney disease is regulation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since both of these hormonal systems have complex genetic and environmental regulatory steps (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), carefully controlled interventional studies that evaluate both <italic>mechanisms of action and clinical outcomes</italic> are needed to distinguish the hormonal interplay that is likely involved for vitamin D therapy to influence kidney disease.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The proposed interaction between vitamin D and RAS metabolism.</bold> Renin catalyzes the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which is further converted to the vasoactive peptide angiotensin II. Angiotensin II is a direct vasoconstricter, and can also ilicit aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex. Under physiologic situations, activation of the RAS in response to renal-vascular hypo-perfusion serves to increase blood pressure and renal salt retention. However, in pathologic states (such as in diabetes and obesity), inappropriately high RAS activity contributes to vascular and kidney diseases. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> is largely produced in the skin with exposure to ultraviolet radiation, but may also be ingested orally. This precursor is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) and 25(OH)D serves as the stable barometer of clinical &#x0201c;vitamin D status.&#x0201d; Under the control of parathyroid hormone and calcium status, 25(OH)D can be hydroxylated to form the active vitamin D receptor (VDR) agonist 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D). Activation of the VDR by 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is known to influence the regulation and expression of a myriad of genes, including renin.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6823-13-33-1"/></fig><p>Both excess activity of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and insufficient vitamin D status have been implicated in the development of renal-vascular disease that results in diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The RAS can mediate renal-vascular disease via its circulating components, and additionally the locally expressed renal-vascular tissue-RAS also contributes to the development of kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Excess renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity has been implicated in the development of diabetic nephropathy; RAS inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as well as favorable vitamin D status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], may mitigate this effect.</p><p>Animal studies have shown that the activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25[OH]<sub>2</sub>D) negatively regulates renin expression and thereby lowers RAS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In mouse models of diabetes, both VDR-agonists and RAS-inhibitors blunted the development of diabetic nephropathy when given alone, but the combination (VDR-agonist&#x02009;+&#x02009;RAS-inhibitor) <italic>synergistically</italic> prevented the development of diabetic nephropathy via down-regulation of the renal-vascular tissue-RAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We, and others, have reported findings that translate these animal experiments to humans: the combination of vitamin D levels and genetic variation at the human VDR predicts RAS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Large observational studies have shown that the prevalence of chronic kidney disease and proteinuria (a marker of kidney disease progression) are associated with lower 25(OH)D levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Due to their cross-sectional design, these aforementioned studies could not reveal causality or confirm the mechanism linking vitamin D-VDR interactions and renal outcomes. A few human interventions have demonstrated that VDR agonists may reduce proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], but these studies were confined to populations with established chronic kidney disease (CKD), and evaluation of the RAS was not undertaken. We recently completed a pilot human intervention study in non-diabetics without CKD that demonstrated that high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> therapy improved renal-vascular hemodynamics by lowering renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This latter effect was similar to that induced by an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, thereby further supporting a renoprotective effect of vitamin D therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In light of these novel human results translated from animal experiments, we hypothesize that activation of the VDR represents a method to lower renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in human diabetes, and could therefore play an important role in the <italic>primary prevention</italic> of diabetic nephropathy. We therefore designed the VALIDATE-D study: an ongoing randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to assess whether direct VDR activation: Aim 1) lowers circulating RAS activity in human diabetes; Aim 2) lowers renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in human diabetes; and Aim 3) in combination with ACE inhibition, exerts an additive or synergistic effect on the renal-vascular tissue-RAS and proteinuria.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study population and recruitment</title><p>The VALIDATE-D study will enroll 40 adults, aged 18&#x02013;70&#x000a0;years, with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM), microalbuminuria, and without known CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate &#x0003e; 60&#x000a0;mL/min).

Vitamin D metabolism and regulation of the RAS are complex processes that involve multiple genes, gene-products, and environmental inputs (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); the genetic variation, dietary intake, and other environmental exposures for each individual have been shown to alter the balance of each of these hormonal systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In this regard, using supplementation with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> in an intervention study to induce a clinical outcome that is mediated by the interaction between 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D and the VDR (such as RAS inhibition to influence renal-vascular function) is analogous to administering a pre- or pro-drug that is dependent on multiple subsequent enzymatic steps, each regulated and modified by genetics and environment. The strengths of the VALIDATE-D study are that it focuses on overcoming this individual variability by investigating the influence of <italic>direct</italic> VDR-agonist therapy in modulating RAS activity and renal-vascular function, and employs a meticulous design to evaluate the underlying mechanism of potential findings (regulation of RAS activity).</p><p>Increasing evidence highlights a relationship between vitamin D and the RAS, with relevant implications for renal-vascular and kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Lowering unfavorable RAS activity has known vascular benefits in diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and the use of RAS inhibitors is common practice to prevent or delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Animal studies have elegantly shown that activating the VDR results in lowering of the renal-vascular tissue-RAS, and that this interaction translates to reduced kidney injury, particularly in the setting of animal models of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. While human studies often focus on influencing clinical outcomes by supplementing with vitamin D<sub>3</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], research studies that employ direct VDR-agonists may be most effective at invoking VDR-mediated effects such as RAS modulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The advantage of using direct VDR-agonists in intervention studies is that they likely maximize any effect mediated by the VDR, eliminate inter-individual variations in vitamin D metabolism, and may influence clinical outcomes in a shorter duration of time than would take with vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation. The disadvantage of using VDR-agonists is that they are not commonly used in individuals without CKD and therefore direct clinical translation of study findings is limited; however, positive findings would support any therapy (vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or VDR-agonist) that raises 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels or activates the VDR as an equal surrogate.</p><p>The results of the VALIDATE-D study will shed light on: 1) the mechanism by which VDR activation influences renal-vascular function in human diabetes (via modulation of the RAS), and 2) whether VDR activation modulates renal hemodynamics and proteinuria in human diabetes. These findings would not only carry major implications for the recommendation of vitamin D supplementation in the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy, but they could help interpret the findings of many other studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of vitamin D therapy without accounting for the mechanisms involved. In this regard, the VALIDATE-D study may explain the reasons prior negative studies failed to see outcomes and why positive studies may have succeeded.</p><p>At least three unique findings will emerge from the VALIDATE-D study. First, this intervention study will conclusively evaluate whether vitamin D therapy lowers the <italic>circulating</italic> human RAS. By using direct VDR agonists and a meticulous study design to account for confounders of the RAS (diet, posture, medications, time of day), this study will investigate whether calcitriol therapy lowers the maximally stimulated RAS on a LS diet in comparison to placebo. Second, this study will evaluate whether direct VDR activation improves renal-vascular hemodynamics by increasing renal blood flow and the renal-vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II; both of these observations are consistent with reductions in the renal-vascular tissue-RAS as would be induced by an ACE inhibitor. The study design includes a comparison of renal-vascular hemodynamics (while the circulating RAS is suppressed on a HS diet) during treatment with calcitriol vs. placebo, and then again during treatment with calcitriol&#x02009;+&#x02009;lisinopril vs. placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;lisinopril (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In this regard, the study design is optimized to decipher the individual role of VDR activation, and the effect of combining VDR activation with conventional RAS inhibition, since this combination therapy has been shown to provide synergistic renoprotection in animal models of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The assessment of the renal-vascular tissue-RAS in humans is a unique and defining aspect of this study protocol. The renal vasculature is specifically sensitive to the effects of angiotensin II, and the magnitude of renal-vascular responses to angiotensin II is inversely proportional to the degree of local tissue-RAS activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. High endogenous tissue-RAS activity results in a blunted local sensitivity to the effect of angiotensin II, while inhibiting the local renal-vascular tissue-RAS (for example with an ACE inhibitor) improves the renal-vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, our ability to measure renal hemodynamics via <italic>para</italic>-aminohippurate clearance permits us to objectively ascertain the state of the renal-vascular tissue-RAS in response to drug intervention (calcitriol, lisinopril, placebo) and in response to provocation by angiotensin II. Lowering renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in pathologic states such as diabetes and obesity with conventional pharmacotherapy (ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker) has shown efficacy for the primary prevention of diabetic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Thirdly, the impact of adding chronic VDR-agonist therapy to ACE inhibitor therapy on proteinuria will be assessed. Since the study population is strategically selected to have diabetes without CKD, together these study findings will have implications for recommending vitamin D supplementation to lower unfavorable RAS activity for the <italic>primary prevention</italic> of diabetic nephropathy.</p><p>We have previously shown in a pilot study that high-dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> therapy to markedly raise 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D concentrations can lower renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in non-diabetics with normal renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Like an ACE inhibitor, this intervention induced a favorable state of low tissue-RAS resulting in increased renal-vascular sensitivity to angiotensin II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The VALIDATE-D study will extend these findings by employing a double-blinded randomization, employing direct VDR agonist therapy, and focusing on patients with diabetes without CKD. In prior clinical studies of secondary prevention in diabetes with pre-existing CKD, direct VDR agonists (calcitriol and paracalcitol) reduced proteinuria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]; whether this effect was mediated by the RAS, or could be extrapolated for the <italic>primary</italic> prevention of diabetic nephropathy, are questions that the VALIDATE-D study will clarify.</p><p>VALIDATE-D is the first human study to investigate whether vitamin D therapy to activate the VDR can lower circulating and renal-vascular tissue-RAS activity in diabetics without CKD. This study is designed to specifically focus on whether modulating the RAS represents a key mechanism by which vitamin D intervention impacts renal-vascular hemodynamics and kidney function. In this regard, VALIDATE-D will provide evidence that may influence clinical recommendations for maintaining vitamin D status for the <italic>primary prevention</italic> of diabetic nephropathy. In addition, VALIDATE-D will examine whether the action of potent VDR agonist therapy complements the known beneficial effects of ACE inhibition, as has been observed in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. If so, the results of VALIDATE-D could influence pharmacologic practices by favoring vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation instead of, or in addition to, ACE inhibitor therapy for patients with diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors affirm they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AV developed the study design and concept and is involved in the conduct and supervision of the study as the principal investigator.
