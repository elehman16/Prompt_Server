A key parameter considered in terms of re-mineralization is availability of inorganic constituents chiefly calcium. resence of calcium and phosphate ions during period of acid attack inhibits de-mineralization and re-mineralization.</p><p>De-mineralization in the oral cavity can be attributed mainly to dental caries, intrinsic and extrinsic erosive factors such as acidic foods, beverages, medicines etc. In recent decades researchers have shown a marked interest in studying the cause, process and management of both de-mineralization and re-mineralization of tooth structure. The basic mineral component of mature enamel is hydroxyapatite, Ca<sub>10</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> For net remineralization to occur, adequate levels of calcium and phosphate ions must be available and this process is normally calcium phosphate limited. When the pH is neutral and there are sufficient Ca and P ions in the oral environment, the demineraliation process can be reversed i remineralization occurs</p><p>Erosive tooth wear or dental erosion has progressively gained more attention from the dental profession since the decline in dental caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Excessive consumption of acidic food beverages are one of the most common extrinsic factors that cause dental erosion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Although, the de-mineralizing effect of acidic food beverages on human enamel has been well documented, the role of potentially protective agents that can inhibit this effect has not been investigated.</p><p>Recently, fluoridecontaining newer formulations such as fluorideenriched casein phosphopeptideamorphous calcium phosphate (CPP-ACPF) paste (GC Tooth Mousse Plus) and &#x003b2;-tricalcium phosphate (Clinpro&#x02122; Tooth Cr&#x000e8;me) have been introduced as advanced products for re-mineralization. The CPP-ACP has been shown to re-mineralize enamel subsurface lesions <italic>in situ</italic> when delivered in oral care products.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] The level of fluoride is 900 ppm which approximates that of adult tooth pastes. CPP-ACPF binds to, plaque, hydroxyapatite localizing bio-available calcium, phosphate and fluoride.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Has been considered as one possible means for enhancing levels of calcium in plaque and saliva.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Functionalized tricalcium phosphate (fTCP) mineral comprises of &#x003b2;-TCP and sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] with fluoride level of 950 ppm. The fTCP technology protects its bioavailable calcium with a fluoride-repelling surfactant (sodium lauryl sulfate)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have been reported on the use of remineralizing agents in the management of de-mineralization arising from dental caries. However, there are only a few reports on the effect of acidic food beverages on enamel and even fewer on role of remineralizing agents in preventing the loss of minerals from the tooth structure previously treated with remineralizing agents.</p><p>Hence, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect acidic food beverage on the calcium loss of enamel surface pre-treated with various remineralizing agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Enamel specimens were prepared from 12 freshly extracted human premolars by sectioning from buccal and lingual surfaces using low speed diamond discs.

None of the studies studied the protective antierosive effect of these materials on permanent teeth.</p><p>Colabased beverage was used in this study to induce artificial erosive effect as in other studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] since it is commonly consumed acidic beverages amongst the youngsters. The cola drink was changed every cycle to ensure it was carbonated. The containers containing the cola were hermetically sealed as removal of gas from the drink increases its pH and decreases its potential of dissolving hydroxyapatite.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The specimens were incubated in artificial saliva to simulate the oral conditions.</p><p>Energy dispersive X-rays analysis (EDAX) has been used for elemental analysis at the ultrastructural level. It is one of the latest microanalytical techniques that are used in conjunction with scanning electron microscope (SEM) wherein SEM does the structural analysis and elemental analysis is done by EDAX.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The EDAX x-ray detector measures the number of emitted x-rays versus their energy. Spectrum of energy versus relative counts of detected x-ray is obtained and evaluated for qualitative and quantitative determinations of the elements present in the specimen using a computerbased program.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The result of this study showed that both the remineralizing agents were able to provide protective effect against erosive enamel loss. Specimens pre-treated with &#x003b2;-TCP showed better protective effect than the specimens pre-treated with CP-ACPF</p><p>&#x003b2;-TCPbased tooth cr&#x000e8;me is one of the recently introduced remineralizing agents; hence, reports on clinical trials or efficacy reviews for comparison are unavailable in published literature. According to the manufacturer, as &#x003b2;-TCP is a precursor to hydroxyapatite formation, it is biocompatible, bioactive and manifests lattice defects that allow for crystal modification. &#x003b2;-TCP is created with a milling technique fusing &#x003b2;-TCP and sodium lauryl sulfate, ensuring that the calcium oxides not interact with fluoride, which could render both calcium and fluoride ineffective. When TCP comes into contact with the tooth surface which is moistened by saliva, the protective barrier breaks down, making the calcium, phosphate, and fluoride ions available to the teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>CPP-ACPF, a fluorideenriched CPP-ACP formulation also showed resistance to demineralization following &#x003b2;-TCP. This can be attributed to the formation of stabilized amorphous calcium fluoride phosphate phase. This is in agreement with several other studies that proved combined effect of CPP-ACP and fluoride in enhancing re-mineralization and also improving acidresisting effect.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>CPP-ACP both localizes and increases bioavailability of calcium and phosphate ions and enhances uniform subsurface mineralization of enamel surface.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Incorporation of fluoride with CPP-ACP co-localizes calcium and phosphate ions with fluoride ions at the tooth surface as CPP-ACPF nanocomplexes. This increased concentration of calcium, phosphate and fluoride ions on the tooth surface leads to the diffusion of ions into the enamel and the sub-surface lesion fluid, resulting in higher levels of remineralization and fluoride incorporation into the mineral phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The results of the present study showed among the remineralizing agents used &#x003b2;-TCP was found to be highly effective and showed better preventive effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Under the parameters of this study following conclusions were made</p><p>
