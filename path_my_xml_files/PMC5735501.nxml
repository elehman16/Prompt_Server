The surgical stress response peaks during the postoperative period and has major effects on almost all body systems. A pain- and stress-free postoperative period definitely reduces morbidity and mortality of any surgical operation. Neuraxial blockade is one of the effective modalities to control postoperative pain. Neostigmine is the universally used neuromuscular blocking reversal agent whose postoperative pain relief property was first described by Naguib and Yaksh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in 1994. However, a higher dose of neostigmine shown to produce many untoward side effects such as nausea, vomiting, etc., and lower doses of neostigmine does not show much analgesic property.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Hence, as to reduce the dose of neostigmine and potentiate its analgesic property other adjuvants such as clonidine, opioids, and transdermal nitroglycerin (tNTG) patch have been added along with it. Clonidine, a selective partial &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist, is being extensively evaluated as an adjuvant to intrathecal (IT) local anesthetics and has proven to be a potent analgesic free of opioid-related side effects.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is known to increase both sensory and motor blockade of local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] IT clonidine has been used as an adjuvant to local anesthetics in various surgical procedures without any clinically significant side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] tNTG has been found to be useful for enhancing the postoperative analgesic effect of IT sufentanil[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and neostigmine[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] by release of nitric oxide (NO). This NO increases the intracellular concentration of cyclic guanosine monophosphate, which produces pain modulation in the central and peripheral nervous system.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of the present study was to compare and evaluate the efficacy and safety of combining IT neostigmine with IT clonidine and tNTG patch for the relief of pain in patients after surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After approval from the Ethical Committee and taking written consent from the patients, the study was conducted at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, over a period of 1 year.

All the patients were familiarized with 0&#x02013;10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and nausea. Zero equal to &#x0201c;no pain or nausea&#x0201d; and ten equal to &#x0201c;worst possible pain or nausea&#x0201d;. All patients received tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg and tablet ranitidine 150 mg orally on the previous night of surgery. On arrival to the operation theater table, an intravenous (IV) infusion line was secured, and monitors were connected. Baseline recordings of pulse, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate, (pulse oximetry) SpO<sub>2</sub>, and electrocardiography (ECG) tracings were taken.</p><p>Preloading of the patients with ringer lactate 10 ml/kg was done 15 min before procedure. Lumbar puncture was performed at L3&#x02013;L4 level under aseptic conditions, with 26-gauge spinal needle, and the drug solution was injected intrathecally over 30 s as per the group allocation. The level of sensory loss was assessed by pinprick test. Heart rate, SBP, DBP, Respiratory rate, ECG, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were monitored intraoperatively. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored every 5 min throughout the surgery and a decrease &#x0003e;20% below the baseline value was treated by the incremental dose of injection ephedrine 4 mg IV. Any fall in the heart rate below 50 beats/min was treated with incremental doses of injection atropine 0.3 mg IV. Intraoperative nausea was treated initially with injection metoclopramide 10 mg IV followed by injection ondansetron 4 mg IV. Postoperatively, patients were assessed for pain by VAS rating scale at 15 min, 2 h, 4 h, 10 h, 18 h, and 24 h after the surgery was over.</p><p>Sedation score was evaluated at the above mentioned time intervals and was recorded using Ramsay scale:</p><p>

The cholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine is one among such adjuvants. Even though neostigmine shown to produce an increase in duration of analgesia, it was also associated with many unwanted side effects particularly nausea and vomiting, especially in higher doses.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Hence, to reduce the adverse effects and to prolong postoperative analgesia, other adjuvants have been used along with neostigmine. The aim of this study was to systematically review current evidence of analgesic enhancement of IT neostigmine by the addition of IT clonidine and tNTG patch on bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. The rationale for combining IT neostigmine and clonidine was that IT alpha-2 agonists stimulate norepinephrine release from dorsal horn of spinal cord and cholinesterase inhibitors inhibit the breakdown of spinally released acetylcholine and increase the acetylcholine concentration in cerebrospinal fluid. These drugs exert their antinociceptive effect by mimicking the action of spinally released norepinephrine or acetylcholine, which acted on spinal &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptors or cholinergic receptors, respectively. An additive antinociceptive interaction was found between IT clonidine and cholinesterase inhibitor.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] As acetylcholine-induced response have been shown to involve NO, the present study was designed to examine whether a combination of tNTG (source of exogenous NO) would enhance the analgesic efficacy of IT neostigmine (source of acetylcholine).</p><p>In our study, the duration of analgesia was analyzed as period between complete onset of sensory blockade to the time at which patient started complaining of pain or first rescue analgesic was given using VAS score. We found that the addition of either 25 &#x003bc;g of IT clonidine or a tNTG patch (5 mg/24 h) provides a good duration of postoperative analgesia and this correlates with the findings of Pan <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Kaur <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Pan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] conducted a study of enhancement of analgesic effect of IT neostigmine and clonidine on bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. Their study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combining IT neostigmine and clonidine for the relief of pain in patients after cesarean delivery. They concluded that the combination of 150 &#x003bc;g clonidine intrathecally and 50 &#x003bc;g neostigmine provided longer postsurgical analgesia than with either drug used alone. Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in 2000 conducted a study to determine whether the association of tNTG would enhance analgesia from a low dose of IT neostigmine in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery during spinal anesthesia. They concluded that neither IT 5 &#x003bc;g neostigmine alone nor tNTG alone (5 mg/day) delayed the time to administration of the first rescue analgesics, the combination of both provided an average of 14 h of effective postoperative analgesia after vaginoplasty, suggesting that transdermal nitroglycerin and the central cholinergic agent neostigmine may enhance each other's antinociceptive effects at the dose studied. Kaur <italic>et al</italic>. in 2007 conducted a study to assess the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin patch (5 mg/24 h) on the analgesia of IT neostigmine (5 &#x003bc;g) and incidence of untoward effects. They found a statistically significant longer duration of analgesia in patients who received both IT neostigmine and tNTG than in patients who received neostigmine alone.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The present study did not show any significant changes on cardiovascular parameters. The mean heart rate and mean arterial pressures were comparable in all the groups in the intra and postoperative periods and was found to be statistically insignificant. This finding was consistent with the findings observed by Hood <italic>et al</italic>., Krukowski <italic>et al</italic>., Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. (1999) and Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000. Hood <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] studied the effects of IT neostigmine in 28 healthy volunteers in doses ranging from 50 &#x003bc;g to 750 &#x003bc;g. They found that IT neostigmine of 50 &#x003bc;g did not affect any measured cardiovascular variable. IT neostigmine in doses of 750 &#x003bc;g was associated with increased blood pressure and heart rate probably due to excitatory action on preganglionic sympathetic neurons. Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>. in 2000 conducted a study to determine whether the association of tNTG would enhance analgesia from a low dose of IT neostigmine in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery during spinal anesthesia. Their study shown that there were no significant changes on cardiovascular parameters while using nitroglycerin transdermal patch along with IT neostigmine. Krukowski <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that when neostigmine injection preceded epidural clonidine by 15 min, it reduces the incidence of hypotension. They also founded that IT neostigmine did not have any significant effect on mean arterial pressures.</p><p>In our study, we observed that Group II patients showed significantly higher sedation score than the other two groups. This difference can be attributed to the use of IT clonidine. Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] conducted a study on the efficacy of analgesic effects of low-dose IT clonidine as adjuvant to bupivacaine. In their study, the incidence of sedation as assessed by sedation score was higher in the clonidine group than in the control group.</p><p>High incidence of nausea and vomiting was found in all the three groups. This is most probably occurred due to use of neostigmine. Cho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] conducted a study to analyze the effect of IT neostigmine on postcesarean section analgesia. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IT neostigmine for postcesarean section analgesia. The study was conducted using normal saline 0.2 ml, or neostigmine 12.5 &#x003bc;g, or neostigmine 25 &#x003bc;g intrathecally with 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. There were significantly higher incidences of nausea and vomiting in neostigmine groups than in saline group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We concluded in this study that the addition of IT clonidine and tNTG patch to bupivacaine + neostigmine spinal anesthesia produced significant increase in duration of analgesia and decrease in requirement of analgesics.
