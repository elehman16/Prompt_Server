The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Thesis and Ethics Committee and written informed consent was taken from each of the patients. Sixty American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) Class I and II patients, aged 18&#x02013;65 years and undergoing elective LC were randomly assigned to one of the two groups (each containing 30 patients): Group I (dexmedetomidine group) and Group II (fentanyl group). Patients with hypertension, morbid obesity, severe hepatic, renal, cardiac, and endocrine dysfunction were excluded from the study.</p><p>On arrival to operation theater, routine monitoring (electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure) was started and baseline vital parameters such as HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and MAP, and arterial oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded. An intravenous (IV) line was secured and 10 ml/kg/h of ringer's lactate infusion was started before infusing any medication. IV injection midazolam 0.1 mg/kg was given 30 min before start of surgery. Study medication was prepared by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the computerized generated randomization schedule in 50 ml syringe resulting in concentration of 5 &#x000b5;g/ml in both groups.</p><p>In Group I intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine was started at a rate of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg followed by induction and then continuous infusion at the rate of 0.2 &#x000b5;g/kg throughout the surgery was given. In Group II, fentanyl was given as loading infusion at the rate of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg followed by infusion at the rate of 0.2 &#x000b5;g/kg. Induction was done 15 min after start of loading infusion with propofol (2 mg/kg). Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by vecuronium following &#x0201c;priming principle.&#x0201d; The priming dose of vecuronium (0.015 mg/kg) was given before propofol. Intubation was done after giving intubating dose of 0.05 mg/kg 6 min after giving the &#x0201c;priming dose.&#x0201d; Maintenance of anesthesia was done with O<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>O, isoflurane and intermittent bolus doses of vecuronium. PNP was created with peritoneal insufflation was done with CO<sub>2</sub> (at the rate of 2 L/min). Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was maintained at 12&#x02013;14 mmHg. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was maintained between 35 and 40 mmHg by mechanical ventilation. Intraoperative hypertension was managed by nitroglycerine spray.</p><p>At the end of surgery, infusion of the study drug was stopped. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed by appropriate dose of neostigmine and glycopyrrolate followed by tracheal extubation. Time to tracheal extubation, time to respond to verbal commands, and Orientation time were noted. HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were recorded throughout the surgery after infusion, 1 min after induction, 1 min after intubation, After PNP (at various intervals), end of PNP, end of surgery, and until 60 min after completion of surgery. Sedation in both groups was noted using Ramsay Sedation Score. Postoperative pain was evaluated in both the groups using visual analog scale (VAS) score. Modified Aldrete score was applied to decide about discharge the patients from postoperative care unit (PACU). Patients were observed for any adverse events in PACU.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The results obtained from the study have been presented in the tabulated manner.

These changes are usually transient, variable, and unpredictable which may or may not be tolerated by all the patients. Laparoscopic surgery requires creation of PNP, which is commonly done with insufflation with CO<sub>2</sub>. Elevated IAP after creation of PNP leads to rise in plasma level of norepiniphrine, epinephrine, and renin activity. Activation of Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system leads to various hemodynamic alterations such as decreased cardiac output, elevated arterial pressure and increased systemic/pulmonary vascular resistance. These physiological changes are of special concern to anaesthesiologists for safe and efficient management of the patient undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Various agents have been used to evaluate the safety of techniques and various drugs. Joris and Lamy documented release of vasopressin paralleled the time course of the increase in systemic vascular resistance after creation of PNP.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In the study, we observed the effects of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl on attenuation of pressor response to laryngoscopy, intubation and PNP in LC. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;2 agonist. Hypotension is caused by activation of receptors in the brain and spinal cord level, inhibiting neuronal firing. Presynaptic activation of &#x003b1;2 adrenergic receptors inhibits release of noreponehprine and postsynaptic activation in the central nervous system inhibits sympathetic activity and, therefore, can decrease blood pressure and HR. Effects of hemodynamics are mediated by inhibition of central sympathetic outflow.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl on the other hand acts via opioid receptors, leading to obtundation of pressor response. At high doses, 6 &#x000b5;g/kg completely abolishes the pressor response but produces tissue accumulation and requirement of mechanical respiratory support. At low doses of 1&#x02013;2 &#x000b5;g/kg, it attenuates arterial pressure and HR increase during laryngoscopy and intubation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In several study reports, infusion of dexmedetomidine has been used in range of 0.1 to 10 &#x000b5;g/kg.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There was smooth extubation and lesser orientation time by use of dexmedetomidine than fentanyl. Dexmedetomidine has shown better control of pain relief till 60 min in postoperative period than fentanyl, reducing postoperative analgesic requirements. Various side effects such as bradycardia and hypotension as associated with use of dexmedetomidine use can be counteracted by using slow infusion over 15&#x02013;20 min and hypotension by adequate preloading of the patient.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, no such adverse effect has been noted. Decrease in SpO<sub>2</sub> as associated with fentanyl is prevented by proper monitoring and use of supplemented O<sub>2</sub> therapy. Sedation in fentanyl was noted and patient taken care of by proper monitoring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We have found better attenuation of pressor response by use of dexmedetomidine than by use of fentanyl along with better patient comfort and cooperation, both intra-operatively and postoperatively. But there are few limitations of our study. Study population as calculated at the start of our project was based on various previous studies and taken to be as 85%. We could have drawn more positive results had the power of study been taken to be as 90% or &#x0003e;90%. This would have been possible by inclusion of more number of patients, but we avoided, as it would increase the inclusion of population at risk. But still we recommend using of dexmedetomidine to attenuate pressor responses during laryngoscopy, intubation and while creating PNP in LC.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rao</surname><given-names>LN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A clinical study of dexmedetomidine for maintenance during general anaesthesia for laparoscopic surgeries</article-title><source>Int J Med Sci Clin Invent</source><year>2015</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>681</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Srivastava</surname><given-names>VK</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagle</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Agarwal</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Verma</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kedia</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative evaluation of esmolol and dexmedetomidine for attenuation of sympathomimetic response to laryngoscopy and intubation in neurosurgical patients</article-title><source>J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2015</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>186</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25948898</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Haemodynmaic changes during laparoscopic cholecystectomy: Effect of clonidine premedication</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2007</year><volume>51</volume><fpage>205</fpage><lpage>10</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Amornyotin</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anesthetic management of laparoscopic cholecystectomy</article-title><source>Int J Anesthesiol Res</source><year>2013</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>3</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chraemmer-J&#x000f8;rgensen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Hertel</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Str&#x000f8;m</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000f8;ilund-Carlsen</surname><given-names>PF</given-names></name><name><surname>Bjerre-Jepsen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Catecholamine response to laryngoscopy and intubation.
