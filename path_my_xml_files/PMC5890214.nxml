function of patients with lumbar disc herniation when lumbar stabilization exercise was
applied to the patients, suggest an intervention method that can be used in future
clinical therapies. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty patients with lumbar disc herniation
underwent the intervention 30 minutes per day, three times per week for 4 weeks. Of them,
15 patients were assigned to the balance center stabilization resistance exercise group
(experimental group I) and the other 15 were assigned to the three-dimensional
stabilization exercise group (experimental group II). Before the intervention, disc
herniation index was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, sacral angle was measured
using X-ray, and back function was measured using the KODI. Four weeks later, these three
factors were re-measured and analyzed. [Results] There was a significant pre- versus
post-intervention difference in disc herniation index, sacral angle, and KODI in
experimental group I and a significant difference in disc herniation index and KODI in
experimental group II, and each group of disc herniation index and sacral angle had a
significant difference. In experimental group I, each disc herniation index and sacral
angle had a negative correlation. [Conclusion] The lumbar stabilization exercise, which
controls balance using pelvic movements, improves mobility and stability of the sacroiliac
joint; therefore, it increases pelvic and back movements. These kinds of movements not
only improved proprioception sense, they also had positive effects on lumbar disc function
recovery.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Disc herniation index</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Sacral angle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Back pain is one of the most common diseases in modern society since 60&#x02013;80% of the
population has experienced it at least once in their lifetime<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among back pain diseases, lumbar disc herniation is the most common
disease<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, decreasing the normal lumbar
curve and creating muscular stiffness. It also causes sacroiliac joint instability since the
facet joints and ligament flava are degenerated as the pelvis is warped and the sacral angle
of inclination is increased<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It also causes constant back pain and nerve root injection
between the legs since it makes sitting properly difficult and warps the posture, and
problems occur in balance and walking because of the weakened muscles surrounding the
spine<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. These symptoms become severe due
to disability of the disc function caused by the herniation, which makes it difficult to
maintain sitting or standing postures since it is not able to disperse the impact applied to
the back<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Constant health care and functional recovery are needed since these
symptoms can cause disease recurrence in the same area and herniation in other segments.
Therefore, it is necessary to perform early ambulation, exercise, and training<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise in particular aims to actively strengthen the multifidus muscles and transverse
abdominis muscles, deep muscles of the back; hence, lumbar stability exercises are needed to
stabilize the spine segments and vitalize the local muscles around the back<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, lumbar stability exercises are
difficult to perform in the acute phase when back pain is severe and do not address pelvis
problems such as sacral joint instability since they focus only on the local trunk muscles.
To compensate for these deficiencies, exercises are performed by patients using equipment
that can be used in early parts, which stimulates not only the deep muscles but also the
whole trunk muscles and creates trunk stability<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With this principle, the balance center stabilization resistance exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig 1.</label><caption><p>The balance center stabilization resistance exercise.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-2121-g001"/></fig>), which uses the pelvic movements on moving disc, and three-dimensional (3D)
stabilization exercises (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig 2.</label><caption><p>The 3D stabilization exercise.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-2121-g002"/></fig>), which can exercise on diverse degree. However, it remains to be seen how
accompanying symmetrical pelvis movements through these types of quantitative exercises
positively affect one&#x02019;s back. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effects of pelvis
movements on back function when the balance center stabilization resistance and 3D
stabilization exercises are applied to patients via the quantitative measurement of patients
with lumbar disc herniation and investigated the correlation between the effects; analyze
the effects of back stabilization through pelvis movements on disc herniation index, sacral
angle, and KODI; and make recommendations about how to manage lumbar disc herniation
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted for about 6 weeks from April 14 to May 22, 2017 after receiving

consisted of performing the prescribed exercise for 30 minutes three times a week for 4
weeks. Before the intervention, herniation index was measured using MRI, sacral angle was
measured using standing right posture X-rays, and back function was measured using the
Korean Oswestry Disability Index (KODI). After 4 weeks, these variables were re-examined and
analyzed.</p><p>The disc herniation index measurement consists of measurement of the disc and
intervertebral foramen at the intercept of the axial direction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The sagittal distance of the herniated disc was recorded
as the maximum anteroposterior disc height (AB), while length of the vertebral foramen was
the maximum anteroposterior canal length (EF). The width of the herniated disc was measured
by drawing a line in the middle of the anteroposterior disc length (CD), while the width of
the spinal canal was calculated at the same level (GH). The formula of the herniated disc
index is as follows: [(AB &#x000d7; CD)/(EF &#x000d7; GH)] &#x000d7;1,000<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sacral angle is the angle formed by the line drawn along the bottom surface of the sacrum

disc herniation are stabilized in various activities. This lumbar stabilization exercise is
used in patients in clinics to retrain the proprioceptive senses of the tissues surrounding
the joints<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Letafatkar et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
balance center stabilization resistance exercise positively affects back function since back
pain was reduced and proprioceptive sense, lumbar movement control, and quality of life
increased. There were some significant differences in each disc herniation index group and
KODI group in this study. However, there was a significant difference only in the
experimental group I in sacral angle test. The reason for this is that the 3D stabilization
exercise can lead to functional improvement due to the improvement of stabilization since it
is used by patients when their lower limbs and pelvises are fixed, but it led to different
results from those of the balance center stabilization resistance exercise since couple
motion of pelvic and back were not occurred. Also, the improvement of disk herniation index
was evident as inflammatory exudation was eliminated after increase of the spinal nerves and
blood flow rate of the intervertebral foramen by light exercise<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> through quantitative movements applied to the patients in
the range without pain and shown through the increased diameter of the intervertebral
foramen and the improved circulation around the discs.</p><p>Han et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the lumbar
stabilization exercise, which eases the mental effort, decreases spinal movements, and
improves pelvic tilt, had positive effects on body balance and decreased weight and gravity
on the lumbosacral area. Couillandre et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balance center stabilization resistance exercise
improves coordination as well as the muscular strength of back and the legs and improves
posture as the center of pressure is upgraded. In this study, there was a significant
intergroup difference in disc herniation index and sacral angle. The result of this is as
follows. The balance center stabilization resistance exercise that patients performed on the
moving plate by balancing through pelvic movement improved pelvis tilts more than the 3D
stabilization exercise, which does not have a joint movement but creates changes in
proprioceptive sense<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and has positive
effects on the sacroiliac joint. The conclusion of Kim et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> also supports this study since they stated that the proprioceptive
sense can be improved when the dynamic balance sense exercise was applied to the patients
using tools such as exercise balls.</p><p>Chu et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed the correlation
between lumbar disc herniation and intercostal line height in 445 back pain patients. They
concluded that the iliolumbar ligament brings instability to the lumbosacral joint and
increases the spinning movement when the iliolumbar ligament loses its function, so it
increases the possibility of L5/S1 lumbar disc herniation<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, the iliolumbar ligament becomes short and thin
and L4/L5 lumbar disc degeneration occurs more rapidly and becomes susceptible to
herniation<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, there was
a negative correlation only in experimental group I as disc herniation index increased,
decreasing the sacral angle. The reason for this is that a decreasing sacral angle increases
stability while decreasing mobility but improves stability and mobility at the same time
through the pelvic movement. This result improves the stability of the sacroiliac joint and
the physiological effects of the areas surrounding the lumbar disc<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> since it results in functional improvement of the back by
reducing stress on the spine and sacroiliac joint<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, this study demonstrated that the balance center
stabilization resistance exercise, which increases sacroiliac joint stability by controlling
balance through pelvic movements, can be clinically effective in patients with lumbar disc
herniation causing postural and spinal imbalances.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that it is difficult to generalize our findings to every
lumbar disc herniation patient since it was conducted at one medical institution and it was
not able to control confounding variables such as drugs taken by the patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This paper was supported by the Sehan University Research Fund in 2017.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Krekoukias</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Gelalis</surname><given-names>ID</given-names></name><name><surname>Xenakis</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Spinal mobilization vs. conventional physiotherapy in the
