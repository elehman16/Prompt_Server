In Argentina, the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia increased between 2005 and 2013 from 27.9% to 29.8%. Only one out of four subjects with a self-reported diagnosis of coronary heart disease is taking statins. Since 2014, statins (simvastatin 20&#x02005;mg) are part of the package of drugs provided free-of-charge for patients according to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification. The goal of this study is to test whether a complex intervention targeting physicians and pharmacist assistants improves treatment and control of hypercholesterolaemia among patients with moderate-to-high cardiovascular risk in Argentina.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a cluster trial of 350 patients from 10 public primary care centres in Argentina to be randomised to either the intervention or usual care. The study is designed to have 90% statistical power to detect a 0.7&#x02005;mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoproteins cholesterol from baseline to 12&#x02005;months. The physician education programme consists of a 2-day initial intensive training and certification workshop followed by educational outreach visits (EOVs) conducted at 3, 6 and 9&#x02005;months from the outset of the study. An on-site training to pharmacist assistants during the first EOV is performed at each intervention clinic.

In 2008, the global prevalence of elevated total cholesterol among adults was 39% (37% for males and 40% for females).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Observational studies show that there is a continuous positive relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and blood cholesterol concentrations.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists&#x02019; (CTT) Collaboration reported a meta-analysis<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> of individual data from 90&#x02005;000 individuals in 14 randomised trials of statin therapy versus control. Statin regimens resulted in a mean difference of about 1.0&#x02005;mmol/L in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a proportional reduction of 20% in major vascular events (defined as coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary revascularisation or stroke). A recent meta-analysis showed that trials comparing less intensive versus more intensive statin regimens produced further reductions in major vascular events.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>Although higher serum lipids level seems to be an almost inevitable consequence of economic development, urbanisation, westernisation and nutritional transition, these determinants can be offset through healthier diets and pharmacological interventions.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In low-income and middle-income countries, however, coverage of screening and treatment is still very low.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;16</xref></p><p>In Argentina, the National Risk Factor Surveys conducted by the Ministry of Health indicate that between 2005 and 2013<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> self-reported prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia rose from 27.9% to 29.8%. Of these, 54.8% received some treatment, and only 56.3% of patients treated were prescribed with lipid-lowering drugs (the rate of those receiving treatment was &#x0003c;20% among uninsured subjects, including subjects with &#x0003e;3 risk factors).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Recent baseline results from the CESCAS I Study&#x02014;a population-based prospective cohort study for the detection and follow-up of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and risk factors in 7600 adults from four cities in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> found that the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia in Argentina was 23.1% in men, and 25.6% in women. According to the Framingham heart study risk equation, the prevalence of non-optimal LDL-C was 28.0%. On the other hand, the percentage of subjects with hypercholesterolaemia who were aware of their condition was 37.3% (95% CI 32.8 to 41.9), and the percentage of aware patients under pharmacological treatment was dismally low: only 11.1%. Furthermore, only one in every four subjects with a self-reported diagnosis of CHD is taking statins, and most of those with CHD who are on statins have suboptimal LDL-C levels (Rubinstein <italic>et al.</italic> Personal communication. Data not yet published). This is especially relevant because hypercholesterolaemia accounts for 25% of the burden of CHD in Argentina, as shown in another study.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Use of evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPG) to improve effectiveness and quality of treatment for patients with dyslipidaemia</title><p>As CHD is highly prevalent and lipid-lowering drugs, particularly statins, are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, lipid treatment guidelines have important implications for the health of the population and for the use of healthcare resources.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The International Atherosclerotic Society (IAS) has recently issued a CPG for the management of suboptimal LDL-C. It recommends statins as first-line therapy, choosing the type of statin based on availability and costs and adjusting the dose according to patient's CVD risk.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> More recently, the 2013 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) panels updated their blood cholesterol guidelines. They recommend the prescription of high-intensity statin therapy (lowering LDL&#x02013;C &#x02265;50%) or moderate-intensity therapy (lowering LDL&#x02013;C by &#x0223c; 30% to &#x0003c;50%), based on the presence of prior CVD, LDL-C levels, type 2 diabetes, age and the estimated 10-year risk of CVD according to the risk estimates of pooled cohort equation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Owing to a lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the efficacy of titrating statins to reduce CVD, guidelines no longer recommend this treatment to meet specific LDL-C or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) goals.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, the publication of a CPG does not ensure its application in clinical practice and, therefore, it is necessary to design effective implementation plans specially tailored to the organisational context targeted by the CPG.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Interventions to improve CPG implementation</title><p>Despite the availability of evidence-based practice guidelines, multiple barriers hinder the appropriate management of hypercholesterolaemia in primary care settings. These barriers include organisational hurdles within primary care clinics; confusing and conflicting guidelines from external sources; errors and omissions by primary care doctors; communication problems at the interface between secondary and primary care,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> multiple competing demands on physicians' time and lack of reimbursement for preventive counselling.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition to this, there are other barriers related to (1) the healthcare system (eg, lack of access, cost of medications and poor insurance coverage); (2) healthcare providers (eg, lack of adherence to guidelines, willingness to accept elevated high cholesterol and failure to prioritise this issue among multiple chronic medical issues) and (3) patients (eg, reluctance to take medication).<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The interventions that have been effective in dealing with barriers related to clinical practice include multifaceted educational outreach visits (EOVs),<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> EOVs have the potential to change health professional practice, particularly physicians' prescribing patterns. The term EOV or &#x02018;academic detailing&#x02019; is used to describe a personal visit by a trained person to health professionals in their own settings. A recent systematic review on interventions to improve adherence to cardiovascular disease clinical guidelines showed a global positive impact in intervention group compared with usual care.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The key principles of this approach include surveys of practitioners to determine barriers for appropriate practice and the subsequent development of an intervention tailored to address those barriers using simple messages; contacting practitioners with low compliance and delivering the intervention through respectable persons. Interventions often include feedback on existing practices.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> EOVs alone or combined with other interventions have been effective in improving practice in the majority of circumstances: studies with dichotomous health professional outcomes (eg, proportion of patients treated in accordance with the guideline) showed a 5.6% improvement, while studies with continuous outcomes (eg, mean number of prescriptions) showed at least 20% improvement.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A recent Cochrane review indicates that patient re-enforcement and reminders seem to be the most promising interventions to increase adherence to lipid-lowering drugs. Other interventions associated with increased adherence were simplification of the drug regimen and patient information and education.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Most of the interventions targeted to change provider's behaviours are usually defined as &#x02018;complex interventions&#x02019;. Complex interventions are described as interventions that contain several interacting components or ingredients and also other characteristics such as a number and difficulty of behaviours required by those delivering or receiving the intervention, distinct groups or organisational levels targeted by the intervention, a number and variability of outcomes and a bigger latitude in the flexibility or tailoring of the intervention that is permitted.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In order to avoid that these complex interventions become &#x02018;black boxes&#x02019;, it is critical that process measures, in addition to outcomes, be planned to be assessed along with the study.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Throughout the implementation of this study, we will consider the conceptual framework for evaluation of implementation fidelity proposed by Carrol <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The modified framework is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016014420F1">figure 1</xref>. Usually there is no linear relationship between intervention and outcomes, but there are a number of effect modifiers that affect these relationships, such as participants' response, components, strategies to facilitate the intervention, intervention quality, recruitment and last but not least, context. These factors influence the implementation fidelity of the study in terms of adherence of participants (health managers, providers, patients, users, etc) to achieve desired outcomes.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016014420F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Conceptual framework for implementation fidelity.

The training was followed by EOVs conducted on quarterly basis (at 3, 6 and 9&#x02005;months from the outset of the study), tailored to the needs of clinics' individual practitioners to identify the barriers to appropriate prescribing (eg, adequate statin dosage according to CPGs, side effects of statins, barriers to chronic treatment adherence and so on). EOVs include CPG practical exercises, prescription-related audits and feedback using selected charts from patients with high CVD risk and recommendations to improve practice administration/procedures (eg, support for systematic identification, particularly for complex patients with low adherence). Finally, an mHealth application installed in physicians' smartphones used to facilitate evidence-based and guideline-driven decision aids to improve patient management.

In order to assess comparability between arms, we will compare the baseline characteristics of patients (demographics, clinical variables, lifestyle factors, anthropometrics measures and laboratory measurements) in the intervention group versus the control group using one-way ANOVA or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests. In addition to this, we will perform subgroup analyses on primary and secondary outcomes according to diabetes status and level of CVD risk.</p><p>An economic evaluation component based on patient-level trial data will be supplemented by a model-based component to extrapolate long-term costs and effects. The trial-based primary economic evaluation will use patient-level data collected from the proposed study. We will document all resources involved in conducting this comprehensive intervention programme, as well as all patient-level costs, in 2017 Argentine Pesos adjusted by Argentina's Consumer Price Index and then converted into international dollars. The primary incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) measure will be cost per mg/dL of change in LDL-C. Secondary measures will be cost per treated case, per case receiving an appropriate dose according to the CPG, and per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) using the Argentina EuroQol EQ-5D.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Dissemination</title><p>The dissemination plan is designed to translate, communicate and implement the research findings to inform health policy, health practice and public opinion.

This trial is designed with an implementation focus and has several distinctive aspects: there is a high prevalence of undiagnosed and uncontrolled population with dyslipidaemia and high CVD risk in Argentina as well as in most developing countries.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To the best of our knowledge, this is the first trial in Latin America that tests an educational intervention to reduce CVD risk targeting primary care physicians.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This study is very timely because statins were recently (2014) added to the national list of ambulatory drugs provided free-of-charge at Argentine public primary care clinics, and because there is no CPG in place in public PCCs aimed specifically at addressing the management of dyslipidaemia and statins by health providers. Promoting the adequate use of CPG leads to the reduction of inappropriate variability in clinical practice.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>
<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In addition, this study is innovative since it will use a mobile health application as a decision aid to support physician decision-making and a web-based platform to send tailored SMS messages to patients to promote behaviour change with respect to improving adherence to medications, clinical visits and lifestyles and behaviours.</p><p>As the study intervention targets mostly uninsured populations living in low-income settings, if successful, it can have an immediate impact in the real world through the dissemination and scale-up of the intervention programme to the entire national public primary care network in Argentina, thereby reducing health disparities in CVD risk management and control.</p><p>In summary, this study will generate urgently needed data on effective, practical and sustainable intervention programmes aimed at preventing and controlling CVD risk, which can be directly used in other primary care settings and healthcare systems in LMICs.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AR, VI and PG conceptualised and designed the manuscript, and revised and approved its final version.
