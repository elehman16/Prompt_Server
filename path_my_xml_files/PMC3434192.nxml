This allows service providers to monitor wound healing, facilitating early detection and treatment of adverse events. Follow-up clinic visits are also an opportunity to reinforce post-operative care instructions including risk-reduction counselling and promotion of delayed resumption of sex. Unfortunately, most programs report that many men fail to return for scheduled post-operative visits. A male circumcision program in South Africa reported that only 67% of men returned for follow-up within one week after surgery <xref rid="pone.0043832-Lissouba1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.

Study sites were clinics operating under the Ministry of Health, and supported by the Nyanza Reproductive Health Society (nine sites), Family AIDS Care and Education Services (one site), and Impact Research and Development Organization (two sites). Men eligible for enrolment were 18 years of age or older, had undergone circumcision on the day of screening, owned a mobile phone, had the phone in their possession at the time of enrolment, and were able and willing to respond to a questionnaire administered by phone 42 days after circumcision. Men who reported prior or on-going participation in any other research study were ineligible.</p><p>Between September 2010 and April 2011, 1,200 men were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or standard care. Men who had undergone circumcision were approached by study staff during the 30-minute post-operative recovery period.

All participants' mobile phone numbers were confirmed using a text message-based registration system.

Each participant's phone was credited with airtime worth twenty Kenya shillings (about US$0.25) to compensate for the cost of sending this text message. No other reimbursement was given. Because our text messaging system was one-way, there was no additional cost borne by participants. For all participants, the initial text message sent to the automated study software contained the participant site and study number. For participants randomized to the intervention arm, this message also included the preferred time of day and language (English, Kiswahili or Dholuo).</p><p>We used an automated text messaging software developed in conjunction with Dimagi Inc.

All procedures were documented in the participant's clinic records. The primary outcome was attendance at the seven-day post-operative clinic visit, determined by abstraction of clinic data from this record. Men were considered to have attended the seven-day post-operative visit on time if they returned within three days before or after the scheduled seven-day visit. Data abstracted from clinic records included the visit date, type of visit (routine/client-initiated/physician-scheduled), and the presence and severity (mild/moderate/severe) of adverse events. Twelve (1%) participants whose clinic records could not be located after an extensive search were considered lost to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>We assumed that 43% of men in the control group would return for the day seven visit, as observed in our Kenya male circumcision program. To provide at least 90% power to detect a relative risk (RR) between the two arms of 1.22 or larger for return to clinic (equivalent to an increase from 43% to 52.5%), we needed to enrol 1200 men (600 in each arm).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All tests were two-sided, with a significance level of 0.05.

The SMS intervention versus control arms were compared using a chi-square test. Relative risks and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson regression with robust error variance <xref rid="pone.0043832-Zou1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

There were minor differences in the proportions of men reporting zero versus one partner in the past month in the intervention versus control arms. However, the proportion reporting multiple partners was similar. Other baseline characteristics were similar in both study arms.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0043832-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0043832.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Baseline Characteristics.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0043832-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0043832.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SMS group</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;600)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;600)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n (%)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years) -

In the intent-to-treat analysis, 65% of men returned in the intervention arm compared to 60% in the control arm.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with those of studies evaluating text messaging and phone reminders for adherence to clinic visits for other medical conditions <xref rid="pone.0043832-Perron1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043832-Downer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, although our effect size was smaller in magnitude. To our knowledge, this was the first randomized trial to evaluate SMS to improve clinic attendance in a resource-limited setting.</p><p>We found that return for the scheduled seven-day post-operative clinic visit was associated with lower travel cost related to clinic attendance. Men who incur a higher cost may not be willing to spend money on a return visit. These findings suggest that male circumcision programs might improve follow-up by providing other interventions for such groups of men, such as reimbursement of transport costs or mobile clinics to make services more readily accessible. We also found a statistical trend (p&#x0003c;0.10) suggesting that having less than high school education was independently associated with failure to return for the seven-day clinic visit. Additional or modified communications for men with low levels of education might help to address this problem.Alternatively, it is possible that the association between low levels of education and failure to return for follow-up may have more to do with lack of money for transportation in the less educated group compared to those with higher educational attainment.</p><p>Despite the randomized trial design, the findings from this study must be interpreted in the context of a number of limitations. First, 49% of those screened were excluded because they were less than 18 years old. As a result, it is difficult to generalize these results to this large population of younger men presenting for male circumcision. Second, we excluded men who did not own or have phones with them at the time of circumcision. No data were collected from these men, as they were not enrolled. Thus, it was not possible to directly compare men who had mobile phones to men who did not. This could limit generalizability and the impact of text messaging in the context of widespread scale-up of male circumcision interventions for HIV prevention. However, mobile phone access is rapidly expanding. In Kenya, with a population of 38 million people, there were 22 million mobile phone subscribers by September 2010 <xref rid="pone.0043832-Communications1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, with 63% of all Kenyan households owning at least one phone <xref rid="pone.0043832-2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Third, it is common for people to change mobile phone numbers, and those who did so were unable to inform the study team of this change. Fourth, our SMS software was not programmed to request delivery notifications, and so we were unable to verify whether messages were received. It is possible that a number of men in the intervention arm did not receive the intervention if their phones could not be reached. Finally, the absolute increase of 5.7% in the proportion returning to clinic was a smaller change than our study was initially powered to detect. Nonetheless, we were able to detect a modest but statistically significant increase in follow-up with SMS text messages after male circumcision, due to our large sample size and high participant retention. Despite these limitations, we were able to demonstrate a modest increase in follow-up with SMS text messages after male circumcision.</p><p>Our finding that even in the SMS arm more than a third of participants failed to return parallels results from previous studies of medical interventions other than male circumcision, which have also reported that a high proportion of participants fail to return even when they receive messages <xref rid="pone.0043832-Perron1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043832-Downer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Notably, rates of missed visits among both intervention and control participants in our study were lower than those typically reported by male circumcision programs in Kenya. It is possible that men behaved differently in a trial setting than in a non-research setting. Being in the study may have promoted return to clinic independent of the intervention (Hawthorne Effect) <xref rid="pone.0043832-Franke1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. If this were the case, we may have under-estimated the reduction in missed visits due to the SMS intervention, because of a potent effect of the control condition.</p><p>Our SMS system was inexpensive. Except for the initial registration message, participants did not incur any costs. Our text messaging software was able to send out thousands of text messages per month at an average total cost of US$25 per month. The initial cost of setting up the system (US$5,000) would not be incurred again in the event of scale-up. Because the system is automated and software-based, neither additional human resources nor new physical infrastructure are needed. The SMS software easily works with different languages, and also works across geographical boundaries, limited only by the extent of mobile phone network coverage. Participant registration into the system took no more than two minutes per participant. Our low-cost intervention could easily be integrated into programs for male circumcision in Kenya, and likely in other sub-Saharan African countries. Similar studies using SMS or phone reminders demonstrated financial benefits of using SMS, including cost-effectiveness <xref rid="pone.0043832-Perron1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0043832-Downer1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>Our study utilized daily text messages, and it is possible that less frequent messages would be equally effective. Studies evaluating the use of SMS for antiretroviral adherence show that weekly messages may have higher efficacy than more frequent messages <xref rid="pone.0043832-PopEleches1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043832-Lester1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. While we believe that messages during the first few days after circumcision could be useful to promote a quick return to clinic at any sign of an adverse event, our study did not directly address this question. There is also a lack of published data on the relationship between missing the post-operative visit and the incidence of complications. Qualitative studies involving circumcised men could provide insight into the optimal timing and frequency of messages.</p><p>With on-going efforts to provide adult male circumcision to millions of men across sub-Saharan Africa, post-operative follow-up will be a key element of such large programs <xref rid="pone.0043832-WHOUNAIDSJHPIEGO1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Of note, the number needed to treat was 18. That is, we would need to send text messages to 18 men for one additional man to return to clinic. This could lead to substantial benefits if applied to the millions of men willing to undergo circumcision for HIV prevention. At the same time, these findings show that a substantial proportion of men fail to return for post-operative visits even with daily messages intended to enhance follow-up. Understanding the additional reasons for failure to return will be essential in order to optimize follow-up rates. Future intervention strategies could benefit from combining SMS with behavioural and structural interventions to address transportation costs and message content for less educated men to further optimize return rates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043832.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
