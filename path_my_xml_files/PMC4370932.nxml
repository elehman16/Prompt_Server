To evaluate the impact of oligofructose (OF)-supplemented infant formula on fecal microbiota, stool characteristics, and hydration. <italic>Methods</italic>. Ninety-five formula-fed infants were randomized to &#x003b1;-lactalbumin-enriched control formula (CF) or identical formula with 3.0 g/L OF (EF) for 8 weeks; 50 infants fed human milk (HM) were included. <italic>Results</italic>. Eighty-four infants completed the study, 70 met per-protocol criteria. Over 8 weeks, bifidobacteria increased more in EF than CF group (0.70 vs 0.16 log<sub>10</sub> bacterial counts/g dry feces, <italic>P</italic> = .008); EF was not significantly different from HM group (<italic>P</italic> = .32). EF group stool consistency was intermediate between CF and HM groups; at week 8, EF group had softer stools than CF (5-point scale: 1 = hard, 5 = watery; consistency score 3.46 vs 2.82, <italic>P</italic> = .015) without significant differences in stool frequency. Physician-assessed hydration status was normal for all infants. <italic>Conclusions</italic>.

Following birth, the infant colon is rapidly populated by a variety of bacteria. Differences in the fecal microbiota of HM-fed and formula-fed (FF) infants have been reported; the microbiota of HM-fed infants is dominated by <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. with lower proportions of <italic>Bacteroides</italic> spp. and <italic>Clostridium</italic> spp. compared with FF infants.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr4-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In addition, compared with FF infants, those fed HM typically have softer, more frequent stools.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Bioactive components of HM that may provide benefits to infants include whey proteins such as &#x003b1;-lactalbumin as well as complex oligosaccharides.

These oligosaccharides function as prebiotics, antiadhesive antimicrobials, and modulators of intestinal epithelial cell responses and immune function.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> While more than 100 such oligosaccharides have been identified in HM, these compounds are virtually absent from infant formula.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In order to more closely mimic the intestinal microbiota and stool characteristics of HM-fed infants, infant formula manufacturers have added plant-derived fibers, including oligofructose (OF), to infant formulas. However, because of the osmotic effects of fiber, concerns have been raised about the potential for these fiber-supplemented formulas to adversely affect infant hydration status.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Oligofructose is an oligosaccharide fiber which is not digested in the small intestine but is utilized predominantly by colonic bacteria such as bifidobacteria as a fuel source.

In addition, infants receiving formula with 3.0 g/L OF experienced a greater frequency of &#x0201c;looser stools&#x0201d; compared with the group receiving formula with 1.5 g/L OF; together these findings raised questions about whether OF may potentially affect infant hydration status.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Although studies of OF-supplemented infant formulas have reported good tolerance to these formulas (based on collection of adverse events and other safety data), none included a detailed evaluation of infant hydration status. In addition, differences in study formula composition (including the presence of other ingredients that may affect stool characteristics or microbiota), durations of OF supplementation, and microbiota detection methodologies suggest further evaluation of the effects of OF supplementation alone on fecal microbiota, stool characteristics, and hydration status in healthy term infants is warranted.</p><p>Here we report the effects of a bovine milk&#x02013;based, &#x003b1;-lactalbumin-enriched infant formula supplemented with 3.0 g/L OF on intestinal microbiota, stool characteristics, and hydration status in healthy term infants. The present investigation arose from a study that utilized quantitative culture techniques to evaluate the effects of &#x003b1;-lactalbumin enriched formula with and without OF on fecal bifidobacteria concentrations.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> While that analysis was limited due to the low sensitivity of the quantitative culture method, the study design and methodology provided an opportunity to explore the effects of OF-supplemented infant formula on fecal microbiota in more detail using FISH, a method with greater sensitivity to fecal flora differences. It was hypothesized that infants fed OF-supplemented formula would exhibit differences in fecal bifidobacteria and stool consistency compared to infants fed formula without OF, and would be more similar to a HM-fed reference group included in the study, while maintaining adequate hydration status. In addition, two noninvasive indicators of intestinal disease, fecal <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin and calprotectin, were evaluated as secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-0009922814553433"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-0009922814553433"><title>Study Design</title><p>A multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study was conducted at 10 outpatient pediatric offices in the United States from May 2005 to April 2006. The study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of Helsinki. Institutional review boards approved the study protocol for each study site, and written informed consent of parents/guardians was obtained.</p><p>Both FF and HM-fed infants were recruited to participate in this 8-week study. Infants aged 1 to 13 days were recruited to participate in a screening visit; those who met inclusion criteria were eligible to participate in the baseline study visit (Study Day 0), which was planned between 5 and 14 days of age. At the baseline visit, FF infants (n = 95) were randomized to receive 1 of 2 term infant formulas for 8 weeks: a bovine milk&#x02013;based &#x003b1;-lactalbumin-enriched control formula (CF), or an identical formula supplemented with 3.0 g/L OF (EF). A nonrandomized reference group of healthy term HM-fed infants (n = 50) was included; these infants continued to be fed HM throughout the study. Study participants, care providers, and those assessing outcomes were blinded to the feeding group assignment through the use of coded feeding groups. Study formulas were randomly assigned based on 4 equal-sized color-coded feeding groups, each corresponding to 1 of the 2 study feedings. A biostatistician with no involvement in trial conduct used a computer algorithm designed specifically for this study to generate a randomization schedule for each site in which study numbers were randomly assigned in blocks of 6, comprised of 2 study numbers for HM-fed infants and one study number for each of the 4 formula color codes. Study coordinators at each site assigned a unique study number and a corresponding treatment group to infants sequentially from the randomization schedule, depending on whether the infant was HM-fed or FF. The entire block of 6 study numbers was dispensed before moving to the next block.</p><p>Stool samples were collected at baseline and after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks of exclusive study formula or exclusive HM feeding and analyzed for selected fecal microbiota using FISH. The primary endpoint was the concentration of fecal bifidobacteria at week 8. Secondary endpoints were fecal concentrations of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, clostridia, <italic>Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus/Enterococcus</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> at week 8. Other secondary endpoints included fecal <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin and calprotectin, as well as stool frequency and consistency, hydration status, infant weight, and number of wet diapers per day. Caregivers recorded stool frequency (number of stools per day) and consistency (5-point scale: 1 = hard, 2 = firm, 3 = soft, 4 = loose, 5 = watery) on 24-hour diary cards, which were collected at baseline, week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 8; fecal <italic>C difficile</italic> toxin and calprotectin were measured at the same time points. Hydration status was assessed by study physicians at the screening, week 4, and week 8 visits. A set of 5 common clinical parameters that reflect infant hydration status was established prior to study start and consistently used by investigators across all study sites to evaluate hydration. These parameters included mucous membranes, skin turgor, body weight, formula intake, and number of wet diapers per day. Study physicians performed a physical examination of the infants at the screening and week 8 visits to monitor overall health status. Anthropometric measurements (weight, length, and occipital frontal circumference) were collected at the screening and week 8 visits; weight was also collected at baseline. Study coordinators interviewed caregivers during clinic visits at week 1, week 2, week 4, and week 8 and by phone at week 3, week 6, and poststudy. Interview questions assessed any changes in infant health, and whether the infant or breastfeeding mother started on any new medications. Study coordinators also determined whether the infant continued to be exclusively fed study formula or HM. Safety was assessed by monitoring the incidence of adverse events, defined as any unintended change in pathology or anatomic, metabolic, or physiologic functioning temporally associated with enrollment in the study; this definition included events that occurred both during the trial and within 15 days after the last day of study feeding. At each visit/assessment, adverse events observed by the investigator or reported by the parent/caregiver were recorded, regardless of whether they were related to the study treatment; investigators were instructed to thoroughly report all adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="section4-0009922814553433"><title>Study Population</title><p>All infants were required to have been either exclusively FF or HM-fed from birth.

These medications included antibiotics; antifungals, except topical; suppositories; bismuth-containing medications; herbal supplements; and/or any medication that could neutralize or suppress gastric acid secretion. In addition, infants were not enrolled in the study if they had a congenital abnormality, evidence of significant disease, or a history of feeding intolerance or allergy to cow&#x02019;s milk protein.

DIFF CHEK&#x02122; &#x02212; 60 test was used (TECHLAB Inc, Blacksburg, VA). The test is an enzyme immunoassay designed to detect the <italic>C difficile</italic> antigen, glutamate dehydrogenase. A positive result confirms the presence of <italic>C difficile</italic> in a fecal specimen; the test does not distinguish between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of <italic>C difficile</italic>. The assay was performed at the Center for Pediatric Research (Norfolk, VA). Analysis of calprotectin was performed using the PhiCal&#x02122; ELISA test (Genova Diagnostics; Ashville, NC); the assay was performed at Genova Diagnostics. Data are reported as micrograms per gram (&#x000b5;g/g) feces.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0009922814553433"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on previous data collected by the sponsor, which indicated the mean (log-transformed) bifidobacteria count in the feces of HM-fed infants was 8.8 with a standard deviation of 1.9; equivalence margins for comparisons to the HM group were defined to be &#x000b1;1.76 (20% of the mean), assuming 80% power and an &#x003b1; level of .05.</p><p>The primary objective of the study was to compare the intestinal microbiota (measured as fecal bacteria concentrations) among the feeding groups at 8 weeks (day 56). With the exception of safety outcomes, all analyses were performed in the per protocol (PP) population (n = 70), which excluded infants with major protocol violations. Infants were excluded from the PP population if they were not 5 to 14 days of age at baseline stool sample collection; were not exclusively fed either study formula or HM; were presently receiving or had received excluded medications or supplements; were a HM-fed infant whose mother was presently receiving or had received any postpartum antibiotics or antifungal medications (except topical); had received prohibited feeding during the study; had an inadequate stool sample at baseline or week 8; had the week 8 clinic visit outside of the accepted window (before day 49 or after day 63). Adverse events were evaluated in the safety population, which included all infants who received study formula or breast milk (n = 145).</p><p>Fecal microbiota data were compared in the study groups using 2-way analyses of covariance, with terms for baseline bacterial count, treatment, study site, and treatment by site interaction. Analyses were based on changes from baseline to week 8 in log<sub>10</sub>-transformed counts [log<sub>10</sub>(count)] per gram dry fecal weight. Sparse data prevented more than a descriptive summary of the number of infant stool samples positive for <italic>C difficile</italic>. Infants with missing baseline or week 8 stool data were not included in the summary. Statistical methods for analyzing fecal calprotectin concentrations were the same as described for fecal microbiota data; calprotectin concentrations were analyzed using models with terms for baseline, treatment, study site, and treatment by site interaction, and were log<sub>10</sub> transformed prior to analysis. Stool frequency and consistency were analyzed for treatment difference at week 8 using a two-way analysis of variance with terms for treatment, site, and interactions. A similar analysis was completed for the number of wet diapers per day. Infant weights were analyzed using a 2-way analysis of covariance with terms for treatment, site, and interactions, using the baseline measurement as the covariant.</p><p>Analyses were initially conducted comparing the 2 formula groups and excluding HM since it was not a randomized group; subsequently, separate analyses were done comparing each formula group to HM. Study sites that enrolled 20 or fewer subjects were pooled to form a single site for analysis purposes. Substitute values were not added if data were missing; infants with missing values for a particular outcome were not included in the analysis of that outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section8-0009922814553433"><title>Results</title><sec id="section9-0009922814553433"><title>Subjects</title><p>Of 166 infants screened, a total of 145 infants between 5 and 15 days of age (mean &#x000b1; SD = 11.2 &#x000b1; 2.3 days) were enrolled in the study; 48 (33%) received CF, 47 (32%) received EF, and 50 (35%) continued to receive HM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-0009922814553433">Figure 1</xref>).

Two previous studies of OF-supplemented formula in exclusively FF infants have demonstrated little or no change in fecal microbiota after OF supplementation; however, the duration of supplementation in these studies was short, only 1 to 2 weeks.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Furthermore, at least one of these studies measured fecal microbiota with quantitative culture, a detection method with relatively low sensitivity.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A study by Yao et al<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> evaluated the effects of a formula supplemented with OF and a high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate fat blend on fecal microbiota using FISH.

However, none of these events was considered serious and in both groups, the events leading to the withdrawals represented common occurrences that are typical among infants of this age (vomiting, spitting up, flatulence, and abdominal pain).

By testing a formula with a single prebiotic (OF), which was not used in combination with other prebiotics such as galactooligosaccharides or inulin, the study was able to directly evaluate the effect of OF on fecal microbiota, stool consistency and frequency, and hydration. In addition, infants were excluded who consumed medications that could influence study endpoints. The possibility that mode of delivery confounded the effect of the formulas on fecal microbiota counts was excluded in the statistical analysis. Limitations included the study discontinuation and data exclusion rates, which affected the proportion of infants who remained in the study and met PP criteria, and could thus be included in the analysis, although based on the study discontinuation/data exclusion rates reported in other published infant prebiotic studies, this is not uncommon.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> Where the events leading to study discontinuation are published, they typically represent common symptoms in infant populations, such as gastroesophageal reflux, regurgitation, and hunger<sup><xref rid="bibr46-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup>; as is the case here, rates of study discontinuation are typically similar between the formula groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr46-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="bibr47-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, it is well recognized that breast-feeding is the optimal means of providing nutrition to the healthy term infant. Improvements to infant formula may match some, but not all, of the benefits of HM feeding. The addition of 3.0 g/L OF to an &#x003b1;-lactalbumin enriched term infant formula resulted in increases in fecal bifidobacteria over an 8-week period similar to increases in HM-fed infants, and greater than increases in infants receiving a control formula without OF. Hard stools and constipation are common concerns among parents of FF infants<sup><xref rid="bibr41-0009922814553433" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>; here, FF infants receiving OF had stools that were softer than those in infants receiving control formula and more similar to those in HM-fed infants without increases in stool frequency or adverse impacts on hydration status. Overall, the present study supports the safety and tolerability of an OF-containing infant formula, including hydration status. Future studies should measure species-level changes in the fecal microbiota caused by OF supplementation; these may or may not parallel changes in broad bacterial classes, such as those detected by the FISH method. In addition, future studies should evaluate whether the benefits of OF supplementation persist after supplementation ends, and seek to better understand any long term benefits associated with improvements in fecal microbiota and stool consistency resulting from OF supplementation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the investigators and their study staff for participating in this multicenter trial: Jack Seidel, Dallas, Texas; Stan Block, Bardstown, Kentucky; Frank Hughes, Bossier City, Louisiana; Laura Ann Sass, Norfolk, Virginia; John Spitzer, Kalamazoo, Michigan; Frances Rushton, Beaufort, South Carolina; Lisa Lowe, Murfreesboro, Tennessee; Richard Schwartz, Vienna, Virginia; Linda Garrison, Portage, Michigan; and Michael Warren, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Susan Wernimont, Robert Northington, Manjiang Yao, and Jodi Bettler are employees of Nestl&#x000e9; Nutrition.
