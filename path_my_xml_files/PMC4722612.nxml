(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>). Painful events such as vaccination is repeated and uncontrolled. Pain can cause short- and long-term effects in infants. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Its short-term effects include a delay in wound healing, a change in immunity system function, endocrine and biochemical changes, increased cortisol and catecholamine release, increased glucagon, growth hormone, aldosterone, rennin, and antidiuretic hormones, and decreased insulin secrection. They also include physiological changes such as apnea, bradycardia, tachycardia, skin color changes, hypertension, sweating palms, increased reased respiration rate and muscular tonicity, increased intracranial pressure and axygen intake, and behavioral changes, crying, ect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>). The studies have shown that uncontrolled pain experienced during early life has negative and long-term side effects, such as distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>), and such experiences negatively affects the development of the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). It is therefore important that the number of painful stimuli be kept to a minimum, and that these stimuli are rendered less painful during this period for each procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). The purpose in pediatric pain management is to reduce physiological and behavioral causes, to reduce intensity and duration of pain to minimum, to lessen the risk, and to give maximum benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>).</p><p>Nowadays various methods are used to reduce procedural pain in the newborn. Pharmacological and non-Pharmacological methods are used to relieve pain in newborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). Non-pharmacological methods are alternatives for pain control, which implement small non-invasive attempts to reduce the pain. Position change, kangaroo care and touch, massage, teat giving, sucrose giving, breastfeeding, playing music, reducing distractions, and personalized developmental care are among these methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). In addition, methods such as distracting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>), cold application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), massage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>), vibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>) injection technique, and manual pressure application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>) are used to reduce pain during invasive attempts.</p><p>Flick application at the injection area could be used to control pain during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>).

According to records, this heath center had provided service for 11780 people and 352 infants during 2014. Data of the research was collected during working hours between March and June 2015. The research was carried out in vaccination room. The infants, whose mothers accepted to take part in the research, were brought to FHC at the end of first month for the second dose of Hepatitis B vaccine, and they were flicked at injection area just before they were vaccinated.</p><p>Population of the research includes all the infants who applied for second dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to FHC between March and June 2015.</p><p>Sample of the research includes the infants who applied for second dose of Hepatitis B vaccine to FHC during the research period and who met following criteria. Sample of the research includes 70 infants, 35 for experimental group, and 35 for control group. In the power analysis performed to determine the sample size, the calculated sample size was found to be 70 infants in order to achieve a 0.80 power in the test, at a significance level of 0.05 with a medium level of effect. Sample groups were randomly selected during the research period; the first infant arriving for vaccination was registered in the control group, whereas the second infant was registered in the experimental group, and so on. Each group included 35 infants.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion Criteria</title><p>The sample group, which was formed after written approval of parents, was selected by taking some criteria into consideration. Some of the criteria for infants are that gestational age is 37-42 weeks, term and healthy, birth weight is 2500 gr and above, 30-42 days old after birth, no previous treatment experience of intramuscular injection, no pain-killing medicine before vaccination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data Collecting Tools</title><p>The question form and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale(NIPS) were used in data collection and the infants&#x02019; responses to the procedure were video recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Question Form</title><p>This form, prepared by the researchers, based on relevant literature, comprised questions to collect participants&#x02019; demographic data, such as, gender, age, weight, duration of crying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>).

Validity and reliability for Turkish were completed by Akdovan in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>). Neonate infant pain scale is formed by 6 behavioral sections including facial expression, crying, breathing style, arm and leg movements, and being woken up. Crying has 3 points (0-1-2), and other behaviors have 2 points (0-1). Total score is between 0 and 7. Higher score shows that the pain is more intense. Akdovan found Cronbah alpha scores as 0,83-0,83-0,86 in his study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>) Internal consistency Cronbach Alpha score of this scale was detected 0.81 before, 0.76 during, and 0.78 after operation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Procedure</title><p>Subsequently, research was carried out with those infants whose parents were willing to participate after informed consents were obtained from them. Data collection forms were completed by researchers. Neonates in both control and experimental group were vaccinated by the same staff working in the family health center (FHC). All infants were awake, had clean diapers at the time of injection, and their parents were in the procedure room.</p><p>The infants in the control group were regularly vaccinated, without any other attempt in FHC, and they were videotaped before, during, and after the vaccination. During the vaccination procedure, the parents of infants in both groups were allowed to calm their babies by touching and talking to them, but not to feed and do anything that would distract the infant&#x02019;s attention, including giving them toys, showing them a dummy, or clapping.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Routine application of Hepatitis B vaccine</title><p>The infant was laid back, and the vaccination area was marked. The Hepatitis B vaccine was intramuscularly (IM) injected. The injection site was located at the ventrolateral section of the vastus lateralis muscle, which is in the upper 1/3 part of the thigh. The vaccination area was disinfected with alcohol, and the vaccine was injected into the upper 1/3 section of the vastus lateralis muscle at 90-degree angle.</p><p>Each infant in the experimental group was flicked once at the vaccination area (vastus lateralis) prior Hepatitis B vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Flick application</title><p>The Nurse determined the vaccination area and disinfected it using cotton with 70&#x000a0;% alcohol. The muscle was held with the nurse&#x02019;s left hand, and the vaccination area was flicked with the right hand. The flick was given as follows: the thumb was placed on the nail of middle finger, then the vaccination area was stimulated with a quick tap using upper nail part of middle finger (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flick application</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13052_2016_218_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>It was ensured that the hands of flicking staff were warm, and nails were clipped in order not to harm the infant. The staff waited to start the procedure until the infant calm down, if it was anxious; the procedure was not initiated if the infants were crying.</p><p>Infants in both the experimental and control group were videotaped before, during, and after vaccination until they stopped crying. After vaccination, filming was continued for 1&#x000a0;min, and, following ethical principles, the mothers were allowed to comfort their babies that continued crying for &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;min. Video records lasted about 1.5 - 2&#x000a0;min. The infant&#x02019;s whole body and the crying sounds, which were indicative of pain, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>) were video recorded using a Canon Ixus 75 7.1 MP digital video camera.</p><p>The procedure was recorded using a video camera. Video records were evaluated independently by two specialist observers (pediatric specialist nurse, neonatal doctor). Observers were not informed which newborn belonged to the control group and which newborn belonged to the treatment group. After records were completed, they were evaluated twice by two experts at different times. Observers scored the NIPS by evaluating the pain experienced by the newborns. The concordance coefficient was calculated between observers. Average Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) scores were calculated at the end of evaluations. Observers&#x02019; evaluations were found consistent (for each of 6 categories of NIPS, Kappa observers consistency test gives the result in range of 0.48 and 0.71).</p><p>The duration of neonates&#x02019; crying (sec) was recorded from the video records.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Data from the research were evaluated in SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) 13.0 software package.

It was believed that neonates and infants do not feel any pain, whereas numerous studies have shown that they feel more pain than children and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>). Nowadays various methods are used to reduce procedural pain in the newborn. Some nonpharmacological methods of stopping pain are touching, giving position, skin stimulation, heat and cold application, teat giving, breastfeeding, kangaroo care, and sucrose giving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>).</p><p>This study was conducted with an objective of providing an alternative to other prevalent nonpharmacological methods and to define the effect of flick application on pain during vaccination. The results of this study indicated that there was no significant difference in mean pain score between infants in the experimental and control groups before vaccination (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05), but there was a significant difference in mean pain score during (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and after the procedure (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p><p>It is identified that flick application is among the effective methods for controlling pain during childhood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). In concurrence with other studies, we found that flick application was effective in reducing pain during vaccination. The effect of manual pressure application, which has a similar effect to flick application, has also been examined in some studies. In the studies of Yavuz (2011), Barnhill et al (1996), Chung and Wong (2002), it was detected that manual pressure to the injection area prior to vaccination reduces injection pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). Furthermore, in the study of U&#x0011f;urlu (2011), in which the effect of massage during vaccination was studied, it was observed that the pain scores of infants in an experimental group were lower than those in a control group during and after the operation. In the light of these results, it is suggested that massage is effective in reducing pain, and as the massage continues, the level of pain decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>).</p><p>The reduction of pain through skin stimulation is based on the Gate Control Theory, which was suggested by Wall and Melzack in 1965, and is still an accepted theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). In this theory, the presence and severity of pain depends on the passage of neurological stimulations and pain signals are transported on small fibers. The large fibers are stimulated through massage, rubbing, and pressure and the small fibers are prevented from transporting signals. As there are numerous large fibers in the skin, most touching stimulations have the potential to reduce pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). This theory explains the possibility that manual pressure and massage can reduce pain. As flick application conveys a similar stimulus, its effect on reducing pain can also be explained by Gate Control Theory.</p><p>According to a literature survey, research concerning the effect of flick application on reducing pain during vaccination has not yet been conducted in T&#x000fc;rkiye or worldwide. The current study is the first to investigate this topic. Crying is an important indicator of pain for infants as it is their only means of communication and, among the behavioral methods, it is accepted as a practical method to evaluate the severity and duration of pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>).</p><p>In the current study, no statistical significance was detected regarding duration of crying between the experimental and control groups; however it was noted that infants in the experimental group cried for shorter periods than those in the control group. In the study of U&#x0011f;urlu and Ba&#x0015f;bakkal (2011), similarly, it was found that infants in an experimental group cried for shorter time-periods than those in a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>). In the same study, a significant difference in average duration of crying was detected between the control and experimental groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). In the study of Razek and El-Dain (2009), in which the effect of breastfeeding on reducing vaccine pain was studied, total duration of crying was 125&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;sec for infants in an experimental group and 148&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13&#x000a0;sec for infants in a control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results indicated that the severity of pain was decreased for infants who were flicked on the vaccination area before immunization; thus, flicking before vaccination is probably effective in reducing pain and decreasing the duration of infant crying during vaccination in primary care health institutions. Finally, flicking before vaccination can be an easy to perform, guick, safe and inexpensive &#x0201c;add on&#x0201d; to other techniques in the management of vaccination pain. Furthermore, it is suggested that this study should also be performed in older groups and with larger sample sizes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>EKC and FKO has been involved is revising the manuscript for important intellectual outcome; EKC, FKO and DA have given substantial contributions to conception and design of this study; EKC and FKO performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript; EKC, FKO and DA critically reviewed the manuscript and supervised the whole study process.
