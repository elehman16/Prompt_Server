Safety and immunogenicity were evaluated for 12 months. Both vaccines were well-tolerated. Overall, 62&#x00025; and 86&#x00025; of vaccine recipients in the rAd5 alone and DNA prime - rAd5 boost groups, respectively, responded to the HIV-1 proteins by an interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;) ELISPOT. The frequency of immune responses was independent of rAd5 dosage levels. The highest frequency of responses after rAd5 alone was detected at 6 weeks; after DNA prime - rAd5 boost, at 6 months (end of study). At baseline, neutralizing antibodies against Ad5 were present in 81&#x00025; of volunteers; the distribution was similar across the 4 groups. Pre-existing immunity to Ad5 did not appear to have a significant impact on reactogenicity or immune response rates to HIV antigens by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT. Binding antibodies against Env were detected in up to 100&#x00025; recipients of DNA prime - rAd5 boost. One volunteer acquired HIV infection after the study ended, two years after receipt of rAd5 alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The HIV-1 rAd5 vaccine, either alone or as a boost following HIV-1 DNA vaccine, was well-tolerated and immunogenic in African adults. DNA priming increased the frequency and magnitude of cellular and humoral immune responses, but there was no effect of rAd5 dosage on immunogenicity endpoints.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00124007">NCT00124007</ext-link>

To further develop these vaccines, three clinical studies were conducted simultaneously: i) the V001 study - presented here - sponsored by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) in collaboration with the Division of AIDS (DAIDS)/NIAID/NIH, conducted in Kenya and Rwanda, ii) the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 204 study sponsored by DAIDS, NIAID, conducted in the US, Latin America, the Caribbean and South Africa and iii) the US Military HIV Research Program (USMHRP) sponsored RV172 study supported by DAIDS, NIAID, conducted in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania <xref rid="pone.0012873-Kibuuka1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The three trials were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and tested the same vaccines in HIV-seronegative volunteers. RV172 enrolled 324 volunteers and used the same vaccination schedules as V001. HVTN 204 enrolled 480 volunteers and evaluated the DNA prime - rAd5 boost schedule only. The objectives of the studies were to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the two vaccines in preparation for future Phase IIb and efficacy trials. After publication of the STEP study results <xref rid="pone.0012873-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012873-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> in November 2007, plans for larger trials using rAd5-vectored vaccines were suspended temporarily. The two vaccines are currently being tested in a Phase II safety and effectiveness trial in the US in HIV-uninfected, circumcised men who have sex with men and who are negative for neutralizing antibodies against Ad5 at baseline.

They were willing to undergo HIV testing and receive results. They agreed to use effective contraceptive methods for the duration of their participation if sexually active and not to become pregnant. Baseline serum neutralizing antibodies against Ad5 were measured, but not used as an eligibility criterion.

The AEs were assessed for relationship to study vaccines. There were 5 categories of relatedness: definitely, probably, possibly, probably not and not related. All safety data were reviewed quarterly by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Protocol deviations were monitored throughout the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>HIV testing</title><p>At screening, HIV testing was performed according to the respective national algorithms. Only HIV-seronegative individuals were enrolled. During the study, a protocol-specific algorithm was followed, using two different HIV-1 ELISA tests selected from Abbott Murex HIV Ag/Ab Combination Assay (Manufactured by Murex Biotech Limited, United Kingdom), Vironostika Uni-Form II Plus O (Manufactured by BioMerieux bv, Boxtel, The Netherlands) or Adaltis Detect HIV v2 (ADALTIS Inc. Montreal, Quebec Canada). If an ELISA test result was positive, a nucleic acid test (HIV RNA PCR, Roche Amplicor Standard Assay V1.5 manufactured by Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) was performed to confirm or refute incident HIV infection in the presence of vaccine-induced antibodies. During the study, clinic staff was blinded to HIV test results.

Testing of baseline sera for assessment of the impact of pre-existing Ad5 neutralizing titers was done at Crucell Holland BV (Netherlands), and pre- and post-vaccination Ad5 neutralizing titers were done at the NVITAL Laboratory (Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, heat inactivated, serially diluted sera, rAd5 luciferase and 1&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> A549 cells (human lung carcinoma) were incubated in 96-well plates. The plates were incubated for 24 hours and luciferase activity was quantitated in lysed cell supernatants in a luminometer. The 90&#x00025; inhibition serum titer was determined to be the serum dilution that can be interpolated to have 10&#x00025; of the maximum luciferase activity, as determined by the assay run without a serum sample. The cut-off for a negative Ad5 titer was &#x0003c;19 and &#x0003c;12 for the Crucell and NVITAL assays respectively. Study groups were stratified by baseline Ad5 neutralizing titer, &#x0003c;19, 19&#x02013;200 and &#x0003e;200 (measured by Crucell assay), which correspond approximately to the strata used in the STEP trial analysis <xref rid="pone.0012873-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012873-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.

U87 cells that express CD4 plus CCR5 and CXCR4 were inoculated with the virus-plasma dilutions and the virus infectivity was determined 3 days post inoculation by measuring luciferase expression in the infected cells. Neutralizing activity was reported as the percent inhibition of virus infection at 4 dilutions as compared with controls containing no test plasma. Virus pseudotyped with a murine leukemia virus (MLV) env was used as a control for non-specific effects in the assay.

Briefly, PBMC were thawed, divided into two aliquots and expanded for 7 days with bi-specific CD3/CD8 or CD3/CD4 antibodies and IL-2 to generate target CD4 and effector CD8 T cells respectively, resulting in expansion and enrichment (&#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the CD3 T cells in the culture) of the required CD4 or CD8 T cell population. Separate cultures were established containing target CD4 T cells alone infected with either vaccine-matched or mis-matched HIV-1 isolates at an MOI of 0.01, and virus-infected target cells co-cultured with autologous CD8 effector T cells from the baseline pre-vaccination blood draw or from each post vaccination time point to be assessed. To limit variation due to effects of the vaccine regimen on the CD4 target cells, a single population of target CD4 cells was generated for each individual; where available this cell population was generated from the baseline, pre-vaccination sample. Every 3&#x02013;4 days, culture supernatant was removed and replaced with fresh media, and assessed for p24 content using a commercially available ELISA (Perkin Elmer, UK). CD8 T cell-mediated inhibition was expressed as log<sub>10</sub> reduction in p24 content of day 13 CD8 and CD4 T cell co-cultures compared with CD4 T cells alone. Viruses used for assessment of inhibition were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Reference and Reagent Program (Gaithersburg, MD) and included the lab-adapted CXCR4-tropic clade B HIV-1-IIIB used as a reference strain with pre-defined criteria for positivity (&#x0003e;1.13 log<sub>10</sub> units of inhibition) <xref rid="pone.0012873-Spentzou1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Overall, there were no differences in the incidence or severity of unsolicited AEs, i.e., between rAd5 and placebo, rAd5 low and rAd5 high dosage, or rAd5 alone and rAd5 boost, whether within 28 days or at any time. Of 266 AEs occurring in vaccine recipients within 28 days after vaccination, 42 (15.8&#x00025;) were judged possibly or probably related to study vaccines. The most frequent of these were laboratory abnormalities (see next section) and influenza-like syndromes. Similarly, of 78 AEs occurring in placebo recipients within 28 days after administration, 15 (19.2&#x00025;) were judged related to study products before unblinding. These included neutropenia, leucopenia, urticarial rash and influenza-like syndrome. No epidemiological data are available on whether or not influenza virus was circulating in the community at the time these adverse events occurred. No blood samples were taken at the time of events that were compatible with adenoviral infections to look for serological evidence of infection with Ad5. Six events of urticarial rash were reported in 5 volunteers at PSF; all resolved spontaneously. Two events were moderate, one occurring 10 days after the 1<sup>st</sup> DNA and the other 71 days after the rAd5 boost. Two events were mild, one occurring 48 days after the 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA and the other 276 days after rAd5 alone. The remaining 2 events were mild and occurred in the same placebo volunteer (5 days after the 1<sup>st</sup> DNA and on the day of the 3<sup>rd</sup> DNA). All these events were described as typical urticarial rashes. Furthermore, in vaccine recipients the intervals between occurrence and the most recent vaccination did not clinically support &#x0201c;immediate hypersensitivity reaction&#x0201d; as a diagnosis. None of the rashes was accompanied by other allergic reactions, nor were any vaccinations discontinued as a result.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0012873-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0012873.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Number of Unsolicited Adverse Events within 28 Days Post Any Vaccination, by Severity and Group.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0012873-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0012873.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 1 Mild</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 2 Moderate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Grade 3 Severe</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total AEs</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">rAd5 Alone</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Low Dosage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (80.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (20.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">High Dosage</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (90.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (10.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Any Dose</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (84.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (16.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (57.1&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (42.9&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0 (0.0&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3DNA<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt111">&#x0002a;</xref>

To extend these findings, viral inhibition was assessed in seven individuals at 6 weeks and between 36&#x02013;48 weeks after a single dose of rAd5 and in a further 2 placebo individuals.

Use of a commercial kit that is least likely to register vaccine-induced antibody as positive is advisable; a purpose-built kit such as HIV-SELECTEST, if eventually approved, may facilitate diagnostic HIV testing in vaccine recipients <xref rid="pone.0012873-Khurana1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> within the study. In an observational follow up study of V001 volunteers, rapid HIV tests that incorporate only HIV-1 envelope proteins did not consistently detect vaccine-induced antibodies <xref rid="pone.0012873-Karita1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Therefore, cautious use of rapid HIV tests may be possible for long term follow up of HIV vaccine recipients, but volunteers must be warned that they may test falsely HIV positive for some time. Specialized testing services will be provided by these clinical sites until the false positive tests fade.</p><p>In Africa, the prevalence of pre-existing antibodies from natural exposure to adenovirus type 5 is at least 80&#x00025; (IAVI unpublished data) compared to 30&#x02013;60&#x00025; in the US <xref rid="pone.0012873-Sumida1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012873-Mast1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. This may be of concern: vaccine take may be compromised, leading to attenuation of immune responses to the rAd5 vector. In our study, the overall frequency of HIV-specific immune responses to the rAd5 vaccine was somewhat lower than reported in US volunteers, perhaps because of the higher Ad5 seroprevalence seen in the majority of our study participants <xref rid="pone.0012873-Catanzaro1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, but there may be other reasons responsible for the differences observed, e.g., race, geographical area, population characteristics, nutritional status. Our findings are also consistent with the findings from the Merck Phase IIb (STEP) study, where pre-existing immunity reduced the immunogenicity of the MRK rAd5 gag-pol-nef vaccine <xref rid="pone.0012873-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, it is important to note, that there are differences in properties and vaccination regimens between the VRC and the MRK vaccines and that results from the V001 and STEP study may not be comparable. With respect to the increased HIV incidence in uncircumcised male vaccinees with pre-existing immunity to Ad5 in the STEP study, a recent publication suggests that pre-existing serological immunity to Ad5 in itself does not appear to be associated with increased risk of HIV acquisition <xref rid="pone.0012873-DSouza1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Uncircumcised status in males was a stronger predictor of HIV acquisition than pre-existing immunity to Ad5.</p><p>The V001 study was completed before the results from the STEP study (HVTN 502) became available; therefore, those results did not influence the conduct of the study <xref rid="pone.0012873-Buchbinder1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012873-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, all former V001 participants were informed about the STEP study results, as were all IRBs/IECs and national regulatory agencies.</p><p>Currently, a focused Phase II study is evaluating the VRC HIV-1 DNA prime - rAd5 boost combination for its effect on early control of viral load in those study participants who become HIV-1 infected. The study is enrolling Ad5 seronegative and circumcised men who have sex with men in the USA (HVTN 505; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00865566">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00865566</ext-link>).</p><p>Recombinant adenovectors of serotypes other than type 5, such as rAd35 and rAd26, are also in early clinical trials as prophylactic vaccines for HIV and other diseases.

While basic discovery and applied research are crucial for the development of a safe and efficacious HIV vaccine, it is important to continue to perform focused human clinical trials of different vaccine strategies to develop a highly effective and safe preventive HIV vaccine <xref rid="pone.0012873-Letvin1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. New functional T cell assays that allow determination of correlates of protection and/or predict vaccine efficacy are also urgently needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0012873.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Local reactogenicity by Ad5 baseline titers.
