Surgery is the only treatment to improve disability related to pain for patient refractory to conservative treatment [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, one year after hallux valgus surgery, moderate-to-severe chronic pain persists in 21% at rest and 43% during walking [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This persistent pain after corrective surgery irrespective of visible injury is due to an abnormal responsiveness state to nociceptive stimuli, with a disproportionate pain perception to noxious stimulation magnitude. The imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory system explain the hyperexcitability in the pain networks, which has been postulated as a central process in chronic pain, and also they are part of the mechanisms that constitute central sensitization syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Central sensitization syndrome can explain the negative impact on quality of life associated with hallux valgus chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is a need therefore for the development approaches to improve the imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory in pain pathways. Thus, the improvement in the disinhibited state may prevent the persistent pain after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Among potential alternatives, emerge the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) as a targeted central technique to modulate cortical excitability in chronic pain. Robust and extensive basic science research over the past 40 years has demonstrated the effects of tDCS [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Conversely, recent human studies have confirmed that anodal stimulation increases cortical excitability while cathodal stimulation decreases it [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Importantly, consistent evidence has shown that chronic pain is associated with a disinhibited state of cortical neural circuits [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that are reverted after anodal tDCS of primary motor cortex [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, this neural disinhibited state may be related to the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is a protein known to regulate the development of plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. BDNF has important synaptic effects: increases spontaneous frequency of neuronal action potentials, potentiate inhibitory and excitatory circuits, interferes in neuromodulation of cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and GABAergic inter-neurons [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, the relationship between BDNF levels and pain can confirm the influence of this biomarker in sustained pain conditions.</p><p>Cumulative evidence suggests that tDCS is a therapeutic tool that is relatively inexpensive, non-invasive, painless, safe, and used efficiently among double-blinded studies [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Also, it has revealed effectiveness in relieving chronic pain in a meta-analysis [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] as well as acute pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the present study we hypothesized that active (a)-tDCS would improve the pain measurements (i.e. score in the Visual Analogue Pain Scale [VAS(0-10cm)], analgesic consumption and disability related to pain (DRP). Also, we hypothesized that a-tDCS effect could be related to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). In order to test our main hypothesis we compared the effect of a-tDCS with s-tDCS in the VAS at rest and during walking (primary outcome). To test the secondary hypothesis we compared their effect in the variation on Numerical Pain Scale [NPS(0&#x02013;10)] scores during the conditioned pain modulation (CPM)-task, in the analgesic consumption and in the DRP. Also, we examined the relationship between the preoperative CSF BDNF level after two sessions of tDCS on the DRP at the follow up end. We hypothesize that the a-tDCS is better than s-tDCS to improve the postoperative pain and correlated measures and that its effect on pain could be related to BDNF.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Material and method</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Design overview, setting, and participants</title><p>This double-blinded, in parallel, sham-controlled study was approved by the IRB of the Hospital de Cl&#x000ed;nicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA/UFRGS) (approval number: 14&#x02013;0643).

Upon surgical room arrival, patients underwent standard monitoring. All patients underwent spinal anesthesia at lumbar segments (L3/L4 or L4/L5) with a 25G Quincke spinal needle. Spinal anesthesia and sedation is the most common anesthesia technique for this type of surgery in the referred hospital. After CSF collection, hyperbaric bupivacaine 12,5mg and morphine 80&#x003bc;g was administered.

If the pain persisted, 3mg of intravenous morphine was administered every 3h until achieve pain relief. On the next day, 24h after surgery, patients were discharged with oral analgesic prescription: dipyrone 1000mg 6/6h if weak pain, and tramadol 50mg 6/6h if moderate to intense pain.

Time of measurement was coded to contrast mean baseline scores to a mean scores of seven-days follow-up. Separate analysis were conducted on data from treatment (a-tDCS or s-tDCS) and each outcome measurement (pain score in the VAS at rest and during walking, and analgesic doses). The models included fixed effects for treatment group. We tested the interaction between treatment group and time, and subject identification. The main effect of the predicted marginal mean differences between interventions was calculated by pairwise comparisons with an adjustment to account for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni&#x02019;s Test. Missing values were not a significant problem in the analysis of the data set, because we lost only four daily assessments in one patient (5%). To analyze the correlation between the CSF BDNF and &#x00394;-B-PCP:S score value (i.e., follow-up end minus baseline level), the Spearman&#x02019;s correlation analysis was used. The effect size of Wilcoxon Signed-rank test was assessed by z value, such as the r proposed by Cohen&#x02019;s guidelines in which a large effect is .5, a medium effect is .3, and a small effect is .1. Whereas within groups, the standardized mean difference (SMD) was computed in terms of the ratio between the mean change and the pool of baseline standard deviation (SD). The SMD was interpreted as follows: small, 0.20 to 0.4; moderate, 0.50 to 0.70 and large, 0.80 or higher. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni Test. All analyses were performed with two-tailed tests at the 5% significance level.

In addition, a-tDCS improved the corticospinal inhibitory system function and possibly its effect may influence BDNF secretion, which is associated with better recovery as assessed by DRP.</p><p>The tDCS effect on pain was demonstrated in the present study by different measures (i.e. reduction in VAS scores, lower analgesic consumption, improvement in descending pain modulatory system and DRP). It induced a large size effect on postoperative pain score in both moments, at rest and during walking. Although the exact mechanism of the tDCS effect involved in our outcomes is not clear, this investigation adds to the current literature, by providing evidence of the benefits of preoperative tDCS as an approach with potential clinical relevance for improving postoperative pain management and also by opening up the door to the investigation of other methods to enhance brain plasticity before surgery as a tool to improve post-operative outcomes.</p><p>Indeed, the effect observed in acute postoperative pain is corroborated by measurements related to neuroplasticity, which is less prone to assessment bias (i.e. CSF BDNF). Accordingly, this effect of tDCS can be extrapolated to patients with persistent preoperative pain. The clinical effect observed in this study is similar to results previously reported in several chronic pain conditions (i.e. fibromyalgia [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], neuropathic pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], etc.), as well as acute postoperative pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite the clinical efficacy of non-invasive methods of neuromodulation on pain has not been settled yet, as explored in several studies; according to a recent meta-analysis, the results of these studies are mixed and the level of evidence limited by the heterogeneity, small sample size and short follow-up [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In addition, the tDCS effect enhanced corticospinal inhibitory system as accessed by the NPS variation during the CPM-task, concurrent with a greater CSF BDNF level. The correlation between the a-tDCS effect and improvement in endogenous pain modulatory system dysfunction might provide insight to identify patients prone to develop increased postsurgical pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and perhaps with a higher propensity for chronic postoperative pain. This finding is supported by convincing evidence that chronic pain is a maladaptive state of facilitation that involves disruption of descending modulatory systems [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Although we observed a lack of a statistically significant difference in BDNF means, either in the serum or in the CSF approximately four hours after the second session of tDCS, its effect was sustained beyond real intervention periods. The absence of difference between groups in CSF BDNF may be explained by a lack of power in this secondary analysis, because in the stratified analysis, an effect according to the group was demonstrated in pain and disability at follow-up end. Although we cannot determine that there is a cause-effect relationship based on this association between BDNF and DRP, we can interpret this as a gradient relationship, where the neuroplasticity process induced by preoperative tDCS continue throughout the postoperative period.</p><p>Whereas the underlying mechanisms of tDCS on DRP has not been fully elucidated, it is plausible that the relationship between CSF BDNF levels, postoperative pain and disability could be an indirect measurement of neuroplasticity changes induced by a-tDCS. In fact, present findings suggest that the direction of the modulation on pain and BDNF persisted beyond tDCS effects. Hence, the correlation between CSF BDNF and clinical effect provide some evidence that tDCS can induce changes in the excitatory/inhibitory balance in the central nervous system, which modulates the transmission of nociceptive inputs [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>However, we need to interpret the a-tDCS effect with parsimony before claiming its effect on acute postoperative pain, because this sample comprises patients with persistent chronic pain associated with some disability, which may be more prone to its therapeutic effect. Accordingly, early evidence in animal and human studies suggest that tDCS downregulates facilitation of pain from sensitized neurons in the thalamus and brainstem nuclei structures [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and so, interrupts disinhibition processes of the motor cortex excitability [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In fact, the tDCS effect depends on neural networks&#x02019; physiological state [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, this issue needs to be better studied to define possible tDCS benefits, and if its impact can change according to chronic preoperative pain type (inflammatory, neuropathic, etc.).</p><p>One strength of this study is the internal validity of its design, in which all patients were submitted to the same type of stimulus (all patients were submitted to the same technique by the same surgeon) and evaluated by the same masked person (the anesthesiologist) and that tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation method that permits an appropriate masking, which was observed in the current study because all patients from the s-tDCS group guessed to be in the a-tDCS group. Another positive aspect is that we measured CSF BDNF, which permits an assessment to neurons and neuroglia secretion without accounting for possible interference by blood-brain barrier crossing [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, we need to address several methodological limitations related to the study design. First, BDNF polymorphisms&#x02019; potential influence was not assessed, which might have an impact in neuronal plasticity. Secondly, study results may be relevant only to the investigated population, which excludes patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Status higher than II. While homogeneous study population is methodologically advantageous, external validity issues arise. That is, hallux valgus may be associated with a particular psychological and behavioral state that is not common in other surgical populations since preoperative anxiety level is related to gender, age and surgery type [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Third, the heat pain threshold as conditioning pain stimulus to elicit a prolonged pain sensation to trigger CPM was distant from the source of ongoing pain because the persistent chronic pain activates the systems involved in pain processing. It induces a widespread central sensitization that explains the generalized hyperalgesia outside the pain source site, as observed in both animal [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and humans, in many pain conditions (i.e. whiplash, fibromyalgia, low back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis) [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In addition, the CPM-task is an element ascribed to processes within the central nervous system to assess the disruption of the balance of descending modulatory circuits to favor facilitation, which promotes and maintain the chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Fourth, another factor to account in the interpretation of our findings is electrode positioning over the left M1 and the cathode over the right supra-orbital area independently to the side of the operated foot [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In our study, the anodal electrode was applied homolateral to the surgery side in 14 patients, who were equally distributed between the groups. However, we observed a clinical effect of the intervention indubitable significant, which makes the specification of the pain side not determinant to the tDCS effect. Taken together, these findings suggest that tDCS can cause changes in functional networks across the brain both within and beyond the motor system [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, we cannot affirm if the stimulation of the contralateral hemisphere of the foot pain could change the effect size on pain. Finally, in the interpretation of these findings, we need to consider two important factors related to applying a sample size larger than the estimated for the primary outcomes&#x02019; analysis: a) this statistical approach was pre-planned to have a sufficient power to compensate for repeated observations; b) the multiple statistical tests may lead to inflation of the overall significance level [<xref rid="pone.0187013.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Hence, the secondary outcomes would need confirmation to establish their validity in future trials.</p><p>In conclusion, according to this protocol, two preoperative anodal tDCS sessions improve postoperative pain control, as demonstrated by a reduction in pain scores, in analgesic use, in the disability related to pain and an enhancement in the function of the descending pain modulatory system. Also, these findings suggest that BDNF level in the CSF after the a-tDCS predicted the DRP at the end of one week after surgery. In overall, these results suggest that a-tDCS effects may be mediated by top-down regulatory mechanisms associated with the inhibitory cortical control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187013.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Database with main outcomes.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187013.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187013.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187013.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187013.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Protocol in English.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187013.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0187013.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Protocol in Portuguese.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0187013.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0187013.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Garrow</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Silman</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Macfarlane</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name>. <article-title>The cheshire foot pain and disability survey: A population survey assessing prevalence and associations</article-title>. <source>Pain</source>. <year>2004</year>;<volume>110</volume>(<issue>1&#x02013;2</issue>):<fpage>378</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>84</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2004.04.019">10.1016/j.pain.2004.04.019</ext-link></comment>
