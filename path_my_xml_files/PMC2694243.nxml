Up to 40% of the time spent during mechanical ventilation is devoted to weaning, which is described as the process of gradual and progressive removal of ventilatory support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-cln64_5p403">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-cln64_5p403">2</xref> Formal discontinuation assessment for patients who receive mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure should be performed during spontaneous breathing rather than while the patient is still receiving substantial ventilatory support. An initial brief period of spontaneous breathing can be used to assess the advisability of continuing onto a formal Spontaneous Breathing Trial (SBT).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-cln64_5p403">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-cln64_5p403">5</xref></p><p>The most important mechanisms that lead to unsuccessful weaning include alterations in respiratory drive, impaired oxygenation, and excessive load being imposed on respiratory muscles.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-cln64_5p403">6</xref> Certain studies suggest that the application of external Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) during mechanical ventilation minimizes hyperinflation effects and reduces the work of breathing, which may be helpful during the weaning process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-cln64_5p403">7</xref></p><p>Positive Expiratory Airway Pressure (EPAP) is a technique that has been used as an effective and safe alternative to chest physiotherapy. During EPAP therapy, the patient exhales against a threshold resistor, generating preset positive expiratory pressures. The purpose of this therapy is to increase the transpulmonary pressure gradient and improve pulmonary expansion, which consequently improves oxygenation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cln64_5p403">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cln64_5p403">9</xref> EPAP can mobilize secretions, help in the management of post-operative atelectasis, and enhance the benefits of aerosol bronchodilator delivery. It is also known that EPAP and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) can reduce inspiratory load, possibly secondary to a reduction in hyperinflation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cln64_5p403">10</xref> Hyperinflation with a decrease in inspiratory capacity is a common presentation in some patients, such as those with asthma and COPD and there is some evidence advocating the use of EPAP in Intensive Care Units (ICU) to reduce air trapping in those patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-cln64_5p403">11</xref> To our knowledge, no research to date has compared the use of EPAP and T-tube devices in weaning patients.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the feasibility of EPAP as a physiotherapy tool in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation, evaluating its short term hemodynamic and respiratory effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>This study took place between January 2005 and July 2007, in two Intensive Care Units (ICU). The sample condition was composed of 40 critically ill patients who had been on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, with different causes of respiratory failure. Their clinical characteristics are displayed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln64_5p403">1</xref>.</p><p>Patients considered fit for weaning were selected by ICU physicians on the basis of the routinely applied ICU criteria, which included improvement or resolution of the cause of respiratory failure; adequate gas exchange, indicated by PaO<sub>2</sub> / FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265; 200 or PaO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265; 60 mmHg; oxygen saturation &#x02265; 90%, FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02264; 0.40, with PEEP &#x02264; 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; Glasgow Coma Score &#x02265; 13; absence of hyperthermia; acceptable hemoglobin levels; respiratory rate (RR) &#x0003c; 35 breaths/min; tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>) on non-assisted breathing &#x0003e; 5 mL/kg; maximum inspiratory pressure (PI max) &#x02264; &#x02212;20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; and hemodynamic stability without the use of vasoactive drugs (dopamine, dobutamine or norepinephrine) or sedatives. Exclusion criteria included patients with hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c; 100 mmHg) due to hypovolemia or direct cardiovascular involvement; patients using vasoactive drugs (dopamine, dobutamine or norepinephrine); patients with severe intracranial disease, with barotrauma and/or chest tubes; and those using sedatives. This study was approved by the ethics committees of both hospitals. All participating patients or their relatives signed an informed consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study was a cross-over randomized clinical trial. Each patient was observed during the use of both T-tube (control) and EPAP methods. The sequence in which the methods were implemented was determined by random selecting sealed envelopes.</p><p>All patients entering the study were ventilated either on Servo 900C or on Servo 300C (Siemens-Elema, Solna, Sweden) systems under low levels of Pressure Support (PS) &#x0003c; 12 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, before commencing the protocol. The following information on each patient&#x02019;s clinical status was registered in standard formats: age, sex, APACHE Scale II (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II), and time of mechanical ventilation.</p><p>Mechanical ventilation parameters registered prior to protocol commencement included ventilation mode, PS level, Fractional Concentration of Oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>,</sub> Tidal Volume (V<sub>T</sub>), Respiratory Rate (RR), and peak inspiratory pressure (PIP). Arterial blood gas analysis, performed prior to our protocol, was also recorded. Patients were then submitted to either T-tube or EPAP treatment in a random order.</p><p>During T-tube treatment, the patient was disconnected from mechanical ventilation, and an oxygen flow of 5 L/min was added to the endotracheal tube (ETT) or tracheostomy. Inspiratory and expiratory breathing efforts were made spontaneously by the patient. Oxygen flow added to the T-tube was kept at 5 L/min.</p><p>During EPAP, patients breathed spontaneously through the EPAP system adapted for either the ETT or tracheostomy. The EPAP system consisted of a T-tube with a unidirectional inspiratory valve and a spring-loaded expiratory valve. Pressure was maintained at 7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, the same value used during PS by other authors. Oxygen flow was 5 L/min.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-cln64_5p403">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cln64_5p403">13</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Data Collection</title><p>To monitor ventilatory mechanics, a Ventrak Model 1500 (Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA) was used. This device continuously processes readings from a flow sensor (Disposable Flow Sensor, cat. N&#x000ba; 6038, Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA) that is positioned between the end of the ETT or tracheostomy and the T-tube, both with or without EPAP. The flow sensor converts gas flow into a linear signal, identifying the differences in circuit flow and pressure. The Ventrak 1500 is attached to a portable IBM-compatible computer (Fujitsu, mod. 756 DX, Japan) via a serial port. We used software supplied by Novametrix for data storage and subsequent analysis.</p><p>Pressure on the ETT and tracheostomy was checked at the onset of Ventrak 1500 measurements in order to ensure there was no leakage of exhaled air, which may impair the recording of variables. The Ventrak 1500 is supplied with its own flow and pressure calibration software, which we used at the beginning of each monitoring period. Calibration was performed with a 100 mL Calibration Syringe. (Model No 5510, Hans Rudolph, Kansas City, Mo., USA). Variables recorded by the Ventrak system included work of breathing (WOB<sub>total</sub> = J/L) and tidal volume.</p><p>The HP Multiparametric Modular Model 66S Monitor (Hewlett-Packard USA) was used for non-invasive measurements of hemodynamic parameters as well as to monitor parameters related to gas exchange. This monitor is routinely used for inpatients in ICUs. The recorded parameters were heart rate (HR = bpm); systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressures (SAP, DAP, MAP = mmHg); and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> = %). All of these parameters were recorded by a portable computer at the times designated by our protocol.</p><p>The protocol was initiated and the patient was transferred from previous ventilation parameters in PS to the first method, as determined by randomization. Parameters were registered at Time 1: one minute after the installation of the designated weaning mode, and at Time 30: 30 minutes after the first measurement. Thirty minutes after the beginning of the first weaning method, the patient was put back on mechanical ventilation for at least 30 minutes, under the same ventilation parameters used prior to the beginning of the protocol. This period was intended to allow for respiratory rest and to restore the parameters to which the patient had been exposed before the beginning of the protocol. Thereafter, the second weaning method was tested.</p><p>As described in the literature, the criteria for interrupting our protocol included signs of respiratory distress, a drop in oxygen saturation (&#x0003c; 88%), an increase in the respiratory rate (&#x0003e; 35 bpm) and heart rate (&#x0003e; 140 bpm), SAP &#x0003e; 180 mmHg or &#x0003c; 90 mmHg, agitation, and a change or reduction in the degree of alertness.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Initially, a general analysis of the entire sample condition (n=40) was performed, as well as an analysis of each condition under the two treatment methods at the various time points. Variables were analyzed by comparing T-tube (control) and EPAP treatments at the first and thirtieth minutes.</p><p>Patients were also analyzed in subconditions to compare COPD versus non-COPD patients. Stata 8.0 was used for data storage and analysis. Results are represented in terms of means and standard deviations for continuous variables that are normally distributed, and as ratios for categorical variables. Comparisons were made using the Student t-test for paired samples. Significance was established at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The clinical characteristics of the 40 enrolled patients are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cln64_5p403">1</xref>.

No differences were observed for the other hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. These observations were made by analyzing the entire sample condition as well as the COPD and non-COPD subconditions.</p><p>It is important to note that EPAP is used by physiotherapists in certain situations but has not been evaluated to date in the context of weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Some of its beneficial effects in preventing atelectasis and in clearing secretions may be useful in this context, because it is known that supplementary EPAP is useful in mobilizing secretions and treating atelectasis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-cln64_5p403">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cln64_5p403">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-cln64_5p403">13</xref> We also know that other forms of PEP are helpful in preventing lung collapse and in removing pulmonary secretions. Recently, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) devices have been used to treat patients with sleep-related breathing disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-cln64_5p403">10</xref> CPAP has been shown to be associated with reinsufflation of collapsed lung areas and may exert a potential bronchial cleaning effect, associated with an increase in transpulmonary pressure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-cln64_5p403">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-cln64_5p403">15</xref> PEP was associated with increases in lung volume and removal of pulmonary secretions. The most likely explanation for these beneficial effects of expiratory pressure is the improvement of lung collateral ventilation and probably a reduction in air trapping. These effects in the context of positive airway pressure may be beneficial in reducing respiratory work.</p><p>However, the implementation of CPAP requires a flow system that incorporates specific flow-generating valves or supplementary hardware in the mechanical respirator itself. Our EPAP study aimed to evaluate a low-cost, spontaneous breathing system. We wished to achieve beneficial effects similar to those associated with CPAP, but we failed to meet these goals.</p><p>Comparison between T-tube and EPAP methods showed no significant differences in hemodynamic measurements and SpO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, we suggest that these approaches are not harmful, at least in terms of oxygenation. However, there was a significant increase in WOB during EPAP use.</p><p>Significant increases in WOB totals were related to increased respiratory work under the EPAP protocol, as compared to the T-tube method. There are no data in the literature regarding such a comparison. Measurement of WOB is quite complex and is better reproduced by experimental models. Nevertheless, measurements can be recorded in patients with spontaneous, assisted, or controlled breathing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln64_5p403">16</xref> WOB totals reflect the effort needed to overcome elastic forces (compliance) of the pulmonary parenchyma and of the thoracic wall, as well as viscous forces (resistance) attributed to the airways, lungs and thoracic wall tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln64_5p403">16</xref> WOB measurements reflect the strength of an individual&#x02019;s respiratory muscles in regard to the reserves needed to return to spontaneous respiration (patient work).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-cln64_5p403">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-cln64_5p403">19</xref> WOB is commonly increased in critically ill patients, but many patients have a decreased capacity for working performance. The level of expiratory pressure used during the EPAP method, even though it was low, imposed an increase in the expiratory resistance. Consequently, there was also a substantial inspiratory load, probably due to an increase in negative intrapleural pressure generated before the commencement of inspiratory flow. This may explain the increase in WOB as well as in respiratory rate in the EPAP condition. Nevertheless, a very important point in this study is the fact that a greater WOB was observed in all the subconditions studied.</p><p>Regarding limitations of this study, we wish to highlight the small number of subjects and we note the heterogeneity of diseases causing respiratory failure that can cause different responses. It is also important to point out that no invasive monitoring strategy was used because all patients had their respiratory failure adequately controlled and were not only being weaned from mechanical ventilation, but also from more aggressive monitoring systems.</p><p>Nevertheless, the greater WOB data was observed in all subconditions studied, and we think this result is of interest.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation, the use of a fixed level of positive expiratory airway pressure caused an increase in WOB without other significant cardiorespiratory changes. Therefore, we must be cautious when using EPAP as a physiotherapeutic tool during weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCE</title><ref id="b1-cln64_5p403"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Esteban</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Al&#x000ed;a</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Iba&#x000f1;ez</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Benito</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tobin</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modes of mechanical ventilation and weaning.
