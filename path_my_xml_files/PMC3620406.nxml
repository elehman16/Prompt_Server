Condylar path asymmetry is probably an adaptive mechanism caused by the predominant use of one side. <xref rid="pone.0059980-Hinton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> It is hypothesized that the increased condylar path (increasing eminence) causes difficulty and limits the motion of the condyle needed on the nonworking side, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Miyawaki1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> which helps perpetuate the choice of the habitual chewing side. Moreover, since remodeling of the TMJ occurs slowly in response to biomechanical demands, the habitual chewing side is probably an associated factor rather than a consequence; though, of course, some patients avoid using one side because of pain (2 instances in this study).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Kinesiography</title><p>The diagnostic value of the lateral anterior guidance angles should be interpreted cautiously because some lateral jaw movements are pathologically guided by the opposite side (nonworking side interference), and in any given individual, the anterior dental anatomy may be modified because of oral rehabilitation, orthodontics, or tooth loosening).</p><p>The side exhibiting the temporomandibular disorder also shows a flatter lateral anterior guidance angle. A clinical association was previously demonstrated between a flatter lateral anterior guidance angle and temporomandibular disorders in asymptomatic patients, suggesting that flat lateral anterior guidance angles do not sufficiently protect the ipsilateral TMJ. <xref rid="pone.0059980-Ferrario1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> This study provides the basis of a different explanation for this association in a different way by suggesting that the symptoms are a consequence of the biodynamics resulting from the use of one habitual chewing side. Moreover, the higher range values and SD in the present study suggest higher intra-individual variability in lateral anterior guidance angles (range 34 to 72 degrees with intra-individual differences reaching up to 25 degrees), which, in turn, suggests severe masticatory dysfunction in chronic symptomatic unilateral TMD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Pathophysiological and Etiopathogenetic Considerations</title><p>There are 2 distinct features of the habitual chewing side syndrome: increased masseter activity and reduced TMJ motion. Because the masseters are responsible for TMJ loading, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Koolstra1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> mainly on the nonworking side, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Hylander1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> the TMJ of the habitual chewing side could be overloaded when acting as the nonworking side (when the patient uses the non-habitual chewing side); moreover, the chronic reduction in condylar motion could suddenly change and perform a larger trajectory. <xref rid="pone.0059980-Miyawaki1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> These alterations in biomechanics could lead to overloading of the TMJ and consequent internal damage and/or pain.</p><p>This study does not support the dominant effect of the CNS on the choice of the habitual chewing side. <xref rid="pone.0059980-Pond1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> On the contrary, the present results seem to confirm Hildebrand&#x02019;s assertion that the subject chooses the side where most teeth are in contact during lateral gliding <xref rid="pone.0059980-Hildebrand1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and where the lateral anterior guide is more horizontal and strongly suggest the influence of peripheral factors. Although the CNS influence does exist and does not change throughout life, it is likely that the CNS possesses the organization and plasticity to &#x0201c;decide&#x0201d; to chew on the side of the mouth that is better prepared or perhaps less uncomfortable.</p><p>The flattening of the chewing side anterior guidance angle could be a consequence and/or cause of the habitual chewing side. However, condylar path remodeling can only appear after a long period of altered chewing function; thus, it can only be a consequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Limitations of this Study</title><p>Clinical tests evaluate masticatory function in an artificial environment and at only one time. The feedback from the interview aimed to minimize this problem.</p><p>This study was based on diagnostic reports of patients involved in one randomized trial designed to test the therapeutic efficacy of occlusal adjustment and does not include a healthy control group. Neither the habitual chewing side nor the lateral anterior guidance or condylar path angles allow us to discriminate &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; patients from those with temporomandibular disorders (lack of specificity/sensitivity). However, they usually allow differentiation of the symptomatic side in a given patient.</p><p>Because this study is cross-sectional, it does not permit elucidation of whether the condylar path increases in steepness on the chewing-side or whether the flattening on the nonchewing side predominates. Genetic condition, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Diatchenko1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> physiological and pathologic remodeling or degenerative changes of the bone, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> the influence of the masticatory function, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Poikela1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059980-Hinton1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and the biodynamics of one habitual chewing side all interact in an intricate but as yet unelucidated way.</p><p>The restrictive eligibility criteria were an attempt to standardize the sample to avoid potential confounders. This led to the need to screen a larger sample. and the results probably demonstrate more internal validity; however, the external validity was not affected because all inclusion and exclusion criteria were established before the outcomes assessment.</p><p>These results can only be partially extrapolated to individuals with compromised dental status.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>The diagnosis of temporomandibular disorders should probably include a determination of alternate versus one particular habitual chewing side. Healthcare givers should be aware that this condition, which could go unnoticed by the patient. This study suggests that it is not enough to maintain anatomic tooth health, but that other dynamic and functional factors should be taken into account to avoid temporomandibular disorders.</p><p>From the diagnostic point of view, independent of dental status, condylar path asymmetry suggests habitual chewing on the steeper side, although this can be altered by pathological conditions. From a therapeutic point of view, rehabilitation should, ideally, facilitate/prioritize the chewing function on the previously non- chewing and unaffected side to improve the TMJ/muscle dynamics and lead to subsequent remodeling.</p><p>
<italic>Regarding lateral anterior guidance,</italic> from the diagnostic point of view, habitual chewing function usually occurs on the more horizontal side, but the clinician should investigate whether lateral guidance angles had been recently altered. From the therapeutic point of view, we expect that reducing the steeper lateral guidance angle (sometimes increasing the flatter one) will reestablish physiologic mastication. Moreover, more factors determining the habitual chewing side exist, for example, hemispheric dominance. The therapeutic alteration of lateral guidance should be performed carefully and sequentially to fin the minimum reduction necessary to improve chewing. Also, any therapy designed to achieve physiologic mastication should be performed after physiologic jaw closure is established.</p><p>These issues deserve further investigation.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the impaired masticatory biodynamic, TMJ remodeling, and lateral anterior guidance asymmetry develop slowly, and the symptoms usually appear only after some time; therefore, the symptoms can only be a consequence rather than a cause of the peripheral factor asymmetries.</p><p>The nonspecific label of temporomandibular disorders should be re-examined, and a new etiological entity, the habitual chewing side syndrome, should be applied.</p><p>In conclusion, this study strongly suggests that unilateral chronic temporomandibular disorders affect the habitual chewing side, which is the side with a steeper condylar path and flatter lateral anterior dental guidance.</p><p>It is often stated that &#x0201c;associations never prove a causality,&#x0201d; and the true proof of any theory requires substantial experimental data. Lateral jaw motion could be experimentally altered, with the expectation of improving the chewing function and relieving the symptoms of chronic temporomandibular disorders. This will be addressed in a randomized clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Search Strategy and Selection Criteria</title><p>The Cochrane database systematic reviews and the MEDLINE database were searched by using PubMed to identify articles containing &#x0201c;temporomandibular disorders&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;temporomandibular joint disorders&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;myofascial pain&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;arthralgia&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;osteoartrosis&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;degenerative joint disease&#x0201d; &#x0201c;orofacial pain&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;disc derangement&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;condylar path&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;anterior guidance&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;preferred chewing side&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;dental occlusion&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;etiology&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;therapy&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;reviews&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;randomized clinical trial&#x0201d; up to July 2012.
