Optimal number of options in MCQ item is a matter of considerable debate among academic teachers of various educational fields. There is a scarcity of the published literature regarding the optimum number of option in each item of MCQ in the field of medical education.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Objectives:</title><p>To compare three options, four options, and five options MCQs test for the quality parameters &#x02013; reliability, validity, item analysis, distracter analysis, and time analysis.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Participants were 3<sup>rd</sup> semester M.B.B.S. students. Students were divided randomly into three groups. Each group was given one set of MCQ test out of three options, four options, and five option randomly. Following the marking of the multiple choice tests, the participants&#x02019; option selections were analyzed and comparisons were conducted of the mean marks, mean time, validity, reliability and facility value, discrimination index, point biserial value, distracter analysis of three different option formats.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>Students score more (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) and took less time (<italic>P</italic> = 0.009) for the completion of three options as compared to four options and five options groups.

There are mainly two types of evaluation methods-written assessment methods and viva voice. Written assessment methods are very popular because they are easy to conduct and administer even in large scale of examinees and with cost effectiveness.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, the important issue is element of subjective bias.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] To overcome this issue, objectivizing evaluation is emphasized for both summative and formative assessment.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Multiple choice questions (MCQs) are one of the most popular written objective assessment methods.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Properly constructed MCQs can assess higher cognitive processing of bloom's taxonomy in a large group of examinees in a short period of time. Other advantages associated with the MCQs are high reliability, more content coverage, and capacity to discriminate between high and low achievers.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Constructing good MCQ item is a complex, challenging, and time consuming process particularly for finding plausible distracters.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] MCQs offer another disadvantage that chances of guessing increases with the decrease in number of options.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] There are various types of MCQs used in the assessment in education-single best option type/multiple option, extended matching items, patient vignettes, etc., Single best response MCQs can also be divided further based on number of options such as three responses, four responses, and five responses.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Argument related to the optimal number of options in MCQs has lasted for more than 80 years.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Most of the academic teachers use four or five options in summative or formative assessment because they believe that it improves psychometric quality by limiting the effect of random guessing.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Traditional four or five options formats have one important drawback, i.e. alternative plausible distracters become difficult to construct.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Limiting the number of options enhance item writing by preparation of fewer distracters and save examinee's time to complete exam.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the case of three option MCQs, more questions can be accommodated in the test which can enhance the reliability of the test by more coverage of subject.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The optimal number of options in MCQ test is still a matter of considerable debate, but its solution particularly in medical education demands further evidence due to less research work of this field. This study was designed with the aim of comparing three option, four option, and five option MCQs test for the quality parameters &#x02013; reliability, validity, item analysis, distracter analysis, and time analysis.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study is a randomized study to compare the quality of three, four, and five option MCQ test. A written informed consent of participation and approval of Institutional Ethics Committee (Ethics/Approval/2016/1) were obtained.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was planned for the second professional M.B.B.S. students. The topic chosen for the MCQ test was autonomic nervous system (ANS). The students were informed about the date of the examination 15 days prior to the examination. The students&#x02019; participation in the study was informed and voluntary.</p><p>According to the university marks obtained in first professional examination, the students (<italic>n</italic> = 132) were divided into three groups of high, mid, and low achievers. Then by using randomization software, three groups (Groups A, B, C) were created from the equal selection from the high, mid, and low achievers groups. After randomization, scores of first professional university examination were compared between three groups by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). There was no significant difference between three groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Instrument</title><p>The subject experts (Investigator 1, 2) prepared a 30 item MCQ test initially with five options. Keeping the order of the questions same, one distracter was excluded randomly from the distracters to obtain a four option test. Similarly, using the five option questions, two distracters were excluded randomly from the distracters to obtain a three option test. Exclusion of two options in Group A would give the test with three options, exclusion of one option in group B would give the test with four options, and group C with original five options test.</p><p>The prepared sets were sent to ten subject experts for validation. Seven members responded and their suggestions were incorporated to finalize the three sets. Total time of the test was decided 45 min based on the opinion of subject expert.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Examination Administration</title><p>On the day of the examination, the three groups were seated in three different rooms and arrangements were made to ensure similar environment to each group. One student was absent from Group A. All students were informed that they could return papers if completed before time. For all students, the time taken to complete the test was noted at the time of submission of the question paper by an investigator.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The descriptive statistics was reported in the form of mean, standard deviation, confidence interval, median, frequency, and percentages.

It was observed that student scores more and took less time for completion of three options as compared to four options and five options groups. Facility index was more in three options group. There was no significant difference between three groups for the validity, reliability, and item discrimination. Nonfunctioning distracters were more in the four and five options group as compared to three option group.</p><p>For scoring pattern, there was progressive reduction of scores from three options to five options groups. Such type of scoring pattern may reflect more chances of guessing with fewer distracters, so issue of guessing may be raised if MCQs with less number of options are used.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] For blind guessing in MCQ test, quality of options would be responsible rather than number of options.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Meta-anyalysis by Rodriguez suggested that examines might be engaged in the educated guessing rather than blind guessing when elimination of least plausible distracter would be done.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Because of our study design, we eliminated distracters in random manner, so this significant difference might be due to the method of elimination of distracters and quality of distracters.</p><p>This study showed that mean time taken by examinees in three option group was less than mean time taken by examinees in four and five option groups. Hence, mean time per item decreased with decrease in number of alternatives per item. Overall saving time per item in three option groups was 6 s as compared to four option and five option groups. This time difference would allow completion of more questions in time limited three option MCQs exams which will increase the validity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Fewer options also have distinct advantages for test takers that they need less time for item development and item administration.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In a manner consistent with findings of previous research, our study showed that there was no significant difference in reliability and validity between three option, four option and five option group.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Haladyna and Downing showed that reliability increased with increased number of options, but this difference was small when more than three options were used.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] As per Rodriguez, moving from five options to four options items reduces reliability by 0.35 on average and moving from five options to three options items does not affect reliability.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Change in reliability also depends on distracter elimination method. For random distracter elimination, reliability drops 0.6 on average and no change in reliability if ineffective distracters are deleted.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Vyas and Supe concluded in literature review that reliability might be increased with three option format because total number of items increased to balance decreased number of alternatives.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Mean item facility values in all three different option groups had an acceptable level, but there was significant difference in facility index values between three option and five option groups.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Rodriguez suggested that a small increase in facility index was observed when reducing the options from four to three, while there was a large increase in the facility index (items were easier) if the options were reduced to two.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, small increase in facility value was observed when reducing from five options to four options, but there was a large increase in facility value if the options were reduced from five to three. Previous studies concluded that there was no significant difference in item facility after reduction of number of options, but reducing the number of options may increase the probability of random guessing to choose correct answer.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The reason for such findings in previous researches may be because of use of nonfunctional distracter elimination method to minimize the effects on difficulty level. Motivated examinees rarely resort to random guessing when they have sufficient time and appropriate difficulty level.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In this study, significant difference between three and five options facility values might be due to option deletion method. In this study, all the test groups had mean discrimination index values and point biserial values within acceptable range and there were no significant difference in discrimination index and point biserial values and also consistence with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>For the distracter analysis, in this study, we found that most of the questions had two functioning distracters irrespective of number of choices. Only one item from five option group had four functioning distracters. These findings are consistence with other studies despite of our method for option deletion was randomized process rather than removal of nonfunctioning distracters.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Haladyna and Downing also concluded that approximately two-thirds of all four option items had only one or two functioning distracters and none of the five option items had four functioning distracters.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It is difficult for the teachers to develop three or more equally plausible distracters, additional distracters have role of &#x0201c;fillers&#x0201d; only and also fail to discriminate between poor and good examinees.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Contrary to other studies, in this study, we removed 1 and 2 distractor randomly from five option MCQ test to prepare four option and three option MCQ test respectively. There are chances that some good distractor may have been removed during this process. Here, it should be noted that in the case of randomization both known and unknown confounders distributed equally in all groups. Hence, even if there is chance that good distractor may be removed, still random removal is better because the chance will be equally distributed in all groups and will not affect the results and conclusion of the study. Some other methods like &#x0201c;Horst statistics&#x0201d; could be used for the distractor analysis but the calculation of distractor analysis done by us is adequate as per the standard criteria and available published studies.</p><p>Result from our study highlights that comparison of score variability, time, validity, reliability, facility value, discrimination ability, and distracter performance produced only minor differences on the impact of change of number of options in MCQ test in pharmacology assessment [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Summary of quality parameters of multiple choice question test analysis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-48-571-g005"/></table-wrap><p>There are very few studies in medical specialty, especially in pharmacology subject regarding the influences of number of options on teacher generated tests, so we conducted prospective and randomized study to minimize any bias for the quality parameters of MCQs. However, the study was conducted on the second year M.B.B.S. students for ANS pharmacology assessment, and the sample size was also less, the result of this study should be interpreted cautiously for other specialty, subject, and content. We do acknowledge that more items will increase the reliability of the study. Choice of 30 items was based on real life situations where around 20&#x02013;30 MCQs are used for internal assessment. The MCQ item list was also sent to few experts and all were agreed on number of items. Reliability obtained in the study was also found to be in normal range showing the number of MCQs were adequate. We could not found any association or guideline which relates the number of items with number of students. We could have analyze each items for all parameters of item analysis but our objectives was to analysis three MCQ tests based on three, four, and five option items so for this study that comparison of whole test is more useful looking at our objectives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Assessment based on three option MCQs can be preferred over four option and five option MCQS.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vyas</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Supe</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Multiple choice questions: A literature review on the optimal number of options</article-title><source>Natl Med J India</source><year>2008</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>130</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19004145</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peile</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Knowing and knowing about</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2006</year><volume>332</volume><fpage>645</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16543331</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anshu</surname></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>AT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Assesment of knowledge: Written assesment</article-title><source>Principles of Assesment in Medical Eduction</source><year>2012</year><edition>1st ed</edition><publisher-loc>New Delhi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd</publisher-name><fpage>70</fpage><lpage>9</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siddiqui</surname><given-names>NI</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhavsar</surname><given-names>VH</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhavsar</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Bose</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Contemplation on marking scheme for Type X multiple choice questions, and an illustration of a practically applicable scheme</article-title><source>Indian J Pharmacol</source><year>2016</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>114</fpage><lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27127312</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Karelia</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name><name><surname>Pillai</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vegada</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The levels of difficulty and discrimination indices and relationship between them in four-response type multiple choice questions of pharmacology summative tests of year II MBBS students</article-title><source>IeJSME</source><year>2013</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>41</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Panczyk</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rebandel</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gotlib</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of four and five option multiple choice questions in nursing entrance tests.
