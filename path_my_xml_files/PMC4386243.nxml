Although fosfomycin was discovered more than 40&#x02005;years ago, it was not investigated in accordance with current standards and so is not used in clinical practice except in desperate situations.

Besides the efforts on infection control or facilitating and promoting new drug development,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> old drugs may offer some solutions in the short term. On one hand, some old drugs may be active against some MDR pathogens, offering an alternative for therapy in desperate situations. On the other hand, old drugs may have avoided overuse, unlike other broad-spectrum antibiotics, thus contributing to limit the selective pressure posed by the latter, which facilitates the spread of emerging resistant bacteria. However, because of real, urgent medical needs, some of these old drugs are being used without solid evidence. High-quality clinical research in the MDR field is challenging;<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> this is particularly true in the case of old drugs because studies must typically be designed and driven by academic investigators.</p><p>Extended-spectrum &#x003b2;-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and particularly <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> have been established in the last decade as a common cause of infection worldwide.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Since carbapenems are considered the drugs of choice for serious infections caused by these microorganisms, consumption of these drugs is increasing,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which is contributing to the selection and spread of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In this setting, therapeutic alternatives to carbapenems for the treatment of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae are urgently needed. Since these organisms are usually resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and quinolones, the most plausible alternatives are &#x003b2;-lactam/&#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor combinations, temocillin (available only in a few countries), aminoglycosides (the limitations of which are well known<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) and fosfomycin. Fosfomycin, an antibiotic discovered more than 40&#x02005;years ago, acts by inhibiting the formation of peptidoglycans during the bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. This antibiotic is frequently active against MDR and extremely resistant Enterobacteriaceae,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and in particular against ESBL-EC.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Fosfomycin, in its intravenous formulation (disodium fosfomycin), is approved in Spain, according to a summary of product characteristics (SCP), for clinical use in a wide variety of infections caused by susceptible organisms, including complicated urinary tract infections (UTI) and urinary sepsis (in this case it is advised to be used in combination with other active drugs).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The recommended dose is 4&#x02005;g every 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;h. It is important to consider that when this drug was developed, the requirements of the regulatory agencies were different from those currently applicable.</p><p>A systematic review on the effectiveness of fosfomycin in the treatment of infections caused by MDR Enterobacteriaceae<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> was published in 2010; the existing information on the efficacy in systemic infections caused by these microorganisms was virtually non-existent; moreover, they were limited to a few small series of cases in which they were used in combination with other active drugs. Thereafter, not much information has been generated.</p><p>The objective of this article is to describe the hypothesis, objectives, design, variables and procedures for a randomised controlled trial with fosfomycin.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The FOREST study is a phase 3, randomised, controlled, multicentric, open-label clinical trial to prove the non-inferiority of fosfomycin versus meropenem in the targeted treatment of bacteraemic UTI due to ESBL-EC, designed as a real practice trial.

Therefore, an opportunity to design and conduct a randomised clinical trial to evaluate its efficacy and safety presented itself. In this sense, it seems especially important to take into consideration the new proposed paradigms for investigating new alternatives for antibiotic resistant bacteria through randomised clinical trial designs in order to meet the real clinical needs.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The main concern with the use of fosfomycin is the possibility of resistance development during treatment. While it is true that spread of resistant strains in our environment has been linked to increased consumption of drugs for oral treatment of uncomplicated UTI,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> it seems that the resilience of fosfomycin-resistant enterobacteria has decreased, which would otherwise have permitted it to maintain its activity over time.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Even though development of resistance to fosfomycin can occur during treatment, it seems to be much less frequent in <italic>E. coli</italic> than in <italic>Klebsiella</italic> spp or <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and specifically in UTI,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> which provides an adequate background for testing the efficacy of this drug in monotherapy for bacteraemic UTI caused by ESBL-EC. Also, bacteraemic infections with a source in the urinary tract, especially in the absence of urine obstruction, is associated with lower mortality in comparison with other sources;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> finally, the development of resistance in the course of treatment is less likely in these infections.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Therefore, the investigation of fosfomycin efficacy as monotherapy in bacteraemic UTIs by <italic>E. coli</italic>, at least if there has been an adequate source control if necessary, is justified.</p><p>The few pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies performed to date with fosfomycin indicate that sufficient plasma concentrations are reached for the treatment of systemic infections due to susceptible organisms for at least 4&#x02005;h<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> following an intravenous dose of 4&#x02005;g. Since it is excreted unchanged in the urine, its levels in the urine are also suitable for diagnosing these infections.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Pharmacokinetic data available to date have been obtained following administration of single doses;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> however, we intend to determine fosfomycin plasma levels following repeated doses (48&#x02005;h after treatment).</p><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers &#x02018;complicated UTI&#x02019; to be a syndrome for new therapy evaluation.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, we believe the syndrome definition of the FDA is overly heterogeneous as it includes different clinical situations, from lower UTI in catheterised patients, to pyelonephritis with bloodstream infection in patients with structural of functional problems in the urinary tract. The research group responsible for this trial considers that using such definitions for investigating fosfomycin would not provide valuable results, particularly for patients with bacteraemia; furthermore, the results can be readily transferable to non-bacteraemic UTIs. This is why we decided to include patients with BUTI, who are readily identifiable and for whom clinical decisions are taken every day in real practice.</p><p>We decided to use meropenem as comparator because carbapenems are considered the drugs of choice for invasive infections caused by ESBL producers,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and there is extensive experience with meropenem. Ertapenem was not considered because treatment of UTIs is not an approved indication for this drug in Europe.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Switching to oral therapy was considered in our study, with the aim of reflecting clinical practice. However, decisions were not easy at this point. Fosfomycin trometamol is an oral formulation of fosfomycin reaching low plasma concentrations but very high urinary concentrations;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the results from observational studies suggest that fosfomycin trometamol is useful for the treatment of cystitis and complicated UTIs caused by ESBL-EC.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Anecdotal experience from our team with the use of fosfomycin trometamol in this situation has been positive (Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Ba&#x000f1;o J, unpublished data). Therefore, once the bacteraemia and source of infection have been controlled, which is the objective in the first phase of intravenous treatment, the use of oral fosfomycin trometamol is reasonable. For the control arm, and since there are no oral carbapenems available, we needed to look for other alternatives. Because the susceptibility of ESBL-EC to oral drug is heterogeneous, we defined a step-based strategy. Because of the extensive experience with fluoroquinolones in these infections, ciprofloxacin is our first option; however, most ESBL-EC are resistant. The second option is amoxicillin/clavulanate, which is active against a significant proportion of ESBL-EC and has been shown to be effective in observational studies.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Finally, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is also recommended for pyelonephritis caused by susceptible strains and is, therefore, included as the third option.</p><p>Regarding the safety of disodium fosfomycin, available data suggest it is a very well tolerated drug.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Because the sodium content is high (330&#x02005;mg of sodium per gram of fosfomycin), the Spanish Medicines Agency recommends to take this into account in patients requiring sodium restriction,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and therefore we excluded patients with moderate-to-severe heart insufficiency, liver cirrhosis or renal impairment receiving dialysis. Also, determination of plasma sodium and presence of oedema are incorporated in the follow-up visits. However, more data from well-designed studies are clearly needed.</p><p>This clinical trial is proposed as an initial step in the investigation of a low cost, orphan antimicrobial with a high potential as a therapeutic alternative for frequent infections caused by MDR <italic>E. coli</italic> in selected patients. The results may have a major impact in the use of antibiotics and in the development of new projects with this drug, both in monotherapy or in combination therapy.</p><sec id="s9a"><title>Trial status</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Funding for the study was approved on November 2013 and available for study expenses in January 2014.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Authorisation from the Spanish Regulatory Authority was obtained on 5 May 2014.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Approval for the EC for the 22 sites included was obtained on 27 July 2014.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A total of 15 of 22 sites have been officially opened at the time of manuscript submission.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First patient inclusion for the study occurred on 1 August 2014.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Study is approved until August 2017 (recruitment period 2&#x02005;years).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Dissemination of results directed to patients will be channelled through the Spanish Clinical Studies Registry (Agencia Espa&#x000f1;ola del Medicamento y Productos Sanitarios), of which content is adapted to patients.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold>
