This delay depends on the number, location and severity of the lesion inside the brain. In this study, Ayurvedic drugs and procedures with established beneficial role in the management of neuromuscular conditions were evaluated for effect in delayed mile stone management in Cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>Clinical trial was undertaken for total duration of six month. Patients were selected in age group 1-12 year from O.P.D. /I.P.D. Of Bal Rog department, National Institute of Ayurveda, Jaipur. Assessment was performed at the end of every month using CDC scale of milestone assessment. Total 51 patients were registered and randomly divided in three groups, A, B and C having different procedures. Six cases in each group had discontinued the trial, hence the results were analysed based on data generated from 33 patients.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>Neck holding scale in group A presented with 15.62% improvement while group B presented with 29.41% results and group C presented with 39.39% improvement. In sitting scale, group A presented with 23.81% changes while group B and group C presented with percentage improvement of 38.71% and 55.55% respectively. Standing scale presented with percentage improvement of 75%, 75% and 85.71% respectively in-group A, B &#x00026; C. The inter group comparison with ANOVA test shows in neck holding group C was found statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) over group A, while in sitting scale group B was found statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05) with group A while rest of the other comparisons were found statistically insignificant (p&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Hence it can be concluded that Ayurvedic modalities present in the group B and group C produce better results than group A.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
