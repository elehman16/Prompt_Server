Anti-asthmatic drugs that are available in the market are expensive and have adverse effects. Thus, it is wise to look for an adjunct therapy to alleviate these problems. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to see the effect of yoga on patterns of clinical features, peak expiratory flow rates and use of drugs in asthmatic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A preliminary controlled clinical trial study was conducted on 24 volunteer asthmatic patients who were getting support at the missionary of charity. They were grouped in yoga and control groups. An Indian yoga expert through a translator conducted the training on yogic practice, yogic posture, breath slowing technique and discussion at the end. Then, the yoga groups were supervised for four weeks taking yoga exercise daily for 50 minutes. Peak expiratory flow rate was taken using the mini Wright peak flow meter and vital signs were measured in both groups. Data were analyzed using web based Graph pad quick calcs statistical software.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The male to female ratio was 1:1 in both cases and control groups, 8(66.7%) were Christian and 9 (75.0%) were farmers. The yoga group showed 66.7% reduction in the use of salbutamole puff and 58.3% salbutamole tablets. There was a 10% increment in the PEFR in the yoga group while only 2% in the control group. There was statistically significant reduction in day and night asthma attacks in the yoga group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Yoga exercise among asthmatic patients resulted in a decreased number of day and night attacks and use of drugs. It also shows significant improvement in the peak expiratory flow rate. Further large scale study is recommended.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Asthma</kwd><kwd>Yoga</kwd><kwd>Expiratory flow rate</kwd><kwd>Salbutamol</kwd><kwd>Ethiopia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease that inflames and narrows the airways by spastic contraction of the smooth muscle in the bronchioles, which partially obstructs the bronchioles and causes recurring periods of wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Though the prevalence and incidence of asthma is difficult to assess with certainty because of lack of reliable population based figures which used uniform diagnostic criteria, however, it has been suggested that approximately 5% of adult and 7&#x02013;10% of children in USA and Australia have the disorder (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). According to the CDC (center for disease control) report, 10&#x02013;11 million persons had acute attacks in 1998, which results in 13.9 million out patient visits, 2 million request for urgent care, and 423,000 hospitalizations, with a total cost of &#x0003e;6 Billion USD (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In Africa, it accounts for 2&#x02013;10% of medical admissions (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In South West Ethiopia asthma accounted for 2% of out patient and 5.4% of medical admission (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Yoga, or its ancestor, first appeared some where around 5,000 years ago. Since then, it has gradually evolved in to the modern form. The word &#x0201c;Yoga&#x0201d; means union, joining or to link together as one whole according to Sansacrit language. Hath yoga is a physical method which uses the breath to link the various parts of the body and the mind and to allow them to behave as one functional unit which helps in the control of Asthma (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Different studies have revealed that yoga has significant importance in improving symptoms of asthmatics and in hypertension (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). It was found that one preliminary study of yoga therapy for asthma on 46 patients data clearly shows a significant qualitative improvement in the severity and duration of attacks; attacks per week and decrease medication use (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Significant symptomatic improvement after yoga training for 9 months in patients with chronic severe airways obstruction was observed in Australia. A decade ago both short and long-term prospective studies in India showed clearly the beneficial effects of yoga in the management of bronchial asthma (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). A study showed significant effect with in short time (13 days) of yoga practice (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Since bronchial asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality especially in resource limited areas where the long term use of multiple drugs is costly, it is wise to think alternative way to treat such an illness with better economic safety and avoid adverse effect of the drugs. The study therefore tries to look into the applicability of yoga as an alternative approach in the treatment of asthma in Ethiopia. The research so conducted aimed at determining the clinical features, peak expiratory flow rate and use of drugs for their asthma in asthmatic patients before and after the yoga practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted at the missionary of charity in Jimma town, southwest Ethiopia from March 28 to April 27, 2009 GC.

This is an evidence for the effect of yoga in helping the co-ordination of breath and movement associated with good posturing for best relaxation of breath muscles. It also helps in controlling the panic attacks which aggravate individual's further deterioration and shortness of breath by letting a way to control physical body, the mind (Psycho somatic) and the autonomic nature of breath control.</p><p>The decrease in the number of attacks (day and night) resulted in the reduction of use of asthma drugs especially salbutamol puff which is comparable to the study in India where it showed 69% decrement in the use of oral asthma medications (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) for the acute attacks. The improvement in peak expiratory flow rate in this study is also comparable to the Indian studies (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Change in respiratory rate and pulse rate is also comparable to reports from Indian studies (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This explains the effect of yoga in the relief of asthma attack and improving the quality of life. The responsiveness of air ways is noticeably increased in asthma patients so that they develop broncho-constrictions for smaller amount of physicochemical stimuli than the healthy ones. There is a complex interplay of several factors: inherent responsiveness of smooth muscles, abnormality in autonomic nervous control and breakdown in airway defenses may promote bronchial hyper reactivity. So, reducing the hyper-responsiveness of the patients will benefit them to have good outcome in the control of their asthma. The other way is the psychological effect on asthma progression, though the mechanism is complex and not well understood; still psychological factors affect about half of all patients. This was the focus pointed to be improved by the yoga exercise and shown improvement at different studies (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>The above effect could therefore be, as different authors (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) claimed that psycho-somatic imbalance is present in many, if not all, patients with asthma. Suppressed emotion, anxiety, dependence, and extreme self consciousness may all be accompanied by generalized and localized muscle tension, including that of the voluntary respiratory musculature. This increased muscle tension may be a precipitating or concomitant factor that perpetuates and aggravates the asthmatic syndrome. Yoga seems to stabilize and reduce the excitability of nervous system. Therefore it can reduce efferent vagal reactivity, which has been recognized as the mediator of the psychosomatic factor in asthma.</p><p>As life is kept as it is through the process of breathing, any of the ailments in the three processes (inhalation, retention and exhalation) will hamper the quality of life. One of the ailments especially during exhalation is bronchial asthma. This study therefore, comes to action to forward a new approach of cost effective treatment and the following conclusion is drawn.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that Yoga decreased the number of day and night asthma attacks, use of drugs especially salbutamol puff and improvement in the peak flow rate. We recommend conducting large scale study on the effect of yoga on asthma.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to the student research program (SRP) of Jimma University for supporting this research project.
