nerve stimulation simultaneously combined with local heat and cold applications enhances
pain relief compared with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation alone in patients
with knee osteoarthritis. [Subjects and Methods] Fourty-five patients with knee
osteoarthritis participated in this study. They were randomly assigned to the following
three interventions: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation simultaneously combined
with local heat using a hot pack; combined with local cold using a cold pack; and
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation alone. In each intervention, the knee pain
level during walking and standing up from a chair, as well as dynamic balance and gait
ability were evaluated immediately before and after a single intervention using the visual
analogue scale and the timed up &#x00026; go test, respectively. [Results] A significant
improvement in dynamic balance and gait ability was only observed immediately after
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation simultaneously combined with local heat
application, although the degree of pain relief during standing and walking were
comparable among the three interventions. [Conclusion] These results suggest that
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation simultaneously combined with local heat
application can immediately improve not only knee pain during standing and walking but
also dynamic balance and gait ability in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation</kwd><kwd>Thermal modality</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common type of OA and often leads to pain, swelling,
decreased joint movements, stiffness, or the formation of bone spurs<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the OA Research Society International
guidelines for the management of hip and knee OA, optimal management of OA requires a
combination of nonpharmacological and pharmacological modalities, transcutaneous electrical
nerve stimulation (TENS) and certain thermal modalities (i.e., local heat and cold
applications) may be effective for relieving symptoms of knee OA<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TENS is a method of electrical stimulation which primarily aims to provide a degree of
symptomatic pain relief by exciting sensory nerves, which stimulate either the pain-gate
mechanism and/or the opioid system<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Several systematic reviews have shown that TENS is one of the recommended treatments for
pain relief in some patients with knee OA<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, a previous study showed that there were no significant differences in performance
measures between active TENS and placebo TENS<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, a recent systematic review concluded that TENS is not
effective for knee OA pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, a
consensus regarding the effect of TENS on knee OA pain has not yet been reached.</p><p>In addition to TENS, local heat and cold applications are also used widely for patients
with knee OA. When therapeutic heat is used, the stimuli activate the spinal gating
mechanism (i.e., the gate control theory of pain)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Local heat has also been shown to
elevate the pain threshold<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, local cold is also commonly used to
decrease pain. Analgesia is a direct effect of therapeutic cold<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Possible analgesic mechanisms in local cold are partially
similar to those in local heat<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, a systematic review concluded that local heat and cold applications had no
beneficial effect on edema or pain in patient with OA<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, evidence of the effect of local heat and cold on knee
OA has not yet been established. In the meantime, a previous study reported that a combined
treatment of TENS and therapeutic cold, which consists of a TENS treatment with an ice bag
secured over the TENS electrodes, is effective in treating the pain and muscle spasms that
occur with delayed-onset muscle soreness<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The finding suggests that compared with TENS alone, TENS
simultaneously combined with the thermal modalities (at least local cold) may provide a
synergistic analgesic effect induced by activation of several pain inhibitory mechanisms.
However, little is known regarding whether TENS simultaneously combined with local heat or
cold demonstrates more effective pain relief compared with TENS alone in patients with knee
OA.</p><p>The present study thus aimed to investigate whether TENS simultaneously combined with local
heat or cold enhances pain relief compared with TENS alone in patients with knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fourty-five patients with medial component knee OA were recruited for this study.
Participants had a mean age of 66.9 &#x000b1; 8.48&#x02005;years, height of 153 &#x000b1; 7.56&#x02005;cm, weight of 63.1 &#x000b1;
13.9&#x02005;kg, and body mass index of 26.8 &#x000b1; 4.94&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Only patients who experienced
knee pain during walking and standing up from a chair at a comfortable speed were finally
selected. Exclusion criteria were as follows: history of serious peripheral circulatory
disturbance, history of heart or respiratory problems, history of central or peripheral
neurological disorders, and history of dementia. All patients provided informed consent to
participate in this study. This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and was approved by the Hirosaki Memorial Hospital Research Ethics Committee
(H27-01).</p><p>Participants were randomly divided into three groups by lottery in which the following were
performed for treatment of knee pain: (1) TENS only (control group); (2) TENS simultaneously
combined with local heat application (TENS+LH group); (3) TENS simultaneously combined with
local cold application (TENS+LC group). The characteristics of the subjects in each group is

In all three groups, TENS was performed using a portable electrical
stimulation device (ESPURGE, ITO Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Electrical stimulation was
delivered using two disposable, 50 &#x000d7; 50&#x02005;mm, self-adhesive surface electrodes (PALS; Axelgard
Manufacturing Co. Ltd., Fallbrook, USA). The electrodes were placed so as to sandwich the
medial side of the knee that hurt when walking and rising from a chair. The spinal segments
that innervate the sensation of both the periosteum and joint capsule of the medial side of
the knee are L3 or L4, according to the human sclerotome map<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the two electrodes for TENS were placed on the skin of
the thigh and lower leg matching L3 and L4 dermatome maps in order to obtain sufficient pain
relief according to the principle of spinal sensory gating. In all three groups, TENS
parameters were set as follows: monophasic square waveform, strong (muscle contraction
level) but comfortable intensity, 100 pps frequency, 200-&#x000b5;s pulse width, and 20-min
stimulation duration. In the TENS+LH group, a dry hot pack (HYDROPACMEL PX-151, OG GIKEN,
Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with a surface temperature of approximately 40&#x000b0;C was placed on the
two electrodes for the duration of the TENS session. In the TENS+LC group, a cold pack
(MOIST HEAT-PACK, Duro-Med Industries, Inc., GA, USA) with a surface temperature of
approximately 10&#x000b0;C was covered with a cotton towel and placed on the two electrodes for the
duration of the TENS session. In this study, one TENS session was conducted for each
participant and its immediate effect was examined using the evaluation indices described
below.</p><p>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the level of knee pain during both
walking (w-VAS) and standing-up from a chair (s-VAS) at a comfortable speed. The VAS was a
100-mm-long horizontal line anchored by word descriptors at each end<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The left side of the scale (0&#x02005;mm) read &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d;, and the
right side of the scale (100&#x02005;mm) read &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;. Each participant drew a
vertical mark on the line at the point that best represented their perceived pain. Both the
w-VAS and s-VAS were evaluated immediately before and after the TENS intervention in each
group. The timed up and go test (TUG) was performed to evaluate the improvement in dynamic
balance and gait ability, reflecting TENS related pain relief<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the TUG test was performed by first asking the
participant to wait, sitting with their back against a chair without armrest (seat height,
43&#x02005;cm; depth, 41&#x02005;cm; width, 42&#x02005;cm) that had been placed at the end of a marked 3-m walkway.
The participant was then told that when the instructor said &#x0201c;go,&#x0201d; they should stand up, walk
at a comfortable speed past the 3-m mark, turn around, walk back, and sit down in the chair.
The participant was allowed to use assistive and/or orthotic devices if necessary. We used a
stopwatch to measure the time required to complete TUG and recorded it in seconds.
Measurements of the time required for TUG were performed immediately before and after the
TENS intervention in each group. At each measurement time point, TUG was performed twice,
and the participant&#x02019;s higher speed was used for statistical analysis.</p><p>In statistical analyses, after changes in the raw w-VAS (<italic>&#x00394;</italic>w-VAS), s-VAS

or cold applications enhances pain relief compared with TENS alone in patients with knee OA.
Our findings indicated that in the TENS+LH, TENS+LC, and control groups, both the raw w-VAS
and s-VAS values immediately after the TENS intervention were significantly decreased
compared with those immediately before it. These results indicate that apparent relief of
knee pain during both standing and walking can be obtained not only via TENS simultaneously
combined with local heat or cold but also via TENS alone in patients with knee OA. On the
other hand, there were no significant differences in both the <italic>&#x00394;</italic>w-VAS and
<italic>&#x00394;</italic>s-VAS values among the three groups. This finding suggest that TENS
simultaneously combined with local heat or cold does not enhance relief of knee pain during
standing or walking in patients with knee OA. In other words, this type of knee pain can be
sufficiently suppressed even with TENS alone. TENS performed at a frequency of 100 pps, as
adopted in this study, can selectively activate large-diameter A&#x003b2; fibers (touch related)
without concurrently activating small-diameter A&#x003b4; and C fibers (pain related)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.
TENS-induced large-diameter afferent activity inhibits ongoing transmission of pain
information in the spinal cord (i.e., the gate control theory of pain)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. This pain relief
is achieved during stimulation, with a limited &#x0201c;carry over&#x0201d; effect<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the meantime, TENS implemented at about 100 pps releases
dynorphin, one of the endogenous opioids, with the analgesic effect mediated via kappa
opioid receptors<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, the onset of pain relief mediated via opioid receptors
may be slower than that of the pain-gate mechanism, as it takes time to increase opioid
level via TENS. However, once a sufficient level of opioids has been released, it will
continue to work strongly for at least 30&#x02013;60 minutes, even after the cessation of the
stimulation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. As with TENS, application of local heat and cold can provide pain
relief. A proposed pain-relief mechanism common to both local heat and cold includes the
gate control theory of pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Apart from
this, an increase in the current perception threshold of sensory nerve fibers associated
with local heat<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, and decreased nerve
conduction velocity associated with local cold<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, are also involved in pain relief. Among these, the latter two
pain-relief mechanisms can induce a carry-over effect lasting for several tens of
minutes<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies, however, the degree of the carry-over effect
induced by local heat and cold was not fully examined. Results of the current study may
indicate that the carry-over effect on pain relief caused by local heat and cold is weaker
than that caused by TENS. Therefore, TENS simultaneously combined with local heat or cold
does not provide a synergistic analgesic interaction compared with TENS alone.</p><p>In addition, the raw TUG value immediately after the TENS intervention was significantly
decreased compared with that immediately before it in the TENS+LH group only, although there
were no significant differences in the <italic>&#x00394;</italic>TUG values among the three groups.
Considering the abovementioned results on both the w-VAS and s-VAS, the TUG results suggest
that only the TENS simultaneously combined with local heat can improve dynamic balance and
gait ability. Nevertheless, the pain-relief effect of TENS simultaneously combined with
local heat or cold is equivalent to that of TENS alone in patients with knee OA. As an
explanation for this, the influence of &#x0201c;passive warm up&#x0201d; due to heat stimulation is
suggested. Bishop<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that
passive warm up could increase the temperature of the skeletal muscle, resulting in an
improvement in dynamic force. In the TENS+LH group, local heat around the knee joint for 20
minutes was administered using a hot pack. There is no doubt that the local heat corresponds
to passive warm up. In addition, Oosterveld and colleagues<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> pointed out that a hot pack, which is superficial heating stimuli,
can alter intra-articular temperature of the knee joint. If so, it is likely that the hot
pack used in this study could also increase the temperature of the skeletal muscles around
the knee joint, resulting in an improvement in dynamic balance and gait ability. From a
clinical standpoint, the use of TENS simultaneously combined with local heat will be
recommended when therapeutic exercises such as gait exercise are performed immediately after
pain-relief by using TENS.</p><p>The present study has some limitations. First, it suggested the possibility that the
carry-over effect on pain relief caused by local heat and cold was weaker than that caused
by TENS. Therefore, TENS simultaneously combined with local heat or cold did not provide a
synergistic analgesic interaction compared with TENS alone. However, the degree of the
carry-over effect on pain relief caused by local heat and cold has not been fully clarified,
and it is necessary to elucidate the degree of this effect to provide evidence for the
abovementioned possibility. In addition, a clinically interesting finding of our study was
that only TENS simultaneously combined with local heat was able to provide immediate
improvement in dynamic balance and gait ability in patients with knee OA. This finding may
indicate that even from a long-term perspective, TENS simultaneously combined with local
heat can provide a significant improvement in dynamic balance and gait ability compared with
TENS alone in patients with knee OA. Future studies should investigate the relationship
between TENS simultaneously combined with local heat and the long-term improvement in
dynamic balance and gait ability in patients with knee OA.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Parmet</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynm</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Glass</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>JAMA patient page.
