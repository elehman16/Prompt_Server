And almost all the relevant research suggests beginning intervention during the second trimester (from 12 weeks to 20 weeks), including dietary counseling and physical activity.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In this study we started intervention for the high-risk population earlier, during the first trimester (from 5 weeks to 12 weeks). We hypothesized that this may reduce the positive rate of GDM.</p><p>From our research, lifestyle intervention given at the first trimester had a trend of decreasing the positive rate of GDM, although there was no statistically significant difference. We suspect that lack of significance was related to the size of the sample, which was not big enough. We hypothesize that if we enlarge the sample early intervention will appear more effective.</p><p>As for another risk factor of GDM, FPG &#x02265;5.1&#x000a0;mmol/L in the first trimester, we did not put it into our questionnaire at the beginning of our study because that evaluation was not being done at that time. However, from the results of Zhu Weiwei,<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and the limited data from our study, it did play an important role in increasing the risk of GDM. Therefore we should pay more attention to these patients.</p><p>A review<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> provided a comprehensive overview of the effect of prenatal physical activity-based intervention on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and GDM prevention. Of the eight articles reviewed, only three of them showed that it may help to achieve good glycemic control and limit insulin use in GDM women. Only 16%&#x02013;55% compliance appears to be a main problem in physical activity-based intervention studies to prevent GDM. However, another article<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> about practice intervention had pointed out that physical activity during early pregnancy could help reduce the positive rate of GDM around 24% (odd ratio, OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70&#x02013;0.83). Besides, a meta-analysis<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> of dietary-based intervention and GDM prevention had reported that with good compliance, dietary intervention started during early pregnancy could significantly reduce the positive rate of GDM. Generally speaking, the moderate way of exercise and starting time of lifestyle intervention and the compliance of pregnant women all play an important role in GDM prevention.</p><p>There were several factors that could explain the results of our study. First, the goal of controlling weight gain was not thoroughly achieved, which was also mentioned by a review article.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Secondly, the size of sample was not big enough to determine significance between the two groups, which was increasing as the study went on. Thirdly, there was unknown compliance, the same problem as other studies had pointed out. We have not yet found a good way to evaluate the compliance of the pregnant women with intervention, which we need to increase our efforts. And last, due to the profound cognition of and attention to GDM in our hospital, the control group might also have received some guidance from their doctors, including eating a healthy diet and moderate exercise, which may affect the result of our study.</p><p>In conclusion, the positive rate of GDM could be reduced by certain lifestyle interventions from the beginning of pregnancy. More validated effective intervention should be explored for the high-risk pregnant women.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reece</surname><given-names>E.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Coustan</surname><given-names>D.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gabbe</surname><given-names>S.G.</given-names></name></person-group><chapter-title>Diabetes in Women</chapter-title><year>2004</year><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams &#x00026;
