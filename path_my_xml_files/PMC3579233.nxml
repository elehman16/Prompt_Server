However, in these studies, intensive insulin therapy was associated with an increased risk of hypoglycaemia and increased body weight. These studies did not include pre-adolescent children, but other studies have confirmed that poor glycaemic control in the young is not harmless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. For example, periods of hyperglycaemia and episodes of severe hypoglycaemia are associated with impaired cognitive and intellectual development in children with Type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>The challenge of achieving good glycaemic control is more difficult in children and adolescents compared with adults because of the characteristics of the paediatric population. Growth, variable exercise and eating patterns, dependence on parents and other caregivers for injections and blood tests, difficulties ensuring optimal diabetes care in schools and the physiological and psychological burdens of adolescence all constitute challenges to achieving optimal glycaemic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Consequently, an ideal insulin regimen would be flexible and predictable, whilst protecting against hypoglycaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> and inappropriate weight gain.</p><p>Insulin detemir is a long-acting, soluble acylated analogue of human insulin [Lys<sup>B29</sup> (N<sup>&#x003b5;</sup>tetradecanoyl) des (B30) human insulin] with a protracted action profile attributable to increased self-association at the injection site and buffering of insulin concentration via albumin binding in both the subcutaneous tissue and the blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. In contrast to neutral NPH human isophane insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, insulin detemir does not require re-suspension before injection.</p><p>Clinical trials in adults with Type 1 diabetes have shown that insulin detemir is associated with comparable HbA<sub>1c</sub>, less variability in fasting plasma glucose, less nocturnal hypoglycaemia and less weight gain compared with intermediate-acting NPH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. In spite of the importance of optimizing diabetes care in children, few comparative randomized clinical trials have been conducted in this age group.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to establish the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir in children aged 2&#x02013;16 years with Type 1 diabetes over 52 weeks of treatment. Results for the youngest age strata (2&#x02013;5 years) have already been published, and it was found that insulin detemir was associated with similar glycaemic control, but a greater reduction in fasting plasma glucose and a lower rate of hypoglycaemia when compared with NPH insulin in these patients after 52 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Children with Type 1 diabetes for at least 12 months (<italic>n</italic> = 347), aged 2&#x02013;16 years (~60% prepubertal and ~40% pubertal), a total daily insulin dose &#x02264; 2.0 U/kg, with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02264; 97 mmol/mol (11.0%), insulin detemir-na&#x000ef;ve, non-obese (maximum BMI &#x02264; 27 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, depending on age) were recruited from diabetes clinics at 35 sites in 11 European countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, Macedonia, Poland, Russia, Turkey and the UK). Subjects with clinically significant concomitant diseases (as judged by the investigator) were excluded. The study was approved by local ethics committees and health authorities, and carried out in accordance with Good Clinical Practice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and the Declaration of Helsinki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Written informed consent was obtained from all children (where appropriate) and their parents or legal representative before any study-related activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>In this 52-week, multinational, open-label, randomized (1:1, insulin detemir:NPH), two-armed parallel-group trial, eligible children were stratified according to age; 2&#x02013;5 years (<italic>n</italic> = 82, 23.6%) and 6&#x02013;16 years (<italic>n</italic> = 265, 76.4%). In addition, in a post-hoc statistical analysis, the 6- to 16-year-old cohort was separated into 6- to 12-year-old and 13- to 16-year-old subgroups. Insulin detemir and NPH were administered once or twice daily (according to pretrial regimen), and both treatment groups received insulin aspart as bolus insulin with main meals and larger snacks. The trial consisted of a 2-week screening period, followed by a 52-week titration and treatment period, including a total of 10 scheduled visits and eight telephone contacts during the treatment period. Eligibility for the study was confirmed at an initial screening visit. Eligible subjects were allocated to treatment with insulin detemir or NPH (1:1). Randomization was carried out using a centralized telephone and web-based randomization system, the Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS)/Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), performed within 2 weeks of the screening visit. Insulin detemir and NPH are visually distinguishable and, as the primary endpoint HbA<sub>1c</sub> is not easily biased, an open-label study design was chosen. Stringent glycaemic control in children is often avoided in real-life clinical practice because of potential hypoglycaemia and its negative effects on young patients. So that the diabetes treatment given during this trial could closely resemble a real-life environment, this study was not a treat-to-target design.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Children were treated with insulin detemir (Levemir&#x000ae;; Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark; 100 U/ml) or NPH (NPH, human isophane insulin&#x000ae;; Novo Nordisk A/S; 100 IU/ml) once or twice daily, according to pretrial insulin regimen and dose. Both groups received insulin aspart (NovoRapid&#x000ae;/NovoLog&#x000ae;; Novo Nordisk A/S; 100 U/ml) 2&#x02013;4 times daily, with main meals.</p><p>During the treatment period, the basal insulin dose was adjusted according to plasma glucose measurements with a preprandial plasma glucose goal of 4.0&#x02013;7.0 mmol/l (72&#x02013;126 mg/dl).

HbA<sub>1c</sub> was measured by ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Bio-Rad Diamat&#x02122;; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) and fasting plasma glucose values were assessed using a hexokinase method (Gluco-quant&#x000ae;; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Self-monitored plasma glucose was measured using a glucose meter (Medisense Precision Xtra&#x02122; or Optimum Plus&#x02122;; Abbott Diabetes Care, Delkenheim, Germany). Use of test strips calibrated to plasma glucose values ensured that capillary blood concentrations were displayed as plasma glucose values. All self-monitored plasma glucose values &#x0003c; 3.6 mmol/l (&#x0003c; 65 mg/dl), as well as signs and symptoms of hypoglycaemia, were recorded in the patients' diaries and included in the analyses of hypoglycaemia. All blood samples were obtained in the morning before administration of insulin.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The trial was designed to confirm efficacy of insulin detemir in children in terms of glycaemic control. This was carried out by showing that insulin detemir was non-inferior to NPH both in combination with insulin aspart with respect to HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 52 weeks of treatment using a non-inferiority criterion of 0.4% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Throughout the analyses, a significance level of 5% was used.</p><p>The power calculation was analysed on this basis: using a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test with a one-sided significance level of 2.5%, assuming <sc>sd</sc> of 1.1, a non-inferiority criterion of 0.4%, a power of 85% and an expected dropout rate of 20%, a total of 344 children were to be randomized.</p><p>The primary endpoint HbA<sub>1c</sub> at the end of the trial was tested for non-inferiority using a normal linear regression model with treatment, pubertal status at baseline, country and age stratification at randomization (only mentioned as age in the remaining part of the section) as factors, and baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> as covariate. The primary efficacy analysis was based on both the full analysis set and per protocol population. The full analysis set was defined as all randomized subjects exposed to at least one dose of trial product with a post-baseline observation, classified according to randomized treatment. The per protocol population was defined as all exposed subjects who took part in the trial without significantly violating the inclusion/exclusion criteria or other aspects of the protocol considered to potentially affect the efficacy results, classified according to actual treatment.</p><p>Fasting plasma glucose at the end of the trial was analysed using a similar model, replacing baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> with baseline fasting plasma glucose. Last observation carried forward was applied to all HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose post-randomization values. All secondary efficacy analyses were based on the full analysis set.</p><p>Within-subject variation of self-monitored plasma glucose was estimated using a variance-component model with country, treatment and age as fixed factors and subject as random effect. The test was carried out as a likelihood ratio test comparing the model with a separate residual variance component for each treatment group to a model with a common residual variance component.</p><p>Nine-point self-monitored plasma glucose profiles were analysed using a repeated-measurements model with treatment, country, pubertal status at baseline, age, time point and the treatment by time-point interaction as fixed factors. The covariance structure was modelled as unstructured for each subject and independence between subjects was assumed.</p><p>The number of hypoglycaemic episodes per subject was analysed using a negative binomial regression model with treatment and age as factors and the logarithm of subject exposure as offset, and from this model the rate ratio between the two treatment groups was estimated. This was performed for nocturnal, diurnal and 24-h hypoglycaemic episodes divided in the categories All, Severe, Moderate, Mild and Biochemical. Hypoglycaemic episodes were categorized as nocturnal if they occurred between 22.00 and 07.00 h.</p><p>The weight <sc>sd</sc> score at the end of the trial was analysed with a normal linear regression model with treatment, age and country as factors and baseline <sc>sd</sc> score as a covariate.

The slight increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> seen with insulin detemir and NPH reflects the difficulties in treating children for whom many factors, including social status, diabetes care in school or day care, highly variable lifestyle and (fear of) hypoglycaemia, influence glycaemic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Additionally, physicians and families are often reluctant to titrate insulin in children as aggressively as in adults, because of the risk of severe hypoglycaemia and its consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Another finding similar to previously reported results in both children and adults was that of a lower within-subject variation in self-monitored plasma glucose before breakfast with insulin detemir than with NPH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. The low glucose-lowering variability of an insulin is desirable, as fluctuations in glucose levels have been shown to increase the risk of retinopathy and neuropathy in patients with Type 1 diabetes and may induce higher rates of hypoglycaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p><p>Insulin detemir was associated with a significantly lower risk of 24-h and nocturnal hypoglycaemia. The lower rate of hypoglycaemia with insulin detemir may in part be attributable to its lower within-subject variability compared with NPH. These results support findings from a similar study also examining insulin detemir with insulin aspart with children with Type 1 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Severe hypoglycaemia is associated with impaired cognitive capabilities in children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> and parents' fear of hypoglycaemia episodes has been shown to impact negatively on adherence to diabetes treatment and thus glycaemic control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. Hence, attempting to minimize the occurrence of hypoglycaemia in children is essential, and it is therefore noteworthy that there were fewer severe hypoglycaemic events with insulin detemir than with NPH.</p><p>Taken together, the outcomes discussed above suggest a reduction in hypoglycaemia was achieved with insulin detemir vs. NPH without an increase in HbA<sub>1c</sub> and, reassuringly, this was seen across all age groups studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>.</p><p>Weight gain was also lower for insulin detemir when compared with NPH for all age strata. The decrease in weight <sc>sd</sc> score from baseline to end of trial in those children treated with insulin detemir indicated that their weight decreased towards that for the normal reference population. Accurate and detailed growth standards were not available for all 11 participating countries; accordingly, British standards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> were used. These standards allow very accurate calculation of <sc>sd</sc> score as data are available for monthly time intervals and gender. This was not the case for other available population data. Although the derivation of the <sc>sd</sc> score for all countries was based on British growth curves, the difference between treatment arms was not influenced by this.</p><p>The weight-sparing property of insulin detemir is a phenomenon observed in several other studies in both Type 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> and Type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>, but the reasons for this remain unclear. The importance of keeping weight gain associated with diabetes therapy low, especially in adolescents, is highlighted by the observation that young people with Type 1 diabetes often use insulin omission as a strategy to manage their weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, with a detrimental effect on glycaemic control, and complication risk.</p><p>In consequence of the findings of this trial, regulatory approval has been granted by the European Medicines Agency for use of insulin detemir within the European Union, for children aged 2&#x02013;5 years.</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirmed efficacy of insulin detemir by demonstrating non-inferiority of insulin detemir compared with NPH with respect to HbA<sub>1c</sub>, with an improved safety profile including significantly fewer hypoglycaemic episodes and less undesirable weight gain in children and adolescents aged 2&#x02013;16 years with Type 1 diabetes. An ideal insulin regimen&#x02014;particularly for children&#x02014;should be physiological, flexible and predictable, whilst protecting against hypoglycaemia and inappropriate weight gain. Although here the efficacy and tolerability of insulin detemir was compared with NPH, which is not always used as part of a basal&#x02013;bolus regimen in the young in clinical practice, the most suitable comparator, insulin glargine, has not yet been approved for use in children under the age of 6 years, and therefore the choice of NPH as a comparator does not detract from the positive outcomes seen with insulin detemir. This study therefore confirms that insulin detemir, coupled with insulin aspart in a basal&#x02013;bolus insulin regimen, has the key characteristics of an ideal insulin regimen, and that these benefits extend to the very young.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding sources</title><p>This study was supported financially by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was supported financially by Novo Nordisk A/S, Denmark, who were also responsible for the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of the study, with input from the authors.
