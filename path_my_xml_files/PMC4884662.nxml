Interventions are needed to alleviate memory difficulty in cancer survivors. We previously showed in a phase III randomized clinical trial that YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; yoga&#x02014;a program that consists of breathing exercises, postures, and meditation&#x02014;significantly improved sleep quality in cancer survivors. This study assessed the effects of YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; on memory and identified relationships between memory and sleep. <italic>Study design and methods.</italic> Survivors were randomized to standard care (SC) or SC with YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; . 328 participants who provided data on the memory difficulty item of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory are included. Sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. General linear modeling (GLM) determined the group effect of YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; on memory difficulty compared with SC. GLM also determined moderation of baseline memory difficulty on postintervention sleep and vice versa. Path modeling assessed the mediating effects of changes in memory difficulty on YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; changes in sleep and vice versa. <italic>Results.</italic> YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; significantly reduced memory difficulty at postintervention compared with SC (mean change: yoga=&#x02212;0.60; SC=&#x02212;0.16; P&#x0003c;.05). Baseline memory difficulty did not moderate the effects of postintervention sleep quality in YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; compared with SC. Baseline sleep quality did moderate the effects of postintervention memory difficulty in YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; compared with SC (P&#x0003c;.05). Changes in sleep quality was a significant mediator of reduced memory difficulty in YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; compared with SC (P&#x0003c;.05); however, changes in memory difficulty did not significantly mediate improved sleep quality in YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; compared with SC. <italic>Conclusions.</italic> In this large nationwide trial, YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; yoga significantly reduced patient-reported memory difficulty in cancer survivors.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>memory difficulty</kwd><kwd>cancer-related cognitive impairment</kwd><kwd>yoga</kwd><kwd>&#x0201c;chemobrain&#x0201d;</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>cancer survivor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735415617021"><title>Introduction</title><p>Up to 75% of cancer patients experience some form of cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) during cancer treatments (eg, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hormone therapy), and this impairment persists for months or up to 20 years in 20% to 35% of survivors.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> CRCI commonly includes impairments in memory, executive function, attention, and concentration.

Restorative yoga is characterized by a combination of meditative, breathing, and physical alignment exercises requiring the passive support of the body through the use of props and is designed to promote deep relaxation. We recently completed a phase III randomized clinical trial (RCT) through the University of Rochester Cancer Center (URCC) and Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) to investigate the effects of a combined Hatha and Restorative yoga program, Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; ), on sleep quality and efficiency in cancer survivors posttreatment. We previously reported greater improvements in global and subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, wake after sleep onset, sleep efficiency, and medication use at postintervention compared with controls. Additionally, improvements in sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction were specific to controls, and medication use was reduced by 21% in yoga participants compared with 5% in controls. Therefore, we concluded that the improvements in global sleep quality in yoga participants may be related to reductions in daytime dysfunction in terms of less napping, less fatigue, and better sleep continuity, whereas any improvement in controls may be related to continued sleep medication.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Here, we report a secondary data analysis investigating the effects of YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; on memory difficulty.

Postures include seated, standing, transitional, and supine poses, with an emphasis on restorative poses, and the program was taught with modifications to address multiple levels of experience. The breathing exercises focused on regulation of breathing, and the awareness component included meditation instruction, visualization, and affirmation. The intervention was delivered in an instructor-taught group format over 8 sessions. Each session was 75 minutes, and sessions occurred twice a week during the late afternoon or evening at community-based sites, including yoga studios, community centers, and community oncology practices. Sessions were standardized across CCOP sites and included physical alignment postures, breathing, and mindfulness exercises. Instructors were Registered Yoga Alliance Instructors and each had to complete a standardized training session and was provided with a detailed YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; instructor manual and DVD. In addition, a coordinator at each CCOP completes the standardized training session and randomly observes YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; sessions to ensure proper content is taught.</p><p>Adherence to the intervention was good, with yoga participants attending an average of 6.5 of the 8 sessions.

Whereas 85% of survivors reported some degree of memory difficulty, the most common rating was mild (51%), which is consistent with descriptions of complaints in survivors as often subtle. Baseline memory scores were significant independent predictors of postintervention memory difficulty. No other predictors that we assessed were significant; however, previous chemotherapy exposure showed a trend that is consistent with this type of treatment, as often reported as the most strongly associated with cognitive complaints. When we assessed moderation of memory on sleep, we did not find a significant relationship; however, baseline sleep did moderate the effects of reduced memory difficulty postintervention. Additionally, memory mediation did not significantly play a role in improving sleep; however, mediation by sleep did play a significant role in improving memory.</p><p>Overall, these results support the hypothesis that yoga has a positive effect on memory function in cancer survivors and reduces memory difficulty. Limited research has been conducted in this area. Sprod et al<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> demonstrated that older cancer survivors who reported exercise during treatment had improved perceived memory function during and after treatment compared with survivors who did not exercise. One recent, noncontrolled feasibility study showed a positive effect of Tai Chi Chuan on multiple domains of cognitive function in cancer survivors, including memory, concentration, and attention.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> No large randomized controlled clinical trials assessing physical activity interventions for CRCI have been conducted, making the results of the current study novel.</p><p>The current study has a number of strengths. First, it consists of a large nationwide sample of cancer survivors, making the results generalizable to the US population. Moreover, assessment of the impact of yoga on memory was conducted using a rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trial design. Finally, perceived memory function was assessed, making the results relevant to the patients&#x02019; experience. Although these results need to be confirmed in future research, this is the first large study that suggests that yoga can improve perceived memory function in cancer survivors. This finding is supported by animal literature showing that physical activity can increase neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the brain&#x02014;a region that is responsible for memory&#x02014;and that chemotherapy damages by reducing neurogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that various forms of exercise in rodents improve memory, and most recently, exercise in mice was shown to improve chemotherapy-induced spatial memory impairments in animal models.<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p>The concept that improved sleep can help improve memory function is important, particularly if interventions that target sleep also improve memory and other cognitive functions. Previous studies have shown that improvements in cognitive function also improve other symptoms. For example, cognitive training of memory in cancer survivors also improved depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> Another cognitive training study showed improvements in anxiety and depression following similar cognitive training exercises.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Our hypotheses need further testing. In an ongoing phase III trial, we are currently testing mediation hypotheses to further investigate the impact of yoga on sleep and memory difficulties and other co-occurring symptoms. In that study, we will investigate mediation and moderation effects of yoga on global sleep quality as well as sleep duration, sleep latency, sleep disturbance, daytime dysfunction, medication use, and subjective sleep quality. Improving memory and sleep could enhance overall quality of life and could have broad implications for improving activities of daily living, work-life balance, and social engagements.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-1534735415617021" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup></p><p>Although these results are encouraging, the study is not without limitations. First, while the results are based on a large nationwide RCT, the trial was not designed specifically to assess changes in cognition. Therefore, the assessment of cognition was limited to memory impairment and used a single-item self-report measure from the MDASI. A more sophisticated cognitive battery, with both objective and subjective assessments, is needed in future studies to determine if the impact of yoga is restricted to memory improvements or whether other domains of cognition may also be improved. Objective assessments of memory will also help support our findings. In the current analysis, we did not have data on the time since the last treatment, which is an important covariate to consider in future studies. Additionally, future studies need to incorporate more detailed treatment agent, dosage, frequency, and duration information to tease apart the impact of therapy on cognitive function and whether or not interventions for memory difficulty may work better in certain treatment settings. Our population included primarily breast cancer survivors, and the impact of yoga on memory, sleep, and other symptoms needs to be more thoroughly examined in those with other diagnoses. Finally, the mediation analyses need to be interpreted with caution because such analyses should use intermediate time points. In our analysis, we conducted the path analyses with change scores, and we lack the requisite temporal order of mediation, where the mediator is measured at a time between the intervention and postintervention assessment. However, overall, our results do indicate that for patients with sleep problems, yoga improved memory, at least partially via improved sleep.</p><p>The effects of YOCAS&#x000a9;&#x000ae; Yoga compared with SC on reducing memory difficulty were significant, positive, and conducted with a rigorous study design. More elaborate RCTs designed to specifically assess cognitive function outcomes in cancer survivors are needed to confirm these results. Moreover, further research is needed to better understand which components of yoga (ie, physical movements, meditation, and relaxation) are most important for improving memory function in cancer survivors.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: K07CA168886, UCA037420, UCA037420 Supplement, and UG1CA189961.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1534735415617021"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
