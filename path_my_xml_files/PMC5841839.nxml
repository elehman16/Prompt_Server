<bold>Background:</bold> Diarrhoea and acute lower respiratory infections are leading causes of childhood morbidity and mortality, which can be prevented by simple low-cost interventions. Integrated strategies can provide additional benefits by addressing multiple health burdens simultaneously.</p><p>
<bold>Methods:</bold> We conducted a community-randomized&#x02013;controlled trial in 51 rural communities in Peru to evaluate whether an environmental home-based intervention package, consisting of improved solid-fuel stoves, kitchen sinks, solar disinfection of drinking water and hygiene promotion, reduces lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal disease and improves growth in children younger than 36 months. The attention control group received an early child stimulation programme.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> We recorded 24&#x000a0;647 child-days of observation from 250 households in the intervention and 253 in the attention control group during 12-month follow-up. Mean diarrhoea incidence was 2.8 episodes per child-year in the intervention compared with 3.1 episodes in the control arm. This corresponds to a relative rate of 0.78 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.58&#x02013;1.05] for diarrhoea incidence and an odds ratio of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.47&#x02013;1.06) for diarrhoea prevalence. No effects on acute lower respiratory infections or children&#x02019;s growth rates were observed.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> Combined home-based environmental interventions slightly reduced childhood diarrhoea, but the confidence interval included unity. Effects on growth and respiratory outcomes were not observed, despite high user compliance of the interventions. The absent effect on respiratory health might be due to insufficient household air quality improvements of the improved stoves and additional time needed to achieve attitudinal and behaviour change when providing composite interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Community-randomised trial</kwd><kwd>integrated interventions</kwd><kwd>household air pollution</kwd><kwd>household water treatment</kwd><kwd>improved cook stove</kwd><kwd>kitchen hygiene</kwd><kwd>hand-washing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">UBS Optimus Foundation, Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft, Basel, Stiftung Emilia-Guggenheim-Schnurr, Basel</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">M&#x000e4;usezahl, Lanata</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group award-type="grant"><funding-source><named-content content-type="funder-name">M&#x000e4;usezahl, Lanata</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>

It was registered at a national (INS) and an international trial registry (ISRCTN: &#x02018;ISRCTN28191222&#x02019;). Community leaders and local authorities signed an agreement with the IIN and Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute (Swiss TPH) after screening for eligibility and before randomization. The principal caregiver of each study child gave written informed consent before study implementation. Sick study children were evaluated by the study physician or referred for treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Site and population</title><p>The study was conducted from September 2008 to January 2010 in the San Marcos province, located 60 kilometres south-east of Cajamarca city, in northern Peru. We chose this area because of its well-separated and accessible communities and because, to our knowledge, no major health promotion programmes were currently implemented. The province is located between 2200 and 3900 metres above sea level. Most of the population are small-scale farmers. At the time of the study, most people were using an unventilated traditional stove or open fire for cooking and heating within their homes. About 80% of the population had a piped-water system with a faucet available in the household&#x02019;s yard.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>We implemented a community-randomized&#x02013;controlled field trial to evaluate the IHIP interventions on reducing acute diarrhoeal illness and ARI, and improving child growth over a 12-month surveillance period. Our primary sampling units were the communities. Sample size was calculated for cluster-randomized trials using the approach of Hayes and Bennett.<xref rid="dyw242-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> The trial was powered to detect an incidence rate (IR) reduction of 22% with 80% power at a 5% level of significance, assuming five episodes of ARI and five episodes of diarrhoea per child-year of observation and a coefficient of variation of k&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.2. Fifty-six communities were identified by a house-to-house screening. We included only 51 communities, as five communities were very small, with fewer than four children. Three of the five communities were joined to adjacent communities and the other two were excluded because of remoteness. Within the included communities, one child aged 6&#x02013;35 months was randomly selected from each eligible household willing to participate. Eligibility criteria included use of solid fuels, no public sewage connection and no intention to move during the study period. Randomization was performed at the village level. The 51 communities were randomized using covariate-based constrained randomization&#x02014;a procedure that can balance individual- and group-level covariates in the experimental units, here the communities, in a group-randomized study.<xref rid="dyw242-B14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyw242-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Randomization, enrolment and baseline data collection took place between September 2008 and January 2009 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyw242-F1">Figure 1</xref>). Blinding of the interventions was not possible. To counteract potential unbalance of dropouts between study arms and non-blinding bias, an early child stimulation intervention, which seemed unlikely to have an impact on child diarrhoea and respiratory infections, was implemented as attention control. More details on study design can be found elsewhere.<xref rid="dyw242-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><fig id="dyw242-F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Flow of participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dyw242f1"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Development of interventions</title><p>The components of the IHIP interventions were developed with a participatory approach during a six-month pilot phase in neighbouring communities not enrolled in the trial.<xref rid="dyw242-B15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyw242-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> We identified and convened main stakeholders and beneficiaries to develop an intervention package that generates healthy household environments, addresses local beliefs and cultural views, and has potentially synergistic effects on household health and livelihoods.

With the community members&#x02019; involvement, an improved solid-fuel stove called the &#x02018;OPTIMA-improved stove&#x02019; and a kitchen sink providing piped water within the household&#x02019;s kitchen were developed.<xref rid="dyw242-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The stoves were built with local materials to enable self-maintenance and repair.

The field research team collected morbidity data and was trained in interviewing techniques, data recording, identification of signs and symptoms of child diarrhoea, and ALRI severity symptoms, as well as measuring respiratory rates. Additionally, the team collected spot-check observations using a checklist on household hygiene and environmental health conditions (e.g. presence of SODIS bottles on the roof or kitchen). The health promoters locally hired elementary school teachers, implemented and promoted the interventions and collected monthly compliance data. The anthropometric team was trained in measuring child weight and height in a standardized way. The environmental team collected environmental samples to test for faecal contamination of mothers&#x02019; hands, drinking water and kitchen cloths.</p></sec><sec><title>Implementation</title><p>The IHIP interventions (improved solid-fuel stoves and kitchen sinks) were installed between October 2008 and January 2009. Households without connection to piped water were connected during sink installation. SODIS and personal, child and kitchen hygiene were reinforced monthly during 12-month follow-up. Each child in the control group received six sets of toys approximately every two months, depending on the child&#x02019;s progress and age.<xref rid="dyw242-B16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyw242-B17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The promotion of the interventions was done with the same intensity in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>Follow-up took place from February 2009 to January 2010. Field workers visited each household weekly and collected morbidity data from the mother/caretaker on daily signs and symptoms of child diarrhoea and respiratory illness. If diarrhoea was observed, additional information on severity was collected (sunken eyes, dry mouth, tongue and mucous membranes and thirstiness). If a child had cough or fever on the day of the household visit or the previous day, we looked for danger signs<xref rid="dyw242-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> to assess the severity of the respiratory illness by recording noisy and/or fast breathing, rhonchus/wheezing, lower chest in-draw, malaise and lack of appetite. If any of the severity signs were present, the child was examined and treated by our study physician on the same day or referred to local healthcare services.

We measured exposure data only once and seven months after stove implementation.<xref rid="dyw242-B18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyw242-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="dyw242-B47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> The best-functioning stoves achieved a 45% and 27% mean reduction of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and CO, respectively, in mothers&#x02019; personal exposure.<xref rid="dyw242-B19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> It is possible that, after the introduction of the stoves, study participants spent more time in the then less-smoky kitchens, which led to increased total exposure to air pollutants. Project-initiated repairs were carried out nine months after the stoves had been installed. At this point, 35% of our stoves needed minor repairs, e.g. re-plastering, and 1% needed major repairs, e.g. a broken chimney valve. Two years after the end of the study, an evaluation showed that around 85% of the Optima-improved cooking stoves were still in use (defined as at least five times a week, twice a day).</p><p>A further limitation was the monitoring frequency for ARI and ALRI. Respiratory rate measurements were only available for about two-thirds of all reported ARI episodes. In addition, in 40% of the remaining ARI episodes, the child had already attended a health centre and/or received treatment at the time of the household visit. Therefore, the true ALRI incidence is likely higher, but this should be balanced between intervention and control communities. Hence, the observed 25 and 10 ALRI episodes in the intervention and control arm should be interpreted with caution considering also that, of the 25 observed episodes in the intervention arm, almost one-third were recorded in a single very sick child. Additionally, a more objective way of defining ALRI, e.g. through chest x-rays, could have produced more correct estimates<xref rid="dyw242-B24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> but would have added substantially to costs and training requirements, which was not feasible for this study.</p><p>We could not blind the application of our interventions. Open trial designs can, however, benefit from and harness the community dynamics generating interest and motivation for a demand-driven replication. Furthermore, we believe that the selection of a highly valued intervention in the control arm (early child stimulation) reduced non-blinding/reporting bias and drop-out rates. Additionally, we used standardized data-collection tools and independent morbidity data-collection teams to minimize social desirability bias.</p><p>In conclusion, our intervention is one of the first studies to focus on addressing several household burdens simultaneously. Improved drinking-water quality and quantity, personal and kitchen hygiene and indoor air quality provide a healthy household environment that can translate into many aspects of life, including better health and poverty reduction. Even though we found no strong evidence for health impacts, the IHIP could be successfully delivered and was highly accepted.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the UBS Optimus Foundation, Freiwillige Akademische Gesellschaft, Basel, Stiftung Emilia-Guggenheim-Schnurr, Basel.
