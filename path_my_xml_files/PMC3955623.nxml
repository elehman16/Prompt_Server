This prospective longitudinal study of 72 women used a randomized controlled experimental design with two groups conducted over 12 weeks. The intervention was a CD with 4 professionally recorded tracts designed and sequenced to influence study variables. Participants in both GI and usual care (UC) completed measures and donated 5&#x02009;cc of blood at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks. Participants also completed a daily stress scale. A mixed-effects linear model tested for differences between groups for self-reported measures of stress, anxiety, and fatigue as well as corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH), a biologic marker of stress. Significant differences in perceived stress daily scores and at week 8 but not week 12 were found in the GI group compared to UC group. The GI group reported significantly less fatigue and anxiety than the UC group at week 8 but not week 12. There were no significant differences in CRH levels between groups.

Introduction</title><p>Maternal stress has been associated with pregnancy complications such as hypertension and preeclampsia as well as negative perinatal outcomes such as intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR), low birth weight (LBW) infants, preterm birth (PTB), and neuropsychological developmental delays of affected offspring [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Perceived stress is often associated with symptoms such as anxiety and fatigue [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and these related symptoms may increase the deleterious effect of stress on health and birth outcomes. For example, state and trait anxiety during pregnancy has been associated with stress and has been found to significantly predict gestational age and preterm birth [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Likewise, maternal fatigue has been found to be positively associated with stress [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and anxiety [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and is recognized as a symptom of these mental states [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There is an association between fatigue and antenatal morbidity [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and adverse perinatal outcomes such as PTB [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes in nulliparous women [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Of equal importance is the major disparity in rates of stress and pregnancy complications between African American women and Caucasian or Hispanic women [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Research has demonstrated that AA women experience significantly more prenatal stress [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and it has been proposed that they have increased susceptibility to the negative effects of psychosocial stressors when compared to Hispanic or Caucasian women [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. There is also the possibility of health disparities related to fatigue. For example, of women with preterm labor, African Americans had higher level of fatigue than Caucasians [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite the high prevalence and potential negative perinatal consequences, very few studies have focused on interventions to decrease prenatal stress and the related symptoms of anxiety and fatigue in pregnant African American women.</p><p>The pathway from maternal stress to negative health outcomes is a multifaceted and complex process which represents the connection between the mind and the body [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The perception of stress in the mind triggers biological changes in the body leading to physiologic reactions that can have detrimental effects on health outcomes [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This connection is mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway with corticotrophin releasing hormone (CRH) playing a major role in the physiologic response to stress [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated that stress and anxiety during pregnancy are associated with elevated levels of CRH [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Evidence from studies suggest that women with significantly elevated levels and/or significantly accelerated rate of CRH increase over the course of pregnancy have an increased risk for pregnancy complications such as preterm birth [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], intrauterine growth restriction [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and reduced birth weight [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In addition, in the general population, CRH and neuroendocrine hormones mediated by CRH have been associated with fatigue [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and anxiety [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Given the mind-body connection between maternal stress and adverse health events, it is possible that a complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) intervention may be effective in reducing self-reported and biologic measures of stress during pregnancy [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, many of the CAM interventions are presented in groups or one-on-one, which requires participant's scheduled time, child care, transportation, health-care provider time, and cost&#x02014;all of which present potential barriers to participation and implementation into clinical practice. Guided imagery (GI) is a powerful, mind-body CAM therapy that is an economic, simple, and easy to use intervention that can be easily delivered in a self-help format thus eliminating potential barriers inherent in other CAM interventions [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Given these potential benefits and today's demands on the health care system, the authors selected GI for further investigation in this study.</p><p>GI is a psychophysiological dynamic modality in which a person imagines and experiences an internal reality in the absence of external stimuli [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The mechanism of action may be related to the power of GI to send messages and information from the brain to the central nervous system and thus connect with physiological processes [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. GI represents a basic principle of psychophysiology in that every thought has a physiologic response. When a mental image is experienced, there is an associated emotion connecting the feeling state with the mind and body leading to a physiologic change [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Thus, a GI intervention may decrease perceived stress and associated symptoms which, in turn, may provide a positive influence on neuroendocrine factors, such as CRH.</p><p>The use of GI has been reported to reduce self-reported measures of stress, anxiety, and fatigue as well as neuroendocrine measures of stress such as cortisol among nonpregnant participants [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, there is limited research investigating this intervention on self-reported and biologic measures of stress and associated symptoms among pregnant women in a prenatal care setting. A longitudinal pilot study examining a GI intervention in pregnant African American women reported a significant decrease in state anxiety and weekly numeric rating scale of stress (NRSS) scores over time compared to the usual care (UC) group but not perceived stress scores or level of CRH over time [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Hospitalized pregnant women with preterm labor were found to benefit from a GI intervention. In Taiwan, this population was found to have lower state anxiety scores but not perceived stress scores compared to control group immediately after 3 sessions and over time until delivery [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Women hospitalized with preterm labor in the US reported significantly lower mean perceived stress levels after listening to a GI intervention compared to preintervention stress levels [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, background music was added to the GI, thus making it difficult to isolate the effect of imagery.</p><p>Not all studies have reported a reduction in anxiety. For example, the use of imagery during prenatal classes reported no significant differences in anxiety state [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Likewise, a brief GI intervention did not significantly reduce state anxiety in healthy pregnant women [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because both of these studies investigated a single 10-minute session of GI, the short exposure to the intervention rather than the intervention itself may have contributed to the lack of findings.</p><p>Because imagery links perceptions, emotions, and physiological responses, the selection of appropriate images is of utmost importance [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Previous research has investigated imagery exercises in pregnant women for general stress management [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or childbirth [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] but no studies reported including imagery exercises for pregnancy-specific stress, which is inherent during pregnancy [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The effect of the addition of healthy pregnancy-related images to the previously studied general stress management images on maternal stress and associated symptoms is unknown and warrants further investigation.</p><p>While the results of these studies are promising, variations in research design, dosage of intervention, and selected study variables limit the applicability of these findings. Additional research addressing these limitations is warranted. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a 12-week professionally developed GI intervention on self-reported and biologic measures of perceived stress and the associated symptoms of anxiety and fatigue in pregnant African American women.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>This study used a repeated measures, two-group randomized experimental design to examine the effect of GI on perceived stress, and the associated symptoms of anxiety and fatigue, as well as CRH, a neuroendocrine stress measure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited from 2 academic obstetric clinics affiliated with the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System and the Riverside Regional Health System. Inclusion criteria included being (1) pregnant African American women between 14 and 17 weeks gestation, (2) &#x02265;18 years of age or older, (3) able to read, write, and understand English, and (4) able to verbalize a source of social support. Exclusion criteria included (1) multiple pregnancy, (2) cervical cerclage, (3) current use of oral corticosteroids, (4) uterine or cervical abnormality, (5) dissociative disorders, borderline personalities, and psychotic pathology, (6) medical and/or pregnancy complications, and (7) current use of GI techniques. Criteria were selected to reduce sources of variability between and within subjects to include (1) variables that could potentially influence CRH levels such as ethnicity, development and growth of the placenta, gestational age of the pregnancy, use of glucocorticoids, and medical and/or pregnancy complications potentially associated with infection/inflammation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and (2) variables that could potentially influence participant safety or treatment effects such as use of unsupervised guided imagery in individuals with disruption in the functions of consciousness, memory, or identity as well as social support, which has been reported to be a buffer of the stress response [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Criteria were initially measured when participants completed the Demographic and Health History form and the Health History component was reviewed for changes at every study visit.</p><p>A total of 148 potential participants were assessed for eligibility. Of these 148 women, 74 did not meet inclusion criteria, 2 were eligible but declined to participate, and 72 pregnant African American women between 14 and 17 weeks gestation were enrolled after completing the informed consent process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Intervention</title><p>The 12-week intervention consisted of a CD with 4 GI tracts, each 20 minutes in length. The script for each CD was developed and professionally recorded by the author certified in GI. Key components included relaxation, focused breathing, and a variety of multisensory images to promote reduction of stress and anxiety as well as to restore levels of energy. The intervention contained multiple styles of imagery to include (1) feeling state imagery designed to shift the participant's mood to one of peace and calm, (2) end state imagery suggesting that participants see themselves the way they wish to be, and (3) energetic imagery focusing on restoring normal levels of energy [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>The content and order of the CDs were sequenced to focus on the desired outcomes and were based on examples in the professional literature and the Academy for Guided Imagery [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. CD tract number 1 was designed to promote familiarity with relaxation and imagery. Instructions were provided for CD use, focused breathing, and relaxation techniques. Participants were encouraged to imagine themselves in a peaceful, serene, safe, and secure personal place to rest and let go of their anxiety, worries, or concerns and emerge from their imagery with a sense of feeling refreshed and recharged. This feeling state image of a pleasant safe scene focused on feelings of peace, calm, and relaxation. CD tract number 2 included a shortened version of the content in CD tract number 1 and added feeling, end-state, and energetic images associated with decreases in stress and stress-related symptoms, decreases in physiological and psychological arousal, and energy restoration [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. For example, participants were encouraged to &#x0201c;imagine a large ball of energy&#x0201d; and visualize the image's form, color, flow, and effects on how they are feeling. Language cues included suggestions for the desired physiological or psychological change (e.g., <italic>&#x0201c;I am calm, I am relaxed, I am energized, I am invigorated with a powerful sense of well-being</italic>&#x0201d;). It is these images that potentially mediate the communication between perception, emotion, and physiologic change and may affect a physiologic process such as reducing the stress reaction and the related stress symptoms [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CD tract number 3 (week 3) included a shortened version of focused breathing and relaxation along with the addition of feeling state and energetic images associated with decreases in stress, anxiety, and fatigue as well as end-state imagery, whereby the participant was invited to imagine rehearsing and successfully meeting the stressful challenges in their daily life. The inclusion of such imagery was important as it can be useful to bring things into real life and assist the participants in meeting those challenges [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This tract also contained cues such as &#x0201c;<italic>letting the feelings of calmness and relaxation carry over with you into a fully alert state</italic>&#x0201d; to promote sustained effects of the GI. CD tract number 4 (week 4) included a shortened version of focused breathing and relaxation along with feeling, end-state, and energetic images associated with decrease in stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Because pregnancy-related worries have been identified as major stressors and sources of anxiety in African American women [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], feeling and end-state images related to a healthy pregnancy and baby such as &#x0201c;<italic>Imagine your baby tucked away safe inside your body&#x02014;safe and cozy&#x02014;cushioned and protected</italic>&#x0201d; combined with positive affirmations such as &#x0201c;<italic>More and more I can let go of worrying about things and focus on my own inner peace and stillness</italic>&#x0201d; were also included to target potential pregnancy-specific stressors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. GI Group</title><p>The R-GI group continued usual care with the addition of the GI intervention. Participants were instructed to listen to the CD once a day for 12 weeks in a recommended order for weeks 1&#x02013;4 and used in any order for weeks 5&#x02013;12. This plan was based on a study reporting that some women got tired of hearing the same script after three weeks [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] as well as feedback from a previous study [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The design called for daily practice for twelve weeks because (1) daily practice is an important component of skill acquisition [<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], (2) it has been demonstrated that stress-related symptoms as well as the individual's appraisal of stress improves within 8&#x02013;12 weeks of relaxation-based programs [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and (3) GI intervention must be introduced early enough and last long enough to decrease stress and potentially impact levels of CRH.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. UC Group</title><p>Participants in the UC group continued their usual obstetric care.

Following the intent to treat principle, all participants with postbaseline data were used in the mixed effects linear model. The fixed effects included visit number (baseline (visit 1), visit 2, and visit 3), intervention group (GI and UC), and visit by intervention group interaction. Participant was modeled as a random effect. CRH was positively skewed; thus, a log-transformation served the dual role of normalizing the data and stabilizing the variance.</p><p>NRSS scores were obtained daily from each participant. In the GI group, two NRSS sores were obtained (prior to and after listening to the GI intervention) and one NRSS score in UC group was obtained. These daily data were averaged to obtain weekly means (weeks 1&#x02013;12). Thus, each subject had as many as 12 weekly averages. Two different questions are posed regarding these data. The first is &#x0201c;do the weekly means differ from before to after intervention for the subjects within the GI group?&#x0201d; The mixed-effects linear model used to test this question contained fixed effects for week (1&#x02013;12), time (pre- or post-CD), and a week by time interaction and a random effect for participant. In order to model the doubly repeated measures (pre/post and across 12 weeks), an unstructured variance structure was used to model the repeated time (pre/post) and a compound symmetric variance structure was used to model the repeated week (1&#x02013;12). The second question asked of the daily data was &#x0201c;do the post-GI group means differ from the UC group means across the weeks?&#x0201d; The data used to answer this question was the post-GI data and the UC group data. The mixed-effect linear model used to test this question contained fixed effects for week (1&#x02013;12), intervention group (GI versus UC), and a week by intervention group interaction and a random effect for participant.</p><p>Because this was a pilot study, no adjustment for multiplicity was used; the results from this trial should be regarded as exploratory and should be confirmed in a larger trial. JMP and SAS were used for all data analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><title>2.9.

Demographics</title><p>Participants ages ranged from 18 to 39 years with a mean age of 24.26 years (1.06) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The mean estimated gestational age (EGA) at enrollment was 15.43 (0.16) weeks and 21 participants (29%) were primigravida and for 23 participants (32%) this was their second pregnancy. The majority of participants were not married (86%, 62/72), were educated after high school (51%, 37/72), reported that they were not employed out of the home (60%, 43/72), and had an income of &#x0003c;$15,000 (68%, 49/72). Thirteen participants (18%, 13/72) reported smoking and 6 (8%, 6/72) reported current use of alcohol. The majority (85%, 60/71) stated they did not use any stress management techniques. There were no significant differences between groups on demographic variables or baseline PSS and STAI scores and CRH concentrations between the groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). The groups were similar with respect to smoking and alcohol use and utilization of stress management techniques. Of the 72 women who were randomized and completed the baseline measures, 12 (12/72) did not complete the 12-week study. Reasons included the following: (1) seven did not attend the scheduled prenatal care visit and were lost to follow up; (2) three women moved; (3) one experienced a fetal loss; and (4) one GI participant withdrew because it was &#x0201c;too much bother&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><title>3.2.

Discussion</title><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Study Outcomes</title><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of GI on self-reported and biologic measures of stress and the associated symptoms anxiety and fatigue in pregnant African American women. There was a statistically significant reduction in perceived stress scores at 8 weeks (time 2) but not at 12 weeks (time 3) in the GI compared to UC group. The significant decrease in PSS scores for the GI group at 8 weeks has not been reported in previous studies with pregnant women [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A possible explanation for this finding may be related to the selection of images for this study. While a previous study included images related to focused breathing, relaxation, stress, and stress-related symptoms, as well as mental rehearsal imagery [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], this study included those images but added a 4th CD tract with images related to a healthy pregnancy and baby. Pregnancy is a complex and dynamic condition wherein the pregnant woman and fetus have an intricate relationship [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Thus, it would be no surprise that the health of the pregnancy and baby is of concern to the pregnant woman. It is possible that the inclusion of affirmations such as &#x0201c;<italic>I know my baby is tucked away inside my body&#x02014;safe and cozy&#x02014;cushioned and protected</italic> and images of <italic>how secure and comfortable and safe the baby is in your body every cell in your body supporting this wonderful baby</italic>&#x0201d; promoted a sense of maternal wellbeing and a reduction in perceived stress. While there was a significant difference in PSS scores at 8 weeks (time 2), this was not the case at 12 weeks (time 3). This did not appear to be due to an increase in PSS mean scores in the GI group but rather a decrease in the UC group mean PSS scores, while the GI group mean remained constant. However, even though the GI participants were able to maintain their initial changes at 12 weeks, they did not demonstrate further reduction in PSS scores.</p><p>The NRSS weekly mean stress scores were significantly lower in the GI compared to UC group and, in the GI group, the NRSS scores were significantly lower after intervention compared to before intervention. These findings are consistent with prior reported research [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and add evidence to the effectiveness of this intervention to reduce perceived stress over the course of a single week. This is important because daily stressors affect wellbeing and can accumulate over time [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Our body responds to daily events and attempts to maintain homeostasis by an active process often referred to as allostasis [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. It is the increase of the daily stress events and/or the inefficient management of allostasis that results in an increase in allostatic load and potentially negative health outcomes [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The results suggest that GI had an immediate effect on decreasing day-to-day perceived stress, which potentially may impact allostatic load and ultimately health outcomes.</p><p>While the GI group's state anxiety scores trended downward and the UC group's state anxiety scores remained fairly constant at 8 weeks, there were no significant differences in the state anxiety scores at time 2 or 3. While previous studies [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reported a reduction in state anxiety scores following a GI intervention, the findings of this study are consistent with those studies [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] which found no reduction in state anxiety scores. While state anxiety is a common emotional reaction to stress and has been associated with negative health outcomes, recent research suggests that pregnancy anxiety, a newer concept, is one of the most potent maternal risk factors for adverse outcomes [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. While closely associated with state anxiety, pregnancy anxiety is a particular emotional state closely related to state anxiety but more contextually based to concerns about the current pregnancy [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that a general measure of state anxiety would not capture the multidimensional aspect of anxiety during pregnancy. If so, it is conceivable that an intervention designed to reduce anxiety during pregnancy may not affect a general measure of anxiety.</p><p>There was a significant difference in trait anxiety scores with the GI group reporting decrease levels at time 8 but not time 12 compared to UC group. Prior studies [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have reported on effect of GI on state anxiety but not trait anxiety. The significant reduction in trait anxiety reported in this study is an important finding as trait anxiety levels during pregnancy have been associated with negative neonatal development and behavior. For example, increased levels of trait anxiety during pregnancy have been shown to adversely influence fetal hemodynamics [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and are associated with lower infant orientation and self-regulation scores [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], reports of difficult infant temperament [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], and slower growth of the infant's hippocampus over the first 6 months of life [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Thus, an intervention that decreases maternal trait anxiety may have long-term implications for fetal and infant development as well as maternal-infant interactions.</p><p>Fatigue at 8 weeks (time 2) was decreased in the GI group compared to UC group. We believe this is the first published study to document the effects of GI on fatigue in pregnant African American women. This finding is consistent with reports of researchers examining the effects of GI on fatigue in other populations [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. There are potentially several explanations for this finding. First, since the GI group reported lower perceived stress scores weekly and at 8 weeks and stress has been found to be associated with fatigue, it is reasonable that the GI group would experience a decrease in fatigue. Another possible explanation is related to sleep quality. One of the most common causes of fatigue during pregnancy is disturbed sleep [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Sleep disturbances during pregnancy may be the result of difficulty falling asleep and/or maintaining sleep [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] due to midsleep awakenings [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and nightmares [<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] which results in difficulty maintaining sleep [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In fact, frightening dreams or nightmares have been cited as a common cause of midsleep awakening by 72% of pregnant women [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. The comments written by the GI participants in the daily logs regarding their perceived benefits of the intervention on their sleep may offer an explanation for the effect of GI on fatigue. Comments such as &#x0201c;they helped me to fall asleep,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;stay asleep,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;improved my dreams,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;helped me sleep longer&#x0201d; suggested that the intervention potentially improved the participants' sleep and, thus, decreased fatigue. As total time spent asleep has been reported to play a significant role in perceived fatigue[<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>], this is a plausible explanation.</p><p>As expected, the CRH increased at each measurement. In a normal pregnancy, levels of CRH in maternal blood increase exponentially from weeks 15 to 36 gestation with a significant rise at weeks 26 to 30 [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is the significantly elevated and/or accelerated rate of CRH increase over the course of the pregnancy that is associated with negative outcomes [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Given the small sample size analyzed and the expected wide ranges of CRH during pregnancy, it is not surprising that no significant differences were found.</p><p>The intervention was well received by the GI group. The GI participants had never used GI prior to this study and were open to participating and listening to the intervention. As evidenced by the written comments in the daily practice log, the participants found the intervention helpful in feeling less stressed and calmer, relieving symptoms, and soothed pregnancy-related concerns. The positive comments coupled with the fact that only one participant withdrew because the intervention was &#x0201c;too much bother&#x0201d; suggest that CAM interventions are potentially acceptable to African American pregnant women. This is an important finding given the current health disparity in the use of CAM interventions in the United States. Existing data suggest that CAM use is lower among African Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites and Asian Americans [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In this study, AA women participated at a high level and used a variety of GI CD tracts over the course of 12 weeks. The results of this study highlight the importance of health care providers discussing CAM interventions and introducing effective yet inexpensive therapies such as GI particularly to pregnant African American women.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. Research Implications</title><p>There are multiple research implications resulting from this study. An interesting and important area for a future focus is to examine if a booster (s) between 8 and 12 weeks would continue to help improve the stress levels of the group receiving GI as boosters have been found to sustain and/or improve the effectiveness of health behavior interventions [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. A larger randomized controlled trial for efficacy in relationship to improvement in infant outcomes is also needed. Future research might also consider testing an allostatic load score using a combination of stress and anxiety with biological markers to predict preterm birth and test if this allostatic load is then changed as a composite score. Additional studies testing the effect of GI in pregnancy on anxiety might also benefit from including pregnancy-related anxiety as well as generalized anxiety measures. An interesting and potentially important finding out of this study is the effect of GI on fatigue. Because sleep quality is a predictor of maternal mood, stress, and fatigue [<xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], future work might include a sensitive measure of sleep quality in relationship to the GI use. Finally, a larger randomized controlled trial examining the effect of the GI use on biological markers such as CRH is also warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. Study Limitations</title><p>Our results must be balanced with study limitations. In terms of adherence to the intervention, the majority of participants reported daily use of the GI intervention. However, self-reported measures are dependent on the participant's accurate reporting. It is possible that participants under- or overreported information or did not complete the form in a timely manner, which are all potential threats to validity. Future studies could address this limitation through the use of expanding mobile technology that can facilitate self-report data collection and validate intervention use. In some instances, participants' health history information was self-reported and the recruitment site was unable to verify the information. This is a potential limitation when trying to control for confounding factors. For example, fatigue during pregnancy is known to be influenced by coexisting factors such as anemia, excessive weight gain, diet, and physical activity [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, the differences in fatigue between groups could be confounded by other factors. In addition, the CRH sample that was analyzed was small which limited identifying treatment effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>This study investigated the effects of a GI intervention on maternal stress and associated symptoms of anxiety and fatigue in pregnant African American women beginning in the second trimester. The findings demonstrated significant effects of the GI intervention on perceived stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Within the GI group, the intervention had an immediate effect as evidenced by significant differences in pre- and postintervention averaged daily scores and the GI group reported significantly lower perceived stress scores compared to UC group at 8 weeks. In addition, the GI group reported significantly less trait anxiety and fatigue compared to UC group at 8 weeks.</p><p>This study also provides direction for consideration in future studies. For example, the addition of appropriate booster sessions may strengthen or sustain the effects of the intervention and the use of mobile technology may facilitate self-report data collection and potentially enhance the evaluation of treatment fidelity, which is often missing in CAM mind-body intervention research. In addition, when examining measures of stress and associated symptoms in pregnant women, consideration should be given for the addition of pregnancy anxiety measures.</p><p>The results of this study also support the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. Of those who met the inclusion criteria, 97% of women agreed to participate and, of those, 83% completed the 12-week study. The majority of participants (85%) reported at the beginning of the study that they were not using any stress management technique. Given the negative health outcomes associated with stress during pregnancy, it is imperative that effective, low-cost, and easy to use interventions be available to this population. GI, a CAM mind-body intervention, is a promising intervention to meet that need.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title> Acknowledgments</title><p>This work is supported by NIH Grant P30 NR011403 (Grap,
