Cervical pessary and cervical cerclage are both considered as preventive treatments in women at risk for preterm birth. We aim to evaluate whether a cervical pessary can replace cervical cerclage for preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a prior preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency or in women with a prior preterm birth and a short cervix in the current pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">A nationwide open-label multicentre randomised clinical trial will be set up to study women with a singleton pregnancy and a prior preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation. Women are eligible in case of previous preterm birth based on cervical insufficiency (primary intervention, &#x0003c;16&#x000a0;weeks) or in case of previous preterm birth and a short cervical length in current pregnancy &#x02264;25&#x000a0;mm (secondary intervention, &#x0003c;24&#x000a0;weeks). Eligible women will be randomised to either cervical pessary or cervical cerclage. Both interventions will be removed at labour or at 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestational age, whatever comes first. The primary outcome will be delivery before 32&#x000a0;weeks. Secondary outcomes will be gestational age at birth, preterm birth rate before 24, 28, 34 and 37&#x000a0;weeks of gestation (overall and stratified by spontaneous or indicated delivery), premature rupture of membranes, use of tocolysis and/or corticosteroids during pregnancy, mode of delivery, maternal infections, maternal side effects, neonatal and maternal hospital admissions, and a composite of adverse perinatal outcomes including both morbidity and mortality. We assume an event rate of 20% preterm birth before 32&#x000a0;weeks for cerclage and use a non-inferiority margin of 10% for the cervical pessary.

The incidence of preterm birth varies between countries with a range of 5&#x02013;13% and results in 15 million preterm deliveries worldwide each year. Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality. Of all perinatal mortality, 50&#x02013;70% is associated with preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Approximately 75% of all preterm births occur spontaneously, starting with either contractions or preterm pre-labour rupture of membranes (PPROM). Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity, mostly due to respiratory immaturity, intracranial haemorrhages and infections. These conditions can result in long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae such as intellectual impairment, cerebral palsy, chronic lung disease, deafness and blindness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Thus, prevention of spontaneous preterm birth remains one of the biggest challenges in obstetric care.</p><p id="Par22">An important risk factor for preterm birth is a prior preterm birth. Women with a prior spontaneous preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks have an average risk of 20% (range between 15.8% and 30.2%) of recurrence of spontaneous preterm birth before 37&#x000a0;weeks and 15% before 34&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Women with a previous preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation are usually advised to use progestagens, either 17-hydroxy progesterone caproate or vaginal progesterone, in a following pregnancy. Additionally, women with a prior preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency can be offered a primary cervical cerclage, i.e. history based cerclage. Cervical insufficiency is characterized by progressive shortening and dilatation of the cervix before 24&#x000a0;weeks of gestation without signs of preterm labour, and is associated with mid-trimester pregnancy loss and early preterm birth. Screening for cervical shortening by transvaginal ultrasound before 24&#x000a0;weeks of gestation is recommended in women with a prior preterm birth without (clear) diagnosis of cervical insufficiency in prior pregnancies. In case of a short cervix &#x02264;25&#x000a0;mm before 24&#x000a0;weeks of gestational age, these women can be offered a secondary cervical cerclage, i.e. ultrasound indicated cerclage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">A cervical cerclage is a surgical procedure that involves occlusion of the cervix by means of a cervical suture or stitch which is performed under general or spinal anaesthesia proposed by Shirodkar in 1955 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and by McDonald in 1957 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A primary cerclage is considered to be effective in the prevention of preterm birth in women with cervical insufficiency and is usually offered before&#x000a0;16&#x000a0;weeks of gestational age. The largest trial published in 1993 included 1292 women with singleton pregnancies, and showed a significant reduction in preterm birth before 33&#x000a0;weeks of gestation (13% versus 17%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A meta-analysis from 2003 demonstrates that primary cervical cerclage has a significant effect in preventing spontaneous preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The effectiveness of a secondary cerclage has been studied in a meta-analysis from 2011. This meta-analysis found that in these women the risk of delivery before 32&#x000a0;weeks&#x02019; gestation was 19% in women with cerclage as compared to 30% in those without cerclage (RR 0.66 95% CI 0.48&#x02013;0.91) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Placement of cervical cerclages has proven to be effective in some women at risk for recurrent preterm birth. However, the disadvantage of cervical cerclage is the potential harm. Complications of cervical cerclage include PPROM, preterm labour, infection, suture displacement, and bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, cerclage is associated with an increased risk of cervical laceration, both in nulliparous (OR 3.7, 95% CI 1.1&#x02013;12.8) and multiparous women (adjusted OR 12.7, 95% CI 5.7&#x02013;28.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The cervical pessary is a soft and flexible silicone device known since 1959 when it was used in women with recurrent miscarriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Although the exact mechanism of the cervical pessary remains unknown, it has been hypothesised that the pessary relieves direct pressure on the internal cervical ostium by changing the position of the cervical canal and distributing the weight of the pregnant uterus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another possible mechanism is that the pessary might support the immunological barrier between chorioamnion-extraovular space and the vaginal microbiological flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Recently, several randomised trials showed that the cervical pessary may be potentially effective as a treatment for preterm birth prevention. The Spanish Pesario Cervical para Evitar Prematuridad (PECEP) trial from 2012 compared treatment with a pessary in women with a short cervix with expectative management and showed a significant decrease in preterm birth before&#x000a0;34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.12&#x02013;0.30) and improvement of neonatal outcome (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.04&#x02013;0.39) in the intervention (pessary) group. In this study, 11% of 385 women included had at least one prior preterm birth, however, no subgroup analysis was performed for women with a previous preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The same group performed a similar trial in twin pregnancies and observed a reduction in spontaneous preterm birth before 34&#x000a0;weeks of gestation in the pessary group (16.2% versus 25.7%; p 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Another randomised controlled trial performed by Liem et al. in 2014 comparing a pessary with no treatment in twin pregnancies showed similar results in a subgroup with short cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Two randomised trials coordinated by the Fetal Medicine Network from the United Kingdom could not confirm these results of the pessary, both in singleton and multiple pregnancies with short cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The most frequently reported side effect of a pessary is vaginal discharge. Less common reported complications during the use of a pessary are vaginal blood loss or pelvic pain. Cervical laceration as complication is rarely seen in the use of pessary, this chance seems smaller than 0.1%.</p><p id="Par26">Since a cervical pessary can be positioned in an outpatient setting, it is less expensive than placing a surgical cerclage and is therefore potentially more attractive than a cerclage. In addition, a cervical pessary is a non-invasive method contrary to a cervical cerclage which is an invasive procedure. Although both interventions have been available for over 55&#x000a0;years now, both interventions have been compared directly only once. A randomised study performed in 1986 in Germany in women with a prior preterm birth included 242 women and did show comparable outcomes in women using a pessary and women having cerclage (37&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5&#x000a0;weeks of gestational age at delivery in the cerclage group versus 37&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;weeks in the pessary group, <italic>p</italic> value not significant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">We propose to compare the cervical pessary and cervical cerclage in a head-to-head comparison and hypothesise that the use of a cervical pessary will be equally effective in preventing preterm birth as cervical cerclage. The outcome of the proposed study will indicate the relative effectiveness of cervical pessary for women with a singleton pregnancy with a prior preterm birth due to cervical insufficiency and in women with a prior preterm birth and short cervical length in current pregnancy. In addition, we will be able to compare the costs of both interventions. Since the placement of a pessary is less expensive compared to the surgical application of a cerclage, implementation of this therapy will potentially yield a major cost-reduction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim, design and setting</title><p id="Par28">We will perform an international randomised controlled trial under the acronym the PC Study (Pessary or Cerclage to prevent preterm delivery in women with short cervical length and a history of preterm birth; Netherlands Trial Registry NTR 4415, registered at the 29th of January 2014: website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=4415">http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=4415</ext-link>).

In addition, the recent PECEP study, a study which compared treatment with a pessary in women with a short cervix with expectative management, included 11% women with at least one prior preterm birth. This study showed an overall significant decrease in preterm birth in the intervention (pessary) group (spontaneous delivery before&#x000a0;34&#x000a0;weeks 12 (6%) in the pessary group vs. 51 (27%) in de control group; OR 0.18; 95% CI 0.08&#x02013;0.37; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;0001), however, no subgroup analysis was performed for women with a previous preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

Although the chance of these complications occurring is indeed low, the impact on the course of the pregnancy is major. Additionally, cervical cerclage is a surgical intervention which is usually performed under general anaesthesia, and as such is at risk of surgical complications. A cervical pessary is a non-invasive intervention and can be placed in an outpatient setting. In addition, severe complications related to cerclage are considered to occur more often compared to complications related to the use of pessary. This makes a pessary more attractive as intervention, however, the effect on preterm birth and neonatal outcome should be addressed first.</p><p id="Par53">The outcome of this study will determine whether treatment with a cervical pessary can replace a cerclage to prevent preterm birth in women at high-risk for preterm delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
