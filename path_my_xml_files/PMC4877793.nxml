Approximately 1.2 million people die from lung cancer each year. NSCLC represents &#x0003e;80% of all lung cancers. 60%-70% of the patients with NSCLC suffer stage III or IV disease. In the late 1980s, radiotherapy was the standard treatment for these patients [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Randomized trials and a 1995 overview subsequently showed that combination/combined chemoradio-therapy was superior to radiotherapy alone [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Many chemotherapeutic agents active in NSCLC possess radiosensitizing properties, thereby improving the probability of local control. In addition, chemotherapy administered concurrently with thoracic radiation may act systemically and potentially eradicate distant micrometastases. Several studies showed the feasibility of the cisplatin-etoposide combination plus radiotherapy for patients with stage III disease [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Successfully tailored therapy in lung cancer patients requires defining the prognostic factors. Prognostic factors are defined as characteristics of patients and stage, before starting the treatment. Analyzing these characteristics provides the opportunity to select patients in different groups and choose the best treatment modality for the selected group. They are also important to evaluate the results of treatments and to compare the results of different clinical studies [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Primary end point of this study was to evaluate the treatment results and the prognostic variables in our patients treated with sequential and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>One hundred and ten patients with NSCLC stage IIIA and IIIB were analyzed at the University Clinic of Radiotherapy and Oncology in Skopje in the period from October 2005 to March 2008. Only 85 patients were eligible for this study, aged between 18 and 70 years, had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Score &#x02264; 1, and had &#x02264; 10 % weight loss in the period of 3 months before inclusion. They have previously untreated histological or cytological proven NSCLC, unrespectable stage IIIA-N2 disease, or stage IIIB disease without pleural effusion. Stage IIIB disease was assigned either by N3 (contralateral mediastinal or supraclavicular nodes) or by T4 from invasion of mediastinal structures. Following prognostic factors were evaluated: aged (18-43, 44-55, 56-70); histological type (squamous, adenocarcinoma large cell carcinoma and unspecified type); performance status (PS) according to ECOG Score &#x02264; 1, weight loss in the period of 3 months before inclusion (&#x0003c; 5%, 5-10%); lymph nodes involvement and tumor dimension (&#x02264;5 cm, &#x0003e; 5 cm and unmeasurment because atelectasis, pneumonitis); symptoms duration before treatment (&#x0003c; 3 months, 3-6 months, &#x0003e; 6 months); and hemoglobin level (&#x0003c;120 g/l, &#x02265; 120 g/l).</p><p>The following laboratory values were required: leucocytes &#x02265; 1.5x10&#x000b3;/l, platelets &#x02265; 100x10/l, AST and ALT &#x02264; 2 x the upper limit of the reference range. Ineligibility criteria were as follows: uncontrolled infection, or fever over 38&#x000ba;C, unstable cardiovascular disease and previous malignancy.</p><p>Before enrolment, the patients gave their full medical histories and underwent clinical examination with assessment of performance status (PS). In the sequential arm, responses were assessed 8 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. In the concurrent arm, responses were assessed 8 weeks after the end of the consolidation chemotherapy. Imaging studies x-ray and/or computed tomography (CT) could be repeated at all times when clinically indicated. Complete and partial responses were based on RECIST criteria. Toxicity was graded according to RTOG/EORTC criteria. Follow-up visits were conducted every 2 months during the first year and, afterwards, every 3 months. Patients were randomly assigned to receive sequential or concurrent therapy. In the sequential arm, 45 patients received four cycles of chemotherapy. They were administered first, consisting of carboplatin (AUC x 6) on day 1 and etoposide on days 1-3, repeated every 3 weeks. The radiotherapy began 4 weeks after the fourth cycle of chemotherapy administration. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy began simultaneously in concurrent arm, including 40 patients. The radiotherapy schedule was identical to that in the sequential arm. The first cycle with cisplatin 30 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and etoposide 100mg/m<sup>2</sup> was administered on days 1 to 3 and the second 3-days cycle was administered the last 3 days of radiotherapy. After 4 weeks of concurrent chemoradiotherapy schedule, two cycles of consolidation chemotherapy began, consisting of carboplatine (AUC x 6) and etoposide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day 1 to 3.</p><p>Conformal radiotherapy at both arms consisted of 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy per fraction, for 5 days a week given over a period of 6 weeks. Treatment planning CT was required to define the gross tumor volume (GTV). Each patient was positioned in an immobilization device-wing board in the treatment position on a flat table. CT slices with 5 mm thickness were obtained, starting from cricoid cartilage and extending inferiorly to the level of the L1 vertebral body. The GTV, clinical target volume (CTV), planning target volume (PTV) and normal organs were outlined on all CT slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>ECOG status and survival</italic>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OAMJMS-3-75-g001"/></fig><p>The normal tissues that were contoured included both lungs (as the total lung volume), heart, spinal cord and esophagus. The CTV included the entire GTV plus 0.7 cm and the PTV included CTV plus another 0.7 cm adding margin.

The analysis was not performed according to the treatment modality: sequential or concurrent, because the two groups were homogeneous without significant differences between them.</p><p>Most patients in our study were between 44-55 and 56-70 years of age. The youngest patient was 38 years old and the oldest was 70 years old. Average age was 58.2 years (SD &#x000b1; 6.68 years). Patients aged between 44 and 55 had median survival of 14 months (95% CI 10.15-17.84), significantly better than the patients between 56 and 70 years of age, with median survival time of 10 months (95% CI 4.3-15.6) (p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>As we expected, performance status, according to ECOG criteria, has important influence on survival.

Median survival in patients group with weight loss under 5% was 16 months (95% CI 12.2 months to 19.7 months) and was, in statistical terms, significantly better than 7 months (95% CI 5.5 months to 11.3 months) in patients with weight loss between 5% and 10% (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Tumor dimension was also an important prognostic factor with statistical influence on survival (p&#x0003c;0.001). Patients with tumor dimension under 5 cm in size have median survival of 20 months (95% CI 13.6-26.3), compared with survival of 13 months at patients with tumors dimension over 5 cm in size (95% CI 9.8 months to 16.1 months) and 9 months (95% CI 6.1 months to 13.8 months) at unmeasured tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Lymph nodes involvements also have statistical influence on survival in lung cancer patients treating with chemoradiotherapy. Patients with N1 lymph nodes involvement live the longest median of 20 months (95% CI 11.1 months to 32.8 months), compared to 13 months (95% CI 9.6 months to 16.3 months) at patients with N2 involvements and 7 months (95% CI 5.8 -8.1) at those patients with N3 involvement (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><p>Another parameter we analyzed in this study was hemoglobin level in patients&#x02019; blood.

We found more benefit of concurrent therapy than in the previously listed trials, in terms of overall and disease-free survival (19 vs 13; 16 vs 9 months), and the difference was significant with log-rank test. When our study was designed, the cisplatin-etoposide combination was mostly used concurrently with radiotherapy. Consolidation chemotherapy with two cycles of carboplatin-etoposide was administered in the concurrent arm to balance the dose of platinum based chemotherapy in the two arms. This consolidation chemotherapy administered after concurrent chemoradiotherapy seems promising in terms of survival, as shown in the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) S9504 and Locally Advanced Multimodality Protocol (LAMP) studies [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the SWOG S9504 study, consolidation docetaxel following concurrent chemoradiotherapy has shown median survival of 26 months and median progression free survival of 16 months. Our concurrent-consolidation arm showed similar results (OS 19 months and DFS 16 months). In our study, the local relapse rate was lower in the concurrent arm than in the sequential arm. In the RTOG 94-10 [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] study, local failure rates at 2 years were significantly lower in the concurrent arm. Thus, it seems that the superior survival observed with concurrent treatment is associated with better local control [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Sealy at all [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] informed that elderly patients with inoperable lung cancer manifested local disease recurrence, while younger patient showed distant dissemination, proven in our study. According to the most authors, gender did not influence survival.</p><p>According to the literature, number of female with lung cancer was increasing with decreasing ratio male/female. We did not confirm this in our study, because, in Macedonia, smoking among the female population was rarity [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>According to our study, histology type of lung cancer did not influence the survival, but same data from the literature confirm that squamous lung cancer patients live longer than those with adenocarcinoma [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>We have confirmed in our study that tumor dimension was an important factor influencing the survival. Perez informed that that there was only correlation between tumor dimension and local disease control without influence on the survival [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The most important prognostic factor according to the literature was the performance status. We also confirmed that the performance status before starting the treatment had statistically significant influence on the survival [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In our study, median survival in patients&#x02019; group with weight loss under 5% was 16 months and was significantly better, in statistical terms, than 7 months in patients&#x02019; group with weight loss between 5 and 10%. Data from the literature confirmed our conclusion [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>We highly recommend precisely defining the stage of disease and the prognostic factors in lung cancer patients and hoping that in better selected patient group the chance for giving best treatment will be higher.</p><p>Given the high toxicity in the concurrent-consolidation schedule, it should be reserved for patients younger than 70 years, having good performance status and minimal weight loss. In our study, the dose-limiting toxicity, esophagitis was reduced by performing conformal radiotherapy. Conformal thoracic radiotherapy and new radiotherapy techniques, such as respiratory gated radiotherapy, allow dose escalating and may probably improve survival and local control in lung cancer patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests
