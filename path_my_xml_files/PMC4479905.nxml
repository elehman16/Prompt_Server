The modality of exercise that is most beneficial and economic for masses has now become a topic of research.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The conventional exercises (endurance exercises like walking, jogging, running, swimming, cycling, etc.), which give stress on cardiovascular and respiratory systems and test the responses of these systems are very popular. On the other hand, ancient yogic exercises which have been claimed to benefit human body on multiple fronts are also getting more popularity all over the world.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Lot of studies are published in India demonstrating positive effects of yogic exercises on multiple body functions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, most of these studies are cross-sectional. Furthermore, the positive effects of yogasanas and pranayama may be the outcome of any exercise <italic>per se</italic> and may be same as that of other exercises. Comparison of the effects of yogic exercises and those of other endurance exercises like walking, running, and swimming on major body functions has not been done to reveal the efficacy of yogic exercises over other exercises, if any. Efficacy of different modules must be compared as practicing any one exercise module may not be feasible by different people. With this background, this study was designed to assess the effects of yogic exercises on resting heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of the modulation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) at rest,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in normal healthy young sedentary volunteers, and to compare these effects with those obtained with swimming in sedentary volunteers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy males and females with normal physical examination and with sedentary occupations between 18&#x02013;40 years of age were included in the study. The volunteers from the socio-cultural gathering of general populations were motivated to participate in the study by explaining plan of the study to them. The recruitment was purely on the voluntary basis. After screening and fulfilments of inclusion and exclusion criteria, volunteers were recruited in the study. Initially, 100 volunteers were recruited but at the end of the study, Yoga group consisted of 41 subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 41), out of which 16 were males and 25 females. Swimmer group comprised 40 subjects with 18 males and 22 females. Volunteers had not been engaged in yoga practice or swimming in the past nor were they doing any physical exercise at least during 3 years preceding the study as assessed by enquiring in detail. Smokers, subjects consuming alcohol even occasionally, subjects who were in non-sedentary occupations, post-operative patients, and subjects suffering from any hernia, pregnant females, subjects with history of any cardiovascular disorder, subjects with a history of respiratory tract infection symptoms during previous 6 weeks, and subjects suggestive of any active respiratory disorders were excluded by thorough history and clinical examination.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The screening of subjects was done and clearance of Institutional Ethics Committee was obtained. After selection of the subjects, they were explained about the detailed plan of work and aim of present research project. The volunteers were briefed about the study protocol, they were motivated for the training and for compliance needed till the end of the study and written informed consent was obtained from them. The appointments for recording of study parameters were given to each subject.</p><p>One hundred volunteers were divided into cohorts of ten subjects each and were randomly assigned by block randomization method to undergo either yogic training or swimming for a duration of 12 weeks. Before the actual training period, resting blood pressure, resting heart rate, and resting digital electrocardiogram were recorded in a week's time for one cohort. In the same week, the subjects of that cohort were motivated for the exercise regimen they had to follow during the entire 12-weeks period. After 12-weeks exercise by all ten subjects in that cohort, all the parameters were again studied (2 or 3 subjects daily) in about a week's time. After baseline parameters were recorded for one cohort and the training started for that cohort, the next cohort was subjected to same treatment. Their cardiovascular parameters and digital electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded both before training and after training. For women, both pre- and post-training recordings were postponed in case they were menstruating till their menstruation stopped. Because of overlapping of training duration for cohorts, the baseline and post-exercise evaluation became easy.</p><p>Out of the 100 subjects, nine from the yoga group and ten from the swimmer group dropped out in due course of the study. As subjects who dropped out were non-compliant, per protocol analysis method was used to analyze the data. Thus, at the end of the study, data of 41 subjects from yoga group and 40 subjects from swimming group were analyzed [characteristics of the population shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Composition of both groups of exercise modality namely yoga and swimming</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJY-8-96-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The yoga group subjects were instructed not to practice any yogic technique other than the prescribed ones and swimmer group was advised to refrain from other physical exercises during the study. We supervised the subjects early in the morning (5.00&#x02013;6.00 a.m.) during yoga classes and swimmers from 6.00&#x02013;7.00 a. m. everyday during the training period. Participants of both the groups were allowed to do their routine activities during the study period.</p><p>The subjects were taught yogasanas and pranayamas and then they practised the same, 6 days/week for 60 minutes daily, for a total duration of 12 weeks. Iyengar yoga techniques were followed by the yoga trainers.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Different yogasanas (yogic postures) viz. t&#x00101;d&#x00101;sana, kon&#x00101;sana, utkat&#x00101;sana, sarv&#x00101;ng&#x00101;sana, hal&#x00101;sana, chakr&#x00101;sana, padm&#x00101;sana, dhanur&#x00101;sana, makar&#x00101;sana, pashchimott&#x00101;n&#x00101;sana, vajr&#x00101;sana, vir&#x00101;sana, and shav&#x00101;sana were practiced for 40 minutes and pranayamic breathing exercises with purak, rechak and kumbhak, anulom-vilom, bhastrik&#x00101;, bhramari pr&#x00101;n&#x00101;y&#x00101;m, and kapalbh&#x00101;ti were practised for 20 minutes. Swimming was practiced 6 days/week for 60 minutes daily. Swimming comprised freestyle in first 6 weeks (including training in first 2&#x02013;3 weeks) and freestyle and breast stroke in last 6 weeks including 10 minutes of floating on the water. For novice swimmers, continuous swimming for 60 minutes is difficult; therefore, intermittent floating with deep slow breathing (total 10 minutes) was introduced. It also helped to keep similarity with yoga group who practiced shav&#x00101;sana for 10 minutes (lying still and relaxed with slow deep breathing).</p><p>An important limitation of the methodology was inability to assess and compare the intensities of two modalities of exercise during 12-weeks duration. The reason for this inability is that tools for intensity assessment of endurance exercise like exercise and post-exercise heart rates or O<sub>2</sub> consumption during exercise are not valid for measuring intensity of yogic exercises. Immediate heart rates after some yogasanas have shown variable response with decrease in heart rate seen more often than increase in heart rate with yogasanas.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Therefore, the whole module lasting for same duration for swimming and yoga was compared.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Measurement of autonomic activity</title><p>On the day of recordings, the subjects were familiarized with the laboratory environment and their anthropometric measurements were taken. Pre- and post-training measurements were recorded in the morning 2 hours after a light breakfast. All parameters like heart rate and right brachial blood pressure as well as ECG were recorded after 20 minutes of rest in supine position.</p><p>For autonomic activity, ECG was recorded continuously on a computerized data acquisition and analysis system (Polyrite, Recorders, and Medicare Systems, Chandigarh, India).</p><p>The analogue to digital conversion of the ECG signal was done using A/D converter with the sampling frequency 512 Hz. Both frequency and time domain analysis of HRV was done using HRV analysis software of Recorders and Medicare System proided with the data acquisition and analysis system. For frequency domain analysis, Fast Fourier Transformation was done using Welch's periodogram method with a Hann window. Entire spectrum of frequencies was divided into three major bands, very low frequency (VLF, 0&#x02013;0.04 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.04&#x02013;0.15 Hz), and high frequency (HF, 0.15&#x02013; 0.4 Hz). For computing HRV indices during supine rest, recommendations of the Task Force on HRV were followed.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the data obtained was analyzed group-wise by descriptive statistics using mean, standard deviation, and standard error of mean. For differences in sex-wise composition of two study groups, Chi-squared test was used. For each parameter in both yoga and swimming groups before and after training period of 12 weeks, data distribution was tested for normality of distribution by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p><p>The paired data before and after 12 weeks of training for both yoga and swimming groups was tested by Student's paired <italic>t</italic>-test for parametric data with normal distribution and by Wilcoxon signed rank test for parametric data without normal distribution as well as for non-parametric data.</p><p>The change in different parameters with 12 weeks of training was studied by calculating delta i. e., difference in value before and after 12-weeks exercise training of both modalities. The percent change was also calculated for each parameter as percentage of change with respect to pre-exercise training level of that parameter. Increase or decrease in value of a parameter (delta) with yoga and swimming was also compared using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for parametric data with normal distribution and using Mann-Whitney U test for parametric data without normal distribution as well as for non-parametric data.</p><p>The statistical significance was considered at probability value less than 0.05.</p><p>The statistical calculations were done using Data Analysis tool of Microsoft Excel and Systat 12 (Systat Software, Inc.

Increase in parasympathetic activity as indicated by increased high frequency power (absolute power, HF% or HF n. u.) has been demonstrated after endurance exercises as well as yogic exercises. Similar change in LF/HF ratio which changes the sympathovagal balance in favor of parasympathetic component has also been reported by many workers.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>However, Martinelli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] have described that endurance-trained athletes present indications of increased HRV in the time domain but not in the frequency domain.

Changes in sympathetic as well as vagal nerve traffic to the heart are thought to contribute to LF power.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] LF power is more closely related to stretch-induced changes in firing of baroreceptor afferents rather than the tonic discharge in baroreceptor afferents in response to the prevailing mean blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Physical training improves baroreflex sensitivity and can be associated with a reduced risk for cardiac mortality after myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Increase in HF power after both yoga and swimming training depicts a balance in favor of parasympathetic component of ANS. Even in diseased conditions, exercise training can restore a more normal cardiac autonomic balance by increasing cardiac parasympathetic regulation and also reduce the incidence of malignant arrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Heart rate power (LF and HF) decreases with increasing age; however, the effects of age are not significant between all deciles of age.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Deep psycho-physiological relaxation obtained in <italic>shavasana</italic>, a relaxing yogic posture, which is practised intermittently and at the end of training sessions, causes the reversal of the &#x0201c;flight or fight&#x0201d; response which results in maximum reduction of heart rate and blood pressure below normal resting level. Due to such conditioning, the parasympathetic predominance may be established.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>The ANS response to athletic training and rehabilitative exercise programs is thought to be a conditioning phenomenon.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] HRV is a product of the dynamic interplay of many of the body's systems and is considered a measure of neurocardiac function that reflects heart&#x02013;brain interactions and ANS dynamics. Yoga, pranayam, or endurance exercise may be modifying this complex interplay of heart&#x02013;brain interactions.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Whatever are the mechanisms in yoga or endurance exercises, a swift increase in HRV is seen, particularly favoring the parasympathetic dominance.</p><p>To conclude, the present study has shown significant improvements in resting HRV after both the modalities viz. yoga and swimming. However, results are more in favor of yoga, though the results of the present study needs further confirmation on a larger sample size as adequacy of the sample size was not tested in the present study.</p><p>Apart from the preventive value of yoga there is also an emerging realization of its benefit as a complementary therapy in therapeutic and rehabilitative medicine.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] In developing and poor countries, the facilities for recreational exercise and sports are not easily available and many low socio-economic group people cannot afford to utilize the available resources. Some individuals with physical constraints and for other reasons like lack of infrastructure and training may not be able to undertake exercises like swimming, though they can easily undergo yogic training. In light of these facts, yogic exercise can become the most important way of lifestyle intervention and physical activity for prevention of many diseases as prescribed by World Health Organization.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>We acknowledge help of yoga instructors of Anekant Swadhyaya Mandir, a yoga and naturopathy centre at Wardha and swimming coaches of Municipal Swimming Pool managed by Police Welfare Fund at Wardha.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shimamoto</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Adachi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Takahashi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low impact aerobic dance as a useful exercise mode for reducing body mass in mildly obese middle-aged women</article-title><source>Appl Human Sci</source><year>1998</year><volume>17</volume><fpage>109</fpage><lpage>14</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saper</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisenberg</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Culpepper</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Phillips</surname><given-names>RS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and Patterns of adult yoga use in the United States: Results of a national survey</article-title><source>Altern Ther Health Med</source><year>2004</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>44</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15055093</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Khalsa</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Yoga as a therapeutic intervention: A bibliometric analysis of published research studies</article-title><source>Indian J Physiol Pharmacol</source><year>2004</year><volume>48</volume><fpage>269</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15648399</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Heart rate variability: Standards of measurement, physiological interpretation, and clinical use.
