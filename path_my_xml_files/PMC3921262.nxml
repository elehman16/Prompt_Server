Taking in to account the limits of infrastructure and available resources in low-resource settings, the technology used in these areas needs to be simple to use, robust, and in need of minimal technical maintenance. A pocked-sized battery-driven colposcope (the Gynocular [Gynius AB, Sweden]) was developed to provide criterion standard examination suitable for any infrastructural setting, thus enabling access to high-quality colposcopy in low-resource settings.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate if the Swede score colposcopy method using a pocket-sized battery-driven colposcope, the Gynocular, may improve detection of cervical lesions and selection for immediate treatment in low-resource settings.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a crossover, randomized clinical trial for assessing accuracy of the Swede scores<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> by colposcopy performed by standard colposcopes and the Gynocular, using biopsy as a criterion standard.

Among the women who had VIA of approximately 5% are VIA positive.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A woman is considered to be VIA positive when a trained doctor or nurse noticed sharp, distinct, well-defined, dense acetowhite areas on the cervix, with or without raised margins, close to the squamocolumnar junction in the transformation zone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Other inclusion criteria were (2) ability to understand written and oral information and (3) women signing an informed consent to participate in the study after receiving oral and written information from a social worker. Exclusion criteria were the following: (1) on-going vaginal bleeding, (2) any previous gynecologic examinations for at least 1 week before, and (3) pregnancy. Women who chose not to participate in the study had a standard colposcopy examination. In total, 540 women were included in the study after written consent. All women in the study were examined by 1 of the 6 colposcopy specialists in the colposcopy clinic of BSMMU. The colposcopy specialists were physicians or gynecologists who were trained in colposcopy, cold coagulation, and loop electrical excision procedure at the colposcopy clinic of BSMMU.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Colposcopy was performed using 1 of the 2 standard colposcopes (Karl Kaps Som 52, Karl Kaps GmbH &#x00026; Co.KG, Asslar/Wetzlar, Germany or Leisegang 1DF, Leisegang Feinmechanik-Optik GmbH, Berling, Germany) and the Gynocular. The Gynocular was mounted on a camera tripod during the examination. Women were randomly allocated in blocks of 50 to start the examination with either standard colposcope or Gynocular examination of the cervix. A total of 298 women started the examination with colposcope and 242 women with the Gynocular. All women were inspected with a standard colposcope and the Gynocular by the same examiner in a crossover design to assess the performance of agreement between the standard colposcope and the Gynocular.

The examination started with inspection of cervical vessel patterns with colposcope or the Gynocular as randomized using the red-free (green filter) mode. A cervical cell sample was then collected with a soft spatula from the cervix and cytobrush from the cervical canal for liquid-based cytology (ThinPrep; Hologic Inc, Marlborough, Mass). Then, the cervix was wiped with 5% acetic acid for 1 minute, followed by completion of the first colposcopic examination. After each examination, the 4 Swede score variables (acetowhiteness, margins plus surface, vessel pattern, and lesion size) were scored by the colposcopist and documented by the study coordinator. The examiner then changed instruments and repeated the examination procedure, and the new 4 Swede score variables were documented by the study coordinator. Next, the cervix was swabbed with 5% Lugol iodine solution, and the colposcopist scored the Swede score&#x02019;s fifth variable (iodine staining) with both instruments as randomized. The examination was completed with 1 or more biopsies taken from areas of suspected cervical lesions. Punch biopsies of the cervix were done in all women with Swede score of 4 and above.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref></p><p>The cervical biopsies were analyzed at the histopathology laboratory of BSMMU.

The human papillomavirus (HPV) tests were analyzed in the Laboratory of Clinical Microbiology and the Laboratory of Viruses of Karolinska University Hospital at Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, using the Cobas HPV Test (Roche Molecular Systems Inc, Pleasanton, Calif). The test specifically identifies (types) HPV-16 and HPV-18 while detecting the rest of the high-risk HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68) at clinically relevant infection levels.</p><p>The final diagnosis was the histopathology result, using the cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) system,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or other histopathologic diagnosis in situation of such outcome.

A Swede score of above 4 in VIA-positive women gave a good indication for biopsy, whereas the possibility of a high-grade cervical lesion and a Swede score of 8 and above was highly correlated with CIN2+ and thus could serve as an aid to decide at site for direct removal of abnormal cervical areas. Another important finding was that very few of the referred VIA-positive women resulted positive for HPV infection or had a CIN2+ lesion on cytology or biopsy. This needs to be considered when VIA is used for cervical screening.</p><p>The main strength of our study is the large sample size and randomized crossover design, which reduced the risk of intraobserver variability. The fact that all patients had HPV and a cervical cytology test analyzed in an accredited laboratory increases the strength of the study.</p><p>The main weakness of our study is that biopsy was performed in patients with Swede score of 4 and above and thus not in all patients. This might have biased our results because we could not compare histopathologic results for Swede scores of lower than 4 with Swede scores of 4 and above. However, although all women had both a cervical cytology and HPV test, the low incidence of HPV and abnormal cytology supports the finding that few VIA-positive women had an increased Swede score and thus was not in need of a biopsy. Another weakness is that women who were included were referred as VIA positive, and we could not control for how the referrer assessed the woman as VIA positive.</p><p>Our finding that most referred VIA-positive women had no HPV infection nor cervical lesions is in line with VIA studies from Nigeria, Peru, and Uganda.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4,7,13</xref> In a pooled study from India, women who were never screened before for cervical cancer had a prevalence of 5.8% high-risk HPV.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This finding is interesting to compare with the prevalence of 8.6% high-risk HPV among our study group of VIA-positive women from Bangladesh, whom thus did not differ much in HPV prevalence to women who were never screened before in a close-by region. These findings emphasize the need of a more accurate method for cervical cancer screening in low-resource settings to avoid overtreatment or unnecessary referrals and thus economic burden on already-restrained economies. In addition, the finding that 2 of the VIA-positive women had cervical tuberculosis on biopsy is important keep in mind, especially because it has only rarely been described in literature before.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Pimple et al<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggested a &#x0201c;single-visit approach&#x0201d; with colposcopy, which gives direct results and could be considered as a secondary testing tool to triage women who were found positive on VIA in settings where cytology and histopathology services are unavailable. In addition, a &#x0201c;see-and-treat&#x0201d; approach was a well-accepted management strategy of high-grade CIN in Bangladesh because it reduced the number of visits to the clinic and failure to receive treatment.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Moreover, Bowring et al<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> proposed that a modified Swede score in low-resource settings could predict cervical abnormalities and avoid overtreatment,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Strander et al<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> suggested see-and-treat approach when the patient has a Swede score of 8 and above. It is reassuring to note that the observed high specificity for CIN2+ for Swede score of 8 and above in our study is well in line with the results from both Strander et al<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and Bowring et al<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and support the see-and-treat method when the patient has a Swede score of 8 and above.</p><p>A recent meta-analysis<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> of the accuracy of colposcopy found that the pooled sensitivity for a punch biopsy&#x02013;defined CIN2+ disease was 91.3% and the specificity was as low as 24.6%. In most of the studies included, most women had positive punch biopsies, and the authors concluded that the observed high sensitivity of the punch biopsy was probably the result of verification bias, whereas very few cases of negative punch biopsies were referred for colposcopy and thus lowering the specificity of colposcopy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Also, previous studies on the Swede score method took place in settings where most of the patients were referred for colposcopy because of abnormal cytology. In these studies, most patients with CIN2+ had Swede score of 5 and above.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11,12</xref> The study population in our study was different; cytology was not available before colposcopy, only the VIA result, and for many women included in the study, the current visit to the colposcopy clinic might have been their only lifetime opportunity to have a colposcopy examination. Therefore, it is reassuring to note that also in our study population of VIA-positive women, colposcopy with Swede score was able to identify those who are in need of further assessment with biopsy and also which women would benefit from direct treatment.</p><p>One alternative to screening by Swede score is cytology. In our study, the results from cytology showed that 2.5% of the VIA-positive women had CIN2+, whereas punch biopsy from Swede scores of 4 and above found CIN2+ in 7% of the women. These findings are comparable with the results from a multicenter study in India, where cytology for CIN2+ reported where colposcopy in VIA-positive women also detected more CIN2+ lesions in VIA-positive women than cytology.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Increasing the Swede score cutoff decreased the sensitivity and increased the specificity. Lower specificity for a diagnostic test increases further burden on the health system in increased health care cost for treatment of the false positives. Thus, we recommend a colposcopy Swede score cutoff of 4 for biopsy in low-resource settings as an alternative cervical screening method.</p><p>In conclusion, Swede score by colposcopy using standard colposcope or the Gynocular might be an alternate cervical cancer screening method in low-resource settings, enabling the single-visit approach and avoiding overtreatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>First of all, we would like to thank all the women who participated in the study.
