back pain rehabilitation program on low back extensor strength, pain, and dysfunction in
chronic low back pain patients. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty men aged 22&#x02013;36&#x02005;years with
chronic low back pain were randomly divided into experimental and control groups of 10
patients each. Both groups underwent a low back pain rehabilitation program lasting 30&#x02005;min
each, thrice/week for 8 weeks. The experimental group was prescribed an additional 30&#x02005;min
of treadmill exercise without a slope at a speed of 3.0&#x02013;3.5&#x02005;km/h, at which patients could
walk comfortably. Low back extensor strength was tested using the Medx lumbar extension
machine, pain level was tested, using the visual analog scale, and dysfunction was tested,
using the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire. [Results] Changes in low back
extensor strength by angle showed significant interaction effects between measurement time
and group at 12&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0;, and 36&#x000b0;. The results of the visual analog scale and Oswestry
Questionnaire showed a decreasing trend after the experiment in both groups. However,
there was no interaction effect of the additional treadmill exercise in the experimental
group. [Conclusion] The combination of a low back pain rehabilitation program and
treadmill exercise has a synergistic effect, to some extent, on the improvement of low
back extensor strength and should be considered for treatment and rehabilitation of low
back pain patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Treadmill exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Over 70% of the population in developed countries experiences low back pain, and its
incidence is increasing in developing countries as well; low back pain is therefore a global
problem<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. As varied and complex
psychological and social factors are involved, the pain has no definite cause in about 85%
of patients<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Low back pain is divided
into acute or chronic according to its duration; if the pain lasts for over 12 weeks, it is
defined as chronic low back pain, and 5&#x02013;10% of all acute low back pain patients develop
chronic low back pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Once low back pain becomes serious, physical activities are restricted, and ultimately
muscle atrophy occurs as the muscles remain unused for long durations<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Particularly in chronic low back pain patients, the
worsening of low back pain caused by reduction in the muscle area and muscular atrophy leads
to secondary damage and relapse<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many low
back pain patients develop recurring low back pain due to lumbar instability caused by
muscular weakness around the spine and soft tissue damage in the trunk. Finally, the
reduction in muscular strength, muscular endurance, and flexibility in the lumbar spine and
limited range of motion of joints cause relapse of chronic low back pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, chronic low back pain
patients have more severe atrophy of low back extensors than of flexors<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, the aerobic exercise capacity tends to
decrease in patients with chronic low back pain owing to the limitation on motion&#x02014;this must
be considered in rehabilitation exercise<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The reasons for low back pain are still under discussion, and over many years, various
exercise methods have been suggested for treating low back pain, including flexion exercise,
isometric flexion exercise, extension exercise, passive extension exercise, and intensive
dynamic back exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although these exercise programs have been recommended
and developed over several years in low back pain discussions and rehabilitation centers, a
satisfactory outcome has not yet emerged. Despite greatly different opinions on the
pathogenesis of low back pain among researchers, therapeutic exercise is known to be
effective in general<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
therapeutic exercise in which patients participate actively is effective for low back pain
after the acute phase, and in particular, different types of exercises applied by
physiotherapists show very positive outcomes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rehabilitation programs for the relief of low back pain include complex exercises such as
selective exercises involving control of trunk muscles, muscle strengthening, muscle
stretching, and aerobic exercises<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Recent studies report that aerobic exercise is effective in reducing depression, pain, and
dysfunction in low back pain patients<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, some studies report that aerobic exercise combined with traditional physical
therapy has no additional effect on pain and dysfunction<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, there are conflicting results concerning the effects of
aerobic exercise in low back pain patients, and there is also a lack of clear evidence on
this matter. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the additional effect of
treadmill exercise combined with a low back pain rehabilitation exercise program on low back
extensor strength, pain, and dysfunction in patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 20 men aged 22&#x02013;36&#x02005;years with chronic low back pain who visited a

The low back pain rehabilitation program was conducted for 30 minutes, thrice
a week for 8 weeks for the control and experimental groups. The program consisted of 14
exercises including flexion and extension, and it was conducted under the continuous
guidance and supervision of an expert in a low back pain treatment room. The experimental
group performed an additional 30&#x02005;min of treadmill exercise. Treadmill exercise was conducted
without a slope at a speed of 3.0&#x02013;3.5&#x02005;km/h, which allowed patients to walk comfortably, and
the patients were instructed to straighten their back and make initial contact with their
heel.</p><p>For the low back extensor strength test, the Medx<sup>TM</sup> lumbar extension machine
(H-10000; MedX, Ocala, FL, USA) was used, and measurement were taken before and after the
experiment for both groups. Before starting the low back extensor strength test, the tester
moved the machine manually and conducted the range of motion (ROM) exercise 3 times to check
that there were no limitations in ROM at the designated degree of flexion for the lumbar
spine. The test was conducted to measure the maximum isometric torque of the lumbar spine
extensors according to degree of flexion (72&#x000b0;, 60&#x000b0;, 48&#x000b0;, 36&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0;, 12&#x000b0;, 0&#x000b0;) starting from

development and a sedentary lifestyle have brought about a reduction in physical activity
and changes in physical function and posture, leading to the incidence of low back pain. In
most low back pain patients, muscular weakness and imbalance around the lumbar spine caused
by lack of exercise are the major factors that cause activity impairment. This is because
muscular weakness and imbalance lead to low back pain, and this pain limits the range of
motion and prevents the proper exertion of muscular strength. Generally, low back pain
patients reduce their physical activity to avoid the pain caused during the performance of
their daily routine activities<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, leading
to a vicious circle of relapse and chronicization of low back pain, which in turn reduces
aerobic exercise capacity (cardiorespiratory fitness)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reduction of activities of daily living (ADL) after the
occurrence of low back pain causes sarcopenia and reduces muscular strength, muscular
endurance, and cardiopulmonary function, leading to an increase in the likelihood of
development of metabolic risk factors<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, performing aerobic exercise to improve low back extensor strength is important.
In this study, additional treadmill exercise was conducted by patients performing a low back
pain rehabilitation program for 8 weeks to determine if the addition of this exercise was
effective.</p><p>In this study, changes in low back extensor strength showed a significant interaction
effect by angle at 12&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0;, and 36&#x000b0;, which was considered to be the effect of the treadmill
exercise conducted under the supervision of experts who ensured that the patients performed
the exercise with their backs straight and made initial contact with their heel. In other
words, low back extensors are activated and muscular strength increases by walking properly
and improving lordosis; these findings are attributed to the effect of training the
supporting muscles involved in the angle changes of extensors often used in the lumbar
region when performing walking exercises.</p><p>Kankaanp&#x000e4;&#x000e4; et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the low
back extensors of chronic low back pain patients were weak and got easily tired as compared
with those of normal people. Lamoth et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that walking training should be considered in
rehabilitation programs for chronic low back pain patients, since the stability between
their lumbar sections was low and the coordination between the low back extensors was poor.
From a rehabilitative perspective, it can be said that walking programs are helpful for
simultaneously stabilizing the trunk and controlling the motion of the limbs by
strengthening the waist muscles and abdominal muscles supporting the spine.</p><p>In this study, the VAS and Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire scores of the
experimental group showed no interaction effect of the additional treadmill exercise as
compared with those of the control group. Tritilanunt et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> found that chronic low back pain patients that performed an aerobic
exercise program for 3 months showed a significantly reduced pain index compared with those
who performed only lumbar flexion exercise. Also, Chatzitheodorou et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> found that chronic low back pain patients
that performed high-intensity aerobic exercise for 12 weeks showed significantly reduced
pain, dysfunction, and psychological burdens compared with those who received only
conservative physical therapy. However, Chan et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> found that aerobic exercise combined with an 8-week physical
therapy had no additional effect on the alleviation of pain and dysfunction, similar to the
findings of this study. The lack of an additional effect of treadmill exercise in this study
is attributed to the fact that both groups underwent back mobilization, performed abdominal
stabilization exercise, and received back care advice based on ergonomic principles in
addition to traditional physical therapy. However, as many studies have reported an
additional effect of aerobic exercise, further systematic long-term studies with many
subjects are required to confirm the findings of the present study.</p><p>Considering all the outcomes of this study, the changes in low back extensor strength by
angle showed an additional effect of treadmill exercise at 12&#x000b0;, 24&#x000b0;, and 36&#x000b0;, and pain level
and dysfunction index showed a decreasing trend after the experiment in both groups, with no
significant difference between groups. It is thought that treadmill exercise combined with
traditional physical therapy has a partial effect on improvement of low back extensor
strength.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The evaluation of chronic low back pain by determining the
