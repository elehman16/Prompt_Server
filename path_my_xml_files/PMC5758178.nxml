Reportedly, the global prevalence of KS ranges between 10% and 15% worldwide.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> It has been reported that about 13% of men and 7% of women in the United States will develop KS during their lifetime.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Notably, an amount &#x0003e;$2 billion is expended annually on the treatment of this condition.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In China, its prevalence in survey studies varied from 1.61% to 20.45%.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup></p><p>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PN), an important treatment strategy for the management of large, complex KS<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> is widely accepted as a safe and cost-effective intervention because of its high success rate and low morbidity.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> A PN can be performed using several positions including the prone, flank, supine, and its modified position.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> To date, fluoroscopic-guided PN (FGPN) is a very popular treatment in patients with KS. However, adverse effects associated with the procedure limit its usefulness. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the efficacy of ultrasound-guided PN (UGPN) as an alternative method to treat KS and simultaneously minimize hazards of radiation exposure among the surgical team.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of UGPN in Chinese patients with KS in complete supine position. We hypothesized that UGPN would be superior to FGPN in terms of efficacy in the management of KS.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of Daqing Oilfield General Hospital. It was operated at this hospital from January 2015 and April 2017. Eighty-six eligible patients with KS were randomly assigned to receive either UGPN or FGPN at a 1:1 allocation ratio.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Our study included men and women with KS, aged 18 to 70 years. All patients were required to meet the diagnostic criteria for KS. Additionally, it was necessary that the KS should measure at least 2&#x0200a;cm in diameter, and these KS presented as the diverticular, pelvic, staghorn, middle, and lower caliceal stones with hydronephrosis. Exclusion criteria were pregnant women or those who were breastfeeding, presence of renal and urinary tract anomalies, multiple KS in complete staghorn and upper caliceal stones without hydronephrosis.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Randomization schedule was conducted by a statistician using the SAS software (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). The stratified block randomization method was used for the randomized numbers. All patients, outcome assessors, and data analysts were masked to the allocation assignment.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>All patients were recruited from Daqing Oilfield General Hospital. After clinical assessment, 86 patients who qualified for inclusion in the study were equally allocated to either the UGPN or the control group. All researchers had been trained regarding the administration of the intervention before the study initiation. All patients were subsequently informed about the research and provided signed informed consent before the study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Intervention</title><p>Before this study, we had experience of successfully conducting 41 patients with KS by UGPN, and 36 patients with KS by FGPN. Thus, it is easy for operators to find the correct route to the site of stone by using both ultrasound and fluoroscopy. The procedure was performed in a complete supine position in all patients from both groups. In the UGPN group, ultrasonography was performed using a 3.5-MHz transducer to identify the location of the kidneys, KS, and urinary tract dilation and to check for residual stones at the end of surgery. Caliceal puncture was performed using an 18-gauge access needle that was attached to the side of the ultrasound probe. This was passed into the appropriate calix through the fornix. After successful puncture of the caliceal system, a 0.035-in. J-tipped guidewire was introduced into the targeted calix. Under the ultrasonographic guidance, a 30&#x0200a;F Amplatz sheath was passed into the target calix after dilation of the nephrostomy tract using a one-shot 28 or 30&#x0200a;F Amplatz dilator. An FGPN was performed in patients belonging to the control group. Contrast material was injected through the ureteral catheter after ureteral catheterization, and an 18-gauge needle was passed under fluoroscopic guidance. All procedures such as guidewire insertion, nephrostomy tract dilation, Amplatz insertion, and stone removal were similar to the procedures performed on patients belonging to the UGPN group, except that all those operations were performed under fluoroscopic guidance.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary outcome was the stone-free rate, which was determined using abdominal radiography and renal ultrasonographic evaluation performed a month after the treatment. The success rate was defined as KS &#x02264;3.5&#x0200a;mm in stone-free patients and in those with residual stones. The secondary outcomes were complication rates, operative time, and length of hospitalization.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the outcome data were analyzed by the SAS software (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Inc.) using the intention-to-treat approach.

Therefore, the required sample size of this study was estimated to be 86 patients, each group 43 patients.

We included 86 patients with KS who were eligible for inclusion in our study. These patients were randomly assigned equally to 2 groups and underwent UGPN or FGPN. We utilized the stone-free rate as the primary outcome, and complication rates, operative time, and length of hospitalization as the secondary outcomes to assess the efficacy of the UGPN procedure. The results of our study did not confirm our hypothesis that UGPN resulted in better treatment outcomes than the FGPN procedure in treating patients with KS. Our results showed that UGPN did not demonstrate greater efficacy in terms of stone-free rate, complication rates, operative time, and length of hospitalization than that observed with the use of FGPN.</p><p>Limitations of our study: Our study was performed at a single center and included a relatively small sample size, which could have affected our results. Our study only included a 1-month follow-up, which is a relatively short-term follow-up to conclusively validate our findings.
