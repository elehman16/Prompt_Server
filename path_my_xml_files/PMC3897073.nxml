It is typically diagnosed in the adolescent years of the patient and attains its most severe state between the ages of 20 and 40. If afflicting both eyes, the deterioration in vision can affect the ability of the patient to drive a car or read normal print.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The incidence of keratoconus is reported to be 1 in 2,000 in the general population;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] reported rates vary with the criteria used for diagnosis. Although usually a progressive disease, recent data suggests that it stabilizes after time in most patients, and that treatment with rigid contact lenses is successful for many; 10 to 20% of keratoconus patients in the United States eventually receive corneal transplants to restore their vision.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Corneal cross-linking (CXL) treatment of keratoconus was first introduced by Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>. in 2003.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Corneal collagen cross-linking with riboflavin, also known as CXL, CCR, CCL, and KXL, involves a one-time application of riboflavin solution to the eye that is activated by illumination with ultraviolet A (UVA) light for approximately 30 minutes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The riboflavin causes new bonds to form across adjacent collagen strands in the stromal layer of the cornea, which recovers and preserves some of the mechanical strength of the cornea. The corneal epithelial layer is generally removed to increase penetration of the riboflavin into the stroma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] CXL increases the resistance to the digestion of pepsin by enhancing corneal anticollagenase activity, and induces a thicker diameter of collagen fiber.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Confocal microscopy studies have also shown apoptosis of keratocytes in the anterior and intermediate stroma followed by a gradual keratocyte repopulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>We performed this study because of the small number of studies on the treatment of Iranian patients with CXL method and the unknown impact of this procedure on the cornea of Iranian patients with keratoconus.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate topographic corneal changes one year after CXL in patients with corneal keratoconus at Feiz Hospital of Isfahan, 12 months after treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Randomized clinical trial and study criteria</title><p>In this prospective study, 66 patients with progression of keratoconus during one year were enrolled at Feiz University Referral Eye Center in Isfahan from December 2010 to December 2011.

Riboflavin 0.1% (Medio-Haus Medizinprodukte GmbH, Neudorf, Germany) solution was instilled in the eye every three minutes for 30 minutes. Then, examination under slit lamp was performed for ensuring penetration of riboflavin into the cornea.</p><p>After this procedure, cornea UVA irradiation was performed with a UV-X device (IROC Innocross, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland). The device was set at a safe working distance of 5 cm from the corneal surface with a medium-sized UV ray aperture at a wavelength of 370 nm. Irradiation was performed for 30 minutes and along with this procedure, riboflavin 0.1% solution was instilled every three minutes.</p><p>After treatment, the patient received topical ciprofloxacin 0.30% and betamethasone 0.1% with an extended-wear night and day bandage contact lens for seven days.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Postoperative management</title><p>All patients were given topical ciprofloxacin 0.30% and betamethasone (four times a day) for seven days.

In keratoconus patients, drops containing riboflavin, a B-complex vitamin, are applied to the cornea which is then exposed to UVA light; this stimulates collagen fibers to connect to one another or cross-link. Collagen is the primary protein constituent of the connective tissues of the body. The procedure helps restore appropriate curvature and structure to the cornea, and makes it possible for most patients, who need them, to wear rigid contact lenses again.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>CXL is a new treatment for patients with keratoconus;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] so, response to treatment maybe different among different racial and ethnic groups. In this research, we survey topographic corneal changes one year after CXL in Iranian patients with corneal keratoconus in Isfahan.</p><p>Kohlhaas and colleagues, in an animal study, showed a significant increase in corneal rigidity of porcine and rabbit corneas after corneal cross-linking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Studies on humans with keratoconus have demonstrated satisfactory short-term and long-term findings with substantial topographic and refractive improvement following treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] A considerable decline in topographic parameters such as keratometry, apical gradient curvature, inferior-superior index, cone area, and corneal aberrations after CXL has been reported.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Greenstein and colleagues showed changes in corneal thickness one year after CXL for keratoconus and corneal ectasia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Our study, like other previous studies shows that CXL with riboflavin is effective in halting the progression of keratoconus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] For example, our study showed that the mean of preoperative posterior best-fit sphere (BFS) was 6.33 &#x000b1; 0.35mm (range: 5.51 to 7.73 mm) before operation and that it improved to 6.28 &#x000b1; 0.34 mm (range: 4.36 to 6.13 mm) after operation; the difference was significant. Our results are similar to the research of Saffarian and colleagues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The study mentioned was also done on the Iranian population in 2010. This study showed a statistically significant decrease in cylindrical power (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and decline of &#x02212;0.18 &#x000b1; 0.79 diopter (D) in spherical power (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>In 2008, Raiskup-Wolf <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] described what remains the largest published series comprising 241 eyes followed in Dresden for up to six years after cross-linking. This uncontrolled, retrospective study confirmed earlier findings with statistically significant improvements in astigmatism, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and maximum simulated keratometry values (Kmax) at 12 months. Flattening was observed in 54% of eyes with a mean change in Kmax of -1.91 D (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). The effects of cross-linking were maintained over the duration of follow-up with progression of the disease documented in only two patients (which responded to retreatment). Subsequent published reports from several other centers have described similar results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Our study showed that the mean baseline corneal pachymetry was 459.17 &#x000b1; 45.92 &#x003bc;m (range: 311 to 576 &#x003bc;m). One year postoperatively, the mean corneal thickness decreased significantly to 446.05 &#x000b1; 59.63 &#x003bc;m (range: 309 to 560 &#x003bc;m) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013).</p><p>Saffarian and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported that the mean baseline corneal pachymetry was 460.68 &#x000b1; 46.59 &#x003bc;m (range: 400 to 576 &#x003bc;m). One year postoperatively, the mean corneal thickness decreased significantly to 445.07 &#x000b1; 41.57 &#x003bc;m (range: 395 to 570 &#x003bc;m) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Their results are similar to our study.</p><p>Caporossi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] illustrated that the mean spherical equivalent (SE) declined 2.5 D, postoperatively. These results were topographically confirmed by a reduction in mean keratometry. In our study, the mean preoperative SE was &#x02212;4.64 &#x000b1; 2.56 D and the mean postoperative SE was &#x02212;4.02 &#x000b1; 2.93 D. Our study also demonstrated a mean difference of 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.37 D significantly (<italic>P</italic> = 0.006).</p><p>Koller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] found a significant improvement in four of seven Pentacam topography indices (central keratoconus index, keratoconus index, index of height asymmetry, minimum radius of curvature) one year after CXL. In this study, we also found an improvement in the mean baseline corneal pachymetry, including the mean corneal thickness, as in the Koller study. Thus, although the two studies found an improvement in topography after CXL, it is unclear why some of the improvements were in different topography indices.</p><p>Wollensak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] reported that the riboflavin/UVA treatment leads to a dose-dependent keratocyte damage that can be expected in human corneas down to a depth of 300 &#x003bc;m using a surface UVA dose of 5.4 J/cm2. They reported that a standard surface UVA dose of 3 mW/cm has a toxic effect on the endothelial cells of corneas thinner than 400 &#x003bc;m. But in our study, we had no significant adverse effects among the patients with corneas thinner than 400 &#x003bc;m. Similarly, studies with more than 400 &#x003bc;m pachymetry subjects had no significant adverse effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>CXL has some benefits compared with other methods of keratoconus treatment. There are no cuts in the body of the cornea. It is much safer than a corneal graft which was very successful in the past, and than even a gas-permeable contact lens, and also there is no chance of rejection (some grafts tend to last around 10-15 years). The transplant carries risks such as infection, rejection, cataracts, glaucoma, and astigmatism. At 15 years, there is no difference in the survival rate between penetrating corneal transplants performed for keratoconus and those performed for all other indications. Young keratoconus patients are likely to need one or more repeated grafts during their lifetime. Cross-linking avoids the removal of any corneal structural tissue (only the surface epithelial cells are removed and these grow back mostly within two days).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, our study showed a significant improvement in topographic corneal changes and refractive results in patients with corneal ectasia after CXL. These results can illustrate the efficacy and usage of CXL for keratoconus among Iranian patients. However, there are still few clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of CXL in the Iranian population, and future studies are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
