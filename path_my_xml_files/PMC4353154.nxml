D&#x00026;E is a commonly performed daycare procedure in obstetrics. Due to requirement for an early discharge, this procedure requires an anaesthetic technique that can provide rapid recovery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, like any other surgical procedure, D&#x00026;E involve pain, and therefore pain control measures have to be undertaken. Many patients still find this surgical procedure extremely uncomfortable; 78-97% report at least moderate procedural pain[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] therefore, optimizing pain control should be a goal in every procedure.</p><p>Short acting narcotic analgesics are commonly used for intraoperative and postoperative pain relief in day care procedures. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, which is highly lipid-soluble and rapidly acting drug. Its onset of action is 2 min and duration of action is 30-60 min. Its adverse effects are respiratory depression, pruritus, skeletal and thoracic muscles rigidity, etc.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] may delay discharge especially in day care surgeries. It is also not freely available in our country.</p><p>Paracetamol is used as a nonopioid analgesic.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It is an effective and safe drug for managing mild to moderate pain. It rapidly passes through blood-brain barrier, reaches a high concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid and has an antinociceptive effect mediated by the central nervous system.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Injectable paracetamol was introduced for intravenous (IV) use in 2002, which provides the onset of pain relief within 5-10 min following administration. The peak analgesic effect is achieved in 1-h and the duration of this effect lasts 4-6 h.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] It is devoid of any major adverse effects like respiratory and circulatory depression and has no sedative effect making it ideal for day care procedure with mild to moderate pain. The hypothesis is that IV paracetamol is comparable with fentanyl for pain relief in D&#x00026;E procedures. The objective of this study was to compare IV paracetamol with fentanyl for intra- and post-operative pain relief in dilation and curettage procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After approval from departmental research and hospital Ethical Review Committee (2159-Ane-ERC-12) written informed consent was taken from all patients participated in the study. The study was conducted from March 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013. Sixty adult American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I-II female patients aged &#x0003e;18 years who underwent elective D&#x00026;E procedure requiring general anesthesia were enrolled. Gestational age more than 12 weeks, hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs, anticipated difficult airway, morbid obesity, inadequate fasting, or hepatic disorders were excluded.</p><p>Each patient fulfilling the inclusion criteria was explained about study purpose and numerical rating scale by primary investigator in the wards/surgical day care unit. All patients were randomly allocated in two groups (30 each) by sealed envelope technique. The envelopes were prepared using a computer generated randomization table. The patients were explained in the ward about study purpose and assessment of pain by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) on 0-10 scales. The interpretation of pain scores was assessed as follows: 0 - no pain, 1-4 mild, 5-7 moderate and 8-10 - severe. All patients had received oral midazolam 7.5 mg as a premedication 30 min before procedure in the ward. Group <italic>P</italic> had received IV paracetamol 15 mg/kg in the preoperative area 15 min before the start of surgical procedure. Patients in Group F were given IV fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg at induction of anesthesia.</p><p>The conduct and technique of general anesthesia was same for both groups. After application of standard monitoring (noninvasive blood pressure [NIBP], electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry) (SpO<sub>2</sub>), patients were preoxygenated for 3 min. IV propofol 2 mg/kg was used for induction of anesthesia. After loss of consciousness, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) was inserted. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane 1.5% in oxygen and nitrous oxide (40:60). NIBP which includes systolic, mean and diastolic pressures, heart rate, pulse oximetry, respiratory rate, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> were recorded. These readings were observed by one of the study author every 3 min from start of surgical procedure until the end. Inadequate pain control during the surgical procedure was assumed if heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory rate are increased 20% above the baseline, which was regarded as preinduction time period. The rescue analgesia consisting of fentanyl was administered in 25 &#x003bc;g increments in the intraoperative period for both groups.</p><p>At completion of surgery, patients were allowed to regain consciousness and LMA was removed when patients responded to verbal commands and thereafter transferred to the recovery room. Same study author who recorded intraoperative observations visited the patients in the recovery room and observe pain scores on a numerical rating scale at 5, 15, and 30 min intervals after surgery. If pain score was greater than 3 according to numerical rating scale, rescue analgesia with fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g in increments was administered. The total dose of rescue analgesia used was also being recorded.</p><p>All statistical analysis was performed using statistical packages for social science version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Quantitative data were presented as mean and standard deviation and analyzed by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, while qualitative data were presented as frequency and percentage and analyzed by Chi-square test. We took percentage change (PC) in mean hemodynamics (heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure) ranges from baseline to 20% and percentage change in variation (CV) of hemodynamics ranges from baseline to 15%.

With a good analgesic treatment plan, the anxiety, morbidity, cost and length of hospital stay in the postoperative period are reduced. D&#x00026;E is a brief procedure, but it is associated with mild to moderate pain.</p><p>Short-acting narcotics are commonly used for perioperative pain relief in brief surgical procedures as these drugs provides good analgesia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, resource variability is a major problem in developing countries, and working conditions may vary from excellent to poor. One of the working challenges in these places is the nonavailability or sudden shortages of opioids/narcotic drugs forcing anesthetist to look for safe alternatives. Fentanyl unlike other opioids has fewer side-effects, but still can cause dose-dependent respiratory depression, which may contribute in delayed awakening, bradycardia, and hypotension, etc.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These effects can delay discharge in day care procedures.</p><p>Paracetamol is a safe and effective analgesic agent for mild-tomoderate pain. The IV form of this agent has the theoretical advantage of greater predictability and acceptability compared with oral or rectal routes of delivery. It passes easily through the blood-brain barrier and shows its central analgesic effects within 15-20 min, which starts to decline after 4-h of administration. It is preferred in most surgical patients because it is does not affect mental status, bleeding, respiratory drive, gastric mucosa integrity, or renal function.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] We undertook this prospective randomized study to examine IV paracetamol as a suitable alternative to fentanyl for perioperative pain relief in dilation and curettage procedures.</p><p>Sinatra <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared IV paracetamol with placebo after major orthopedic surgery. They found that IV paracetamol administered over a 24-h period in patients with moderate to severe pain after orthopedic surgery provided rapid and effective analgesia and was well-tolerated. A study in patients undergoing lower segment cesarean section, in which IV paracetamol was compared with oral Ibuprofen, as the analgesic supplementation agent to morphine, indicated that patients in IV paracetamol had better pain control compared to ibuprofen group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Tsang <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] did a study to see the opioids sparing effects of paracetamol in preoperative hip fracture patients, and they found that IV paracetamol had a significant opioid-sparing effect and satisfactory pain relief in preoperative hip fracture patients.</p><p>A randomized, double-blind study had compared IV paracetamol and IV morphine for acute limb trauma in an urban United Kingdom emergency department. Approximately, half in each group had a fracture, and the other half had soft tissue trauma. They received either 1000 mg IV paracetamol or 10 mg IV morphine. The outcome measures were: Pain score measured on a visual analog scale; requirement for rescue analgesia; and frequency of adverse reactions. There was no significant difference in the rescue medication, but there were significantly more adverse reactions in the morphine group. There were no significant differences between the groups in mean pain score and patient satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>There was another randomized study of 84 patients undergoing out-patient knee arthroscopy comparing pain score and adverse reactions between 1000 mg IV paracetamol and IV morphine (0.1 mg/kg) given prior to awakening from general anesthesia. There was no difference in pain scores between those patients given the 2 medications, but there were more adverse reactions, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, in the patients who received morphine. This study has important implications for discharge time from out-patient surgery centers.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Our study did not indicate any statistically significant difference between the IV paracetamol and IV fentanyl groups in pain scores. Neither did we note any significant difference in physiological parameters and side-effect profiles clinically between the two groups. Limitations of our study were small sample size, lack of the placebo arm, single-blinded nature and short follow-up duration. All of these could have improved the results of our study, but due to technical reasons and limited availability it was not possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"
