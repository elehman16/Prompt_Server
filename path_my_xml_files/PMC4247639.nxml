Although 10% to 16% of people aged 65&#x000a0;years and over are likely to experience depressive symptoms, the condition is under-diagnosed and often inadequately treated in primary care. Later-life depression is associated with chronic illness and disability, cognitive impairment and social isolation. With a progressively ageing population it becomes increasingly important to refine strategies to identity and manage depression in older people. Currently, management may be limited to the prescription of antidepressants where there may be poor concordance; older people may lack awareness of psychosocial interventions and general practitioners may neglect to offer this treatment option.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>CASPER Plus is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care intervention for individuals aged 65&#x000a0;years and over experiencing moderate to severe depression. Selected practices in the North of England identify potentially eligible patients and invite them to participate in the study. A diagnostic interview is carried out and participants with major depressive disorder are randomised to either collaborative care or usual care. The recruitment target is 450 participants.</p><p>The intervention, behavioural activation and medication management in a collaborative care framework, has been adapted to meet the complex needs of older people. It is delivered over eight to 10 weekly sessions by a case manager liaising with general practitioners.</p><p>The trial aims to evaluate the clinical and cost effectiveness of collaborative care in addition to usual GP care versus usual GP care alone. The primary clinical outcome, depression severity, will be measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) at baseline, 4, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months. Cost effectiveness analysis will assess health-related quality of life using the SF-12 and EQ-5D and will examine cost-consequences of collaborative care.</p><p>A qualitative process evaluation will be undertaken to explore acceptability, gauge the extent to which the intervention is implemented and to explore sustainability beyond the clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Results will add to existing evidence and a positive outcome may lead to the commissioning of this model of service in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN45842879">ISRCTN45842879</ext-link> (24 July 2012).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Depression</kwd><kwd>Major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>Older people</kwd><kwd>Elderly population</kwd><kwd>Primary care</kwd><kwd>Collaborative care</kwd><kwd>Behavioural activation</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial interventions</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Cost effectiveness analysis</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Problem to be addressed</title><p>Depression accounts for the greatest burden of disease among all mental health problems and is expected to become the second-highest of all general health problems by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Depression is common among older people and people with co-morbid chronic medical conditions and cognitive impairment, and can result in poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although 10% to 16% of people aged over 65&#x000a0;years may experience depressive symptoms, with 2% to 4% meeting formal diagnostic criteria for moderate to severe depression, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] the condition is under-diagnosed and often inadequately treated in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Older people with a long-term condition are five times more likely to suffer depression. For example, 50% of people with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease will suffer depression, 25% following stroke and 20% with coronary heart disease, 24% with neurological disease and 42% with chronic lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Beyond personal suffering and family disruption, depression worsens the outcomes of many medical disorders and promotes disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>The impairments in quality of life associated with depression are comparable to those of major physical illness and among older people a clinical diagnosis of major depression is the strongest predictor for impaired quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Demographic projections indicate a growing ageing population which calls for effective strategies to specifically tackle depression in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, an important factor noted by current and previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] is the complex nature of identifying and treating depression in an ageing population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The need for a trial</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Management of depression in older people</title><p>The vast majority of depression in older people can be managed entirely in primary care, without recourse to specialist mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A range of individual treatments has been shown to be effective in older people, including anti-depressants and psychosocial interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], but a repeated observation among all trials of people with depression has been the failure to integrate these effective elements of care into routine primary care services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Current NICE guidelines recommend a stepped care framework for the management of depression. Essentially, in stepped care, the &#x02018;least intrusive, most effective intervention&#x02019; is provided first; if this is not beneficial, or if it is declined, patients should be offered an intervention from the next step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>However, in the UK, depression in older people is under-diagnosed and under-treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Even when recognised, the provision of psychosocial interventions for this age group is inadequate. For example, there has been minimal provision of psychological treatment for older people under the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite GPs being encouraged through the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) to case-find for depression in older people, there is little evidence that this has translated into better management or identification for this disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This indicator in the QOF framework has now been removed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Collaborative care for older adults</title><p>Collaborative care is a complex intervention delivered in primary care, based on chronic disease management models used for conditions including diabetes. This model of care, also referred to as case management, facilitates the delivery of effective forms of treatment (such as pharmacotherapy and/or brief psychological therapy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A widely-accepted definition established by Gunn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] states that collaborative care incorporates four related criteria: a multi-professional approach to patient care; a structured management plan; scheduled patient follow-ups; and enhanced communication between professionals.</p><p>There is evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative care with behavioural activation in improving treatment of depression for adults over 60 in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and a US systematic review of 37 randomised trials comparing collaborative care interventions with usual care reported significant improvements of the quality of depression care and patient outcomes, lasting up to 2 to 5&#x000a0;years, along with increased medication adherence and improved satisfaction among patients and primary care physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, the transferability of this model of care to the UK NHS cannot be assumed and requires independent evaluation.</p><p>Until recently, there has been limited evidence of the effectiveness of collaborative care for depression in the UK. In 2013 a UK trial of collaborative care for a general adult population (CADET) reported evidence of persistent positive effects on symptoms of moderate to severe depression among adults aged 18&#x000a0;years and over, up to 12&#x000a0;months after the start of the intervention. However, this trial did not collect specific data on older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CASPER Plus trial intervention has been developed specifically for older people and, by increasing follow up to 18&#x000a0;months, aims to extend the evidence base for this population.</p><p>Despite recent investment under the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) initiative, the capacity for specialist mental health services to provide collaborative care is constrained and demand would quite quickly outstrip supply. Hence any feasible strategy will be both low intensity and offered within primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The ubiquity of depression in primary care settings and the poor integration and/or co-ordination of care have led to strategies to re-engineer the delivery of care.</p><p>In a <italic>BMJ</italic> editorial (2004) on the management of depression in older people Chew-Graham notes &#x02018;Innovations in the management of depression have been evaluated. The best results come from models that use multifaceted interventions and principles of collaborative care&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In our own trials of collaborative care in working age adults, we have shown positive outcomes through the combination of medication management and a low intensity psychological intervention, &#x02018;behavioural activation&#x02019; (BA), which can be readily delivered in eight to 10 sessions by a trained case manager either over the phone or face to face for those who have difficulty using or accessing phone-based therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Briefly, behavioural activation focuses on the behavioural deficits common among those with depression, it reintroduces positive reinforcement and reduces avoidance. The effectiveness of BA is now well demonstrated in trials and has been shown to be at least as effective as more complex forms of psychological intervention such as cognitive behavioural therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several trials have shown positive results in older adult populations and the focus on self-enhancement and physical activity is especially relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>The CASPER plus trial</title><p>CASPER Plus is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial of a collaborative care intervention for individuals aged 65&#x000a0;years and over experiencing moderate to severe depression.

This experimental intervention is a bespoke collaborative care designed and delivered specifically for those aged 65&#x000a0;years or over with above threshold, case-level depression over eight to 10 weekly sessions. Participants randomised to the intervention group will be contacted by the allocated case manager to arrange their first session face to face.</p><p>Collaborative care will be delivered by a case manager (CM: a primary care mental health worker) within a &#x02018;stepped care framework&#x02019;&#x02009;, such that those whose depression deteriorates are &#x02018;stepped up&#x02019; from low intensity care to a more intensive form of management including medication monitoring. This will be delivered according to an established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The five core components of the intervention are described below:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Patient-centred assessment and engagement: patients are usually first assessed in their own residential setting. The severity of depression and associated behavioural and social deficits are assessed. The presence of depressive symptoms and behavioural deficits are described and patient information materials are given.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Symptom measurement and monitoring: a standardised assessment of symptom severity is made by symptom tracking (to judge response, failure to respond or deterioration) using the GDS-15, a reliable and valid measure for depressive symptom severity in older adults, which is then carried out at all subsequent patient contacts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Medication management: the prescription of anti-depressant medication is entirely at the discretion of the general practitioner. We will encourage GPs to consider NICE guidance in their prescribing decisions. The concordant use of medication by patients will be encouraged by the case manager if a prescription has been initiated by the GP. Patient concerns (such as &#x02018;addiction&#x02019;) and non-compliance will be explored and addressed during sessions. There will be active liaison with GPs to encourage follow-up patient appointments with the GP if poor adherence is noted by the CM.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Active follow-up: all patients are proactively followed up by the CM for 8&#x000a0;weeks using face-to-face meetings or telephone contacts. Our own experience is that telephone contacts are acceptable and that patients can be engaged using this means of communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We have adapted this means of delivery to the specific needs of people aged 65&#x000a0;years and over.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Delivery of Behavioural Activation (BA): patients are offered the option of BA delivered over eight sessions by their case manager. BA consists of a structured programme of reducing the frequency of negatively reinforced avoidant behaviours in parallel with increasing the frequency of positively reinforcing behaviours to improve functioning and raise mood. During this time patients will remain under the medical care of their general practitioner. We have demonstrated that BA is potentially effective in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and have recently demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in working age adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Following completion of the intervention, the participant is offered a final contact 6&#x000a0;weeks later. This enables the participant to consolidate new information learned and reflect on any behavioural changes made. If during treatment it becomes apparent that symptoms are not improving the case manager and participant will collaboratively discuss options for further treatment. This may require referral back to the GP for possible medication review or prescription or stepping up into the local Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) service for interventions such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or Counselling.</p></list-item></list></p><p>As part of collaborative care the GP is informed routinely by letter at the beginning, mid-point and end of the participant&#x02019;s progress. If the CM is concerned about the participant&#x02019;s mental wellbeing it may be necessary, with the participant&#x02019;s consent, to contact their GP to discuss these concerns. The only time consent may not be required is if the participant&#x02019;s life is at risk, from themselves or others.</p><p>The additional elements of collaborative care include: telephone support; symptom monitoring and active surveillance (facilitated by a computerised case management system PC-MIS); medication monitoring and a low intensity psychosocial intervention (behavioural activation). PC-MIS is a web-based management information system developed collaboratively by the Department of Health Sciences Mental Health Research group and Health Sciences IT Services, with the specific purpose of managing high-volume mental health patients, through stepped care. It allows assigned clinicians and supervisors to access participant details and their current treatments, thereby improving clinical and information governance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Intervention manual</title><p>All CMs follow the guidance of a detailed intervention manual, thereby optimising consistency across all the sites. The work of CMs is overseen by an older persons&#x02019; mental health specialist (old age psychiatrist or psychologist). This is made possible by each CM being assigned a supervisor from the principle site (University of York) who has completed the IAPT Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner supervisor course.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Usual care group</title><p>Participants allocated to the usual care group will receive usual primary care management of case level depression offered by their GP, including the prescription of any necessary medication. Participation in the trial will therefore not affect medication prescribing, which will remain entirely in the control of GPs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Case manager training</title><p>All CMs will participate in a comprehensive 3-day training programme delivered by supervisors at the University of York. This includes training on the use of the study specific manual, procedures, behavioural theories underpinning BA, medication management and specific training on working with older adults. This in-depth training aims to ensure adherence and fidelity to the model. We will not formally assess adherence and competence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In line with the IMPACT US trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and the point estimate from our UK pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a standard effect size of 0.35 is sought as a conservative estimate of the detectable difference in mean PHQ-9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] depression severity scores between collaborative care and usual care. This difference equates to approximately 1.4 PHQ-9 score points (assumed SD = 4.1). In order to detect such a difference with 80% power at the 5% two-sided significance level, assuming an ICC of 0.02 (case load size of 20) and 20% loss to follow-up, the sample size needed will be 450 (225 in each group).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Data collection will occur at six time points: at invitation, baseline (pre-randomisation/pre-assessment), diagnostic interview for participants entering the trial, at 4&#x000a0;months, 12&#x000a0;months and 18&#x000a0;months post randomisation/assessment. Additionally, primary care sources will be checked for medication prescribing during the participant&#x02019;s time in the trial. Postal questionnaires will be used for data collection at baseline, 4-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure is mean depression severity at 4&#x000a0;months by self-report using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) on a continuous scale. We will also measure outcome at 12 and 18&#x000a0;months using the PHQ-9 to examine any sustained impact of the intervention.</p><p>Secondary outcomes include the SF-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and GAD-7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] at 4, 12 and 18&#x000a0;months. We will also collect data on somatic symptom severity using the PHQ-15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], participant resilience using the CD-RISC2 and cost effectiveness including the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], prescribed medication and health and social care use. Resource utilisation and cost data will be collected to fully reflect the management of depression and the consequential &#x02018;total healthcare costs&#x02019; for individuals in both collaborative care and usual care groups, and these will be analysed within a societal perspective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="Sec27"><title>Statistical analysis of clinical data</title><p>We will analyse the data on an &#x02018;intention-to-treat&#x02019; basis. The primary outcome of depression severity is the continuous PHQ-9 depression score. Data will be analysed by a mixed effects model to compare collaborative care with usual care over all follow-up time points. The analysis will be adjusted for baseline depression severity (PHQ-9 score) and physical functional limitations (SF-12 physical component score). Estimates of the mean difference between randomised groups at 4&#x000a0;months follow-up will constitute the primary end point and will be presented with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis will include all patients with valid PHQ-9 scores at any follow-up time point and complete covariate data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>The number of non-responders will be calculated for each treatment group and response rates compared. We will undertake a secondary analysis to explore the impact of missing data by including predictors of non-response as covariates in the primary model. Analyses of secondary outcomes will be conducted using linear or logistic mixed models, depending on the outcome measure, adjusting for the same covariates as the primary analysis. Variability of within-therapist clustering will be explored by including CMs as random effects in the primary analysis. Full details will be provided in the statistical analysis plan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Analysis of economic data</title><p>Economic evaluation will take the form of within-trial cost-utility analysis to determine the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) for treatment with collaborative care against usual care in individuals with depression. Following NICE evaluation guidelines, the primary analyses will be conducted from the perspective of the UK NHS and personal and social services (PPS). The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC) will represent the probability that collaborative care is cost-effective compared to usual care for a range of maximum monetary values (ceiling ratios) that a UK decision-maker may be willing to pay for an increase in one unit of QALY. Furthermore, a net benefit analysis will be undertaken to evaluate the net monetary gain that can be achieved with implementation of collaborative care thus indicating to decision makers the value of the intervention in terms of monetary gain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>While a considerable evidence base exists for the role of collaborative care in improving treatment of depression in the USA, there is a recognised gap between demonstrated efficacy in trials and implementation in everyday practice, with particular uncertainty around whether the model will effectively translate to UK healthcare systems. The UK Medical Research Council has highlighted the need for process evaluations to understand the problems of integrating interventions into healthcare settings. A recent trial of collaborative care in the adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] highlighted organisational barriers to embedding the intervention into routine primary care. The process evaluation for CASPER Plus will add to the existing literature by including data collection from patients, as well as identifying barriers and facilitators to implementation of this model of care in the older population, who view &#x02018;depression&#x02019; very differently from the younger adult population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>We will therefore undertake a qualitative process evaluation to evaluate the extent to which the collaborative care model was delivered and received, and how it impacted on practices. The aims of the process evaluation are to explore:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Feasibility and acceptability of the collaborative care intervention as experienced by both patients and professionals (CMs and GPs).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Likely sustainability of collaborative care models of care beyond the trial.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The COREQ checklist, consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, is given in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>

Adjustments have been made in our search criteria to account for the difference in population groups, that is, older adults with major depressive disorder compared to those with sub threshold depression, and a larger invitation base will be necessary in order to meet our recruitment target. We anticipate that this study will add to the existing international knowledge base of collaborative care for depression which has not yet been explored for an older population in a UK setting. In our economic analysis we aim to provide evidence of whether this intervention for older people will be cost effective when delivered within primary care.
