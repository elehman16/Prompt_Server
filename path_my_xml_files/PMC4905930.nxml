of a traditional pedometer for improving the physical activity and weight status of
community-dwelling older adults. [Subjects and Methods] This study had a nonequivalent
pretest-posttest control group design. Ninety-seven older adults (mean age &#x000b1; SD, 60.1 &#x000b1;
5.5&#x02005;years) joined the smartphone pedometer group and underwent a 2-week walking
intervention based on a smartphone pedometer application. Fifty-four older adults (mean
age &#x000b1; SD, 65.3 &#x000b1; 8.7&#x02005;years) joined the traditional pedometer group and underwent a 2-week
walking intervention based on a traditional pedometer. The participants&#x02019; physical activity
was evaluated using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#x02013;Short Form, and
their weight status was quantified by calculating the body mass index. The daily pedometer
count was also documented. [Results] No significant time, group, or time-by-group
interaction effects were found for any of the outcome variables. However, trends of
improvement in physical activity and body mass index were seen only in the smartphone
pedometer group. [Conclusion] A smartphone pedometer application might be more favorable
than a traditional pedometer in improving physical activity and body mass index in
community-dwelling older adults. However, further experimental studies are necessary to
confirm the results.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mobile technology</kwd><kwd>Walking</kwd><kwd>Elderly</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Increased physical activity is known to be associated with a risk reduction for many
chronic illnesses such as coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, type 2 diabetes,
osteoporosis, and cancer<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For older adults, increased physical activity has
additional benefits such as a decreased fear of falling<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and can actually prevent falls<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, how can physical activity be increased? Many previous studies
have suggested the use of a pedometer as a motivational tool to increase physical activity
and improve health in both younger and older adults<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there were compliance
problems; participants would sometimes forget to put on the pedometer, which is an
additional piece of equipment, at the beginning of the day, and the pedometer would
sometimes fall off and become lost when the participant undressed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, new
motivational tools or instruments that can be incorporated into daily use (e.g., smartphone
applications) have been developed to enhance adults&#x02019; physical activity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The number of smartphone users has increased dramatically in recent years. Approximately
63.5% of the world&#x02019;s population used smartphones in 2014, according to statistics from
eMarketer<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Smartphone applications
have become part of our daily lives. Despite the many types of physical harm (e.g., neck
pain, muscle fatigue in the upper trapezius, and carpal tunnel changes) associated with the
overuse or misuse of smartphones and their applications<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, this technology could be useful in promoting healthy active
lifestyles if used correctly<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, a simple smartphone pedometer application can raise
awareness about physical activity and increase the amount of walking during adults&#x02019; normal
everyday activities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can induce
positive behavioral changes in habitual physical activity and thus improve health<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In addition, the evidence of a cascade effect involving the families and communities of the
users of the smartphone pedometer application was noticed<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. From a practical standpoint, the use of a smartphone pedometer
application to log in physical activity requires no additional equipment; hence, people will
not forget to carry it. Most encouragingly, many smartphone pedometer applications have
attractive appearances and are free of charge.</p><p>Despite the many benefits and advantages associated with the use of smartphone pedometer
applications, no study has investigated the effectiveness of the new smartphone pedometer
technology relative to that of the traditional pedometer, in the enhancement of physical
activity and health in adults, particularly in older adults who are physically less
active<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the aim of this study
was to compare the effectiveness of a smartphone pedometer application with that of a
traditional pedometer and to assess the improvement of the habitual physical activity and
weight status of community-dwelling older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study used a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design. Eligible
participants joined either the smartphone pedometer group or the traditional pedometer group
as they wished (i.e., no randomization). In addition, the outcome assessors were not blinded
to the group assignment. Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics
Committee of the University of Hong Kong. The study was explained to each participant, and
written informed consent was obtained before data collection. All procedures were conducted
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised 1983).</p><p>Older adults were recruited from the Hong Kong Christian Service Bliss District Elderly
Community Centre and the local community, via convenience sampling. The inclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) an age of 50&#x02005;years or more, (2) the ability to ambulate independently
through indoor and outdoor environments, without the use of a walking aid, and (3) the
ability to communicate effectively with others. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
medical instability (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension), (2) a significant musculoskeletal
disorder (e.g., symptomatic arthritis), (3) a neurologic disorder (e.g., stroke), (4)
cardiopulmonary disease, and (5) cognitive impairment. In addition, all participants were
screened using the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire to ensure that they could
safely perform physical activity.</p><p>The participants in both groups were enrolled in a 2-week walking intervention in which
they were encouraged to walk to different places (e.g., market, parks, and elderly community
center) and around the neighborhood using a pedometer (either a smartphone pedometer
application or a traditional pedometer).</p><p>For the smartphone pedometer application&#x02013;based walking intervention, the research personnel
assisted the participants who joined the smartphone pedometer group to download and set up a
free pedometer application (e.g., Pedometer Lite, Pedometer++, and WalkLogger) on their
smartphones. The mobile pedometer application logged the number of steps they walked per
day. The participants were instructed to carry the same mobile phone in their pocket for two
consecutive weeks from the moment they got up to the end of the day, just before they went
to bed (except when showering). In addition, they were taught how to record and reset the
number of steps aggregated at the end of each day and document the step count in a logbook
(record form).</p><p>For traditional pedometer&#x02013;based walking intervention, the participants in the traditional
pedometer group were given a pedometer (Ariel Premium Supply, Inc., St. Louis, USA) that
registered the number of steps they took each day. They were shown how to attach the
pedometer to a belt fixed around the left iliac crest level and how to record and reset the
number of steps aggregated at the end of each day. The participants were instructed to wear
the pedometer from the moment they got up and to detach it at the end of the day, just
before they went to bed (except when showering). In addition, they were asked to document
the number of steps taken, in a logbook (record form), and to push the reset button at the
end of each day.</p><p>Data collection was performed at the Hong Kong Christian Service Bliss District Elderly
Community Centre and in the community by BSc (Exercise and Health) students from the
University of Hong Kong under the supervision of two registered physiotherapists and a
social worker. All participants were assessed twice&#x02014;1 to 2 days before the start of the
pedometer intervention (pretest) and 1 to 2 days after it ended (posttest). Demographic
information including medical history was obtained by interviewing the participants. All
participants underwent the tests mentioned bellow.</p><p>The International Physical Activity Questionnaire&#x02013;Short Form (IPAQ-SF, self-administered
version) was used to assess the habitual physical activity of the participants during the
previous 7 days. The IPAQ-SF is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring physical
activity in older adults<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants were asked to report the frequency (in
days per week) and duration (in minutes) of walking, all vigorous and moderate activities
that lasted for a minimum of 10 minutes, and the time spent on sedentary activity in the
past 7 days. The IPAQ-SF data were then converted to a metabolic equivalent score (in
MET-minutes per week), for each type of activity using the following formula: MET score of
the activity &#x000d7; minutes of activity per day &#x000d7; days per week. The MET score assigns each type
of activity a weight based on its energy expenditure, assuming 3.3 METs for walking, 4.0
METs for moderate activity, and 8.0 METs for vigorous activity. The total activity score (in
MET-minutes per week), that is, the sum of the MET scores of walking, moderate, and vigorous
activities, was used for the analysis (a primary outcome measure)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The participants&#x02019; body weight (in kilogram) and height (in centimeter) were measured in
light clothing using a bathroom scale and a cloth measuring tape, respectively. The body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height squared
(m<sup>2</sup>). This index is an important indicator of weight and health because of its
relationship to mortality in the elderly population<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and was thus used for analysis (as a primary outcome measure).</p><p>A smartphone pedometer application (smartphone pedometer group) or a traditional pedometer
(traditional pedometer group) was used to enhance the walking intervention and monitor the
daily physical activity level of each participant. Subjects were instructed to carry the
smartphone or wear the pedometer during the 2-week walking intervention period, as mentioned
above. They documented in a logbook the number of steps aggregated at the end of each
day<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The average pedometer count (in
steps per day) over the 2-week intervention period was used for analysis (a secondary
outcome measure).</p><p>Descriptive statistics (e.g., mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) were used to analyze all
demographic data and primary and secondary outcome variables. Independent t-tests (for
continuous data) and chi-square tests (for categorical data) were used to compare at
baseline, the demographic and outcome variables between the two groups. Two-way
repeated-measures analysis of covariance was conducted to compare the effects of the two
types of pedometers on each primary outcome measure. The within-subject factor was time (two
levels), and the between-subjects factor was group (two levels). The relevant demographic
and baseline variables that showed significant between-group differences were entered as
covariants in the analysis of covariance. The intention-to-treat principle (last observation
carried forward) was used to handle missing data resulting from dropouts<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, an independent t-test was
used to compare the average pedometer count between the two groups. All statistical analyses
were performed with SPSS version 20.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). The alpha level was
set at 5% (two-tailed).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>From January to April 2015, more than 160 older adults were screened by our assessors to
determine their suitability for voluntary participation in the study. Finally, 97
participants joined the smartphone pedometer group, and 54, the traditional pedometer group.
Seven participants (7.2%) in the smartphone pedometer group and five (9.3%) in the
traditional pedometer group dropped out. The reasons for attrition in the smartphone
pedometer group were an inability to commit the time (n=2) and loss to follow-up (n=5), and
the reasons in the traditional pedometer group were the loss of the pedometer (n=4) and an
inability to commit the time (n=1). Excluding the drop-out cases, the self-reported
intervention compliance rate of both groups was 100%. Incentives were given to participants
who completed the intervention successfully. No adverse events were reported during the
pedometer-based walking interventions and assessments.</p><p>The participant&#x02019;s baseline demographic characteristics are described in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smartphone pedometer group<break/>(n=97)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Traditional pedometer group<break/>(n=54)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.1 &#x000b1; 5.5*</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.3 &#x000b1; 8.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (n)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 46 male / 51 female</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 19 male / 35 female</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.0 &#x000b1; 10.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">59.5 &#x000b1; 13.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.4 &#x000b1; 9.2*</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.6 &#x000b1; 11.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; standard deviation is presented, unless specified otherwise. *p&#x0003c;0.05 compared to the traditional pedometer group.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

improved by 9.9%, and the BMI decreased by 0.7% after the smartphone pedometer&#x02013;based walking

average IPAQ-SF total activity score (by 12.4%) and a lower average BMI (by 4.7%) on the

was comparable between the two groups (p=0.159).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This pilot study showed that both the smartphone pedometer application&#x02013;based walking
intervention and the traditional pedometer&#x02013;based walking intervention were well accepted by
community-dwelling older adults. The smartphone pedometer application seemed to be more
convenient than the traditional pedometer, and the risk of losing the pedometer (smartphone)
was minimized. Although statistically insignificant, greater trends of improvement in the
primary outcome measures&#x02014;habitual physical activity and BMI&#x02014;were observed in the seniors who
used a smartphone pedometer application than in those who used a traditional pedometer.</p><p>Previous randomized controlled trials reported that the use of a smartphone-based
application can increase walking in daily life (daily step count) in older and younger
adults<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It can also motivate sedentary people to increase their physical
activity<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> and reduce the amount of time that overweight and obese individuals
spend on sedentary activities<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our
findings further show that a smartphone-based application might be even better than a
traditional pedometer in increasing habitual physical activity and decreasing BMI, possibly
because our participants used the smartphone pedometer application as part of their daily
lives and thus showed better adherence to the walking intervention<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, two recent qualitative studies have
transcribed positive experiences with smartphone applications to increased physical activity
in adults<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. These favorable experiences might also explain why both habitual
physical activity and BMI showed an apparent improvement in the smartphone pedometer group.
A summary of the users&#x02019; positive experiences is given below.</p><p>(1) The participants were surprised by their own daily step counts as registered by the
smartphone application and were keen to compare their step counts with the recommended daily
10,000-step goal.</p><p>(2) The technology made attainment of the daily 10,000-step goal more interesting and
motivating.</p><p>(3) The participants interacted with the smartphone applications, which provided live
feedback on their daily step count.</p><p>(4) Many participants had their smartphones in close proximity. The extrinsic feedback of
visualizing the step count (instant positive reinforcement) provided a sense of achievement
to the participants.</p><p>(5) The smartphone applications indirectly encouraged the participants to change their
exercise behavior (e.g., to walk around the house in times of inclement weather).</p><p>(6) The participants gained confidence and incorporated exercise (walking) into their daily
routine to fit their own lifestyle.</p><p>(7) The smartphone applications are easy to use and can be tailored to an individual and
used independently.</p><p>(8) The highly visible always-on smartphone applications made participants aware that their
steps were being tracked continually. This self-monitoring technology helped the
participants track their exercise (walking) progress and change their behavior to attain the
daily 10,000-step goal<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Not all of these perceived benefits were noted in the participants who used traditional
pedometers to increase their physical activity and reduce their BMI<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the use of a smartphone pedometer application
might be more favorable than that of a traditional pedometer in improving physical activity
and BMI in an adult population, including community-dwelling older adults.</p><p>No significant difference was found between the two groups in the secondary outcome measure
(average pedometer count over the 2-week intervention period). This result was questionable
because previous studies have reported that smartphone pedometer applications are less
accurate than traditional pedometers in counting steps<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and that the quality of the pedometer applications varies<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further studies should use validated
smartphone pedometer applications to confirm the result.</p><p>This study has several limitations; therefore, the findings should be interpreted
cautiously. First, the free pedometer applications used in this study were not standardized,
and their validity and reliability were not known. These pedometer applications may not have
been accurate, valid, or reliable in measuring step counts, especially for research
purposes<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, because the IPAQ-SF
total activity score was a self-reported measure of habitual physical activity, it may
overestimate the participants&#x02019; actual physical activity levels<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Third, women and people with lower weights may have
higher daily step counts than men and overweight individuals<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. We did not consider these two confounding factors in the study
design. Fourth, the group assignment was not randomized; some seniors who joined the
traditional pedometer group had no experience with smartphones, and those who joined the
smartphone pedometer group may have been more willing to adopt technology in their exercise
(walking) routine<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further study should
use a randomized controlled study design, include a larger sample, use a longer intervention
period and validated instruments, and include a no-intervention control group to better
explore the relative effectiveness of smartphone pedometer technology and traditional
pedometers in improving the physical activity and health of community-dwelling older
adults.</p><p>To conclude, smartphone pedometer applications might be more favorable than traditional
pedometers in improving habitual physical activity and BMI in community-dwelling older
adults. However, further experimental studies are necessary to confirm the results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the University of Hong Kong BSc (Exercise and Health) students for collecting the
