Exercise has shown to be able to counter some of these side-effects and improve physical function as well as quality of life. The primary aim of the study is to investigate and compare the effects of two different exercise regimens on the primary outcome cancer-related fatigue and the secondary outcomes muscle strength, function and structure, cardiovascular fitness, systemic inflammation, skeletal muscle gene activity, health related quality of life, pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms in women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The second aim is to examine if any effects are sustained 1, 2, and 5 years following the completion of the intervention and to monitor return to work, recurrence and survival. The third aim of the study is to examine the effect of attendance and adherence rates on the effects of the exercise programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a randomised controlled trial including 240 women with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy in Stockholm, Sweden. The participants are randomly allocated to either: group 1: Aerobic training, group 2: Combined resistance and aerobic training, or group 3: usual care (control group). During the 5-year follow-up period, participants in the exercise groups will receive a physical activity prescription.

Even less is known about the specific effects of different types of exercise on the most commonly reported side-effect, cancer-related fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, many existing exercise studies have been short in duration and lack follow-up assessments; thus, the long term-effects and sustainability of the exercise programme are not monitored or assessed. The few large randomised controlled exercise interventions in patients with breast cancer during chemotherapy have shown improvements in physical function, fatigue, and health-related quality of life (QoL) compared to patients receiving standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Differences have also been identified when comparing moderate or vigorous to a low intensity exercise program, demonstrating greater beneficial effects on QoL and physical function with moderate or vigorous exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. To develop exercise interventions and guidelines that have the potential to address the great problems facing cancer survivors, adequately-powered trials with long term follow-up are urgently required.</p><p>After a cancer diagnosis and during treatment, a marked deterioration of the individual&#x02019;s physical capacity usually ensues and it is well known that patients with cancer generally reduce their activity levels after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many patients are also forced to adapt their daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and side-effect symptoms resulting from treatment for cancer greatly affect the patients&#x02019; QoL. Previous research shows that QoL is a prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer that correlates with both survival and how well patients respond to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Although medications that target estrogen receptors decrease the risk for recurrence by approximately 50%, aromatase inhibitors result in detrimental musculoskeletal side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], possibly due to the influence of muscle protein turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other side-effects that patients with breast cancer encounter include cardiovascular complications, psychological distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and increased levels of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite growing research in oncology and physical exercise there is a paucity of randomised controlled trials that have particularly focused on investigating which modalities of exercise are most beneficial and at which intensity, duration and frequency these exercise modalities should be prescribed to reduce the side-effects and improve the health of patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. While exercise trials for patients with cancer have generally employed either resistance or aerobic exercise, there is a lack of studies that have combined the two training modalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Significant barriers exist for patients with cancer who wish to return to work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Exercise provides a potential strategy to improve the physical and mental health of survivors, in turn improving their likelihood to return to work, should they chose to. The PACES randomised clinical trial demonstrated that patients who were prescribed moderate to high intensity combined aerobic and resistance exercise or were prescribed light intensity physical activity during chemotherapy returned to work significantly earlier and for longer hours than the standard care group at the end of a 6-month intervention period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As survival rates for breast cancer increase, facilitating successful return to work rates is of great importance.</p><p>Attendance and adherence to exercise protocols have generally been poorly monitored and reported in the existing literature, which may have resulted in an over- or underestimation of the effects of exercise programs. Investigation of the importance of adhering to exercise protocols and rates of attendance is warranted to understand the real- world implications of these exercise programs.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms induced by exercise in patients with cancer are still largely unknown. Low-grade systemic inflammation is linked to most events involved in the development and progression of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and an ongoing elevated systemic inflammatory state is associated with poor prognosis in patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Findings on anti-inflammatory effects of physical exercise have mainly been demonstrated in healthy individuals showing that regular exercise exerts anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Few studies have evaluated the effects of exercise on inflammatory markers after a cancer diagnosis and data on inflammatory responses to exercise during chemotherapy are even scarcer but tend to show exercise-induced anti-inflammatory effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Those data are, however, confounded by heterogeneous patient populations, small sample sizes, and analysis of only a few pro/anti-inflammatory biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Moreover, the effect of different types and doses of standardised exercise on inflammatory markers in patients with cancer need to be elucidated.</p><p>The current study will examine and compare the effects of different modalities and intensities of exercise on a wide range of clinically important and varying endpoints in patients with breast cancer. It will be the first study of its kind to offer supervised exercise sessions in the clinical setting that includes strategies to monitor physical activity levels over the course of and after the 16-week supervised intervention period including multiple follow up measurements (1, 2, and 5 years). In addition to functional outcomes, important biomarkers of systemic inflammation and skeletal muscle gene activity will be assessed. This can translate into better take out well-informed and targeted strategies for surveillance and treatment of patients with breast cancer.</p><p>The primary aim of the study is to compare the effects of two different exercise regimens (aerobic exercise vs. a combination of aerobic and resistance exercise) and a usual care control group on the primary outcome cancer related fatigue and the secondary outcomes cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, function and structure, systemic inflammation, gene activity, health related quality of life, pain, disease and treatment related symptoms in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. The second aim is to examine if these effects, if any, are sustained one, two, and five years following the completion of the intervention and to monitor the effects of the intervention on return to work, recurrence and survival. The third aim of the study is to examine the effect of attendance and adherence rates on the effects of the exercise programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a 16-week randomised controlled exercise trial with follow-up at one, two and five years.

All participants will provide informed written consent prior to their entry into the study. In the case that changes in the protocol are necessary, relevant amendments will be made and submitted to the relevant ethics trial registration authorities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Recruitment began in March 2013 and is ongoing. Two-hundred and forty (80 in each group) women with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy are being recruited from the Department of Oncology Breast and Sarcoma units at Radiumhemmet and S&#x000f6;dersjukhuset, Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. The expected completion date for recruitment is August 2016. Oncology physicians inform eligible patients about the study and, should they wish to participate, they fill in a cardiovascular health questionnaire and undergo an echocardiogram. If no relevant cardiovascular health issues are identified, the participants are deemed fully eligible for the trial. Once the participants have had any of their possible questions answered to their satisfaction and wish to volunteer for the study, the participants then sign the written informed consent form prior to data collection. Research nurses at The Clinical Trials Unit at Radiumhemmet then inform the study researchers of the participant&#x02019;s eligibility and of the group allocation of the patient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Inclusion criteria include women (aged 18&#x02013;70 years) with Stage I-IIIa breast cancer about to start adjuvant chemotherapy.

Pressure pain thresholds are assessed using a pressure algometer (Somedic Sales AB, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden). Blood sampling and muscle biopsy procedures are taking place at the Clinical Trial Unit laboratory at Radiumhemmet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm. Muscle biopsies (approximately 100 mg) will be obtained under local anesthesia from the vastus lateralis muscle (lateral part of the knee extensor muscle) with a Bergstr&#x000f6;m needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This takes place before the intervention starts and 24&#x02013;72 h after the last training session. Contractile function, markers for systemic inflammation, muscle fiber area, mitochondrial density, and expression of genes important for muscle adaptation will be analysed. Concurrently, venous blood is sampled for markers of systemic inflammation, hemoglobin levels, genotyping, and for analysis of white cell distribution and epigenetic patterns.</p><p>Patient-reported outcomes include self-reported health-related QoL assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire which is a cancer-specific instrument that measures health-related QoL in terms of physical, emotional, social, cognitive and everyday function. Common cancer-related symptoms are assessed by the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (MSAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Both exercise groups train twice per week on non-consecutive week days for 16 weeks. Each session is approximately 60 min in duration and is conducted at the exercise clinic at the Karolinska University Hospital. An exercise physiologist or oncology nurse supervises all sessions to ensure safety, correct technique and adherence to the exercise protocols. Participants can choose to perform the continuous aerobic exercise on a cycle ergometer, elliptical ergometer, or treadmill, the interval aerobic exercise is performed on a cycle ergometer. Resistance exercises are performed using machine resistance training equipment, participants&#x02019; body weight and free weight dumbbells and barbells. All exercise sessions commence with a five min warm up on a cycle ergometer, treadmill, or rowing machine at a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 10&#x02013;12 on the Borg scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and sessions conclude with a 10 min cool-down which includes dynamic and static muscle stretching activities of the major muscle groups.</p><p>Group 1 (AT) exercise sessions commence with 20 min of moderate intensity continuous aerobic exercise at an RPE of 13&#x02013;15.

The research team will be responsible for providing the motivational seminars and physical activity prescriptions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data will be analysed using the IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) 20 statistical package for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Analyses will include standard descriptive statistics (one-way ANOVAs or Kruskall-Wallis tests, as appropriate, and Chi squared tests). ANCOVAs accounting for baseline values will be used for the main analysis. Variables with data that are not normally-distributed will be log transformed prior to ANCOVA analyses. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests, as appropriate, will be used to test for within groups differences from baseline to follow up. All tests will be 2-tailed and statistical significance set at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. An intention-to-treat approach will be used for the analyses with missing values replaced using the expectation-maximization method.</p><p>Power Calculation: With fatigue as the primary outcome measure, a sample size of 65 patients/group is required, based on an effect size of 0.53 and power&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.8. From our research group&#x02019;s experience with participant dropout in previous exercise trials in cancer survivors, we accounted for an attrition rate of ~20% and therefore are aiming to recruit 80 participants into each group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Monitoring harms</title><sec id="Sec21"><title>Adverse events</title><p>Study supervisors record any adverse events that occur as a result of the testing or training activities of the study. Participants are also asked to directly report any adverse events they experience. Reported adverse events are recorded by the research staff and reported both to the relevant ethics committee and as relevant in any subsequent publications and reports. Patients who experience an adverse event will be referred to the relevant health professional for a medical assessment. All participants will be covered by the Patient Insurance that is made available for participants in clinical studies at Karolinska University Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional potential discomfort issues</title><p>Progressive resistance training and muscle strength testing are known to result in mild discomfort, delayed onset muscle soreness and joint stiffness especially in untrained individuals. However, participants are informed of the possibility of delayed onset muscle soreness, symptoms and procedures to alleviate them. Warm-ups and cool-downs are incorporated in each testing session to mitigate muscle soreness and return the individual to their resting heart rate level before leaving the training facility. There is also the risk of a muscle strain. However, this risk is reduced by careful monitoring of each participant, ensuring that correct loads are used, checking technique and requiring a warm-up and cool-down period with each exercise session. Furthermore, all testing sessions are conducted with one participant at a time, and exercise training takes place in small groups of up to five participants, each session supervised by the study exercise physiologist or oncology nurse.</p><p>There may be a low risk of falling when performing the functional tasks; however, participants are closely supervised. There may also be some discomfort from the procedures involved in blood samples and muscle biopsies and some bruising may result. However, both procedures are performed by a trained phlebotomist (blood sample) and an experienced physician (muscle biopsy).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide a more complete understanding of the effects of different modalities of exercise on the physical and mental health of breast cancer survivors in the short and long term as well as adding further knowledge regarding the potential exercise may have in managing fatigue, the most commonly reported but poorly understood side-effect of cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>There is a concern by some health professionals and researchers, both within and outside of the oncology setting, that high intensity exercise training may not be feasible or safe for individuals with a history of cancer. However, recent controlled trials have adopted high intensity training and showed exercise induced physical adaptations to be superior to low or moderate intensity exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and concluded that this mode of exercise to be safe and well tolerated in both patients undergoing chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>The results of the study will be communicated to all participants at the conclusion of the trial. The findings of the study will be shared with the public and research community by way of scientific peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific meetings. Popular science articles will be written to inform the public of the study results and study findings will be communicated to the relevant organisations and funding bodies for dissemination to relevant health care and policy professionals.</p><p>In terms of advancement of cancer survivor care, we expect that dissemination of the knowledge gained from this study to contribute to developing effective strategies to improve the physical and psychosocial health of breast cancer survivors. In particular, we expect that the knowledge will aid our understanding of the benefits and issues associated with long term exercise programs.</p><p>This randomised controlled trial will generate substantial information regarding the effects of different types of exercise on the health of patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. We anticipate that the results of this study will help to develop future exercise programs and interventions that are more effective and appropriate for and attractive to patients with breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AT</term><def><p>Aerobic exercise training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Combined resistance and aerobic exercise training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EORTC QLQ-C30</term><def><p>European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSAS</term><def><p>Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAP</term><def><p>Physical activity on prescription</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RM</term><def><p>Repetition maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>Rate of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOC</term><def><p>Sense of coherence</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UC</term><def><p>Usual care control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VO2max</term><def><p>Maximal oxygen uptake</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>S.
