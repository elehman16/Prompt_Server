The goals of phase 2 include establishing proof-of-concept using an endpoint that is appropriate for phase 3 or a suitable surrogate, demonstrating a dose-response that can be used to select the doses for phase 3, and assessing the magnitude of the treatment effect, so phase 3 studies can be appropriately powered.</p><p>This traditional strategy has not been followed in many recent AD projects for disease-modifying drugs <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Instead, small phase 2 studies using biomarker endpoints led directly to phase 3 trials (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>) <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. These trials were generally underpowered to detect changes in clinical endpoints. Although biomarkers can indicate target engagement, this evidence alone is not sufficient to predict clinical effect and should not be used to advance a compound into phase 3 without evidence that the treatment's effect on the biomarker translates into a beneficial clinical effect. Although there are many possible reasons for the recent failed phase 3 trials of amyloid-based treatments, such as inclusion of patients at advanced stages of disease, one possible reason is the lack of clear evidence for an effect on a clinical endpoint in phase 2, leading to unsupported decisions to enter phase 3. To improve the success rate in phase 3 for a disease-modifying drug in AD, phase 2 trials should demonstrate a relevant treatment effect on a clinical endpoint.</p><p>AD trials using clinical endpoints will be larger and longer than those using biomarker endpoints for two reasons. First, clinical assessments of AD symptoms and progression have higher variability than biomarker assessments <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Second, disease-modifying AD therapies are generally tested earlier in the disease, when clinical progression is slower <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, conducting traditional phase 2 clinical trials for disease-modifying therapies in AD is lengthy and costly. These considerations may have led companies to rely on data from smaller phase 2 studies using biomarker endpoints for decision making about entry into phase 3 and the design of phase 3 studies, with outcomes that have so far suggested the risk inherent in this approach.</p><p>Different trial designs are needed so that trials with clinical endpoints can be conducted more efficiently. An adaptive design can minimize the overall sample size and study duration by stopping recruitment early in response to strong signals of success or futility based on regular interim analyses (IAs) <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. This approach can be enhanced by using the emerging data to adjust the randomization ratios to assign more subjects to doses that appear more efficacious, and fewer to doses that are less effective. This reduces the overall sample size and speeds recruitment by increasing the attractiveness of the trial to health authorities, IRBs, investigators, and subjects.</p><p>An important challenge of adaptive trials in AD is the difficulty of assessing the outcome measure early enough so modifications of the randomization can occur well before recruitment is complete <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In AD, where the clinical drug effect may not be seen for a long time, the theoretical advantages of adaptation have not been considered practical. This challenge can be met using a Bayesian design in which all available longitudinal data from the ongoing study are analyzed, with imputation of missing endpoint data based on the longitudinal model, so that response adaptive randomization and detection of signals predictive of 12-month success or futility can occur based on IAs before all subjects reach trial completion <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Early endpoints need not be surrogates for later endpoints to be used for imputation because this data-driven approach is not dependent on clinical hypotheses about the relationship of the endpoints. The longitudinal model is updated using data accruing in the trial, with correlations between observations at different time points informing the model. This approach results in a more efficient use of the data, leading to faster and more accurate decision making.</p><p>Based on these ideas, we designed a Bayesian adaptive phase 2, proof-of-concept trial with a clinical endpoint to evaluate BAN2401, a monoclonal antibody against amyloid protofibrils.

We assumed a maximal recruitment rate of 32 subjects per month and a 20% dropout rate by 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>We hypothesized a treatment effect equivalent to a 25% reduction in the rate of decline over 1&#x000a0;year.

The prespecified algorithm is run at each IA, the randomization probabilities are adapted, and the stopping rules are applied without any unblinding by study personnel.</p><p>Modeling and simulation were used to design this Bayesian adaptive trial. There are two major components to the modeling. The first is the modeling of the mean change from baseline to week 52 for each treatment arm. This model is informed by a second, longitudinal model that captures the correlations between early visits and the 52-week outcome. These two models work simultaneously to jointly estimate the primary endpoint effect size for each treatment arm at 52&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The dose-frequency response model and the longitudinal model were prospectively defined as part of the trial's design. They are stochastic models in that they have unknown parameters with probability distributions. These prior probability distributions were specified in advance and are updated as the trial proceeds and information accrues about each subject's outcome. This updating is Bayesian in nature.</p><p>Many iterations of the trial were simulated before finalizing the design. We assigned particular sets of numerical values to the parameters in the models and simulated an entire trial for many such sets to test a design's performance. Using the particular numerical values of the parameters, we generated each virtual subject's outcomes, including longitudinal outcomes, depending on the particular dose assigned to that subject. The computer algorithm that is the trial's design was not privy to the values of the parameters that generated the subject outcomes but only to the subject outcomes themselves, just as in the actual trial. The point of these simulations was to see how well a design was able to estimate the true values of the parameters. As these true values were known, we could compare them with the results of the simulations. Of course, in the actual trial, the true values of the parameters are not known.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Dose-frequency response model</title><p>A dose-frequency response model was constructed for the mean change from baseline to 52&#x000a0;weeks for each treatment arm (see <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref>). The arms were modeled with a two-dimensional first-order normal dynamic linear model <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. This model is a Gaussian random walk model over the dimension of dose and, separately, frequency of dose. The model allows a borrowing or smoothing of the 52-week effect size across neighboring doses and frequencies to provide a superior estimate of each treatment arm's effect. Prior distributions were set for the mean response for each dose and the error variance.

The model was built to learn from the accruing information during the course of the trial on the observed correlation between the earlier values and the 52-week primary value using Bayesian imputation within Markov chain Monte Carlo, to impute the 52-week data and update the dose-frequency response model at each IA.

Key operating characteristics of interest were the type I error and the probabilities of futility, early success, overall success, selecting each treatment arm for phase 3, and success in a phase 3 confirmatory trial. The simulated virtual trials allowed us to calculate the operating characteristics of the trial for a wide range of possible dose-frequency response scenarios. Simulations were used to iterate aspects of the design, including maximum sample size, cut-offs for stopping rules, frequency of IAs, and response adaptive randomization, to achieve optimized operating characteristics. If, as new design features were simulated, these did not result in an optimal balancing of operating characteristics (e.g., between the probabilities of stopping for futility or early success in different scenarios), the iterative process was resumed to correct them <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.

The scenarios in which some doses are effective and some are not included five exposure-response relationships: (1) linear dose-response throughout the dose range; (2) linear dose-response that is only seen above a threshold dose of 10 or 20&#x000a0;mg/kg/month; (3) flat dose-response (all doses work equally well); (4) inverted <italic>U</italic>-shaped dose-response (intermediate doses have the best effect, and a lesser effect is achieved with doses that are either higher or lower); and (5) dose response based on a need to maintain a minimum average drug concentration (biweekly dosing works better than monthly dosing). Within each of these dose-frequency response pattern scenarios, we included several subscenarios with treatment effect magnitudes ranging from very weak to very strong reductions in the rate of clinical decline.</p><p>Based on assumptions about the fraction of the 52-week treatment effect that would be observed at each visit, we chose three different longitudinal patterns of drug response: (1) linear (assumes steady growth in treatment effect through 52&#x000a0;weeks; essentially, the pattern that should be seen if the drug is disease-modifying); (2) symptomatic (most of the effect occurs in the first 12&#x000a0;weeks, then remains the same); and (3) late-onset (which assumes that a certain amount of amyloid-based toxicity must be cleared before a clinical effect is seen). Each dose-response scenario was simulated under the assumption of each of these patterns of response.</p><p>An iterative simulation process was used to choose the futility and success boundaries. We defined futility as a probability &#x0003c;X% that any dose is better than placebo by the CSD at an IA, and early success as a probability of &#x02265;Y% that any dose is better than placebo by the CSD. We simulated the trial using a range of 2.5%&#x02013;15% probability of no effect for futility and 85%&#x02013;99% probability that one dose was efficacious for early success. Based on the simulations, we chose boundaries that resulted in the most useful balance between improving trial efficiency and minimizing the risk of making incorrect decisions about stopping the trial early (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> for detailed examples; note that the type I error rate of 16% in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> is the result at the beginning of the design process.

Futility boundaries ranging from 2.5% to 15% were simulated for each scenario. The results for two scenarios are shown: (A) null scenario and (B) a dose-response scenario in which one dose has a robust effect. Robust indicates a dose-response in which the percentage reduction in decline relative to placebo for the 2.5-mg bimonthly, 5-mg bimonthly, 10-mg bimonthly, 5-mg monthly, and 10-mg monthly doses are 17%, 33%, 50%, 17%, and 33%, respectively. Null scenario simulations showed that with a boundary of 15%, the cumulative probability of declaring futility at the 13th IA would be 54% (A). However, using the same boundary, futility could be declared 13% of the time in a scenario where a single dose had a robust response (B), which was considered too risky. A boundary of 2.5% would reduce the probability of declaring futility to nearly zero in the event of a robust response for one dose (B) but would only permit stopping for futility in the null scenario 13% of the time (A). A boundary of 7.5% would permit stopping for futility 32% of the time in the null scenario (A), while only incorrectly declaring futility 4% of the time when one dose actually had a robust effect (B). Based on these simulation results, a futility boundary of 7.5% was chosen as providing the most acceptable balance of trial efficiency and risk. For the first three IAs (i.e., at 196, 250, and 300 subjects randomized), a more conservative futility boundary of 5% was chosen to further reduce the possibility of inappropriately stopping early for futility at very early time points in the trial, when the decision would be based on more limited data.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig><fig id="fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Simulating early success boundaries in multiple dose and effect scenarios.

Instead, a maximum sample size is chosen. Simulations were used to select the maximum sample size of the trial. Sample sizes of 500&#x02013;900 were simulated. Under the stopping rules that provided the most assurance of trial success, the best balance of power and time to obtain a signal of success was seen with a maximum sample size of 800. This maximum is also the anticipated size of a traditional fixed-design trial, so that if there is no interim signal for stopping, the trial will still have power to achieve the objective once all subjects have completed treatment.</p><p>Recruitment rate is an important factor in designing the trial because it affects the amount of data that will be available at each interim analysis (i.e., because the IAs are conducted after every 50 subjects are randomized, the recruitment rate determines the treatment duration for subjects previously randomized, and therefore, the total amount of data available for analysis). Therefore, the improved efficiency due to the Bayesian analyses is tempered as the recruitment rate increases, such that the advantage of a faster recruitment rate in accelerating the conduct of the trial is somewhat lessened. Recruitment rate can therefore be adjusted to maximize trial efficiency, and simulations can be performed to determine the optimal recruitment rate. However, in practice, recruitment is always challenging in dementia trials, especially ones seeking subjects with prodromal AD. Therefore, as noted above, we chose to fix the recruitment rate at the maximum we expected to achieve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>The final study design, using five active treatment arms and placebo, ADCOMS outcome measure, 12-month primary endpoint, and a maximum sample size of 800, has an average overall probability of success of &#x02265;80% when at least one dose shows a treatment effect that would be considered clinically meaningful.</p><p>In this phase 2 design, a type I error would be a decision to move to a phase 3 trial when there is no cognitive benefit of the drug. Simulations of the possible outcomes indicated that the type I error rate (one sided) is &#x0223c;10%, which we considered acceptable for a proof-of-concept trial. Note that, in a frequentist approach, the <italic>P</italic> value is calculated using a test statistic based on the distribution center at 0 under the null hypothesis, which is naturally two sided, and a one-sided <italic>P</italic> value of 10% is equivalent to a two-sided <italic>P</italic> value of 20%. However, the type I error rate in this Bayesian adaptive trial is not based on any statistical test of significance, but simply on the false-positive rate of success under the null hypothesis through simulations. Therefore, in this Bayesian trial, the simulated type I error rate is the experimental wise error rate, which in this design is 10%.</p><p>The mean actual sample size averaged across all scenarios is expected to be 626. A decision on success or failure, and therefore the opportunity to advance to phase 3 or discontinue the program would occur, on average, 17&#x000a0;months earlier than for a traditional trial with 800 subjects. This gain in efficiency is due not only to stopping enrollment before the maximum sample size is reached, but also to being able to declare success before all subjects have completed the full 12&#x000a0;months of treatment.</p><p>The protocol design is presented as a figure in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Appendix C</xref>.

Robust dose-response scenario used is the linear dose-response scenario with the largest response having &#x02265;50% reduction in decline relative to placebo. During the study, IAs are carried out after 196 subjects are randomized (A), after 250 subjects, and every 50 subjects thereafter (B) until 800 subjects are recruited, after which IAs are carried out every 3 months, until 52-week data are available for all subjects. Based on the results of each IA, the study can be stopped early for success or futility. If the study continues, the randomization ratios are adapted based on the effects of each dose on the ADCOMS (C). If the study achieves early success, recruitment is stopped (D), and the study continues with enrolled subjects until 52-week data are collected for all subjects (E). Robust indicates a dose-response in which the percentage reduction in decline relative to placebo for the 2.5-mg bimonthly, 5-mg bimonthly, 10-mg bimonthly, 5-mg monthly, and 10-mg monthly doses are 17%, 33%, 50%, 17%, and 33%, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr3"/></fig></p><p>IAs occur when 196 subjects are enrolled, then 250, and then every 50 subjects up to the maximum sample size of 800. After 800 subjects have been randomized, if neither boundary has been crossed, IAs occur every 3&#x000a0;months. The 52-week ADCOMS value is the driver of all decisions and/or adaptations at each IA. For subjects that do not yet have a 52-week observation, the 52-week observation is calculated using multiple imputations from the longitudinal model based on the most recent observation. At each IA, a Bayesian analysis is used to calculate the posterior distribution of the parameters in the dose-frequency response model. Based on these distributions, 10,000 dose-response curves are sampled. The maximum effective dose and the ED<sub>90</sub> for each of these curves are identified. The proportion of simulated dose&#x02013;frequency response curves where a given arm is the maximum effective dose is the posterior probability that that dose is the maximum effective dose. Similarly, the proportion of simulated dose&#x02013;frequency response curves where a given arm is the ED<sub>90</sub> is the posterior probability that that dose is the ED<sub>90</sub>. These probabilities are used for an algorithm-determined adjustment of the randomization allocation probabilities, implemented in a computerized system that automatically assigns treatments to subsequent subjects without unblinding any study or sponsor personnel or the study investigators.</p><p>Similarly, for each active treatment arm, the posterior distribution of the mean change from baseline to 52&#x000a0;weeks is compared with placebo to calculate the posterior probability of being superior to placebo and of being superior to placebo by at least the CSD. These probabilities are used to determine whether the trial has met the predefined criteria for early stopping.</p><p>Interim monitoring for futility begins at the first IA and is based on the dose identified as the most likely ED<sub>90</sub>. At the first three IAs, if there is a &#x0003c;5% posterior probability that the most likely ED<sub>90</sub> is superior to placebo by the CSD, the trial will stop early for futility. Beginning at the 350-subject IA, and continuing to completion of the trial, the futility criterion is increased to 7.5%. Thus, it becomes easier to stop for futility once &#x02265;350 subjects have been enrolled. If a signal for futility is found, the sponsor is notified and the trial is terminated.</p><p>Interim monitoring for early success occurs at each IA beginning when 350 subjects have been enrolled. At this point, if enrollment were to stop for early success, enough subjects would be available to complete the trial so that the full dose response could be modeled. If there is a &#x0003e;95% posterior probability that the most likely ED<sub>90</sub> is better than placebo by the CSD, then early success is declared. Enrollment is stopped, but all randomized subjects continue for the full 18-month duration of the study.</p><p>If the trial is not stopped early for futility or success, then trial success is evaluated at the completion of the trial, when both accrual and follow-up for the primary endpoint are complete. At that time, if there is a &#x0003e;80% probability that the most likely ED<sub>90</sub> is better than placebo by the CSD, the trial will be considered a success. If the trial is stopped early for success, then a final analysis using the full 12-month data from all subjects serves as a sensitivity analysis to confirm the result. Stopping early for success means that there is a 95% probability that the ED<sub>90</sub> is better than placebo by the CSD. Therefore, if this occurs, there is a very high likelihood of achieving an 80% probability that the ED<sub>90</sub> is better than placebo by the CSD at the final analysis. However, if the final sensitivity analysis does not confirm the result, additional analyses of the data would be performed to explain the discrepancy.</p><p>Unlike in a traditional trial, achieving study success is not the same as meeting the primary objective. Although the primary objective in this study is met by identifying the ED<sub>90</sub>, study success requires that this dose can achieve a clinically meaningful treatment effect in a phase 3 study. In the phase 2&#x000a0;trial, success is defined as a drug effect that exceeds the placebo rate by &#x02265;25%, rather than only being superior to placebo. We chose these criteria to ensure that any early signal of success would likely indicate a robust treatment effect. Thus, using the Bayesian adaptive design in phase 2, the risks of failure in phase 3 are mitigated.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>Many recent failures in phase 3 studies of AD drugs can be attributed to lack of robust phase 2 clinical results. Owing to the long-term endpoint, large variability in disease progression, typically high dropout rates and limited size of the potential treatment effect due to the nature of the drug (disease modification), the outcomes from shorter and smaller studies are likely to be misleadingly large or small. However, traditional phase 2 studies have been avoided in recent AD drug development because of concerns that they are too large and costly. This risk is a major challenge in developing disease-modifying drugs in AD. We believe that the study described in this article permits the determination of clinical efficacy for a disease-modifying treatment for AD in a trial of feasible size and duration by using a Bayesian adaptive design. The results can be used for go/no-go decisions on initiating phase 3 and to design phase 3 trials with a greater likelihood of success.</p><p>This trial design has numerous advantages over a traditional phase 2 proof-of-concept, dose-finding study and over other statistical approaches. Each Bayesian IA uses emerging data to update the joint posterior distribution of the longitudinal model parameters, which improves the predictive power of IAs <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. In this way, the regular IAs are part of a learning process that improves the trial's efficiency in arriving at a stopping decision. This approach compensates for the absence of good predictive biomarkers or a priori evidence for the clinical effect of the study drug. A group sequential trial design permits IAs for early stopping but does not incorporate longitudinal data, a dose-response, or response adaptive randomization <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>.</p><p>The study can stop early, either for futility or success, thereby avoiding unnecessary exposure of patients to an ineffective drug or accelerating the initiation of confirmatory trials that can speed the availability of an effective drug to patients who need it. This efficiency gain is due to the likelihood that enrollment will complete before the 800 subject maximum and due to the efficacy signal being detected before all enrolled subjects have completed the full 12&#x000a0;months of treatment. If the drug is ineffective, the time and cost savings can be diverted to more promising therapies.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to the use of the Bayesian adaptive approach for clinical trials. All Bayesian analyses are dependent on the choice of prior distributions, which can be erroneous. In this trial, the prior distributions for the dose-frequency response model and the longitudinal model were kept weak so that the posterior distributions would be mostly shaped by the emerging data. Our estimates of the operating characteristics were based on simulations of a range of possible dose-frequency response scenarios, but these may not have covered all possible scenarios, which could have affected our estimate of power if the true dose-response scenario was to be very different from what was simulated. Underestimation of the dropout rate could also result in underestimation of type I error rate. In addition, we could not be certain that each of the simulated scenarios was equally likely, so it is possible that our estimate for the average expected sample size, which was not weighted, might not be accurate. For these reasons, our estimates for the potential efficiency gains that could be achieved with this study design should be viewed with some caution. In addition, the conclusions of the trial could be impacted by the possibility that effect sizes observed at early success might be larger than the true effect size, resulting in a positive bias.</p><p>Designing a Bayesian adaptive trial requires extensive planning <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The study team must consider numerous scenarios for possible outcomes and must expend time and resources on a lengthy iterative simulation process. It should be noted, however, that all trials, whether adaptive or fixed, should be simulated to ensure the effectiveness of the design to achieve the study aims; this approach can minimize the risk of inadequate phase 2 trials and costly phase 3 failures. Conducting an adaptive trial requires a rapid flow of data from sites to the database so IAs can be performed in real time to adjust the randomization ratios on schedule and provide the study team with early stopping decisions if a boundary is met. Drug use and availability must be tracked more closely than for a traditional trial because of the adjustments in randomization ratios. Drug supplies may need to be larger than for a traditional trial because of these adjustments <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Regulators may be less familiar with these complex study designs <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, although the Food and Drug Administration has issued draft guidance <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Prior agreement with regulators on the study design is helpful. Questions about the maintenance of data integrity using this trial design are to be expected <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In the BAN2401 trial, once the protocol was finalized, the sponsor (Eisai) has had no involvement with the actual IAs.
