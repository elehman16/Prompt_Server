Published trials have tended to focus on one particular seizure type such as absence seizures<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> or upon generalised tonic-clonic seizures and have either excluded or ignored other seizure types.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> No trials have so far been reported that have assessed the treatment response of differing generalised seizure types or syndromes, and no prognostic models have been reported.</p><p>Arm B of the Standard and New Antiepileptic Drug (SANAD) trial<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> enlisted 716 patients where the recruiting clinician considered valproate the treatment of choice: 473 with generalised, 191 with unclassified and 52 with focal epilepsy. These patients were randomised to start treatment with valproate, lamotrigine or topiramate. Overall results indicated that valproate was the first-line treatment as it was significantly superior to lamotrigine for time to 12-month remission and significantly superior to topiramate for time to treatment failure.</p><p>The SANAD B dataset provides a unique opportunity to use prognostic modelling to investigate which clinical factors influence outcome. Prognostic models are rare in epilepsy and include those derived from the National General Practice Survey of Epilepsy,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the Medical Research Council (MRC) antiepileptic drug withdrawal study,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the Multicentre study of Early Epilepsy and Single Seizures.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Most recently, we reported a prognostic model for patients with focal epilepsy derived from the SANAD A dataset.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A number of factors influencing treatment outcome were identified and a prognostic model produced to aid outcome prediction for individual patients. In this paper, we report prognostic modelling of data from SANAD B in order to inform prognostication and treatment decisions for patients with generalised and unclassified epilepsy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients and procedures</title><p>Full details are available in the original trial report.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In brief, patients qualified for randomisation in arm B of the SANAD study if they had a history of two or more clinically definite unprovoked epileptic seizures in the previous year and if the recruiting clinician regarded valproate the better standard treatment option than carbamazepine. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to valproate, lamotrigine or topiramate between 12 January 1999 and 31 August 2004.</p><p>The two primary outcomes in SANAD were time to treatment failure and time to the first period of 12-month remission from seizures. Treatment failure can be as a result of inadequate seizure control or due to unacceptable adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Prognostic modelling</title><p>As in our modelling of SANAD arm A,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> we wished to determine factors that predicted time to 12- and to 24-month remission, and factors that predicted time to treatment failure, either as a result of treatment withdrawal due to adverse events or treatment addition or replacement due to inadequate seizure control. Clinical consensus and knowledge from previous prognostic studies in epilepsy<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> led to the following list of potential prognostic factors: sex, febrile seizure history, first degree relative with epilepsy, treatment history (antiepileptic drug treatment prior to randomisation), age at randomisation, time from first seizure to randomisation, neurological insult (learning disabilities or a neurological deficit), total number of tonic-clonic seizures before randomisation, EEG result, seizure type and epilepsy type. EEG result was classified as normal, not done, non-specific abnormality or epileptiform abnormality (focal or generalised spikes, or spike and slow wave activity).</p><p>Seizure type and epilepsy syndrome were highly correlated as would be expected. As there is often uncertainty about the precise syndrome that a patient has, we elected to include seizure type in the prognostic models (as well as age and EEG), which is more likely to be informative for prognostication in newly diagnosed epilepsy. Also, as only 52 patients were classified as having focal epilepsy these patients have been excluded from this analysis leaving a dataset comprised of 473 patients with generalised epilepsy and 191 patients with unclassified epilepsy. Analyses, adjusted for multiple variables, used Cox proportional hazards modelling methods. Variable centring was employed to diminish multicollinearity<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and variables were examined with the likelihood ratio test.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The proportional hazards assumption was tested and the discriminatory power and the predictive accuracy of the models were assessed using the <italic>c</italic>-statistic.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> To assess the effect of factors on the different reasons for treatment withdrawal, a competing risks analysis was required. We therefore undertook cumulative incidence analyses to assess the probability of one of the two treatment failure events occurring (inadequate seizure control and unacceptable adverse events), with covariate effects tested by Gray's method.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Continuous variables were investigated using logarithmic and fractional polynomial transformations.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref> Continuous variable results are illustrated as post hoc defined categorical variables with categories chosen as per spline model fit knot positions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Time from first seizure to randomisation contains extreme values. Therefore, people with a time from first seizure to randomisation in the first or last 1% of the variable were removed from the dataset<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02014;this applied to 17 patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306040F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> illustrates patient disposition for the 716 patients randomised to arm B of SANAD.

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Rates of 12-month remission were significantly lower for patients with a first degree relative with epilepsy, and for those with a neurological insult. Regarding seizure types, compared with patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, 12-month remission was significantly less likely in patients with myoclonic or absence seizures with tonic-clonic seizures. The HR for unclassified tonic-clonic seizures was not significant but the estimate suggests that they have a lower 12-month remission rate than generalised tonic-clonic seizures. A 12-month remission was more likely in patients randomised to start valproate than those starting lamotrigine. For total number of tonic-clonic seizures, as the number increases the chance of 12-month remission decreases. Rates of 24-month remission were as for 12-month remission with the additional conclusions that patients with absence seizures, and patients with other seizure types, were significantly less likely to achieve 24-month remission than patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures only. The HR for unclassified tonic-clonic seizures suggests the same 24month remission rate as for generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Additionally, 24-month remission was more likely in patients randomised to start valproate than those starting topiramate.</p><table-wrap id="JNNP2013306040TB2"

results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013306040TB3">table 3</xref>). All four variables are significant in the model for treatment failure because of inadequate seizure control. Patients taking non-SANAD AEDs were more likely to have treatment failure than treatment naive patients and compared with patients with a normal EEG result, patients with an epileptiform EEG result had a higher rate of treatment failure because of inadequate seizure control. Similarly, compared with patients on valproate, patients on lamotrigine and topiramate had a higher rate of treatment failure due to inadequate seizure control. Treatment failure was also more likely in patients with absence seizures only, or patients with myoclonic or absence seizures with tonic-clonic seizures, than in patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures only. Treatment history and treatment were significant for time to treatment failure because of unacceptable adverse events (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013306040TB3">table 3</xref>). Patients on topiramate were more likely to have a treatment failure due to unacceptable adverse events than patients on valproate and patients with seizures after remission were also more likely to have a treatment failure than treatment naive patients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>What have we found?</title><p>We have shown that numerous clinical factors influence treatment outcome. For time to 12-month remission, the multivariable model included first degree relative with epilepsy, age at randomisation, neurological insult, number of tonic-clonic seizures before randomisation, seizure type and treatment. The model for time to 24month remission was similar and also included febrile seizure history. This study allowed the assessment of prognosis in a subgroup of patients who were unclassified at the point in time that treatment was started; a group for whom prognosis has not previously been estimated in this way, despite being a relatively common clinical scenario. While some of these unclassified patients will have had their epilepsy reclassified during follow-up, it is important to emphasise that these additional data should not be used in a prognostic model that is attempting to inform likely prognosis at a point in time when those data are not available. Interestingly, compared with patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures, patients with unclassified tonic-clonic seizures had the same 24-month remission rate, but a lower but not statistically significant 12-month remission.</p><p>Our model for time to 12-month remission has a number of similarities to the prognostic model for SANAD A. The SANAD A multivariable model focused upon focal epilepsy and included variables for sex, CT/MRI scan result, treatment history, age, time from first seizure to randomisation, neurological insult, total number of seizures before randomisation, focal epilepsy site of onset and treatment. Of these, age, neurological insult, number of seizures and treatment were in common with the SANAD B model presented in this paper. The SANAD A model did not identify first degree relative as a significant factor, which is not surprising given that the generalised epilepsies are primarily genetic in aetiology, are more likely in a first degree relative, and severity of the epilepsy and hence treatment response is likely to be determined at least in part by the causal variant. The multivariable model also allows estimation of the probability of 12-month remission for patients with differing combinations of risk factors. Examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306040F2">figure 2</xref> while estimates for time to 24month remission for combinations of risk factors can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306040F3">figure 3</xref>. While these data illustrate a higher remission rate in those allocated to initiate treatment valproate compared with lamotrigine or topiramate, the treatment effects are small. Conversely, the data show a larger effect on outcome for the clinical covariates seizure type and first degree relative with epilepsy.</p><p>It is important to emphasise that the outcome 12- or 24-month remission does not necessarily imply treatment response. We remain uncertain as to the natural history of untreated epilepsy such that in clinical practice, as in this study, for any particular patient we are unable to state with certainty that any remission is treatment induced. This is particularly so for patients with a low seizure rate prior to starting treatment for whom a long period of observation may be required to be certain of complete seizure remission. It is not surprising therefore that patients with fewer tonic-clonic seizures prior to starting treatment were more likely to achieve a 12- or 24-month remission.</p><p>For time to overall treatment failure, the best fitting multivariable model included treatment history, age at randomisation, time from first seizure to starting treatment, EEG result and treatment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="JNNP2013306040TB3">table 3</xref>). Competing risks analyses provided further detail about the relationship between these factors and treatment failure. Again, the results are similar to the SANAD A model, although this model included number of seizure before randomisation rather than time from first seizure.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>Pragmatic trials will usually recruit a heterogeneous group of patients, and while this approach has been criticised,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> this paper illustrates the strength of this approach as it can allow an investigation of sources of heterogeneity of outcome. In this analysis of arm B, we have been able to categorise patients according to their seizure types at presentation and assess the influence of this and other factors upon treatment outcome. Some may criticise the fact that the analysis has been undertaken according to seizure type rather than epilepsy syndrome. However, it is important to highlight that abnormal EEG was not a prognostic factor for 12- or 24-month remission, and also, at the point in time that a diagnosis and a decision to start treatment are made, there is often uncertainty about the precise epilepsy syndrome, which may become clearer at a later date when further seizures have occurred or other information including investigation results are available. This is illustrated by the fact that at randomisation the most common idiopathic generalised epilepsy type specified by the randomising clinician was &#x02018;not specified&#x02019;. Nonetheless, seizure types were identified, which this analysis demonstrates are of prognostic importance. Of note, patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures had similar 12-month remission rate to patients with absence of seizures 0.98 (0.52, 1.83), and patients with generalised tonic-clonic seizures as well as myoclonic or absence seizures had the lowest remission rate 0.56 (0.43, 0.73), as did patients with unclassified tonic-clonic seizures 0.82 (0.64, 1.06). Additionally, two individual prognostic models were developed using either patients with generalised epilepsy only or using patients with unclassified epilepsy only and both models were found to be very similar to the model published here. Given the increase in sample size and associated increase in precision of the risk estimates with the combined model, only the combined model has been presented. Other limitations of SANAD have been discussed elsewhere.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>While we have presented a number of models that can further inform patient counselling and treatment decisions, ideally these models require validation in other similar datasets and the predictive power of the model also needs to be explored. Although SANAD II is currently underway, there are no other datasets that are similar to SANAD. The closest match is a set of individual participant data collected by the authors. However, these data are missing important covariates and the treatments patients were randomised to do not always coincide with SANAD drugs. Internal validation of the models presented here does suggest a satisfactory model fit, however.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Meaning</title><p>The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306040F2">figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JNNP2013306040F3">3</xref> show that we can recognise, at the start of antiepileptic drug treatment, groups of patients with different risks of 12 or 24month remission or treatment failure. The results also highlight how heterogeneous epilepsy outcomes are and will improve outcome prediction for patients, and allow better stratification of patients, including the identification of patients more likely to have poor treatment outcome for which more intensive follow-up may be required. Similarly the models may also aid in the identification of patients with poorer seizure control outcomes who might be eligible to participate in future trials of new treatments, for example surgical treatments such as deep brain stimulation, which might carry greater risk than drug treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Unanswered questions</title><p>A number of important clinical questions remain unanswered. First, the most appropriate treatment policy is yet to be determined for women with an idiopathic generalised epilepsy who are of childbearing years. While valproate remains the most effective first-line treatment, it is also the most teratogenic. The most appropriate policy will be informed by a synthesis of data from SANAD and other randomised controlled trials and observational studies assessing the risk in pregnancy,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and by qualitative studies that assess the priorities and preferences of women with epilepsy, an important yet under-researched area.</p><p>While clinical predictors of outcome have been identified, the way these factors influence outcome remains to be discovered. Although there is increasing interest in stratified medicine and pharmacogenetics, it remains unknown as to whether genetic factors might explain the unexplained variability in our predictive models. However, given the assumed genetic aetiology of the idiopathic generalised epilepsies, the prognostic importance of having a first degree relative with epilepsy is of great interest and raises the question as to whether some epilepsies are inherently more drug refractory,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> rather than refractoriness being expressed via another mechanism.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Better understanding of the genetic aetiology of these epilepsies may lead to novel targets and new treatments, although the prospect of preventing the epilepsy developing in the first place remains a distant hope, likely requiring some form of gene therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jnnp-2013-306040-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1194" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LJB completed all analyses, drafted and redrafted the manuscript.
