Its clinical usefulness has been limited because of its intraoperative cardiostimulatory response and postoperative recovery with psychomimetic effects. Numerous drugs have been tried to attenuate these undesirable responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine and dexmedetomidine, induce preoperative sedation, reduce anesthetic requirements and improve intraoperative hemodynamic stability with postoperative analgesia, which suggests that they might be suitable adjuncts to ketamine anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The present study was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous premedication with dexmedetomidine in relevance to ketamine anesthesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After getting approval of the protocol from the Ethical Committee of Institution and written informed consent, this prospective blind randomized study was conducted on 80 normotensive adult patients of both genders, aged 21 to 55 years, with ASA physical status I and II, scheduled for elective surgery under ketamine anesthesia from February 2010 to January 2011. Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease, hypertension, increased intraocular and intracranial pressure, asthma and severe renal, hepatic or endocrinal dysfunction were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included patients with known drug hypersensitivity, compromised airway, morbid obesity, those on antihypertensive or antidepressant drugs and those who refused consent. All the patients underwent pre-anesthetic evaluation with history, general and systemic examination and review of biochemical investigations before enrolment in the study. None of the patients had previous experience with general anesthesia.</p><p>They were randomized into two treatment groups of 40 patients each according to a computer-generated random table. Group I patients received premedication with midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) and Group II patients received dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), given slowly intravenously over 10 min. These doses are considered to provide adequate and comparable effects. The study solution was prepared and administered by the consultant anesthesiologist, not responsible for the study.</p><p>The protocol defined primary end points were intraoperative hemodynamic pressure response, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and ketamine requirement, quality of postoperative recovery and occurrence of ketamine-induced psychomimetic effects.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Anesthetic technique</title><p>In the operation theater, monitors were attached, and baseline heart rate, electrocardiogram (ECG), systemic arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration were recorded. A crystalloid intravenous infusion of 6 to 8 ml/kg was started and patients were premedicated intravenously with metoclopramide (10 mg), glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg) and study solutions of midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) in group I and dexmedetomidine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) in group II, given slowly over 10 min. After preoxygenation for 3 min with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced with intravenous ketamine (1% solution) at a dose of 2 mg/kg and injected slowly over 30 seconds. The hemodynamic parameters of heart rate and systolic arterial pressure were recorded before and after premedication, and after induction. Thereafter, the hemodynamic parameters were recorded every 5 min using a non-invasive blood pressure monitor till the end of surgery. The end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration was also monitored intraoperatively.</p><p>Anesthesia was maintained with 40% O<sub>2</sub> in N<sub>2</sub>O, using an anatomical face mask while the patient was breathing spontaneously. Tachycardia, hypertension, and clinically insufficient analgesia or anesthesia were controlled with 1 mg/kg dose of intravenous ketamine. The tachycardia was defined as heart rate faster than 100 beats/min, and hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) more than 180 mm Hg. Autonomic or somatic signs of insufficient anesthesia included lacrimation, sweating and flushing. Hypotension was treated primarily by increasing the intravenous infusion and additionally with vasoactive drugs. Bradycardia, defined as heart rate slower than 45 beats/min, was treated with intravenous atropine (0.01 mg/kg).</p><p>Anesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized for all patients. All groups were assessed for changes in heart rate and systolic arterial pressure intraoperatively and psychomimetic effects with behavioral changes postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Postoperative follow-up</title><p>The patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and monitored for at least 3 hours or until there were no signs of any drug-induced effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension/hypertension, tachycardia/bradycardia and emergence delirium. The patients were treated with ondansetron hydrochloride 0.1 mg/kg IV, atropine 0.01 mg/kg and vasoactive drugs, in case of these complications. Postoperative sedation and orientation in place and time, and digit symbol substitution test (DSST ) were also assessed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] At the end of PACU period, the occurrence of hallucinations, confusion, agitation or unpleasant dreams was recorded (yes or no) and assessed on a 3-grade scale (1-mild; 2-moderate; and 3-severe) based on patients&#x02032; subjective estimates.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study population size and statistical analyses</title><p>The sample size was decided in consultation with a statistician and was based on initial pilot observations, which indicated that approximately 30 - 33 patients should be included in each group in order to ensure power 0.80 for detecting clinically meaningful reduction in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure and emergence delirium by 10 - 20%. Assuming a 5% dropout rate, the final sample size was set at 80 patients.</p><p>The results obtained in the study were tabulated and analyzed using Microsoft Excel, and SPSS software for windows. Hemodynamic variables were represented as mean&#x000b1;SD. Analyses for postoperative sedation and performance were applied to the measurements from 15 min or 30 min until 3 hours.

It is the only anesthetic available with analgesic, hypnotic and amnesic effects. In spite of several advantages, its anesthetic use has been limited due to its cardiostimulant response even in therapeutic doses. After an intravenous dose, the heart rate increases progressively up to 33% for 10&#x02013;15 min and then subsides. The net effect is an increase in mean arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output as observed by Knox et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and Gupta et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Numerous drugs have been evaluated for attenuation of cardiovascular effects of ketamine. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of intravenous premedication with midazolam and dexmedetomidine on ketamine-induced hemodynamic pressor response and psychomimetic effects.</p><p>A benzodiazepine (midazolam) premedication abolishes the post-anesthetic psychomimetic effects of ketamine by closing the NMDA receptors, while an &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor agonist induces central sympatholysis by activating presynaptic autoreceptors. Thus, dexmedetomidine induces sedation via central nervous system receptors which differ from those induced by the benzodiazepines drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] The other possible benefits include decreased postoperative shivering, decreased anesthetic and analgesic requirements and to provide sedation and anxiolysis.</p><p>In the present study, at doses that induced comparable and clinically adequate sedation in our healthy patients, premedication with dexmedetomidine was more effective than midazolam for attenuation of ketamine-induced intraoperative hypertension, tachycardia and postoperative unpleasant dreams. Thus, the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine and midazolam appear to be qualitatively different. Several studies have demonstrated the clinical utility of combining midazolam with ketamine in mitigating ketamine-induced adverse effects for providing total intravenous anesthesia. Taittoven <italic>et al</italic>. compared clonidine and midazolam as premedication agents and observed no differences in oxygen consumption, anxiolysis, energy expenditure and carbon dioxide production. The clonidine premedication improved hemodynamic stability and protected against the pressure response to laryngoscopy and intubation. Thus, pharmacodynamic profile of clonidine appears to be suitable for combination with ketamine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>In a recent study by Munro <italic>et al</italic>., 300 &#x003bc;g oral clonidine was found to be more effective than 1.5 mg/kg intravenous lidocaine in preventing the cardiostimulatory effects of ketamine. There was statistically significant increase in heart rate and arterial blood pressure after ketamine induction. The partial attenuation could be due to the smooth muscle relaxation effect of lignocaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The hemodynamic results of our study are in agreement with the results obtained for clonidine. Compared with clonidine, dexmedetomidine is about 10 times more selective toward the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor and acts as a full agonist in some pharmacologic tests. The effects of dexmedetomidine on sympathetic tone are opposite to those of ketamine, resulting in reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Levanen et al. reported that premedication with 2.5 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine is effective in attenuating the cardiostimulatory and post-anesthetic delirium effects of ketamine and reported its superiority over midazolam in a dose of 0.07 mg/kg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The psychomimetic effects of ketamine appear to be linearly related to the venous plasma concentration, and thus, oral ketamine causes fewer side effects, perhaps because of the smaller plasma levels.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Clinically significant respiratory depression was not seen in any of the patients. Intraoperatively, none of our patients had shown fall in oxygen saturation. No patient required a nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal airway to maintain the patency of airway. This is similar to what was seen in a study conducted by two studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] or it may be due to appropriate speed of injecting ketamine. Recovery from anesthesia often results in pain and elevated catecholamine concentrations. At the same time, anesthesia residuals compromise breathing. The &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonists may prove beneficial in the postoperative period because of their sympatholytic and analgesic effects without causing respiratory depression.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, dexmedetomidine increased perioperative bradycardia (defined as heart rate below 45 beats/min) and the subsequent use of atropine, suggesting that an anticholinergic drug should be given routinely before induction with ketamine. Ketamine increases salivary and tracheobronchial mucus secretion, further necessitating prophylactic administration of an antisialagogue.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Glycopyrrolate, which does not penetrate the blood brain barrier, would be a rational choice.</p><p>It has to be recognized that our patient population and surgical procedure did not represent the normal clinical circumstances for the use of ketamine. More relevant patient populations should be studied before any final conclusions or recommendations are made concerning this combination. The experience of dexmedetomidine in elderly patients is limited; the possible anti-ischemic properties of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> agonist could be beneficial as they reduce the incidence of the myocardial ischemic episodes in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine premedication has effectively and safely attenuated the ketamine-induced hemodynamic pressor response and psychomimetic effects. Due to its tendency to cause bradycardia, routine use of an anticholinergic drug should be considered. The sympatholytic and antinociceptive effects of dexmedetomidine may prove beneficial for high-risk surgical patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of
