This group exhibits an unusual pattern of long-term pulmonary dysfunction. We report on Phase I of a two-phase clinical trial; the second Phase will be a randomized controlled trial testing digital delivery of the intervention. Subjects were recruited in the Northeastern US; testing and intervention were administered in 4 major cities. The intervention involved 12 h of training in Meditative Movement practices. Based on recent research on the effects of nicotine on fear learning, and the influence of the autonomic nervous system on immune function, our hypothesis was that this training would improve autonomic function and thus benefit a range of health measures. Primary outcomes were the 6-min walk test and blood levels of C-reactive protein. Pulmonary, cardiovascular, autonomic, and affective measures were also taken. Fourteen participants completed the training and post-testing. There was a 53% decrease in high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05), a 7% reduction in systolic blood pressure (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05), a 13% increase in the 6-min walk test (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.005), and significant positive changes in several other outcomes. These results tend to confirm the hypothesized benefits of MM training for this population, and indicate that autonomic function may be important in the etiology and treatment of their symptoms. No adverse effects were reported.

At the time that they were hired, they were required to be in good health. They were exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke (SHCS) in the course of their often vigorous work activities, as well as to a wide range of other stressors (including interpersonal stress, aviation-associated threats and emergencies, disrupted diurnal rhythms and polluted air (Crawford and Holcomb, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Grajewski et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Repace, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Sutton et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Recent studies (Whelan et al., <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Arjomandi et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; McNeely et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) demonstrate significant rates of abnormal pulmonary function in this population: air trapping, reduced flow at mid-volume, reduced exercise tolerance, and significantly elevated rates of chronic bronchitis and sinusitis. There are also increased rates of cardiac disease, depression and anxiety (Pinkerton et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), sleep disturbances, skin and reproductive cancers and hearing loss (Czura, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; McNeely et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Many of these symptoms are also co-morbidities of COPD (Shrikrishna and Hopkinson, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vestbo et al., <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>).</p><p>The magnitude and nature of these pulmonary abnormalities do not meet the standard criteria of COPD using the Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) to Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) ratio (Vestbo et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>) (now recognized as an unreliable criterion at the individual level). In addition, Han et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) have proposed that there is significant heterogeneity in the clinical symptoms of COPD and that a broader definition may be warranted to characterize its differing phenotypes. COPD is thought to be irreversible; and this and the hypothesized effects of cigarette smoke (CS)on the autonomic nervous system may in part account for the lasting nature of tobacco smoke exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Current lack of treatments aimed at FA</title><p>The nature of the morbidities experienced by FA exposed to SHCS is poorly defined. The significance and etiology of the clusters of pathology mentioned above is not clear. Apart from the screening studies noted above, little has been published that serves to define or to suggest treatments for these specific patterns of symptoms. Treatment tends to be directed at the primary symptom, and the possible significance of clusters of co-occurring symptoms is rarely examined.</p><p>Our work with FA has led us to examine the role of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activation in this population of first responders, whose job is &#x0201c;to perform vital crewmember functions onboard air carrier aircraft, including emergency functions for aircraft evacuations, firefighting, first aid, and response to security threats&#x0201d; (Ballough, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In addition to its role as a principal cause of COPD (Moritsugu, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>), cigarette smoke (CS) has been shown to affect the ANS via its influence on fear learning (Gould, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Exposure to CS at the time of stressful experience potentiates fear conditioning (Davis et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Cohen et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Kutlu and Gould, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and makes long-term post-traumatic stress and autonomic imbalance more likely (van der Velden et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). This imbalance of the ANS negatively affects the immune, cardiovascular, respiratory and musculoskeletal systems and may reinforce the pathological changes triggered directly in the lungs by CS. The possible role of autonomic disturbance induced by workplace exposure to SHCS in causing pulmonary, immune or affective disorders has largely been ignored, and as far as we know, no therapeutic approaches specifically aimed at such conditions have been proposed. Our selection of tests and of the MM/qigong intervention are informed by this perspective.</p></sec><sec><title>Qigong</title><p>Qigong, a traditional Chinese health practice, has been used in China for hundreds of years in treating people with respiratory, autonomic and immune dysfunction (Johnson, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Qigong includes a large range of practices using specific postures, movements, breathing patterns and visualizations to treat disease and improve health. Many of these practices have a broad positive influence on a range of pathologies (Lee, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Dong and Bergren, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), and tend to restore physiological functions to normal range (Cohen, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). Qigong, Tai Chi and Hatha Yoga, have been proposed to constitute a novel category of exercise, &#x0201c;meditative movement&#x0201d; (MM) (Larkey et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Specific MM practices have been shown to be an effective intervention for COPD (Ng et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Chan et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and to be equivalent or superior to conventional pulmonary rehabilitation in benefiting several of its symptoms (Xu et al., <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Ng et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). MM has also been shown to benefit the immune system, both reducing chronic systemic inflammation (Jahnke et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and increasing the effectiveness of acquired immune response to infection (Wang et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). MM practices help restore functionality to the ANS (Sun and Yan, <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Lee et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2003a</xref>,<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), and also benefit depression and anxiety (Payne and Crane-Godreau, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and improve quality of life in many chronic diseases (Chan and Larson, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Wang et al., <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). MM also induces positive states of mind through focusing awareness on interoceptive and proprioceptive experiences (Payne and Crane-Godreau, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We believe MM could prove to be of specific benefit to the particular problems experienced by FA exposed to SHCS, especially in view of the possible linking factor of autonomic imbalance.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>Our aim was to determine the effects of a novel form of MM/Qigong training by pre-and post-testing of pulmonary, autonomic and immune function in a cohort of FA previously exposed to occupational SHCS.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>All aspects of this study were approved by the Dartmouth IRB (CPHS # 28572).

Primary outreach was through existing flight attendant organizations and networks, social media and flight attendant events, as well as in collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health Flight Attendant Health Study. Social media and audio-visual support were provided by the Department of Health Behavior at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, NY.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and controls</title><p>This was a pilot study designed, in part, to select the most useful exercises, and a control group was not warranted.

In addition, participants were required to attend at least 12 h of in-person training sessions and focus group feedback sessions provided in central locations over a 4-month period. They were also required to have devices on which to listen to audio and watch video instruction, and be willing to do so. Pregnancy or planned pregnancy, as well as cognitive impairment, severe emotional problems, or physical inability to perform the exercises, were grounds for exclusion. Participants were asked not to modify their lifestyle significantly during the study period apart from the practice required by the study. Since each participant acted as his/her own control, we did not exclude on the basis of medication use.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> shows the overall experimental design of this study. Initial recruiting outreach was followed by enrolling and consenting participants, and administering pre-intervention testing.

Following the training, the same battery of tests was administered again.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Timeline Chart</bold>.

The content of the training shifted over time in response to participant compliance and feedback. All participants were asked to complete 12 mandatory hours of class time over a period of 4&#x02013;5 months. Classes were offered at approximately 1 month intervals at convenient locations. There were between 2 and 7 participants at each class; at a given location classes were usually offered on two consecutive days to accommodate participants' schedules. There was an initial focus on exercises to be practiced at specific times, but in response to participant feedback the emphasis shifted to practices that could be integrated with daily life, such as standing, walking, and sitting. The practices involved static postures or slow and gentle movement, with encouragement to attend to kinesthetic and interoceptive experience and to focus on specific mental images. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows one of the authors (PP) demonstrating a practice. Detailed written descriptions, audio files, and access to videos of the exercises are available (Payne and Crane-Godreau, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2016b</xref>,<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>,<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">d</xref>).

Participants were also asked to maintain a log of their experiences during the training. They were provided with printed sheets for recording their practice sessions as well as an online Survey Monkey page (Payne and Crane-Godreau, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2016e</xref>). All feedback was regularly reviewed by the researchers and instructors to evaluate the exercises for acceptability and compliance. The researchers communicated by email and phone with participants who were not responsive to requests for online feedback.</p><p>As described elsewhere (Payne et al., <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), during the study we selected and refined the specific set of practices taught to participants, including simple postural practices, such as standing and sitting, moving practices, such as walking, and specific limb movements, as well as simple breathing. These practices were accompanied by directed attention to environmental, interoceptive and kinesthetic awareness. Participants were asked to integrate these practices into the course of their daily lives.</p><p>Participants were instructed to discontinue the exercises (in the class or at home) immediately if they experienced any of the following: dizziness, rapid or irregular heart-beat, sudden or excessive dyspnea, chest pain, significant pain anywhere in the body, pressure in the head, headache.

Autonomic dysfunction, reduced functional ability, and increased systemic inflammation are all co-morbidities of COPD. These results are in line with other studies of the effects of Qigong, specifically on respiratory disease (Ng et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) as well as on other health factors (Jahnke et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), supporting the possibility that Qigong may be a useful therapeutic intervention for our target population. Elevated blood pressure, systemic inflammation, autonomic imbalance and reduced functional ability are all strong risk factors for a variety of pathologies, especially in the elderly, suggesting that Qigong practice may have preventive and ameliorative health effects in FA exposed to SHCS and possibly in other populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Our intervention was effective in the primary outcomes, the 6MWT and hs-CRP. There was a 13% increase in the distance walked in the 6MWT. This indicates that, despite no significant change in FEV1 or FVC, participants had a substantial and significant increase in functional ability. This outcome was not unique to this study (Chan et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ng et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). The intervention itself contained no form of aerobic exercise or resistance training; we speculate that the change is due to increased efficiency of body use and movement patterns and a more responsive autonomic nervous system. Other studies have shown increases in strength and bone density due to Qigong practice apparently not due to conventional exercise factors (Lin, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Wayne et al., <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>There was a more than 50% decrease in average hs-CRP. 10 of 14 participants improved, 2 stayed the same at low levels, and two increased. All 4 participants with levels over the clinical norm (3.0) reduced substantially, 3 to below the clinical threshold. These results are likely of clinical relevance. In a cohort of women, average age 68, systemic inflammation would be expected to increase with advancing age, and is a risk factor for the development of many diseases of the elderly, including cardiovascular disease, COPD, diabetes, and cancer (Il'yasova et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Franceschi et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Guarner and Rubio-Ruiz, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Inflammation is associated with autonomic dysfunction (Black, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; McGovern and Mazzone, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Mirakaj et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), so this result is compatible with the hypothesis that the reduction in hs-CRP may be due in part to improved autonomic function. Studies of qigong have shown positive effects on inflammation as well as AD (Lee et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Jahnke et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), and there are both speculative (Pavlov and Tracey, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and well-established (Felten, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) links between the autonomic and immune systems which could provide a mechanism for these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcome measures provided an opportunity to look at the impact of qigong on conditions co-morbid with COPD. These measures included blood pressure, resting and post-6MWT heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, the COPD Assessment Test (CAT), spirometry, Borg Dyspnea Inventory, the COMPASS 31, the Zung Inventories of Anxiety and Depression, the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness (MAIA), and Vitamin D.</p><p>Cardiovascular measures improved substantially. There was a significant decrease of 7% in average resting systolic blood pressure. 11 out of 14 participants showed reduced systolic blood pressure, and the numbers of subjects above the clinical threshold of 140 mgHg reduced from 4 to 1. There was also an almost significant 12% drop in average pulse pressure. Although the decrease in diastolic pressure did not reach significance, in all three blood pressure-related measures (systolic, diastolic and pulse pressures), the number of participants above accepted clinical range diminished substantially, a result which may be meaningful in clinical terms. Also, resting heart rate decreased significantly by 6%. Since the intervention did not include any forms of conventional physical exercise known to decrease blood pressure or resting heart rate, we speculate that improved autonomic cardiovascular control may be responsible. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that there was a substantial (42%) increase in the change of heart rate after the 6MWT. Although this change did not quite reach significance, it is evidence of a more dynamic cardiovascular autonomic control.</p><p>In comparing the graphs of the changes in the 6MWT, hs-CRP and systolic blood pressure, we note that in the measures having a clinical threshold, the change was toward a normal clinical level rather than an across-the-board change. In systolic blood pressure and hs-CRP, values in the normal range showed relatively little change whereas values outside clinical range moved into normal range, with the amount of change approximately proportional to the prior deviation from normal. However, the 6MWT by contrast showed a fairly uniform amount of change regardless of baseline value. Qigong practice claims to normalize physiological variables rather than simply to reduce or increase them in a linear fashion (Cohen, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>); these results are consistent with this claim.</p><p>In addition to objective measures, we included questionnaires to evaluate self-reported autonomic symptoms, affective state and bodily awareness. These are important for evaluating quality of life and changes in cognitive and affective functioning.</p><p>The COMPASS 31, a questionnaire evaluating general autonomic function, dropped from 15 to 11.5. This 24% change was significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05), and supports the hypothesis of improved autonomic function as a result of the intervention.</p><p>The Zung Anxiety score dropped from 29.4 to 26.9 (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05), a significant 8% drop. Since anxiety is associated with autonomic imbalance (increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic activity), this result too is compatible with improved autonomic function, as well as being important for better health and quality of life.</p><p>The MAIA is designed to measure the degree of awareness a person has of their bodily feelings, and the comfort they have with these feelings. This is hypothesized to relate to the capacity for self-regulation (Farb, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Payne et al., <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This capacity includes the ability of the prefrontal cortex, insula and anterior cingulate gyrus to modulate arousal in the limbic system and hypothalamus (Critchley et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Craig, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The significant 8% increase in the MAIA score is consistent with the hypothesis that our intervention acted in part by improving autonomic functioning via increased top-down control.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible mechanisms</title><p>The mechanisms for the long-term pathological effects of SHCS exposure are only partly understood. Our results suggest an overlooked role for the ANS. Cigarette smoke (CS), whether inhaled directly or second-hand, is known to be a principle cause of COPD and its comorbidities as well as other respiratory system disorders (Moritsugu, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In COPD, inflammation, mucous secretion and plasma extravasation are in excess, and antigen responsiveness is inhibited, all together giving rise to pathology. The pulmonary pathology of COPD is accompanied by systemic abnormalities including inflammation and neuro-humoral activation (Andreas et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), as well as multiple co-morbidities, including cardiovascular, immune, musculoskeletal and affective disorders (Sin et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Fabbri et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Although only one of the FA recruited for the present study had COPD as defined by the GOLD standard FEV1/FVC&#x0003c;0.70 (Vestbo et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>), many of them manifested pulmonary dysfunction (as previously noted by Arjomandi) as well as other symptoms that are recognized as co-morbidities of COPD (Vestbo et al., <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>). Both core pathology and the co-morbidities of COPD are known to be associated with chronic dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) (van Gestel and Steier, <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In addition, it is recognized that AD adversely influences the immune system (Czura, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>), predisposing to inflammation, infections and cancer, all of which are associated with COPD (Libert, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Czura, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Pavlov and Tracey, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Emerging evidence from human epidemiology and animal testing suggests that the presence of nicotine within the body may alter the susceptibility of the nervous system to long-term dysfunction. CS exposure during stress has been shown to strengthen learned fear responses (Davis et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Elias et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kutlu and Gould, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In mouse model studies, long-term fear memory is strengthened. In human epidemiological studies, there appears to be an increased likelihood of developing chronic or post-traumatic stress with consequent autonomic dysfunction (van der Velden et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). ANS dysfunction negatively affects the immune, cardiovascular, respiratory, and musculoskeletal systems. It seems likely that this may reinforce the pathological pulmonary changes triggered by cigarette smoke through its direct effect on lung tissue. In this model the effects of CS on fear learning and consequent ANS imbalance are an intrinsic part of the etiology of COPD and COPD-related symptoms. This concept is a distinct break from most previous literature, which has documented self-medication through nicotine use in those who already have affective disorders. However, there is evidence that nicotine exposure precedes and exacerbates the effects of exposure to stress or trauma (Elias et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Since FA are first responders and are at risk for high-stress exposure, we believe that the hypothesis that systemic co-morbidities of COPD may be exacerbated by cigarette smoke exposure at or close to the time of stressful or traumatic events deserves further consideration.</p></sec><sec><title>Generalizability</title><p>This study addressed a specific population, FA exposed to second-hand cigarette smoke. This, and the requirement to attend classes, effectively limited the population to females over 49 with reasonable functional ability. The generalizability of these results to the non-FA population, males, younger people, and those with more severe pathology remains to be established; however given the results of other qigong studies with different populations, it appears likely that similar results would be obtained.</p><p>However, in comparing our results with those of other studies of MM, we note that the intervention we developed differs from other MM practices in that it emphasizes integrating the principles of MM practice with daily life, rather than setting aside specific times for practice as is done in most studies (Ng and Tsang, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). We believe there are both advantages and disadvantages to this approach, involving both effectiveness and compliance.</p><p>As we have said elsewhere (Payne and Crane-Godreau, <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we believe that precise and complete descriptions of qigong interventions are essential in order to enable comparisons between different studies. Details of this intervention are available as supplementary materials to this paper, and a full description and analysis of the exercise selection process, the final choice of exercises, and issues of participant compliance will be published separately. Compliance in particular remains a significant issue, and we plan future studies to explore ways of increasing both compliance and effectiveness of this form of intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The large percentage of participants failing to complete the study is a possible source of bias. This study was not designed to accommodate people with significant levels of affective disturbance. In some cases, affective disturbance only became apparent to us after participants had been consented and had begun to undergo testing. Improved screening is indicated in future similar studies. Life-style was claimed as the reason for non-completion of this study by non-Caucasian participants; we are exploring how to effectively reach a more diverse population.</p><p>In this study, we did not use a control group. Since our purpose was to determine which MM exercises are most effective and best tolerated, use of a control group would not have been appropriate. This however diminishes the power of results from the pre-and post-intervention tests as it is not possible determine with certainty whether results are due to attention, seasonal or other factors. However, we are currently proceeding with the RCT stage of the study (Phase II), using an attention/health education control group, which will provide a well-controlled validation of the effects of the selected MM exercises. It is however possible that positive results from the testing in Phase I, followed by negative results from Phase II, might reflect the ineffectiveness of digital delivery rather than the ineffectiveness of the intervention. In this case an RCT testing in-person delivery would be indicated.</p><p>The 6MWT is known to be influenced by motivation (Southard and Gallagher, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Every precaution has been taken by the researchers to standardize the administration of the test. Nonetheless, in the Selection stage, subjects may be more highly motivated in the post-test situation, and this could skew results. As mentioned above, the use of a control group in the RCT stage will provide a check on these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Future directions</title><p>We are currently conducting Phase II of this study, a randomized controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of digital delivery of these practices. Results from this will indicate whether we need to further refine our method of delivery, or whether we should explore ways of making this material immediately available to FA. In Phase II we are using wearable Holter EKG monitors to analyze heart rate variability. These measures will allow us to test further the hypothesis that the benefits of these practices are due to improved autonomic function, as well as to examine the relative contributions of sympathetic and parasympathetic factors to the reduction of systemic inflammation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Replication and supplemental materials</title><p>Materials necessary for verification and replication of our results, in addition to supplemental materials, have been deposited at the Harvard Dataverse.
