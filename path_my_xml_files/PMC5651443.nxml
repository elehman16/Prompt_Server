The mean level of soluble A&#x003b2; in the brain parenchyma is increased 3-fold in patients with AD compared with age-matched controls and correlates highly with measures of tau reactivity in tangles and plaques, as well as neurofibrillary tangle density <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Reducing amyloid deposits in brain may be warranted in some subpopulations of mild-to-moderate AD. However, amyloid is thought to begin accumulating long before the clinical symptoms of AD appear; therefore, removal of A&#x003b2; from brains of patients who have already progressed to dementia may have limited value.</p><p>The brains of patients with AD also typically display cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a pathological condition caused by the progressive deposition of A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub> surrounding cerebral blood vessel walls <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Although comorbidity of AD and CAA is almost universal, there are clear distinctions between them, such as the A&#x003b2; species being deposited (A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;42</sub> in AD vs. A&#x003b2;<sub>1&#x02013;40</sub> in CAA), the location of the A&#x003b2; deposits (brain parenchyma vs. brain vasculature), and the presence of cerebral microhemorrhages that are the signature of CAA <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Current therapeutic options for AD provide limited clinical benefit. Recent advances in the development of therapies targeting A&#x003b2; include the anti-A&#x003b2; antibodies bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and aducanumab <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Although the approach initially appeared promising, bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similarly, solanezumab failed to significantly improve cognitive or functional ability in patients with mild-to-moderate AD <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, although secondary analyses suggested that it may be associated with less worsening of cognition than placebo in individuals with mild AD <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Data from the extension arm of the solanezumab studies using a delayed-start design indicated a potential modifying effect on underlying disease progression <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. A phase-Ib study is currently under way to evaluate aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal or mild AD (PRIME, NCT01677572) <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The double-blind portion showed a statistically significant reduction of brain amyloid as assessed by the florbetapir PET scan. Clinical progression also appeared to be slowed, although amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs; magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] signal changes thought to represent vasogenic edema and cerebral microhemorrhage) were commonly observed adverse events (AEs), raising some safety concerns <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

It binds only to soluble A&#x003b2; and has a low propensity to induce immune responses <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Ponezumab's primary mechanism of action is believed to be sequestration of A&#x003b2; in the blood and shifting the brain-blood equilibrium toward the periphery, thereby depleting central A&#x003b2; stores (the peripheral sink hypothesis).

However, treatment did not alter CSF biomarkers, brain volumetrics, or clinical outcomes compared with placebo. For these reasons, development of ponezumab for mild-to-moderate AD has been discontinued.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0010"><label>1.</label><p>Systematic review: The authors reviewed the scientific literature on amyloid-targeted therapies in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease, using traditional sources (e.g., PubMed) and congress presentations.
