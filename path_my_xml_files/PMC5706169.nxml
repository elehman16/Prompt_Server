Challenges in addressing this problem include difficulties engaging men in weight loss programs as they tend to view these programs as contrary to the masculine narrative of independence and self-reliance. Researchers have been turning towards sports fans to engage men in health promotion programs as sports fans are typically male, and tend to have poor health habits.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Developed from the highly successful gender-sensitized Football Fans in Training program, Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) recruited 80 male hockey fans of the London Knights and Sarnia Sting who were overweight or obese into a weekly, 90-minute classroom education and group exercise program held over 12&#x000a0;weeks; a 40-week minimally-supported phase followed. A process evaluation of the Hockey FIT program was completed alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial and outcome evaluation in order to fully explore the acceptability of the Hockey FIT program from the perspectives of coaches delivering and participants engaged in the program. Data sources included attendance records, participant focus groups, coach interviews, assessment of fidelity (program observations and post-session coach reflections), and 12-month participant interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Coaches enjoyed delivering the program and found it simple to deliver. Men valued being among others of similar body shape and similar weight loss goals, and found the knowledge they gained through the program helped them to make and maintain health behaviour changes. Suggested improvements include having more hockey-related information and activities, greater flexibility with timing of program delivery, and greater promotion of technology support tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">We confirmed Hockey FIT was an acceptable &#x0201c;gender-sensitized&#x0201d; health promotion program for male hockey fans&#x000a0;who were overweight or obese.

Men were randomized (1:1) to intervention (Hockey FIT program) or comparator (Wait-list Control, beginning Hockey FIT 12&#x000a0;weeks later).</p><p id="Par21">The Hockey FIT program consisted of a 12-week active phase delivered at local GoodLife Fitness clubs or OHL team hockey arenas (when available), followed by a 40-week minimally-supported phase. The active phase involved 12 weekly, 90-minute classroom education and group-based exercise sessions delivered by trained Hockey FIT coaches. Coaches were graduate students and hockey team staff. In-between program sessions, participants were encouraged to engage in an incremental pedometer-based walking program and set/tracked lifestyle prescriptions for physical activity (steps), exercise and healthy eating. During the 40-week minimally-supported phase, participants were encouraged to access the following support tools: 1) the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; smartphone app providing tools to track and sustain physical activity; 2) a private online Hockey FIT social network (powered by Tyze Personal Networks: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tyze.com">http://tyze.com</ext-link>/) for each site, only accessible to coaches and participants to share resources and support; 3) six motivational email messages (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and an invitation to a 9&#x000a0;month booster session and reunion.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Standardized Coach Messages Sent During 40&#x000a0;Week Minimally Supported Phase</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Maintenance Week 4: How&#x02019;s it going?</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hi Guys,<break/>&#x02003;Just wanted to take some time to check in and see how everyone is doing. I really enjoyed working with you guys during our 12&#x000a0;weeks together, and I hope that you have had success continuing to apply the healthy living knowledge you gained during the program. In addition, hopefully you all have managed to maintain your weight loss after the program ended; remember to continue to weigh yourself often to keep track of where you&#x02019;re at. How have you guys been tracking your daily activities? The HealtheSteps&#x02122; app or on paper? Recall our discussion on barriers - it is important to plan for setbacks and use SMART goals if you find yourself going off track. It seems like you guys have been enjoying our online group thus far, please continue to use the group to post any healthy living, hockey, or just plain funny content.<break/>&#x02003;Hope everyone is well,<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Week 11: Still going well?</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hi Guys,<break/>&#x02003;It&#x02019;s now been some time since we finished the program, and hopefully everyone has been working hard to maintain their improvements. If you have not already done so, go back and check your average daily step count from at the end of the program. How does your current step count average compare? If the two averages are similar, what has helped you maintain your step count? Post some advice or tips that have helped you on the Dressing Room wall for the guys who haven&#x02019;t been able to maintain their numbers. The HealtheSteps&#x02122; app is a great way of staying motivated and keeping track of your steps. Additionally, if you ever want to get in touch with the other guys to organize a ball hockey game, trip to see the Knights/Sting, or any other meet-up, feel free to use the messaging tool.<break/>&#x02003;Hope everyone is well,<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Week 22: Still on target?</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hey Guys,<break/>&#x02003;Hope everything is well. Has everyone been able to maintain their end-of-program weight? Remember to weigh yourself weekly to track how much you have lost since the beginning of the program. If you have been losing weight, that&#x02019;s awesome. As you now know, reducing your weight also reduces your risk for a variety of diseases, including heart failure, diabetes, and cancer. If your eating habits have been going a little off track, remember to make your goals SMART to keep focused. Just as a reminder, we will be organizing a little 9-month reunion so you will be able to see all the other guys and talk about how the months after the program have been going. Until then, continue to use the HealtheSteps&#x02122; App and post on the group to share recipes, exercises, articles, or other hockey stuff.<break/>&#x02003;Hope everyone is well,<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Week 28: Looking forward</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hey Guys,<break/>&#x02003;It was great to see some of you at the reunion a few weeks ago. Even though we don&#x02019;t have any more formal reunions planned for you guys before your final measurement session with us, we want to remind you to continue using the network to support one another and set up your own get-togethers. Speaking with some of you a few weeks ago, it sounds like you have organized a couple of exercise sessions on your own which is great to hear! If you haven&#x02019;t met up with any of the guys but you would like to, don&#x02019;t hesitate to post your ideas on your network and we are sure you will find some takers.<break/>&#x02003;Also, we would like to remind you once again to continue your daily or weekly weigh-ins to track your progress and if you find that you have reached a plateau or had a set-back, it may be time to go back to first principles and set some SMART goals again! Don&#x02019;t get discouraged if you find yourself off-track, reach out to others on the network and I am sure that there will be loads of supportive words and ideas for you.<break/>&#x02003;Hope everyone is well,<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Week 32: Reflecting on the process</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hey Guys,<break/>&#x02003;I hope you are starting to enjoy the warmer weather. I just wanted to check in and remind you to reflect on whether your exercise and diet routines are still healthy and that you are maintaining the changes that you had made during the 12&#x000a0;weeks of training sessions. You all did a great job incorporating your new knowledge about healthy lifestyles into your own daily living and we want to remind you how important it is to continue to use those skills. If you are ever questioning whether you have slipped back into old habits, set some SMART goals for next week and then reflect on whether you were able to meet them. If you find yourself running into new situations where making healthy choices may be difficult, ask others for suggestions about how they may have handled them (eg. Eating well while traveling, or exercising when at a cottage for the weekend).<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance Week 37: Hockey FIT for life?</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Hey Guys,<break/>&#x02003;Congrats everyone, it has now been almost a year since you started the program. Now we want you to think back to those weight loss tips which you found most useful during the program and consider how often you still use them. Some people have found this program to be life-changing and we hope that you will continue to use the tools and tips that you learned as part of the program to maintain your weight loss or increased physical activity. We also want to take this opportunity to wish you good luck in the future and remind you to continue to use the HealtheSteps&#x02122; App and to stay in touch with each other using this network. You all supported each other so much during the program and maintaining those relationships or even reaching out to new friends will help you maintain your healthy lifestyle. Remember the network is also a great place to post ideas about pick-up hockey games or other activities that you may be getting involved in. I look forward to seeing you guys in a couple weeks and hearing about your successes in the past 12&#x000a0;months.<break/>&#x02003;Keep your stick on the ice.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

The research team met and a framework of overarching codes was developed off of which new codes could be added based on the findings from the 12 month interviews. The 12-month interviews were reviewed by the research team and new codes were added to the framework. Fidelity data (program observations and post-session coach reflections) were read through by two members of the research team and summarized. Key tasks missed were identified through the program observations and supplemented by the post-session coach reflections along with suggestions for improving program delivery.

Coaches enjoyed seeing the men progress throughout the program and the friendships that were developed, <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;to see these guys from day one, they were nervous, coming in to a baseline assessment and not knowing exactly what they were doing, and then from week 12 where now they&#x02019;re trying to organize golf games together and really enjoying each other&#x02019;s company, so that was fun to watch. And then from a research side it was also extremely fun because you could physically see changes in these guys&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-2).</p><p id="Par27">The&#x000a0;coaches valued the relationships they developed with participants knowing they were helping the men improve their lifestyles, &#x0201c;<italic>My favorite part was just interacting with these guys every week and really building a rapport with them and knowing within myself I&#x02019;m helping people, I&#x02019;m helping 15 guys out here that want to be helped&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-1).</p><p id="Par28">Some coaches felt they were &#x0201c;lecturing&#x0201d; participants at the beginning of the program in part due to the greater amount of classroom content and becoming familiar with the flow of the sessions. This changed as the program progressed, <italic>&#x0201c;Once we got into sessions 4 and 5 though I thought that it started to flow, it was a lot easier to deliver, it wasn&#x02019;t quite as much me lecturing, it was more sort of facilitating discussions among them&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-4). One of the coaches also identified feeling more comfortable with the physical activity portion of the program compared to delivering the nutrition information, <italic>&#x0201c;I felt more comfortable doing the exercise [components]. I&#x02019;ve been coaching since I was 15 so it&#x02019;s easy for me now that I can try to motivate people and I have a better idea of the body in a physical aspect than I do in a nutritional aspect&#x0201d;</italic> (C1&#x02013;1)<italic>.</italic>
</p><p id="Par29">As indicated by Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the attendance dropped mid-program. A coach described how they felt this made the program more difficult to deliver, <italic>&#x0201c;that was a barrier to overcome because a lot of the program is interaction and you want guys to be talking and coming up with ideas so if you only have 9 in a group and you only have one group of 5, one group of 4, it&#x02019;s a lot harder than if you had 4 groups of 4 or 5, where you have more ideas coming out&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-1).</p><p id="Par30">The&#x000a0;coaches did have suggestions for improving the program. One coach expressed concern about participants exercising on the concrete surface of the arena as this can exacerbate previous injuries, <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;I didn&#x02019;t feel like I was giving them the exercises that they needed and again that was because we didn&#x02019;t really take into account the environment that we&#x02019;d be doing those exercises in.&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-4). Timing was a common difficulty noted by coaches throughout the post-session reflections and interviews, <italic>&#x0201c;I wish it was longer, not only number of weeks but I wish it was a 2 hour program instead of an hour and a half because sometimes they had a lot more questions than we anticipated&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-3). More hockey-related content was also suggested by coaches to take greater advantage of the men&#x02019;s common interest, <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;if we did more [hockey] drills with balls and sticks and things like that because they were all such big hockey fans&#x02026;maybe incorporating more of what they all had in common, which was hockey, would have been nice&#x0201d;</italic> (CI-2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Men&#x02019;s experience with Hockey FIT</title><p id="Par31">Participants in the intervention group were on average, 49.1 (SD 9.1) years of age, with the majority being married or common law (87.5%), of Caucasian ethnicity (95%), and having greater than a high school education (67.5%).

Participants compared themselves to each other and were quick to point out those who they felt did not belong, <italic>&#x0201c;Some of it was we wanted to improve our self-image and we didn&#x02019;t like being compared to the model on the front of the magazine concept, and yet we had two [models] in the class&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-1). Others noted that the variation of exercise activities supported the range of physical abilities present in the group, <italic>&#x0201c;I liked the variation because I am not as fit as some of the other guys here, I used to be, but I&#x02019;m not&#x02026;&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-2).</p><p id="Par34">The classroom content was valued by participants as this information both reinforced and added new knowledge to help participants make lifestyle changes, <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;understanding exercise and target heart rate, its impact on obviously your fitness or your calorie burn, those are the things I didn&#x02019;t know&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-1).

And the competition and everything. Everybody said they just wanted to come back&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-2).</p><p id="Par36">Some participants felt the program was rushed to cover all of the content, <italic>&#x0201c;I found that with the class and the exercise it was almost you know, 3 hours squeezed into an hour and a half&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-1). Others were disappointed with the lack of hockey-related content and support from the OHL team personnel, <italic>&#x0201c;I thought that maybe the [OHL] trainer would come out and talk to us a bit about the training, and health, and sports, and exercise&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-2). Some participants suggested involving a dietitian or a chef in a session, <italic>&#x0201c;I can only cook so many types of food, so why not have a chef come in and go over different things to show us how to do it properly&#x0201d;</italic> (FG-1).

Participants found the skills they had gained through the active phase of the program helped them to maintain their health behaviour changes, <italic>&#x0201c;&#x02026;the lessons I learned during Hockey Fit continued to follow me, in the sense of the water, the fruits and the vegetables&#x0201d;</italic> (PI-3, Site 1). The emphasis on making simple lifestyle changes helped participants continue to be physically active, <italic>&#x0201c;I think the attention to the simple thing as walking and staying somewhat fit has helped me stay focused on maintaining what I learned in the program and keep it going&#x0201d;</italic> (PI-7, Site 1). Others noted the skills they learned through the handbook was helpful in maintaining their weight loss goals, <italic>&#x0201c;it was plain and simple, it was on paper, this is what you should do and if you follow this you&#x02019;re probably going to lose weight&#x0201d;</italic> (PI-2, Site 2).

Men admitted their own and other participants lack of interaction on the social network limited the potential of the network to support their progress during the minimally-supported phase, <italic>&#x0201c;It might help if more people were active on it, but I wasn&#x02019;t active on it either so I can&#x02019;t complain about it.

Coaches will be required to complete and pass a test in order to be a certified Hockey FIT coach.</td></tr><tr><td>Nutrition Education</td><td>Coaches found they were less confident delivering the nutrition components as the men would have questions they could not always answer.</td><td>A dietitian has been added to the research team to assist with training coaches on nutrition and to provide resources and tools to assist the coaches with educating participants in nutrition.<break/>A handout on junk food (trans fats, saturated fats, and cholesterol) has been added to compare to the healthier options.</td></tr><tr><td>Timing</td><td>Coaches found the timing was difficult to follow as some content elicited more conversation within the group than others.</td><td>Key tasks for program delivery have been outlined in the coaches handbook for each session to ensure coaches are aware of what tasks must be covered in each session. There are also optional activities included to fill in time if needed.</td></tr><tr><td>Exercise Modifications</td><td>Coaches felt they needed more exercise options to better meet the group needs particularly at the start of the program.</td><td>Modifications have been added to the coach handbook for the exercise components to better meet the variety of participant abilities (Week 1).</td></tr><tr><td>Hockey Skills and Drills</td><td>Coaches identified that participants were disappointed with the lack of hockey skills and drills throughout the program.</td><td>More hockey related facts and exercises will be included through the program.<break/>More sessions at the arena in the latter half of the program will increase the connection to hockey.</td></tr><tr><td>App Usability</td><td>Technical difficulties with the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; smartphone app prevented participants from using the app.</td><td>The technical glitches with the app have been resolved with the latest updates. Coaches will be trained on how to use the app within the program (i.e., heart rate monitoring during exercise), and</td></tr><tr><td>Booster Session and Reunion</td><td>This event was only held in London, and was on the weekend of the Super Bowl resulting in some participants not attending due to distance and conflicting events.</td><td>Having a booster session and reunion in both London and Sarnia and allowing both London and Sarnia participants to attend one of these sessions at either sites would provide more options for more men to attend.</td></tr><tr><td>Hockey FIT Social Network</td><td>Participants were not highly engaged in the use of the social network, only checking the network if a post by a coach or another participant was made.</td><td>A Hockey FIT Social Network smartphone app is being developed. Coaches will post different tasks each week during the 40&#x000a0;week minimally-supported phase for both the intervention and wait-list groups. Participants will receive goals (points) for their team for completing the tasks and posting these on the Hockey FIT Social Network or updating their coach via e-mail if they do not have regular computer access. This includes posting healthy recipes, activities, weekly achievements, etc. The team with the most points at the end of the maintenance phase wins the &#x0201c;Memorial Fan Cup&#x0201d; and an extra prize.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Hockey FIT participants appreciated the program recruited men of similar interest regarding hockey, body size, and weight loss goals. Men felt a connection to each other, and in turn felt obligated to attend sessions and make lifestyle changes in order to contribute to their team. Suggested improvements included adding more hockey related skills and drills, sessions at the arena, more in-depth coach training and nutrition education, exercise modifications, greater opportunity for participants to attend the booster session, and more pro-active use of the Hockey FIT social network to better promote long-term support for health behaviour changes made by the men during the program.</p><p id="Par46">Many of the qualitative findings from the focus groups mirrored the quantitative results of the program exit questionnaires completed by the men directly after the active phase of the program. These quantitative results were published in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. According to results from the questionnaire completed at 12&#x000a0;weeks, 96% of participants found the exercise and educational classroom sessions beneficial to making health behaviour changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. During the focus groups, men had expressed excitement and enthusiasm for coming back to the next session to learn more. All 27 Hockey FIT participants who completed this questionnaire indicated they had made changes to their eating habits as a result of being in the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In the focus groups, there were men who indicated they were now eating breakfast regularly because of Hockey FIT. Although the quantitative results from this questionnaire were positive and important in supporting the acceptability of the program, the focus groups and interviews provided a richer context over which these behaviour changes occurred. This allowed the research team to further understand why certain program components worked well or not well, how Hockey FIT impacted the men&#x02019;s lives both in the short and long term, and the ways in which Hockey FIT can be improved to better meet the needs of participants.</p><p id="Par47">Findings from Hockey FIT including a desire for more sport-specific activities were similar to findings from the FFIT process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The Hockey FIT coaches also enjoyed delivering the program and meeting participants, but felt pressured to stay on time similarly to FFIT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].&#x000a0;We found participants had a strong desire to compete between sites, which speaks to the longstanding rivalry between the two participating major junior hockey teams [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In contrast to FFIT, the standardized messages sent during the 40&#x000a0;week minimally-supported phase were viewed more favourably by the Hockey FIT participants as the men in Hockey FIT may have valued more information and support from coaches to help maintain their health behaviour changes. We also saw a drop in attendance mid-program which may have been a result of running the program in the summer (i.e., vacation).</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par48">There were several limitations to this study. The two head coaches may have responded more positively towards the program during the interview as they were both heavily involved in the development of the Hockey FIT program and materials. Only 15 participants (10 in Sarnia, 5 in London) out of 30 invited participants attended the focus groups limiting the generalizability of these findings to the wider group. Moderators noted one of the focus group participants was more vocal about his experiences with the program than others in the group. This may have swayed the results of the focus group more heavily in favour of this participants&#x02019; experience rather than the entire group. Data were only collected from the intervention group; collecting data from the wait-list group could have deepened our understanding of participants&#x02019; experience with the program. Lastly, there was a low turn-out for the booster session due to a variety of factors (i.e., Super Bowl, weather, and location) limiting the amount of data collected about this event.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par49">This study supports the findings of other gender-sensitized programs targeting sports fans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and provides an innovative and effective approach for engaging men in health promotion interventions and improving men&#x02019;s health. Hockey FIT was found to be a highly acceptable program by both participants and coaches involved in the pilot. Our results indicate only minor changes are needed to optimize Hockey FIT for future implementation in a definitive trial.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par6">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Coach interviews</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFIT</term><def><p id="Par8">Football fans in training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FG</term><def><p id="Par9">Focus groups</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hockey FIT</term><def><p id="Par10">Hockey Fans in Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OHL</term><def><p id="Par11">Ontario Hockey League</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par13">Participant interviews</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pRCT</term><def><p id="Par14">pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par15">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the men who participated in this study, as well as the organizations who provided in-kind support for this study including the London Knights, the Sarnia Sting, and GoodLife Fitness.
