As the destruction of the periodontium progresses apically, the furcation of multirooted teeth is exposed, leading to the irreversible bone loss in the interradicular area.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Molar teeth with furcation involvement are the most common teeth to be lost. Various regenerative procedures have been tried with the aim to obtain furcation closure.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Autogenous intraoral and extraoral bone, frozen bone allografts, freeze-dried bone allografts, calcium phosphate alloplastics, barrier techniques alone and in combination with bone replacement grafts have been used to regenerate lost periodontal structures in Grade II furcation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Among bone grafts, alloplast hold a great promise as a bone graft material.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] &#x003b2;-Tri-calcium phosphate (&#x003b2;-TCP) is a crystalline, biocompatible, and osteoconductive material.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The material is well tolerated, and until now, no adverse effects such as allergic reactions or rejection of the particles have been reported. The histologic analysis following filling of periodontal defects with &#x003b2;-TCP has provided evidence of bone formation around the particles, thus pointing to the good biocompatibility and osteoconductive properties of the material.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Growth factors are naturally occurring polypeptides, functioning as potent biological mediators which stimulate various cellular activities during wound healing.

However, the test groups, i.e. Group I: OFD and PRF and Group II: OFD and &#x003b2;-TCP revealed significant changes as compared to control group (OFD alone).</p><p>Mean PPD, GR, and VCAL variability among three groups observed at baseline were nonsignificant. However, there was the significant decrease in PPD, GR, and gain in VCAL at 6 months in all three groups. Mean change in PPD and VCAL was highest in Group II, followed by Group I and Group III. The mean 6 months in GR was highest in Group I as compared to Group II and Group III at 6 months follow-up as compared to baseline values. Sharma and Pradeep[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Peres <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] also observed significant PPD reduction as well as gain in CAL in Class II/Grade II furcation defects treated with OFD and PRF as compared to OFD alone.</p><p>Mean change in the value of the r-VHF, i.e. c-VDF was statistically significant between Group I versus Group III and between Group II versus Group III. However, the nonsignificant difference was found between Groups I and II. Mean % c-VDF was statistically significant between Group I versus Group III and between Group II versus Group III. However, the nonsignificant difference was found between Group I and Group II. Similar to the present study, Pepelassi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] advocated mean change in V-HOF of 2.31 &#x000b1; 1.77 mm using doxycycline-tri-calcium phosphate composite graft at 6 months in the treatment of Class II/Grade II furcation defect. Peres <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] measured mean change in relative vertical bone level (rVBL) of 1.47 &#x000b1; 1.13 mm at 6 months follow-up, with HA/&#x003b2;-TCP in the treatment of proximal Class II/Grade II furcation defect. On comparing the r-HDF at baseline and 6 months, the significant decrease was found in all groups, and the decrease was highest in Group I, followed by Groups II and III.</p><p>The assessment of radiographic hard tissue parameters such as RTL, V-HOF (radiographic distance from Fx to alveolar crest), Fw (horizontal root separation at alveolar crest), H-DOF, and FA was done with CBCT. To evaluate and correlate the influence of RTL and FA on defect fill of furcation, the present study recorded RTL and FA at baseline. After 6-month follow-up, a significant decrease in V-HOF, i.e. VDF was observed in all groups, and the defect fill was highest in Group I, followed by Group II and Group III. Sharma and Pradeep[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Bajaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] reported almost similar and significant mean bone defect depth fill and % VDF in PRF-treated group when observed radiographically (intraoral periapical radiograph) with computer-aided software in the treatment of mandibular degree II furcation defect. In contrast to above-mentioned studies, we utilized CBCT for measurement of vertical bone loss. Based on the view of Walter <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] results of the present study may demonstrate more accuracy in assessing the furcation defect analysis as compared to the previous study. At 6 months, a significant decrease in H-DOF, i.e. H-DF was seen in all groups and the defect fill was highest in Group II, followed by Group I and Group III.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no publication till now has reported HDF and association of FA with V-HOF and Fw in Class II/Grade II mandibular furcation defect using either PRF or &#x003b2;-TCP using CBCT. Asmita <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported HDF in Class II mandibular furcation using two different forms of bioactive glass. The Pearson correlation analysis showed no association between RTL and FA on mean change in V-HOF and Fw when recorded on CBCT. Nonsignificant baseline mean value of RTL and FA, as well as low sample size, may attribute to this nonsignificant correlation. Horwitz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] in their study on Class II furcation defect stated that a long root trunk and a wide furcation entrance have negative influences on the success of therapy.</p><p>Unlike &#x003b1;-TCP, &#x003b2;-TCP is completely resorbed simultaneously with bone formation and is replaced by vital host bone without residue within 6&#x02013;12 months. Further, local decrease in pH during the dissolution of material or direct chemical bonding of &#x003b2;-TCP with the bone through a reaction between calcium ions in the &#x003b2;-TCP particle, thus minimizes the use of barrier membrane.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] For the present study, commercially available synthetic bone alloplastic resorbable tissue replacement was used that is extremely hydrophilic in nature. It can be drawn into the surgical site and could easily be contoured to fill any bony void, thus making it ideal for the treatment of furcation defects.</p><p>For the present study, no surgical reentry and histological examination were considered to confirm the quality of bone formation in experimental (PRF or &#x003b2;-TCP treated) and control sites. Radiographic interpretation using CBCT although is not a perfect method yet can be considered reliable mean for evaluation of furcation defects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Even then, natural healing in the control group, accelerated bone healing in PRF-treated group, and scaffold-assisted bone healing in &#x003b2;-TCP treated group cannot be completely ascertained. Further, in &#x003b2;-TCP-treated sites, results (defect fill) may be influenced by radiopaque nature of graft material as well as the inconsistent rate of resorption of &#x003b2;-TCP granules (from 3 months up to 12 months) as high mechanical stability may prevent premature degradation of granules into microparticles and inhibit undesirable macrophage activity.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, only Asmita <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] had utilized CBCT for evaluating and recording above-mentioned parameters of the study. Most studies reported mean percentage defect fill on conventional and digital radiography using computer-aided program.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Till date, this study is the first prospective, randomized controlled clinical study that compared the regenerative potential of PRF and &#x003b2;-TCP in the management of Glickman's buccal Class II/Grade II mandibular furcation defects in terms of defect fill (horizontal depth, vertical height, and Fw) using CBCT. The present study demonstrated better result for both experimental groups (OFD with PRF and OFD with &#x003b2;-TCP) regarding probing depth reduction and clinical attachment level gain (VCAL and HCAL) as compared to OFD alone.</p><p>PRF-treated sites represented stabilized level of GM throughout the study. Statistically, significant improvement in V-HOF, H-DOF, and percentage defect fill was observed on CBCT analysis. Fibrin clot derived of PRF stimulates the high level of collagen type I synthesis and consists of the intimate assembly of cytokine, glycan chain, and structural glycoprotein enmeshed within a slowly polymerized explicit fibrin network. When placed in the periodontal defect, this meshwork acts as a bioscaffold with an integrated reservoir of growth factors which are released over prolonged periods, thus enhancing the regenerative potential of the surrounding tissues.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The data from present study suggest that both experimental groups (OFD with PRF and OFD with &#x003b2;-TCP) result in significant improvement in hard tissue parameters, clinically and radiographically, compared with baselines values and as observed in control group (OFD alone). Hence, both experimental treatment modalities (OFD with PRF and OFD with &#x003b2;-TCP) might be an option for the treatment of mandibular Class II/Grade II furcation defects since both were capable of promising gain for all clinical and radiographical parameters evaluated although no predictable complete closure could be attributed to any therapy. Use of PRF in the periodontal regeneration procedure would be cost-effective and being autologous, more acceptable by the body, thus, would be better for both patient as well as clinicians.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitations</title><p>Small sample size in each group, lack of histomorphometric analysis of newly formed tissues, and short-term follow-up of 6 months were the drawbacks of the present study as 6 months is not enough time for &#x003b2;-TCP resorption. In addition, clinical hard tissue parameters were recorded as by different methods for two study periods. Further, results of the present study cannot be generalized for all furcation defects as we have discussed only mandibular tooth. Being single-centered study, morphological deviations in Fw, FA, and RTL due to geographic/genetic variations may influence the outcome.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marcaccini</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pavanelo</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Nogueira</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Souza</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Porci&#x000fa;ncula</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name><name><surname>Cirelli</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Morphometric study of the root anatomy in furcation area of mandibular first molars</article-title><source>J Appl Oral Sci</source><year>2012</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>76</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22437682</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jepsen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Eberhard</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Herrera</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Needleman</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A systematic review of guided tissue regeneration for periodontal furcation defects.
