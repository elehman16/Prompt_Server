</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Review of Related Literature</title><p>In the latest national nutrition survey conducted by the Department of Science and Technology and the Food and Nutritional Research Institute revealed that there was no improvement in anemia in the Philippines, especially in infants 6 months to less than 1 year of age. The prevalence of anemia among these subjects is as high as 66%. In 1-year-old children, it was computed to be 53%. These numbers confer that iron deficiency anemia may still be a staid health issue, particularly in children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This is a consequence of the body's inability to manufacture an adequate number of healthy red blood cells (RBCs) and a lack in iron. Minimal, but chronic, blood losses, secondary to parasite infestation, like that which occurs in hookworm infection, also result in anemia. Poor dietary intake of iron is a common cause of this type of anemia in children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In an experimental trial accomplished in children aged 6 until 13 years old in the Philippines, the subjects were assigned to two groups-those receiving vitamin A-fortified pandesal, fortified with 133 g retinol equivalents versus, versus an ordinary, non-fortified pandesal 5 days/week for 30 weeks. Results showed the regular intake of vitamin A-fortified pandesal enhanced the vitamin A status of children with marginal to low initial serum retinol concentrations.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Hemoglobin (Hgb) levels increased significantly in pre-school children who were provided weekly iron supplementation, regardless whether or not these subjects underwent de-worming. There was a decrease in anemia prevalence and there was a significant improvement in Hgb levels.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Growth status of children 3-5 years of age, belonging to the same environmental and socio-economic conditions, was studied in India. Anemic children had statistically inferior body weight, height and weight for age. When these subjects were given ferrous supplementation at 40 mg of elemental iron/day for 6 months, there was a significant improvement in Hgb levels.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Another study in Indonesia classified anemic and non-anemic children, based on baseline Hgb and transferring levels and received either iron or placebo treatments, respectively, for 12 weeks. The administration of 10 mg of ferrous sulfate per kilogram of body weight for 3 months resulted in a significant progress in hematological levels and growth.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Another study in Indonesia studied the effects of iron supplementation on children with low weight-for-age. The group who received daily supplementation composed of 30 mg of elemental iron and vitamin C showed a significant rise in hematological values.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-3"><title>Methodology</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design</title><p>This will be a two-arm prospective analysis comparing the values hematological parameters of undernourished children, 5-10 years of age in Quezon City, before and after iron alone versus iron and ascorbic acid supplementation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample population</title><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>
