In this case, the range of emotions from mild irritation until intense anger is experiencing.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Anger is described as an emotional state which constitutes of the basis of hatred and aggression. Hatred is an attitude that leads to aggressive behavior, while aggressive behavior is an observable behavior that is performed with purpose of damage to others.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] From the perspective of evolutionary psychology, anger comes from the evolutionary history of organisms and combined with human nature and helps to survive of the mankind and facilitates adaptive responses, in particular the fight-or-flight response when faced with danger, anger is useful. While in terms of modern civilization, uncontrollable anger, not only does not contribute to human survive but also could threaten his life.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, suppressed anger is in conflict with human nature. Research has demonstrated, suppressed anger can make people vulnerable to various diseases.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] &#x0201c;Uncontrolled anger,&#x0201d; adversely affects both adaptation and human health. Furthermore, inability to anger manage can disturb his/her interpersonal relationships.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] If this strong emotion is not properly harnessed, can prevent global success and severely threaten optimal functioning of individuals, groups and communities.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Statistics indicates that in the last few decades, anger and aggression have increased and considerable empirical evidence has demonstrated the negative effects of anger in human relationships.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Anger damaged the economy too, for example, the antisocial behavior and rage are implications and consequences of anger.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Anger related with physical health problems, particularly cardiovascular disorders.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Well as anger is associated with depression, drug dependence, alcohol abuse, suicide, back pain, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, development of atrial fibrillation, hypertension and lipid-lowering ability and readiness, and reduce the feeling of well-being.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] According to the World Health Organization, each year 5.1 million people lose their lives due to violence.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Anger and aggression is a major problem in today's world, it was reported that a quarter of the US population, experience some of kind of anger in their lifetime. In most cases of this disorder in the individual, not only reduces the amount of his personal and social adjustment, but also security and family mental health and other social groups suffer from problems. In some cases, anger would be the harassment and intimidation of members of the legal community, thus leads to involvement of the individual with the law references and criminal.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the 20<sup>th</sup> century, crimes have taken serious forms, according to the United Nations during the 1980&#x02013;1986 annual average increase of 5% on the crime rate in the world.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>More than 10.2 million people are held in penal institutions throughout the world, frequently as pretrial detainees/remand prisoners or as sentenced prisoners. Almost half of these are in the United States (2.24 m), Russia (0.68 m) or China (1.64 m sentenced prisoners).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In our country, according to the latest statistics, there are far more than 217,000 prisoners, evaluate the mental health of them as individuals at high risk is very important.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Issues of criminals and prisoners, especially its association with psychiatric problems are one of the most challenging and the most active areas of research. Mazaheri <italic>et al</italic>. study among female prisoners of Zahedan prison indicated that prevalence of personality disorders was 95%. Antisocial personality disorder with about 86.2% prevalence was the most common disorder. Drug dependence and sadistic aggressive personality with 60% and 56.2% prevalence, respectively, were in next places.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Fotiadou <italic>et al</italic>. study among Greek male prisoners revealed that mental disorder was diagnosed in 78.7% prisoners. The main diagnoses were: Anxiety disorder, (37.5%); major depression, (27.5%); antisocial personality disorder, (37.5%); alcohol dependence, (26.3%) and opiate dependence (27.5%) and schizophrenic or bipolar disorder (11.2%).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>O&#x02019;Connor <italic>et al</italic>. study among 541 teenagers 13&#x02013;18 years in the United States offenders indicated that rates of internalizing problems in offender teenagers is twice that of other teenagers. Prisoners suffering from mental health problems not only are more committed violation in prison and as result is added to the length of their sentence, but also they are more likely to be victims of violence, abuse and harassment of other prisoners.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The results of a systematic review of psychiatric surveys of people in general prison population in Western countries indicate that the risks of having serious psychiatric disorders are considerably higher in prisoners than in the general population.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Likewise, studies, for instance, have shown that prisoner's women compared to prisoner's men more suffer from personality disorders and mental disorders.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Because of the negative impacts of anger, numerous researchers wanted to find solutions and ways to control and management of anger.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Reviewing the educational programs for anger management, demonstrates the effectiveness of intervention programs for different groups.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, anger management interventions with offenders and prisoners, particularly violent offenders, have been performed. However, the evidence for the effectiveness of intervention with serious offenders is sparse. For instance, a brief anger management intervention with experimental and control groups of young male offenders was down, significant improvements observed in the experimental group and no change observed in the control group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Howells study is revealed that in which offenders receiving anger management were compared with waiting list controls on a range of dependent measures. In general, the degree of pretreatment/posttreatment change was small and experimental versus control differences were not statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>As mentioned earlier crimes statistics and as result the number of women prisoners is increasing, however, few studies performed in this regard. According to crucial role of anger management training on physical and mental health, this study investigated the effects of anger management training on mental health and violence among women prisoners in Isfahan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This research was a quasi-experimental (pretest-posttest) study.

The mean scores of general aggression and its factors (hostility, physical aggression, verbal aggression, and anger) significantly were decreased one mount after intervention.</p><p>As well, after anger management training women's mental health was promoted.

The effect of anger management training on mental health and aggression was evaluated separately in numerous studies.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>In some studies, the effects of anger management training compared with other methods of controlling aggression for instance Rostaee compared the effectiveness of anger management training and drug therapy on the aggression prisoners. Both methods were effective in reducing aggression, but the effect of anger management training was greater.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Similarly, in Karimi <italic>et al</italic>. study, effectiveness of anger management training and communication skills on the aggression among those who are dependent on cannabis was compared, finding indicated that communication skills training was more effective than anger management.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Because of specific environment of prisons and precise characteristics prisoners, one of the aggressive management objectives is to reduce the recurrence of crime which certain studies have dealt with it. For example, in study by Hunter and Hughes, after anger management programs in prison, recidivism, and crime recurrences significantly reduced.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Kennedy after anger management training for adult male inmates with aggressive behavior following changes was observed: Self-report reduce anger expression to normal conditions of prison, the frequency, intensity, and duration of anger, a more appropriate expression, the better reactions and consequences of anger reactions.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>The findings of this study were inconsistent with Lakeh and Khalatbari among mothers of an elementary school boy in Rasht.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] One reason for this inconsistency could be the small size of their sample (<italic>n</italic> = 15). Consistent with Motlagh <italic>et al</italic>. study among adolescents,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] in the present study, there was no significant relationship between ages of the respondents and general aggression. This finding also inconsistent with the study of Lakeh and Khalatbari this inconsistency may be due to differences between subjects in two studies.</p><p>Furthermore, the findings of this study were inconsistent with some previous studies, for instance, would be pointed out to Watt's <italic>et al</italic>. study among violent offenders.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>One of the reasons for inconsistency results with the present study could be due to gender inmates. Women prisoners are more likely than men prisoners to embrace training program and more influence by training. Another reason could be the mismatch specific cultural issues.</p><p>This study had limitations one of the most notably of them was a lack of a control group. Likewise, lack of classification of the audience according to the education, crime type, age, and history of incarceration can be mentioned as another limitation.</p><p>As conclusion, anger management intervention can have a positive effect on mental health and reduce aggression among prisoners. Anger management education can prevent the occurrence of negative and damaging consequences of aggression. Anger management training, enabling prisoners to effectively solve problems in their lives and do not use aggressive behavior in their interactions with others.</p><p>It is suggested that in future studies, the effects of anger management intervention compared with the control group. It is recommended that the impact of trained educators about communication skills special for prisoners compare with other educators. In general, it is recommended further studies at prisons of the country perform anger management training in order to improve the mental health of women prisoners.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
