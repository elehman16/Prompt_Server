Glucocorticoids are known to be effective initially but have significant side-effects with long-term use and recrudescence can occur on cessation. Current evidence is conflicting on the efficacy of radiotherapy and non-steroid systemic immunosuppression, and the majority of previous studies have been retrospective, uncontrolled, small or poorly designed.</p><p>The Combined Immunosuppression and Radiotherapy in Thyroid Eye Disease (CIRTED) trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of radiotherapy and azathioprine in <italic>combination </italic>with a standard course of oral prednisolone in patients with <italic>active </italic>thyroid eye disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Patients with active thyroid eye disease will be randomised to receive (i) azathioprine <italic>or </italic>oral placebo and (ii) radiotherapy <italic>or </italic>sham-radiotherapy in this multi-centre, factorial randomised control trial. The primary outcome is improvement in disease severity (assessed using a composite binary measure) at 12 months and secondary end-points include quality of life scores and health economic measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The CIRTED trial is the first study to evaluate the role of radiotherapy and azathioprine as part of a long-term, combination immunosuppressive treatment regime for Thyroid Eye Disease. It will provide evidence for the role of radiotherapy and prolonged immunosuppression in the management of this condition, as well as pilot data on their use in combination. We have paid particular attention in the trial design to establishing (a) robust placebo controls and masking protocols which are effective and safe for both radiotherapy and the systemic administration of an antiproliferative drug; (b) constructing effective inclusion and exclusion criteria to select for active disease; and (c) selecting pragmatic outcome measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials ISRCTN22471573</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Thyroid eye disease (TED) can be a visually disabling and cosmetically disfiguring condition which significantly impairs health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A wide variety of immunosuppressive therapies have been used to target the early active inflammatory phase of the disease, including glucocorticoids (GC's), radiotherapy, antiproliferative agents, T-cell inhibitors and, more recently, biologics. The goal of these interventions is to suppress the autoimmune inflammatory phase of the disease, thereby altering the course of the disease and reducing the severity of residual changes in the extraocular muscles, orbital fat and other periocular soft tissues which result in permanent visual and cosmetic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>GC's have been used to treat TED for over forty years, and several studies have demonstrated their efficacy with an overall response rate of 63&#x02013;77% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, GC treatment is typically discontinued after 3 to 5 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] because of the side-effects associated with their long-term use, and subsequent disease recrudescence is a common problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This recurrence may be prevented by the concomitant use of ciclosporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (which continues after GC treatment stops), and combinations of ciclosporin and prednisolone also achieve a better initial treatment response than either agent alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, the routine use of such second-line immunosuppressive drugs in the management of TED has been limited by fears about their potential toxicity, and glucocorticoid monotherapy remains the mainstay of conventional treatment.</p><p>Radiotherapy is also well established in the treatment of TED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and its efficacy was affirmed in 1993 by the results of a prospective double-blind randomised control trial (RCT) which reported that orbital radiotherapy was as effective as oral prednisolone[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the same authors subsequently found that radiotherapy was no better than placebo (except in a subgroup of patients with motility impairment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and a recent trial from the Mayo Clinic in the USA also could not demonstrate a beneficial therapeutic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As a result, many clinicians, particularly in North America, have abandoned its use.</p><p>The Mayo study has been widely criticised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]and European groups argue that the balance of evidence remains in favour of radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In support of this, the most recent randomised control trial (in patients with relatively mild disease) found that radiotherapy was better than placebo when outcome was assessed by clinical measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, this was not associated with quality-of-life or health economic gain, and the role of radiotherapy as monotherapy for TED remains the subject of heated debate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Older RCTs have shown that radiotherapy is more effective in combination with steroids than when either agent is used alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, this distinction between monotherapy and combination therapy is rarely highlighted, and the confusion which has resulted from the inconsistent recent evidence has caused many ophthalmologists to discontinue using radiotherapy as part of a combined treatment regime. Consequently there is a pressing need for a definitive study to investigate radiotherapy's role <italic>in combination </italic>with steroids.</p><p>The data supporting the use of ciclosporin combined with steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and radiotherapy combined with steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] are not surprising given current knowledge about the benefits of combination therapies in other autoimmune ocular and systemic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Manipulation of an autoimmune response is more effective when more than one mechanism of immunosuppression is used, and this can be especially so early in the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Combined drug treatments can also be continued long-term, preventing the disease reactivation which is commonly seen at the end of typical short-term low dose steroid monotherapy regimes, and enabling the duration of an individual's treatment to be tailored to the length of the active phase of their disease.</p><p>Azathioprine is a low-cost second-line immunosuppressive agent which is widely used in the management of other autoimmune conditions. It is better tolerated than ciclosporin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and does not cause the renal toxicity and cardiovascular side-effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] (including hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia) associated with ciclosporin. However, it can cause bone marrow suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This risk has been greatly reduced with the advent of a laboratory assay for the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT), which regulates a key step in azathioprine metabolism. Now individuals with low TPMT activity, who would otherwise be at particular risk of azathioprine toxicity, can be identified and their treatment modified or withheld [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Hence, azathioprine has safety, tolerability and cost advantages over ciclosporin.</p><p>Retrospective data suggests that azathioprine, when used in combination with oral prednisolone and radiotherapy, can significantly reduce the long-term severity of TED and the need for rehabilitative surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, the use of azathioprine for TED remains highly controversial; in part because it has previously been proven ineffective as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. As with radiotherapy, there is no clear evidence base and clinical practice consequently varies widely.</p><p>The current trial is designed to investigate whether (i) radiotherapy and (ii) azathioprine are effective <italic>when used in combination with steroids </italic>for the treatment of <italic>active </italic>TED. It will also provide pilot data on the possible benefits of triple therapy (steroids, azathioprine and radiotherapy). Particular attention in the trial design has been given to (a) establishing robust placebo controls and masking protocols which are effective and safe for both radiotherapy and the systemic administration of an antiproliferative drug; (b) constructing effective inclusion and exclusion criteria to select for <italic>active </italic>disease; and (c) selecting pragmatic outcome measures.

However, in London and Manchester, patients having active treatment are exposed to radiation during both their CT scan and dosimetric planning. To avoid this in the sham-treatment group, sham-CT scans and a generic dosimetric plan with zero downloaded monitor units (ie no radiation exposure) are used.</p><p>Radiotherapy machines make a loud buzzing noise when switched on and this is the only indicator patients have that they are receiving treatment. In order to mimic this for patients allocated to receive sham-radiotherapy, bespoke noise-emitting devices (NEDs) which make a similar sound to that which accompanies normal treatment have been constructed, and are positioned above the gantry of the machines in Bristol, London and Manchester. The NEDs are activated from the radiotherapy suite's control room for the same duration of time that treatment would usually be administered. Hence, patients allocated to the sham-radiotherapy arm of the study have the same planning and treatment experience, but receive no radiation at all.</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo azathioprine tablets</title><p>These are made for the trial by St Thomas' Hospital Pharmacy Manufacturing Unit in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice and exactly match the appearance of the active azathioprine tablets, which are removed from their blister-packs and re-packaged in the same bottles as the placebos. Both active and placebo drugs are then labelled as trial-specific Investigational Medicinal Products (IMPs) and distributed to the trial centres.</p><p>Placebo azathioprine tablets are also dispensed according to body weight, so patients in the placebo group take the same number of tablets per day as they would if receiving active treatment. (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional measures to maintain masking</title><sec><title>Sham-radiotherapy</title><p>The trial radiographers are by necessity aware of each patient's treatment allocation. Their contact with trial recruits is therefore the time at which patients are at greatest risk of being un-masked. In order to minimise this risk, the number of radiographers involved in the administration of radiotherapy to trial subjects has been limited as much as possible. These individuals have all received specific training about the study and are very aware of the importance of maintaining masking, which they achieve by acting out their well-practiced treatment set-up and delivery protocols in a standard fashion to all patients regardless of whether they receive sham or active therapy. The clinical oncologists who consult with patients before and during treatment are not informed of treatment allocation, and the contents of patients' hospital records are specially adapted to keep this information concealed until they complete the study.</p><p>The radiotherapy departments involved in the trial have also examined their local facilities to ensure that other potential indicators of treatment allocation, such as the activation of warning lights outside radiotherapy suites when radiotherapy machines are being used, are identified and addressed (for example, taking care to sit patients and relatives out of sight of the warning lights).</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo azathioprine tablets</title><p>All trial recruits, whether allocated to the azathioprine or placebo arms of the trial, will have regular blood tests to monitor for the potential adverse effects of azathioprine. These results are monitored by an un-masked trial co-ordinator, who arranges for trial subjects to be recalled if abnormalities are revealed and adjusts their treatment in accordance with a standard algorithm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Azathioprine Dose Adjustment/Blood Test Algorithm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-6-2"/></fig><p>In order to maintain masking about 5% of the placebo treated group are also being randomly recalled for identical drug 'dose' adjustment, and repeat blood tests. The un-masked trial co-ordinator is never in direct contact with trial recruits, and the instructions issued to the clinical investigators to recall patients and adjust their treatment is standard, regardless of whether they are receiving active or placebo tablets. Hence, safety is ensured for patients on azathioprine, and treatment allocation is not revealed to the trial subjects or investigators.</p><p>If the un-masked trial co-ordinator has a query about a blood test result which is not adequately addressed by the standard treatment algorithm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), they can reveal a patient's treatment allocation and ask for advice from one of the clinical investigators at another Trial Centre. This clause provides a safety net should an unforeseen clinical scenario arise, and should not introduce bias as the patient and the clinical investigator responsible for their assessment remains masked.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Allocation of trial interventions</title><p>Patients who are eligible to continue in the study at the second trial visit (after confirmation of active disease by response to steroids or short disease duration &#x02013; see above) are allocated to treatment groups by minimisation. This is a dynamic process which reduces the imbalance between trial arms with respect to a range of predefined prognostic variables, and a randomisation schedule is therefore not drawn up in advance. Instead, a form categorising each study recruit according to the minimisation criteria set out in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref> is returned to the randomisation service at Moorfields Eye Hospital on enrolment, giving them time to determine the patient's treatment allocation should they be eligible to proceed in the study. The trial pharmacists at each Trial Centre then phone the randomisation service on receipt of a trial IMP prescription at the patient's second visit, and are notified whether they are to dispense azathioprine or placebo.

The first stage of the analysis will be to use descriptive statistics to describe the group of individuals recruited to the trial in relation to those eligible, and to investigate comparability of the trial arms at baseline. The primary intention-to-treat analyses will comprise comparisons between radiotherapy versus sham-radiotherapy, and azathioprine versus placebo, for each of the two primary outcomes at 12 months follow up. The comparisons will be made using appropriate (that is, logistic or linear) multivariable regression models, adjusting for minimisation variables, the factorial design, and the value of the outcome variable at baseline. Full attention will be paid to the estimates and the confidence intervals for these comparisons as well as the p-values. Secondary analyses will then be conducted using regression models with further adjustment for any prognostic factors that exhibit marked imbalance at baseline. Patients who have no outcome data for the primary analyses will have data imputed using last observation carried forward. Patients who have become non-compliant for any reason will still be invited to produce outcome data such that they can be included in the intention to treat analyses. The assumptions required for the regression models will be investigated using appropriate diagnostic plots, and actions such as transformation of continuous outcome variables taken as necessary.</p><p>The co-primary outcome CAS at 3 months follow up, and all secondary outcomes, will be analysed in the same way, using appropriate (linear or logistic) regression models depending on the nature of the outcome measure. Bonferroni corrections for multiple testing will be considered for the secondary outcomes.</p><p>Other secondary analyses will involve: (a) investigation of any interaction between the two interventions for each of the two primary outcomes; (b) pre-planned sub-group analyses to ascertain any differential effects of the interventions according to steroid use versus no steroid use in the six months prior to enrolment. These secondary analyses are readily performed as extensions to the multivariable regression models described above, by simply introducing the appropriate interaction terms. However, the precision of the estimates of interaction is very likely to be too poor, and high p-values will most likely reflect low power and so cannot be taken as evidence for no interactions.</p><sec><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>Costs will be related to the percentage of patients responding to treatment. Incremental cost effectiveness ratios will be formed, which will estimate the extra cost per extra patient responding to (i) radiotherapy; and (ii) azathioprine 12 months after randomisation. A secondary analysis will estimate the cost-of-illness of TED from a societal perspective.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial organisation</title><p>Trial Centres and Investigators are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">7</xref>.

We hope to help resolve the debate which has arisen from recent monotherapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], and seek not only to establish whether the addition of azathioprine or radiotherapy confers benefit in patients treated with glucocorticoids, but also to test the principle of combination therapies in TED.</p><p>The use of a factorial design enables us to evaluate two interventions in a single study and is the most valid means of establishing whether the combination of two or more therapies achieves incremental benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. It also makes efficient use of patients, which is especially important because of the limited numbers of potential recruits with active TED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. However, in using a factorial design we are assuming (but will have insufficient power to test) that there is no interaction between trial interventions, as if a significant biological or statistical interaction between radiotherapy and azathioprine treatment exists, our calculation of their independent effects will be incorrect. The validity of the study design therefore rests on the judgement of the trial investigators and statistical advisors that the potential for an interaction between our interventions to have a 'clinically significant' effect on the interpretation of the trial data is very low (ie &#x02264; 5%). We believe this to be a reasonable assertion and consider that the risk of generating uninterpretable data is outweighed by the benefits of using a factorial design to assess combination treatments for an uncommon condition. Our small sample size will also limit our sensitivity to small differences in treatment efficacy, which is a compromise we accept as integral to the conduct of a pragmatic study.</p><p>In addition to the restricted number of trial subjects, there are many factors in the natural history and clinical evaluation of TED which pose challenges to the objective and scientific comparison of treatment outcomes. For example, the control of systemic thyroid dysfunction reduces disease severity, but delay in TED treatment until a 2 month period of euthyroidism has been maintained (as has been advocated by other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]) in order to prevent this confounding interpretation of treatment efficacy, potentially misses the opportunity to obtain maximal benefit from immunosuppression in the earliest, most active phase of the disease. A patient's smoking status, previous exposure to steroids and disease severity can also independently influence their response to treatment. Furthermore, measures of disease activity and severity are notoriously subjective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], and although some outcome measures have been used more often than others in previous studies, there is no single standardised and robustly validated scoring system to use in the assessment of treatment efficacy.</p><p>We have sought to address the potential influence of multiple confounding factors through the use of a minimisation strategy to ensure their even distribution across trial arms (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). The absence of validated outcomes is more problematic, particularly with regard to measures of disease severity, which need to incorporate a range of parameters to quantify both cosmetic deformity and visual dysfunction. The available continuous scoring systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] can be relatively insensitive to clinically significant treatment differences and depend on large sample sizes. Consequently, recent studies have tended to use binary composite outcome measures, weighted to detect improvement in a selected disease components, such as oculomotility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, no two studies have used the same criteria to define treatment success, and we have combined elements of each in order to generate our scoring system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). There is greater consensus on the measurement of clinical activity and the CAS is an accepted standard which has been widely used in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], however it remains limited by its subjectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and inability to predict response to steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><p>In order to ameliorate the problem of subjectivity in clinical assessments with consequent inter-observer variability we are using Dickinson et al.'s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] reference atlas of colour plates and our standard operating procedures for patient examinations are based on those advocated by the European Group on Graves Ophthalmopathy (EUGOGO). In addition, we are seeking to lay the foundations for fully objective measurement of disease activity and severity through an ancillary Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) study which is being conducted alongside the trial.</p><p>We have gone to great lengths to establish placebo controls for the trial interventions, in particular with sham-radiotherapy and decoy dose changes for patients allocated to receive placebo tablets. However, there is a risk that the common side-effects of azathioprine, such as lethargy and nausea, will unmask investigators and patients to their treatment allocation. This may be off-set by the overlap between the side-effect profiles of azathioprine and prednisolone and the success of our masking procedures will ultimately be evaluated by questionnaire when each patient completes the trial.</p><p>Referral patterns to the study centres dictate that it is impractical to restrict trial entry to patients who have not been previously exposed to steroids. Hence, all potential recruits who have sufficiently active disease to be eligible for trial entry will be enrolled regardless of their prior steroid exposure, and the potential this has to bias their subsequent immunoresponsiveness is accounted for in the minimisation criteria. In addition, the practicalities of day-case admission for intravenous (IV) prednisolone treatment have prevented the trial centres from adopting this as their usual practice, despite recent evidence in favour of IV administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>], and we are consequently using oral prednisolone in the trial.</p><p>In summary, the CIRTED trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>] seeks to utilise a high-quality, pragmatic trial design to evaluate combination immunotherapies for the treatment of TED and enhance the evidence base available to inform treatment decisions for both patients and health care professionals.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CAS: Clinical Activity Score; CT: Computed Tomography; CTU: Clinical Trials Unit; DMC: Data Monitoring Committee; EUGOGO: European Group on Graves Ophthalmopathy; GC: Glucocorticoids; GO-QoL: Graves Ophthalmopathy Quality of Life; HADS: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; IMP: Investigational Medicinal Product; MHRA: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; NED: Noise-emitting device; NHS: National Health Service; OI: Ophthalmopathy Index; RCT: Randomised Control Trial; REC: Research Ethics Committee; TED: Thyroid Eye Disease; TES: Total Eye Score; TLD: Thermoluminescence Dosimetry; TPMT: Thiopurine Methyltransferase</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RR: Participated in development of the trial protocol.
