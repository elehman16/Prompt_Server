</p><sec id="dme13268-sec-0006"><title>Introduction</title><p>Artificial pancreas systems are capable of automating glucose regulation through real&#x02010;time glucose monitoring, algorithms for glucose control and insulin infusion. In the past few years artificial pancreas technology has developed rapidly. Several authors reported improved mean glucose and reduced time spent in hypo&#x02010; and hyperglycaemia in longer&#x02010;term studies using wearable artificial pancreas systems under real&#x02010;life conditions at home <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. These results are promising but even highly efficacious devices will not reach the expected clinical outcomes if they are used infrequently because of poor patient acceptance <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>. Patient&#x02010;related outcome measures should be taken into account to realize the full potential of this technology <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown high future acceptance of the artificial pancreas by participants when asked to report their preferences based on a &#x02018;paper case description&#x02018; <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Ziegler <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> also reported high satisfaction, less worry about hypoglycaemia and increased perceived ease of use after participants had experienced 4 nights&#x02019; use of an artificial pancreas system at home <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>; however, only moderately positive acceptance was reported after 4&#x02010;week real&#x02010;life night use of the technology <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. This shows that perception of artificial pancreas acceptance might differ between short&#x02010; and long&#x02010;term use, and that it is key to understanding the impact of artificial pancreas use over the longer term in a similar environment to that in which the artificial pancreas can be expected to be used in the future.</p><p>We recently reported the results of a multinational, multicentre, long&#x02010;term, randomized crossover artificial pancreas trial in people with Type 1 diabetes, showing improved time spent with glucose levels in target through reduction of both time spent in hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia with the artificial pancreas compared with sensor&#x02010;augmented pump therapy <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. The artificial pancreas was used during the evening and night period. In the present paper, we report on a substudy aiming to determine the impact of the current artificial pancreas prototype compared with sensor&#x02010;augmented pump therapy on treatment satisfaction and fear of hypoglycaemia. In addition, acceptance of the artificial pancreas technology was studied. Semi&#x02010;structured interviews were performed to provide further insight into participant acceptance of current artificial pancreas technology and to inform future development of artificial pancreas technology.</p></sec><sec id="dme13268-sec-0007"><title>Methods</title><p>The main study results and methodology have been reported previously (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02153190) <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. In short, participants from three sites in Montpellier, France, Padua, Italy and Amsterdam, the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive 8 weeks of evening&#x02010;and&#x02010;night closed&#x02010;loop glucose control using an artificial pancreas (artificial pancreas period) and then 8 weeks of insulin pump with continuous glucose monitoring (sensor&#x02010;augmented pump period) or vice versa. During the daytime participants randomized to the artificial pancreas period used sensor&#x02010;augmented pump therapy with their artificial pancreas switched off. Both intervention periods were separated by a 4&#x02010;week washout&#x02010;period to minimize carry&#x02010;over effects. A further description of the artificial pancreas system can be found in Appendix S1. Adults with Type 1 diabetes and an HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 58&#x02013;86 mmol/mol (7.5&#x02013;10.0%) were included, people with one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia in the last year or ketoacidosis in the last 6 months were excluded from participation for safety reasons. The study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee for each participating study site.</p><sec id="dme13268-sec-0008"><title>Patient&#x02010;reported outcomes</title><p>Three self&#x02010;report questionnaires were used to determine the perspective of people with diabetes on artificial pancreas technology: the Hypoglycaemia Fear Survey II (HFS&#x02010;II); the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire standard/change versions (DTSQs/c); and the artificial pancreas acceptance questionnaire <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The DTSQs/c versions were administered to account for any ceiling effect. The DTSQs and HFS&#x02010;II were filled in at the first visit and last visit of both study periods while the DTSQc was filled in at the last visit of both periods. The artificial pancreas questionnaire was filled in at first and last visit of the artificial pancreas period only.</p><p>The HFS&#x02010;II was designed to measure the degree of anxiety associated with (anticipated) hypoglycaemia in adults with Type 1 diabetes <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>. The 33&#x02010;item questionnaire (range 0&#x02013;4 per item, Cronbach's &#x003b1; 0.90) comprises two subscales, a behaviour scale and a worry scale. The behaviour scale (Cronbach's &#x003b1; 0.60) assesses the extent to which people with diabetes engage in active or passive hypoglycaemia&#x02010;avoidant behaviours (e.g. proactive snacking), the worry subscale (Cronbach's &#x003b1; 0.89) taps into their worries and fears related to hypoglycaemia (e.g. about losing consciousness in public). HFS&#x02010;II sum scores are calculated for the total scale (33 items, range 0&#x02013;132 points), behaviour scale (15 items, range 0&#x02013;60 points) and worry scale (18 items, range 0&#x02013;72 points). Validated Dutch, French and Italian versions were used <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>. A higher score indicates higher fear of hypoglycaemia. The DTSQs (Cronbach's &#x003b1; 0.79) was developed to measure diabetes treatment satisfaction <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The DTSQs consists of eight items with a scoring range of 0&#x02013;6 points, two of which do not pertain to satisfaction but rather perceived frequency hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia (range 0&#x02013;6) and are therefore analysed separately <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The DTSQc is similar to the DTSQs, but rather than asking about current treatment satisfaction, participants are asked to compare their current treatment satisfaction with that of the treatment prior to the current intervention. DTSQc items are scored &#x02212;3 to 3, and were multiplied by two afterwards for ease of comparability between the DTSQc and DTSQs. DTSQs and DTSQc total scores (range 0&#x02013;36 and &#x02212;36 to 36) is calculated by the sum&#x02010;score of items 1 and 4&#x02013;7. A higher score indicates higher treatment satisfaction. Validated Dutch, French and Italian versions were used <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The artificial pancreas questionnaire (Cronbach's &#x003b1; 0.91) was developed based on the technology acceptance model <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, comprising four themes: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, intention to use and trust, distributed over 15 questions, with a scoring range of 0&#x02013;6 per item. A higher total score indicates higher artificial pancreas acceptance (range 0&#x02013;90). The artificial pancreas questionnaire was translated for this study into Italian and French using a forward&#x02010;back translation procedure <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. The questionnaire is available on request in Dutch, English, French, German and Italian <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="dme13268-sec-0009"><title>Semi&#x02010;structured interviews</title><p>After completion of both study arms of the main study, participants from the clinical site in the Netherlands were invited to participate in a semi&#x02010;structured interview. These interviews, based on the technology assessment model <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, were performed face&#x02010;to&#x02010;face or by telephone, according to the participants&#x02019; availability. Interviews were performed until no new information or themes were observed in the data and &#x02018;saturation&#x02019; was reached. An overview of the methods used to develop the semi&#x02010;structured interviews is given in Appendix S1.</p></sec><sec id="dme13268-sec-0010"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcome measures were HFS&#x02010;II total scores, HFS&#x02010;II behaviour and worry subscores and the DTSQs/c&#x02010;scores and the artificial pancreas questionnaire total scores.

For the artificial pancreas questionnaire any questionnaires with missing data were discarded. Normality of data distribution was visually assessed.

A multilevel <sc>anova</sc> model including &#x02018;study site&#x02019; as a covariate was performed to assess between&#x02010;site differences. A paired <italic>t</italic>&#x02010;test was used for comparison of DTSQc scores. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c; 0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. <sc>spss</sc> software (IBM Inc.

To date, assessment of psychosocial factors of the artificial pancreas indicates that, overall, acceptance of the artificial pancreas is good, achieving 75.7% of full acceptance (actual/maximum artificial pancreas questionnaire total score). Compared with previous &#x02018;paper case studies&#x02019;, the present study showed a lower &#x02018;intention to use&#x02019; the artificial pancreas system (70 vs about 85% of artificial pancreas questionnaire theme &#x02018;intention to use&#x02019; maximum score) <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>. Also no significant improvements in patient&#x02010;related outcome measures were found vs the comparator (sensor&#x02010;augmented pump). This is consistent with previous results by Barnard <italic>et al</italic>. <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> who reported on a 4&#x02010;week artificial pancreas study using a different artificial pancreas system <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. Reduced &#x02018;intention to use&#x02019; and no improvement over sensor&#x02010;augmented pump therapy might be a consequence of the developmental stage of the product, including frequent technical errors and reduced ease of use compared with the CGM and insulin pump used in this study, which were at the grade of commercial products. Participants appear to appreciate the positive effects of the artificial pancreas on glucose regulation, but technical errors and reduced usability diminish their appreciation for the system <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. This was supported by the results of the artificial pancreas questionnaire, showing numerically lower scores on whether <italic>&#x02018;patients wanted to switch the</italic> artificial pancreas <italic>for their current treatment&#x02019;</italic> (item 2), whether &#x02018;<italic>their life would be easier by using the</italic> artificial pancreas<italic>&#x02019;</italic> (item 7) and whether <italic>&#x02018;they spent less time on their diabetes treatment&#x02019;</italic> (item 8), together with a higher score on whether <italic>&#x02018;they expect to achieve better HbA</italic>

<italic>values&#x02019;</italic> (item 3). Participants seemed to like the idea and functions of the device, but were not yet convinced by the device as it stands. This was also emphasized in the interviews, where participants reported connectivity problems, but at the same time were mostly enthusiastic about their glucose control and the idea of a &#x02018;machine&#x02019; controlling their diabetes with less input needed. Also the need for fewer devices with better connectivity was vocalized by our participants. These results signify the importance of using artificial pancreas acceptance information to guide future development of the technology, and the importance of &#x02018;real&#x02010;life&#x02019; assessments <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>, <xref rid="dme13268-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>.</p><p>In our view, most benefit of using an artificial pancreas system can be achieved in the relatively safe home environment during the evening and night period; therefore, the artificial pancreas was used during the evening&#x02010;and&#x02010;night period only. As such, the present results cannot be directly translated to day&#x02010;and&#x02010;night artificial pancreas use. Another limitation is the fact that only a small Dutch subset of participants was interviewed; nevertheless, there was no indication of relevant differences in outcomes of the questionnaires between countries. Finally, probable selection bias should be taken into consideration when interpreting these results, as the selected participants would be expected to have been more motivated to use diabetes technology than the average person with diabetes. In other words, acceptance of the system might be lower than was found among the participants of the present study. A strength of the study was the multinational study set&#x02010;up, the long study duration and assessment of psychosocial aspects of artificial pancreas based on actual experience rather than a paper sketch of an artificial pancreas. The interviews provide additional information for the interpretation of the questionnaire&#x02010;based results. The current detailed description of psychosocial factors of the artificial pancreas in a long&#x02010;term study provides valuable new insights to further improve the artificial pancreas systems currently under development.</p><p>We can conclude that the artificial pancreas is ready for real&#x02010;life testing, but technological issues need to be fixed and further development will have to take place before it will be fully acceptable for people with diabetes and thus can be commercialized. There appears to be a general consensus that people with diabetes would like a small, all&#x02010;in&#x02010;one, technologically stable device. Psychosocial factors of insulin automation technology should again be studied in the next&#x02010;generation artificial pancreas systems in a more diverse population to evaluate device trust and to obtain an understanding of the implications of letting the device manage the disease, as these were currently difficult to investigate. A combination of questionnaires specifically developed for artificial pancreas technology combined with semi&#x02010;structured interviews can provide a framework for future studies.</p><p>Current technical problems need to be resolved to achieve full potential of insulin&#x02010;automation technology. At that time though, artificial pancreas acceptance may be expected to be high.</p></sec><sec id="dme13268-sec-0020"><title>Funding sources</title><p>The study was supported by the European Community Framework Programme 7 (FP7&#x02010;ICT&#x02010;2009&#x02010;4 grant number 247138).
