Clonidine, a selective partial alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, when administered intrathecally in adults for unilateral spinal anesthesia in very small doses of less than 1 &#x003bc;g/kg, has shown contradicting results in extending the sensory and motor blockade effects of local anesthetics with low incidence of side-effects e.g., hypotension, sedation and bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The efficacy and safety of low doses has not been extensively studied in elderly patients. This study tested the hypothesis that in elderly patients, addition of clonidine in small doses of 15 &#x003bc;g and 30 &#x003bc;g to intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine 9 mg would augment sensory blockade. Effect on hemodynamic parameters and other block characteristics including motor blockade were also studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was undertaken after approval by the Institutional Ethics Committee (Academic and Ethical Committee, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, Delhi, India) and written informed consent from each patient. The study has been registered with Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI) and the registration number is CTRI/2013/01/003336.</p><p>In this study, 60 elderly male patients of age more than or equal to 60 years, of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 or 2, body weight between 50-70 kg and height 150-180 cm, undergoing elective lower limb orthopedic surgery under spinal anesthesia were included. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, recent myocardial infarction or contraindications to spinal anesthesia were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were examined a day before surgery and were kept fasting overnight. They received tablet diazepam 5 mg night before surgery and on the morning of surgery with a sip of water as premedication. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the three groups using sealed envelope technique. Group C received 9 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine without clonidine, Group C<sub>15</sub> received 9 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 15 &#x003bc;g clonidine and Group C<sub>30</sub> received 9 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with 30 &#x003bc;g clonidine intrathecally. In all the cases, total volume administered intrathecally was 2 ml. An Anesthesiologist not involved in the study prepared the test drug solution and observations were made by another Anesthesiologist blinded to the constituents of the test drug.</p><p>After shifting patient to the operating table, monitoring in the form of non-invasive blood pressure, which included systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure, continuous electrocardiography and pulse oximetry was instituted and baseline readings were recorded using a multiparameter monitor (Penlon PM 9000 Express). Intravenous access was established and patients were coloaded with 8 ml/kg of Ringer lactate solution at the time of performing the block.</p><p>An epidural catheter was inserted before the performance of the subarachnoid block to cover for the surgical time if latter exceeded beyond the effect of subarachnoid block. Under sterile conditions, an 18G catheter (Portex Epidural Minipack, System 1, Smiths, USA) was inserted for 4-5 cm in the epidural space using a 16G Touhy's needle through L<sub>2-3</sub> interspace. L<sub>3-4</sub> interspace was utilized for performing the subarachnoid block. Quincke spinal needle of 25G (BD Spinal needle, Spain) was used for administration of the test drug solutions for spinal anesthesia. The drugs were injected into the subarachnoid space at the rate of 0.2 ml/s and the needle was removed. The epidural catheter was secured appropriately and patient was placed in the supine position. The time of completion of spinal injection was designated as time 0 and other time points were measured from this time. Oxygen was administered via facemask to all patients as a routine.</p><p>Sensory level of the block was assessed using absolute loss of sensation to pinprick and the highest last level with no sensation to pinprick was recorded as sensory level. Surgeons were asked to proceed once the block level was T<sub>10</sub>. Motor block in the lower limbs was graded as per modified Bromage grade. In case the block failed to ascend to a level of T<sub>10</sub> within 20 min of intrathecal injection, the designated intrathecal dose was considered as inadequate and epidural top-up was given to facilitate surgery.</p><p>Various parameters were recorded at following points of time:</p><p>

</p><p>For sedation, midazolam was administered in doses of 1 mg intravenously as and when required. Epidural supplementation by local anesthetics was done when the patients complained of pain.</p><p>Any episode of hypotension during first 30 min after intrathecal drug deposition was recorded. Hypotension was defined as a fall in systolic blood pressure to more than 25% from pre-operative baseline systolic blood pressure and was treated using 3 mg boluses of mephentermine intravenously. Clinically, relevant bradycardia was defined as heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats/min and was treated with atropine 0.6 mg intravenously. Any other intraoperative complication was recorded and managed appropriately.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Numbers of participants in this study were calculated considering a minimum augmentation of sensory block by two segments. Minimum of 18 patients were required in each group to produce a significant difference assuming a type-1 error of 0.05 and power of 0.8. Repeated measures analysis of variance was employed to obtain the within and between group comparisons. Tukey's test was used for multiple comparisons of different groups and different time points with each other and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Clonidine also increased the duration of surgical anesthesia, motor blockade and the duration of analgesia without increasing the incidence of hypotension and other complications.</p><p>Clonidine is commonly used because of its safety and various advantages over other adjuvants. The mechanism by which clonidine prolongs motor and sensory block is not well-known. It produces analgesia by depressing the release of C-fiber transmitters and by hyperpolarization of postsynaptic dorsal horn neurons.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Binding of clonidine to motor neurons in the dorsal horn may prolong motor block.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Its effect in terms of potentiation of sensory and motor block of intrathecal bupivacaine has been studied with doses of 1-2 &#x003bc;g/kg.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Doses much less than 1 &#x003bc;g/kg have shown contradicting results in terms of augmenting the effects of local anesthetics, but with minimal side-effects in adult patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, the effects and doses of clonidine as adjuvant to intrathecal bupivacaine have not been investigated at length in elderly patients.</p><p>van Tuijl <italic>et al</italic>. used 15 and 30 &#x003bc;g of clonidine supplemented to 5 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anesthesia and found no significant difference in the peak sensory block levels, the mean age of their study population was 35-38 years.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In another study, similar doses of clonidine were studied with 6 mg bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anesthesia in patients of mean age 56-62 years, the cephalad spread of sensory block was significantly higher by two to four dermatomes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, no difference in median peak sensory levels was observed when 30 &#x003bc;g clonidine with 12 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine was used in patients with a mean age of 70 &#x000b1; 6 years.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Larger doses of local anesthetics were reported to mask the effect of clonidine on the sensory level.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, clonidine did not affect the onset of surgical anesthesia, similar results on the onset have been shown by other workers even with slightly higher doses of clonidine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Clonidine in both doses increased the median highest sensory block level, but the time to achieve this level was longer with 30 &#x003bc;g of clonidine.
