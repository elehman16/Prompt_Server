To synchronise mating and subsequent lambing, an intravaginal progestagen pessary (30 mg flugestone acetate; Chronogest, Intervet, Boxmeer, the Netherlands) was inserted into approximately 300 Suffolk-cross ewes ranging in age from 2 to 5 years for 12 days, which were later mated with rams at a ratio of one ram per seven ewes. To determine litter size and confirm stage of gestation, ewes were scanned using transabdominal ultrasonography 75 days after ram introduction and remained outdoors on permanent grassland until they were housed at 82 days gestation. From housing until parturition, ewes were offered grass silage <italic>ad libitum</italic>. Based on established criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> the energy requirements of the ewes was estimated to be 12 MJ at 90 days gestation rising to 20 MJ just before lambing. This was provided by offering grass silage <italic>ad libitum</italic> and supplemented with 500 g to 700 g of concentrate meal.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flowchart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bjo0116-0975-f1"/></fig><p>On day 98 of gestation (the first day of the third trimester), 104 ewes were chosen from the main flock after a sample size calculation that indicated a need for at least 50 animals in each of the two groups (see below). To do this, ewes from the main flock were excluded if they were not pregnant or were carrying three or more fetuses. Remaining animals were then divided into large holding pens containing ewes with single or twin fetuses. They were then randomly presented by the stock person to be weighed and their ear tag number (assigned at birth by the Department of Agriculture) recorded until we had assembled 50 ewes with single fetuses and 54 ewes with twin fetuses. Upon completion of weighing, ewes were alternately assigned to one of the two treatment groups (see below) from the list of ear tag numbers (recorded in random order during weighing). The two treatment groups were 100 ml twice per day (0800 and 1600) of water (<italic>n</italic> = 53) or propylene glycol (<italic>n</italic> = 51) (Inform Nutrition Ireland Ltd, Cork, Ireland) from the afternoon of day 98 of gestation to the first signs of parturition about day 147. The propylene glycol (200 ml per day) provided 4.4 MJ per day of energy to the propylene glycol treated ewes.</p><p>On day 109 of gestation, six ewes from each of the treatment groups (PG or C treated single and twin bearing ewes) were randomly selected. The same animals were selected again on day 140 of gestation. On each day, blood samples (4 ml collected into a heparinised and a sodium oxalate vacutainer tubes (Unitech, Dublin, Ireland) were taken every 30 to 60 minutes from 90 minutes before the first treatment of propylene glycol or water. All blood was centrifuged at 1600 &#x000d7; g for 20 minutes at 4&#x000ba;C. The plasma was separated and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000ba;C until analysis. We chose to characterise the glucose and insulin response to treatment on day 109 of gestation as this was 10 days after the start of treatment and on day 140 of gestation as this was the latest day during treatment that we could predict no ewes would have started lambing (labour). Six ewes per groups were chosen based on previous experience of the variation among animals (contributing to a sample size calculation) for concentrations of glucose and insulin.</p><p>At birth, lambs were given individually identifying punch earl tags, lambs were weighed, their gender was recorded, blood samples were taken before their first feed and were analysed for plasma glucose and IGF-I concentrations. Body dimensions (head circumference, height, thoracic circumference, jaw circumference, crown rump length, body length, inside limb length) were measured within 24 hours of birth using a standard measuring tape. Rohrer&#x02019;s ponderal index in newborns (birthweight/height &#x000d7; 100)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> has been used as an indicator of fetal growth status, especially to assess asymmetrical intrauterine growth retardation. A ponderal index was calculated as weight/height<sup>3</sup> expressed as kg/cm<sup>3</sup>. In humans, the ponderal index incorporates standing height, i.e. the length of the spine and long bones, whereas in quadrupeds, the length of the spine is not included in height.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> At approximately 1 day of age, ewes with their lambs were moved to pasture where they had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to grass and water for the remainder of the experiment. Ewes nursing their lambs in all groups were maintained together on the same pasture and maintained equally at all times. The offspring were weighed at 6 and 12 weeks of age until they reached an approximate weight of 40 kg when they were slaughtered in a commercial abattoir house. Carcass weight and classification details (based on EUROP system) of each lamb was recorded. Arterial blood pressure of the lambs was measured using a noninvasive blood pressure monitor (CARDELL Veterinary Monitor 9401BP; SHARN Veterinary Inc. Tampa, FL, USA). At birth, a 2.0-cm-wide cuff with a circumference of 3 to 6 cm was placed on the metacarpus of the left forelimb where blood pressure could be measured from the dorsal metacarpal artery. This method has been validated for a number of species including sheep,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> dogs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and pigs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> To ensure an accurate reading, the cuff was selected so that its width was 40% of the limb diameter. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded five times in each lamb. The highest and the lowest readings were discarded and an average was calculated from the three remaining readings. At all stages of data collection from the lambs, the treatments that their mothers received in the last trimester of gestation was unknown (data collection was blinded). Data were collected from all live lambs at birth (0 singles were born dead and in eight cases one twin of the pair was born dead; 3 C and 5 PG), but in cases where lambs subsequently lost their ear tags (and hence their identity), further data on them were not collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Hormone assays</title><p>Plasma insulin concentrations were determined using a two-site fluoroimmunometric assay (Auto-DELFIA insulin; Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland; catalogue no.

In this study, we have now demonstrated that short duration, high glycaemic intake during late gestation that causes transient elevations in glucose and insulin concentrations, compared to the control ewes, had substantial effects to increase offspring birthweight and postnatal growth rates.</p><p>Women who were randomised to the high glycaemic diet delivered larger infants that were both heavier and larger in size.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> Our study is in agreement with this finding, as lambs born to ewes on a high gycaemic intake delivered heavier lambs with a higher ponderal index than control lambs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). This suggests that our animal model has relevance for investigation of fetal overgrowth mechanisms in humans.</p><p>We found that offspring born to ewes treated with propylene glycol in the last trimester of pregnancy had higher basal plasma glucose concentrations at birth, which could indicate impairment of the carbohydrate metabolism. These findings are in agreement with clinical investigations, which found that offspring born to mothers predisposed to gestational diabetes had elevated frequencies of impaired glucose tolerance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Additionally, offspring of rats displayed long-term alterations of glucose tolerance because of the induction of maternal gestational hyperglycaemia, which can lead to fetal and neonatal hyperinsulinism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> An additional issue is that large for gestational age offspring, of diabetic mothers, are at significant risk of developing metabolic syndrome, which predisposes individuals to diabetes and cardivascular disease in childhood<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and adulthood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> One of the criteria established for metabolic syndrome in this study was hypertension. In our study, we measured blood pressure in all lambs at birth, but found no significant differences (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) between the two groups. Maternal undernutrition has been found to be associated with increased neonatal blood pressure in some studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> although others have found no such effect.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> However, it is possible that differences in blood pressure may not become apparent until later in life. We found that the high glycaemic intake in the last trimester of pregnancy resulted in offspring with faster rates of growth up until 12 weeks of age and reached their slaughter weight of about 40 kg earlier than the control lambs. We hypothesise that altered programming of fetal carbohydrate metabolism may also occur resulting in a persistence of the accelerated growth postnatally, even though the stimulus of maternal hyperglycaemia has been removed.</p><p>The limitations of this study are that we measured blood pressure in neonates and not in later life, it is possible that blood pressure changes may become evident in adolescence or adulthood (as discussed above). While we did not closely monitor the postnatal nutrition of the lambs, we feel that their diets were standardised as they were kept together in the same field with equal access to the dame diet. The strengths of this study are that it is a well-controlled randomised experiment with very good numbers (104 mothers and 150 offspring). Such a study would ethically and practically be difficult to perform on human pregnancy.</p><p>To our knowledge, there have been no previous animal studies carried out to investigate the effect of short duration high glycaemic intakes in the third trimester of pregnancy and its effects on offspring birthweight and growth rates. Our study shows for the first time, in a sheep model, that this resulted in an increased birthweight, basal plasma glucose concentrations and a faster postnatal growth rate in the offspring. Our hypothesis is that maternal hyperglycaemia stimulates fetal insulin production, which has a positive effect on fetal growth. There is evidence that maternal hyperglycaemia can result in chronic fetal hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, which increases fetal fat mass and leptin synthesis within the fetal fat deposits.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>We conclude that our animal model has relevance for the investigation of the effects of transient maternal hyperglycaemia on offspring development and health. Altering the source and pattern of intake of maternal dietary carbohydrate may prove valuable in the management of pregnancies at risk for fetal overgrowth, trauma at parturition and possibly in the subsequent control of childhood obesity.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Disclosure of interests</title><p>The authors have no conflict of interest in publishing this paper.</p></sec><sec><title>Contribution to authorship</title><p>NS helped in the experimental design, performed the experiment, analysed and interpreted the data and wrote the paper.
