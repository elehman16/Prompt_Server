Current international trends confirm women are gaining more weight than men, with younger women of reproductive age at highest risk, with rapid weight gain and high levels of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Weight related health complications in women are broad, however risk of morbidity and mortality increases even with minor gains in weight (0.5&#x000a0;kg) above a healthy body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Increased weight gain and obesity in women is multifactorial, however large cross-sectional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and longitudinal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] studies report weight gain is inversely proportional to current BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and occurs most rapidly in women aged 18&#x02013;40, with ~40-50% already overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Excess weight retention is increasingly common after pregnancy, a recognised high-risk period for weight gain, with 56% of pre-existing overweight and obese women gaining above international Institute of Medicine recommendations for gestational weight gain (GWG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Excessive GWG impacts negatively on health outcomes during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and following pregnancy contributes to increased weight retention, a rise in inter-pregnancy weight and is an independent predictor for subsequent development of obesity and related health implications long-term in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Average weight retained per pregnancy varies by population, however in Australia is ~2-3&#x000a0;kg based on self-reported data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with similar or higher findings reported internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] significantly contributing to the background weight gain observed in younger women currently.</p><p>Intervening to reduce postpartum weight retention is an important public health initiative; however key gaps remain. Previous studies on systematic review show equivocal findings with small sample sizes noted, difficulties with engagement and ambiguity around ideal setting, delivery and intervention length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For these reasons, intervening during pregnancy may be favourable. Pregnancy is recognised as an opportune time with a motivated population, more receptive to lifestyle behaviour change and actively engaged in the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Yet, systematic reviews of antenatal interventions highlight gaps, including poor to moderate quality studies with failure to extend follow-up to the postpartum period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Further, results from interventions in higher risk women (i.e. overweight, obese or at risk of GDM) are inconsistent with some [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but not all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] systematic reviews reporting reduced excessive GWG following lifestyle intervention. Recent research adds to previous equivocal findings, including the large LIMIT trial reporting no significant effect on GWG in predominantly obese women following moderate-high intensity lifestyle intervention with moderate compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>We have previously demonstrated the efficacy of a healthy lifestyle program (HeLP-her) for optimising GWG at 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation in women at increased risk of GDM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Here, we aimed to assess sustained impact of the HeLP-her intervention following pregnancy on postpartum weight retention and changes in health behaviours, following early antenatal intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>Detailed study methods have been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In summary, recruitment took place in the antenatal care setting at three large metropolitan tertiary teaching hospitals in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria, Australia between June 2008 and September 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Women were included if they were &#x02264;15&#x000a0;weeks, had a singleton pregnancy, were overweight (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25.00&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x02265;23.00&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> if high risk ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) or obese (BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30.00&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and at increased risk of GDM as identified by a validated risk prediction tool based on established risk factors including age, BMI, ethnicity and obstetric and family history of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Exclusion criteria included diagnosed diabetes, a BMI &#x02265;45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, non-English speaking women or a pre-existing chronic medical condition that prevented full participation or completion of outcome measures (e.g. psychiatric illness, major depression, significant disability).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>Following initial screening, all eligible women were invited to participate by invitation flyer at their first antenatal booking visit. Those expressing interest were randomly assigned to intervention or control through computer generated randomised sequencing performed by a biostatistician. Allocation concealment was achieved by using sealed opaque envelopes performed by an interventionist. Care providers, investigators and outcome data analysers were blinded to group allocation. Intervention sessions were integrated with routine maternity visits in the clinic setting. All women received standard antenatal care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Control and intervention groups</title><p>Women allocated to the control group received a brief, single non-interactive education session and brief written resources based on the generic Australian Dietary and Physical Activity Guidelines with no further support provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Information regarding GWG was not provided.</p><p>Women in the intervention group participated in four, 45&#x000a0;minute individual behaviour change lifestyle sessions at 14&#x02013;16, 20, 24 and 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation. All intervention content was delivered by 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation and underpinned by behavioural principles of the Social Cognitive Theory, informed by our successful lifestyle intervention program (HeLP-her) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Sessions were delivered by a health coach who had undergone intervention specific training. Intervention content focused on simple, pregnancy specific healthy eating and physical activity messages as well as encouraging healthy GWG according to the IOM guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] supported by behaviour change strategies designed to optimise lifestyle, GWG (as previously described) and reduce post-partum weight retention in an individualised, interactive environment. Behaviour change and self-management strategies included goal setting, addressing barriers, positive self-talk and relapse prevention in the form of self-directed small, sustainable adjustments to dietary intake and physical activity. Personal goals were discussed and revised at each session, behavioural skills practised and personal action plans supported by written hand-outs. Recommended self-monitoring resources included pedometers and the use of weight gain charts based on international Institute Of Medicine (IOM) recommendations for weight gain during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. On-going contact and support with mobile phone SMS text messages, personalised by participant name, were provided throughout the study duration commencing from the third lifestyle session. Text messages reinforced simple intervention health messages for diet, physical activity, behaviour change and relapse prevention. Two healthy lifestyle postcards were also sent at 30 and 34&#x000a0;weeks gestation to maintain engagement and remind participants of the simple health messages. Southern Health Research Advisory and Ethics Committee approved the study and all participants gave written consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Measures</title><p>Outcome measures were completed at baseline (12&#x02013;15 weeks), 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation and 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum.

Measured weight at baseline was used for all analyses due to inaccuracies associated with self-reported weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Physical activity</title><p>The Yamax Digiwalker SW-700 Pedometer (Yamax Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) was used to assess the number of free-living steps per day as a tool with demonstrated accuracy in pregnancy, as we have previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Pedometers were sealed and worn for a minimum of three to seven consecutive days during waking hours, including at least one weekend day, which has previously shown to be reliable for estimating weekly physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. All participants were advised on correct usage and provided with a diary to record wearing times. A full day was considered as wearing the device for at least eight daytime hours and a half day was considered as less than eight hours, but more than three hours. If worn for less than three hours a day, this was treated as a missing day. Readings were processed to provide average daily step count according to total days worn.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Gestational diabetes diagnostic criteria</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>GDM diagnosis</title><p>GDM was diagnosed based on the Australasian Diabetes in Pregnancy Society (ADIPS) criteria including the presence of either a fasting venous plasma glucose level of &#x02265;99&#x000a0;mg/dl (&#x02265;5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L) and/or a 2&#x000a0;hour level of &#x02265;144&#x000a0;mg/dl (&#x02265;8.0&#x000a0;mmol/L) following a 75&#x000a0;g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD with 95% confidence intervals (CI) unless otherwise stated.

These findings persisted after adjustment for baseline BMI, GDM diagnosis, country of birth and age, which also independently predicted weight retention at 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum. Exploratory analysis demonstrated a greater intervention effect in overweight compared to obese women, in those not diagnosed with GDM compared to those diagnosed with GDM, in non-Australian born compared to Australian born women, with significant treatment group differences by 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum.</p><p>Longitudinal studies demonstrate rapid weight gain in reproductive aged women, increasing yearly by ~700 grams, equivalent to ~7&#x000a0;kg per decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Weight retention associated with pregnancy is common, exacerbating background weight gain in younger women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, the degree of prevention of postpartum weight retention in the current study is of public health significance. Previous findings indicate that natural weight retention at 6&#x000a0;weeks postpartum is ~2.5&#x000a0;kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], however varies depending on population, time course following pregnancy and accuracy of measurement. Our current results are consistent with this degree of weight retention in our control group highlighting pregnancy as a key high risk life stage for targeted intervention. In the years following pregnancy, women retain a self-reported 2-3&#x000a0;kg based on reports from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women&#x02019;s Health (ALSWH) study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], with similar or higher findings reported in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Increased weight retention from excess GWG predicts long term obesity with a 3 fold increased risk of being overweight 16&#x000a0;years post-pregnancy if GWG exceeds IOM guidelines, as well as increasing comorbidities including central adiposity and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Data from the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study data suggest that long term health risks including the risk of coronary heart disease increases by 3.1% for each kilogram in weight gained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and the risk of diabetes increases linearly from a body mass index of 22&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For these reasons, modest improvements in weight gain prevention are significant from a public health perspective and may impact on longer term weight, obesity rates and potentially on long term complications especially if modifiable health behaviours are sustained. However, longer term follow-up studies are needed to clarify the latter.</p><p>With up to 50% of women in developed countries entering pregnancy overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], early preconception education is ideal, yet barriers include engagement, health provider contact and unplanned conception. Engaging women following pregnancy is equally difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, optimising GWG has potential to prevent pregnancy complications, prevent weight retention postpartum and reduce long term weight related complications, yet there is a significant research gap in low-intensity, effective interventions during pregnancy with few extending to, or reporting, postpartum weight retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of the limited studies that have, efficacy has not been demonstrated in overweight women, despite frequent contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and additional support for excessive gainers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with increased intensity potentially contributing to high reported attrition rates of &#x0003e;30% overall across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Here, we advance knowledge in this field by targeting a group of high risk overweight and obese women in early pregnancy, implementing a non-intensive individualised behavioural change intervention, achieving high retention rates (~90%) and demonstrating significant reduced postpartum weight retention in overweight women. By aligning the intervention with routine antenatal care, we demonstrate opportunity for implementation in to routine antenatal care as an approach to optimise GWG and potentially, improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Consistent with previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], we have shown here that postpartum weight retention is inversely related to pre-regnancy BMI, with non-obese women at greatest risk. It is notable that the current intervention was most effective in this non-obese cohort of women who are at highest risk for weight gain in pregnancy. Further research in obese cohorts is needed with previous research of different intensities producing contradicting effects on weight change in obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and current ongoing research with larger populations in the US and Europe may provide additional insight. As noted previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], the intervention was more effective in reducing postpartum weight retention in non-Australian born women, comprising ~60% of the study population. The prevention of weight gain reported (~2.5&#x000a0;kg between treatment groups) is important given the greater risk for weight gain in pregnancy and for GDM diagnosis, which may, in part relate to cultural beliefs and practices, including reduced engagement in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. A diagnosis of GDM at 28&#x000a0;weeks gestation was associated with reduced weight retention overall, most likely contributed to by increased health professional engagement and intensive medical intervention following GDM diagnosis and potentially reducing intervention effect in this sub-group.</p><p>Interestingly, in the current study we were unable to demonstrate significant changes or between group differences in physical activity as measured by daily step count. This could be explained by the self-management intervention design, with small, sustainable adjustments to a range of healthy lifestyle behaviours encouraged in an individualised environment according to participant goals, which were variable between intervention participants. Strengths of the current study include an intervention that is based on an established behavioural theory and informed by our previous lifestyle interventions programs that have been effective in other populations and settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The low-intensity study design is feasible and sustainable, reflected by factors including delivery by a trained health coach, a low attrition rate of ~10%, primarily attributed to pre-term birth and miscarriage and a high compliance rate of between 90-95% of allocated intervention participants receiving the intended intervention content. Further strengths include a pre-specified population of high-risk women identified at increased risk of GDM on a validated screening tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], prospective anthropometric assessment by investigators blinded to group allocation and successful delivery to an ethnically diverse, heterogeneous group of women of moderate socio-economic advantage, indicating that the messages implemented were easily transferable across sociocultural beliefs and practices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results demonstrate an evidence-based, low-intensity, self-management intervention delivered in early pregnancy reduces postpartum weight retention in high-risk overweight, culturally diverse women, who currently comprise the highest risk of weight gain in general and obstetric populations. With effective engagement, motivation and adherence, further translational research is now required to enable integration and broad scale up into routine antenatal care. This needs to include health economic evaluation, production of accessible resources, cultural change and education of health professionals, engagement of policy makers and funders and changes in health care delivery systems to enable population based prevention of postpartum weight retention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>The Southern Health Research Advisory and Ethics Committee approved the study and all participants gave written informed consent.
