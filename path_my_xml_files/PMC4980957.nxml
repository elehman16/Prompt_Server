Today an estimated 50 million people live with epilepsy, 80% of whom reside in developing countries. The prevalence of epilepsy is estimated to be around 10 million in Indian population. People with epilepsy have greater cognitive and behavioral dysfunction than the general population. The incidence of cognitive impairment among epileptics is 40%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Their worries include learning disabilities, academic difficulties, poor attention and concentration, and impoverished memory.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In a survey by the International Bureau of Epilepsy, 44% of patients with epilepsy complained of difficulty in learning, and 45% of slowness in thinking.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] It has also been demonstrated that cognitive function is a significant predictor of self-evaluation of the quality of life among adults with epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Cognitive disturbances in epilepsy are multifactorial in origin including underlying neuropathology, anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) and psychosocial issues of the patient due to the disease.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The incidence of AED-induced cognitive dysfunction is about 28%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Older AEDs have higher cognitive disturbances than newer AEDs.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] There is no specific treatment available for the cognitive impairment of these patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Excitotoxicity, mediated by glutamate acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the hippocampus, can cause memory dysfunction in epilepsy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Alteration of this excitotoxic pathway can be a novel, potentially safer and more effective, approach to the treatment of memory loss.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Memantine is a noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor. It interacts with the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding site of the channel to prevent excessive activation while sparing normal function.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Memantine significantly reduces the rate of clinical deterioration in patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's dementia by reducing excitotoxicity and preventing cell damage.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This drug exerts its therapeutic effect in various conditions mainly by blocking glutamate excitotoxicity. It also has antioxidant property and increases production of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Memantine is approved drug by Food and Drug Administration (2004) for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's dementia.

This effect started at the 4<sup>th</sup> week of memantine therapy and highly significant improvement in cognitive score was seen at the 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> week of follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000), which corresponds to 10 mg once daily dosage of memantine. Our study also showed statistically significant improvement in memory assessed by WMS in memantine group compared with the placebo. This significant effect was observed from the 9<sup>th</sup> week of memantine therapy and highly significant improvement was seen at the 16<sup>th</sup> week of follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).</p><p>The molecular mechanism behind cognitive and memory impairment in epileptic patients receiving AEDs is due to excitotoxic damage caused to the brain by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate through NMDA receptor. This glutamate excess affects long term potentiation and learning under pathological conditions which lead to neuronal cell death and free radical formation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>The interventional drug in our study, memantine is an NMDA receptor antagonist (noncompetitive). It can prevent the excitotoxic damage to the brain by blocking the NMDA receptor channel and by preventing glutamate action, which contribute to cognitive and memory improvement as shown by our study. In addition, memantine reduces oxidative stress and increases the level of BDNF, which in turn would add to memory improvement. The transient blockade of activated NMDA receptors by low-affinity agents, inhibits their pathological functions only, leaving physiological functions unaltered.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Memantine is a fast-binding antagonist which binds to the channel in a pseudo- first order manner. It also dissociates from the receptor quickly and in a concentration independent manner which allows the binding of memantine without affecting its removal from the site of action and increased potency with fewer side effects.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In comparison with other antagonists (dextromethorphan, ketamine, amantadine), memantine is fast acting and has less effect on physiologic mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Subset assessment of memory showed improvement in mental control in memantine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at 10 mg dose. Logical memory showed statistically significant improvement in the memantine group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000) at 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> week which corresponds to the dose of 10 mg once daily. Memory span subset of WMS also showed highly significant improvement in the memantine group at the 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> week in comparison with the placebo. Visual reproduction subset also showed highly significant improvement in the memantine group at the 12<sup>th</sup> and 16<sup>th</sup> week. Associate learning subset of memantine group showed statistically significant improvement 16<sup>th</sup> follow-up week in comparison with the placebo.</p><p>Based on our results, there is significant improvement in cognitive and memory dysfunction for epileptic patients at 10 mg once daily oral dose.</p><p>As the efficacy of memantine is investigated in epilepsy, which is one of a critical disease, we cautiously started with an initial therapeutic dose of 5 mg for the first 8 weeks followed by 10 mg for the next 8 weeks.</p><p>Memantine also improved the self-reported memory function and quality of life in epileptic patients as assessed by QOLIE-10-P questionnaire with minimal side effects. In our study, the memantine group had low seizure frequency in comparison with baseline as observed from the seizure dairy of patients. The seizure reducing ability of memantine can be evaluated in detail for control of seizures in future.</p><p>This study also has some limitations. The study period was relatively short. Long-term assessment for the efficacy and safety of memantine can be investigated. We recruited adult patients of age between 18 and 55 years; however the incidence of cognitive impairment in adolescent age group epileptic patients is around 50%, which would certainly impair the cognitive and academic performances of these patients. The possible effect of memantine to improve memory in children and adolescent age group epileptic patients can also be done.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>From this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study to evaluate the efficacy of memantine for mild to moderate cognitive impairment in epileptic patients, we conclude that memantine 10 mg oral, once daily significantly improves mild to moderate cognitive and memory impairment in epileptic patients receiving AEDs when compared with placebo group. Self-reported memory and quality of life significantly improved with 10 mg once-daily memantine at the end of 16<sup>th</sup> week of treatment.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>SRM Medical College Hospital and Research Centre, Kattankulathur - 603 203, Kancheepuram district, Tamil Nadu, India.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the study participants for their cooperation and commitment.
