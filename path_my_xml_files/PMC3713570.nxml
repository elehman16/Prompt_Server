An equally important parameter in the semen analysis is sperm motility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>The WHO and many laboratories use a cut off of 40% progressive motility as the lower limit of normal, whereas others use less than 40% motility as a criterion for defining poor sperm motility (asthenospermia).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Overall, asthenospermia indicates testicular or epididymal failure that can be caused by numerous causes.</p><p>The cause of the asthenospermia is not exactly clear. It may be due to autoimmunity to the sperm, pyospermia, partial obstruction of the ejaculatory ducts in unsuccessful vasectomy reversal operation, longer abstinence intervals, and varicoceles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Also the immotile cilia syndrome (Kartagener syndrome), in which the sperms have tail defects and cannot flagellate, can cause asthenospermia or necrospermia. Hyperviscosity has also been suggested as a possible causes of an artificially decreased the motility of spermatozoa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Ketotifen, a tricyclic benzocycloheptatiophene, is most commonly used for prevention and treatment of allergic reactions of the respiratory and integumentary systems. It has a stabilizing effect on the mast cells (MCs). Additionally, this agent also blocks histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) receptors and inhibits SRS-A (the slow releasing substance of anaphylaxis) and phosphodiesterase release with increasing intracellular Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) concentrations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Ketotifen's androgenic effects on male infertility, associated with oligospermia and asthenospermia, have been reported previously.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Studies have also shown that it may counteract the ability of MCs to trigger an inflammatory response. It is worth mentioning that the number of MCs sometimes increases more than normal in the testicular tissue of infertile men.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Yamamoto <italic>et al</italic>., revealed that the MC blocker, tranilast, could significantly improve the concentrations and motility of sperm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Moreover, administration of the tranilast has resulted in increasing pregnancy rate comparing non-treated couples.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, the data in support of using ketotifen to improve sperm motility followed pregnancy rate is limited. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the potential efficacy of ketotifen on sperm motility and then pregnancy rate in intrauterine insemination for male factor infertility associated with asthenospermia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Forty couples with male factor infertility were participated in this study during the period from May 2010 to December 2011. A full assessment includes demographic information (including ages of couple, duration of marriage, and infertility) and medical and gynecological histories with physical examination and routine laboratory screening (including Body mass index (BMI), complete blood count (CBC), Pap smear, Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), and viral serology). Also, a Hysterosalpingography (HSG) or a laparoscopy for tubal and peritoneal factors in the women and a semen analysis for evaluation of men were done.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were infertile couples with just male factor infertility associated with asthenospermia (less than 40% progressive motile sperm) and absence of female factor infertility. However, the infertile couples associated with a clinical varicocele were excluded.</p><p>The semen specimen was collected by masturbation after an abstinence period of 2-3 days.</p><p>After a primary semen analysis, ketotifen was administered 1 mg bid for 2 months. Second semen analysis was done 2-3 weeks after ketotifen treatment was stopped and then sperm motility was examined. Clinical pregnancy was identified by the presence of a fetal sac detected by vaginal ultrasound.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>End points</title><p>The end point of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ketotifen on sperm motility of asthenospermic infertile men.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were carried out with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 16 statistical software.

None of the couples was lost to follow up [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The two groups were similar except for the date of acceptance of the patients (the seasonal changes) for investigate. The females of the infertile couples were non gravid. The men were aged 23-40 years of mean age 32.8 and the mean duration of infertility among participants was at least 2 years. Twenty-eight cases of the infertile couples (70%) had primary infertility and the remaining 12 (30%) had secondary infertility [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of sperm motility percent between non-treated (MBT) and treated (MAT) groups in primary and secondary infertility cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-6-19-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Couples demographic and clinical characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-6-19-g002"/></table-wrap><p>None of the men of the ketotifen treated group reported adverse events that were linked apparently to the treatment. All parameters measured in semen analysis i.e., sperm count, morphology, volume, and pH according to World Health Organization (WHO) were normal except for the motility. Sperm motility in 34 cases was 10-35% and in six cases was 0%.</p><p>The mean sperm motility before treatment was 16.7% &#x000b1; 3.8, whereas after ketotifen treatment was 21.4% &#x000b1; 4.2 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>] and it was statistically significant difference especially in primary infertility (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In 52% of asthenospermia cases, the percent of sperm motility was increased (from 5% to 35%) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Also in 33% of necrospermia (0% motility), this variable was increased (from 23% to 25%). The cumulative pregnancy rate (12.5%) in the treated couples was more pronounced than the non treated group (4.3%).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of sperm motility percent between non-treated (MBT) and treated (MAT) groups in asthenospermic infertile men</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JHRS-6-19-g003"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Some studies have been reported that MCs, which play a key role in the inflammation, hypersensitivity and fibrosis, are as well normally present in the testes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The previous studies suggest that there is a prominent increase in the number of testicular MCs in the testes of infertile men which may disrupt spermatogenesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Also it was reported that increased numbers of MCs have been associated with different types of infertility, including asthenospermia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Therefore some of male factor infertility problems could possibly diminished if such pathogenesis agent would greatly reduce using drug that block MC mediator release.</p><p>In the present study, it was observed that the percent of sperm motility in asthenospermic infertile men and also, surprisingly, in necrospermic cases remarkably increased.</p><p>As mentioned in the introduction, ketotifen is a tricyclic benzocycloheptatiophene having a high affinity for blocking histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) receptors that most commonly used for prevention and treatment of allergic reactions of the respiratory and integumentary systems.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Regardless of there being various reports on enhanced fertility following given of MC blockers, there is contrary report about the effect of ketotifen, as a MC blocker, on sperm motility or rate of pregnancy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Kondo <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and Slater <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] suggested that ketotifen can block the H<sub>1</sub> receptor, which is present in the male reproductive tract; consequently, it may reduce the effectiveness of histamine.</p><p>Anderson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] identified that ketotifen also prevents degradation of MCs and accordingly inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators. These findings show a relation between ketotifen and inflammatory mediators and therefore may be useful to inhibit inflammatory mediator's activities of MC in the testes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Therefore, it seems that in this way ketotifen may improve semen parameters in infertile men.</p><p>Schill <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] also suggested that ketotifen can be more helpful to improve the patients&#x02019; sperm count and sperm motility with idiopathic oligo/asthenospermia. However, the ongoing pregnancy rate was within the range of spontaneous conception.</p><p>Contrary, the current study, more significant in increasing motility in sperm, showed that the cumulative pregnancy in the treated couples significantly improved by 4 months post-treatment compared with the non-treated ones.</p><p>Alejandro <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] carried out a study to assess the efficacy of daily administration of ketotifen, on the semen quality of men with leukocytospermia and unexplained infertility. They noticed that ketotifen diminished the white blood cell count in semen and so the sperm motility have been dramatically improved. Moreover, the number of morphologically normal spermatozoa was more pronounced at 8 weeks of treatment and these changes remained until at least 4 weeks after stopped of ketotifen treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although the present study had a number of restrictions; first, it was not double blind. Sample size and power to detect clinically essential outcomes were small. The trial was not designed with sufficient power to address important basic outcomes. Nevertheless, it was shown that it seems the failure rate of infertility treatments can be decreased if MC blockers such as ketotifen are given to the asthenospermic men before who were enrolled in intrauterine insemination (IUI) or ART cycles of treatment. Indeed, it seems that further research is necessary to identify the precise capacity of ketotifen to improve quality of semen parameters and whether this MC blocker has effects on the cumulative outcome of reproductive.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the efforts of all Fertility, Infertility and Perinatology Research Center and Mrs.
