However, the high incidence of residual paralyze is still a problem despite the introduction of newer intermediate-acting nondepolarizing NMBs and better monitoring techniques.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Today many agents are available for reversing postoperative effects of nondepolarizing blockade. The anticholinesterase agents&#x02019; effects include direct stimulation of motor end terminal, increasing acetylcholine (Ach) secretion, removing muscle relaxants from receptors and reversible inactivation of Ach esterase enzyme.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In addition to blocking reversing effects, cholinesterase inhibitors have some adverse muscarinic effects over cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and pulmonary systems.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Atropine sulfate and glycopyrrolate can subside these adverse muscarinic effects with some unfavorable anticholinergic actions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Sugammadex that is a modified gamma cyclodextrin has introduced to anesthesia practice in recent years. It removes NMB in a quick and safe manner.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Sugammadex encapsulates steroid NMB agents (rocuronium, vecuronium) and detach them from nicotinic acetylcholin receptors such like a synthetic receptor.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Sugammadex is a biologically inactive, well-tolerable and safe agent, which has not revealed any significant cardiovascular or hemodynamic adverse effect in preclinical studies up to known.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Train of four (TOF) Watch acceleromyography device is used for recording evoked muscle responses because of its accuracy, simplicity and suitability for routine usage during surgery and in the post anesthesia care unit. In acceleromyography, a small piezoelectric transducer converts measured accelerations into electric signals then they are presented as clear neuromuscular transmissions. Four stimulation patterns is currently used in acceleromyographs; single twitch, TOF, tetanic stimulation and post tetanic count, double burst stimulation.</p><p>In this study, we compared the clinical effects of sugammadex versus classical combination of anticholinergic-anticholinesterase agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ethical Committee approval and informed consents of parents&#x02019; were obtained before the study (Research Project Number 0428/10.08.2011). Sixty pediatric patients age between 2 and 12 and American Society of Anesthesiologist 1-2 whom should be performed general anesthesia in the supine position for ear nose and throat surgery were enrolled in this randomized double-blinded clinical trial. Patients with renal disease, liver disease, neuromuscular disease, known malign hyperthermia in the family history, drug uptake that can cause interaction with rocuronium, have predictors for intubation limitation didn&#x02019;t included to the study. The patients randomized with opaque closed envelope technique into two groups; as sugammadex receiving (n: 30) group 1 and neostigmine/atropine (n: 30) receiving group 2. After arrival to the operation room, monitoring of; noninvasive arterial blood pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, electrocardiograms and cutaneous temperature were applied. Upon the operation peripheral, cutaneous temperatures were kept above 32&#x000b0;C by using blankets. Neuromuscular conduction were assessed by TOF-Watch SX (Organon, Schering-Plough, Ireland) acceleromyograph device. In order to decrease surface tension, the cutaneous sites were wiped by alcoholed cotton. Soon after a couple of electrodes were placed 3-4 cm apart from each other through ulnar nerve trace of left wrist while transducer was placed on pulp of left thumb. 1 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl and 2 mg/kg propofol administrated to patients by intravenous (iv) route. Basal activities, which occurred after supramaximal stimulation of ulnar nerve via TOF device were recorded by intervals of 15 s. This preceding stabilization accelomylography phase ended 3 min later and followed by administration of 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium (Esmeron 50 mg/5 ml Schering-Plough) to complete the induction. All the patients were intubated at the moment of TOF 0. Maintenance anesthesia provided by 50% O<sub>2</sub>-50% N<sub>2</sub>O and sevofluran (MAC 1.3-1.5) combination. We evaluated the need for additional muscle relaxant by using TOF Watch acceleromyograph during the operation. When we observed 2 twitches present in TOF stimulation it is time to administered additional muscle relaxant, and rocuronium (0.1-0.2 mg/kg) were applied for this purpose. Measurements were carried out before intubation, at 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup> min after entubation as well as 15<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup>, 60<sup>th</sup>, 90<sup>th</sup> s and 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup> min after reversing of blockade period. Emergence of T2 point (two contractions) on TOF device was replied by iv 2 mg/kg sugammadex (Bridion 200 mg/ml Merck Sharp Dohme) administration to group 1 patients and 0.06 mg/kg neostigmine + 0.02 mg/kg atropine administration to group 2 patients. The test drug was preparing by a researcher and giving to the researcher who administered the drug and was blind to the drug. The person who evaluates the patients&#x02019; situation and adverse effects was also blind to the drug. Some parameters, including hemodynamic alterations, access to T0.9 and extubation time were recorded for each patient. Inhalation agents were sustained until T0.9 point in order to avoid any interaction with muscle relaxation. At the moment of T0.9 inhalation, gases were ceased, and patients were extubated properly after spontaneous breathing. In the post extubation, phase patients were monitored, and all observations were recorded and scored at 5<sup>th</sup>, 10<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup>, 30<sup>th</sup> min of this phase. The scored observations involved; respiration status (able to breath and coughing: 2, dyspnea or limited respiration: 1), O<sub>2</sub> saturation (In room atmosphere &#x0003e;92%: 2, reaches SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;90% by O<sub>2</sub> support: 1, &#x0003c;90% despite O<sub>2</sub> therapy: 0), head elevation (&#x0003e;5 s yes: 1, no: 2), exhibiting tongue (yes: 1, no: 2), muscle strength (total paralyze: 0, no loss of muscle strength: 10) and state of consciousness (fully awake: 2, awake by stimulus: 1, no response: 0). Total rocuronium and fentanyl consumption and related adverse effects including vomiting, spasm and desaturation for each patient were recorded also.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>In order to provide an analytic power of 95% and a probability value of 5%, the postreverse T0.9 reaching durations of groups were evaluated and at least a difference of 15.2 units in terms of geometrical means between two groups, considered to be significant in the analysis, we needed at least 17 patients for each group.

Recovery of motor functions was slower when compared to group 1 and this finding was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>Sacan <italic>et al</italic>. could not show any significance, in vomiting rates and they related it to few numbers of patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Woo <italic>et al</italic>. reported nausea and vomiting in 3 patients in the sugammadex group and 6 patients in the neostigmine group and all patients from both treatment groups who experienced nausea and vomiting had at least two baseline risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Abrishami <italic>et al</italic>. had focused, to adverse effects in their study and reported no significance between sugammadex and neostigmin receiving groups.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Plaud <italic>et al</italic>. had conducted a study involving pediatric patients and reported some adverse effects with sugammadex. With a dose of 4 mg/kg sugammadex, 2 patients exhibited urinary retention, dysuria and one exhibited fever, weight loss, hematuria and diarrhea during a patient experienced vomiting by 2 mg/kg sugammadex.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we could not demonstrate a significance involving vomiting-nausea, and rates of vomiting-nausea were detected as <italic>n</italic> = 2 (6.7%) for group 1 and <italic>n</italic> = 5 (16.7%) for group 2 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.424).</p><p>Ledowski <italic>et al</italic>. compared reversal strategies in their study and found that those reversed with sugammadex showed fewer episodes of postoperative oxygen desaturation (15% vs. 33%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). TOF ratios of &#x0003c;0.7 and also &#x0003c;0.9 were more likely associated with X-ray results consistent with postoperative atelectasis or pneumonia.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In current study 2 patients (6.7%) in each groups, experienced desaturation after extubation, and they responded to O<sub>2</sub> support quickly (<italic>P</italic> = 1.000). These patients were at the level of T0.9 that points out sufficient muscle strength and lack of anticholinesterase effect. Hence, the occurrence of desaturation is likely related to the nature of the operation of our study group. Our study has some limitations; we included pediatric patients whom ear, nose and throat surgery were performed, and the nature of the operation caused complications like edema or laryngeal spasm due to the manuplations. Complication like desaturation was our evaluation criteria, and we confused about the nature of it; inadequate reversal of muscle relaxant or spasm or edema of the involved area. Did not select the operation, which the muscle relaxant effect is more necessary and easily observed, like abdominal surgery, was our second limitation. If we select abdominal surgery group, we may evaluate necessity of additional muscle relaxant usage or the reversal effect more appropriately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>As a conclusion, pediatric patients who received sugammadex, demonstrated significantly a shorter duration of TOF 0.9 and extubation than neostigmin + atropin receivers. Other recovery parameters including, head elevation, muscle strength and state of consciousness were also regained more rapidly in the sugammadex administrated group than neostigmine group. Comparison of adverse effects yielded no difference as a highlighted finding. In the light of all these findings sugammadex can be considered as a safe agent in order to reverse neuromuscular block in a safe and proper manner with few adverse effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>&#x000c7;&#x000d6; contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
