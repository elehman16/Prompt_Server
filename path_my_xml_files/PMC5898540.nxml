Forty-eight cancer patients will be randomized into either of three intervention groups or a no-training control group.

While the treatment options are manifold, neoadjuvant and/or perioperative chemotherapy are considered essentially important for the progression-free and overall survival of cancer patients <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, it is well known that the high toxicity of chemotherapy leads to a number of tremendous short- and long-term adverse effects (i.e. chemo toxicity), presenting a dramatic impact on the quality of life of these patients. Most common short-term side effects include nausea, emesis and cancer-related fatigue, while long-term effects are characterized by declines in physical performance and decreased quality of life, accompanied by neutropenia-induced declines in immune function <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Physical exercise is known for its potential to reduce chemo toxicity throughout a wide range of cancer entities <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, the observed absolute effects of exercise are often only moderate <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This outcome may be especially related to a poor training adherence, which is typically reported in these patients <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Moreover, most of the available studies have utilized low to moderate exercise intensities in training regimes, while studies specifically investigating high-intensity interval training for the adjuvant treatment of cancer are rare.</p><p id="p0020">Previous studies have indicated that increasing (i.e. hyperoxia) or decreasing (i.e. hypoxia) the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) during exercise training may induce substantial physiological alterations both in diseased <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> and healthy populations <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, and may, thus, also enhance the effects of exercise as an adjuvant therapy for cancer patients. For example, Moore and colleagues <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> showed in patients with chronic heart failure that exercise in hyperoxia led to increased arterial oxygen saturation, while concomitantly reducing minute ventilation, cardiac output and subjective scores for fatigue. Similar findings were also observed in a previous pilot study in diabetic patients during sub-maximal aerobic cycling exercise <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Both moderate and high-intensity exercise in mild hypoxia, on the other hand, have previously been shown to mobilize NK-cells and improve NK-cell cytotoxicity <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> in healthy subjects, which would possibly aid slowing down tumor growth in cancer patients. The effects of strenuous exercise in hyperoxia on immune function have yet to be investigated.</p><p id="p0025">According to Craike and colleagues <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, exercise regimes which are perceived less strenuous but do not compromise or even optimize the training-induced physiological and patient-related outcomes will help to increase adherence to exercise and reduce attrition. The aim of this 4-armed study is, thus, to investigate the feasibility of a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) performed with increased FiO<sub>2</sub> as compared to the same training performed in normoxia. As patients undergoing chemotherapy may not be able to perform strenuous exercise training in hypoxic conditions, a third group will be included into this study performing all high-intensity interval bouts with an increased FiO<sub>2</sub>, while during the rest periods FiO<sub>2</sub> will be reduced (i.e. hypoxia). In other words, we are aiming to assess whether the physiological and patient-reported outcomes can be improved, while the perceived effort is reduced when FiO<sub>2</sub> during strenuous exercise as well as the rest periods are modified.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="p0030">The current study will be carried out in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki and received ethical approval by the Ethics Committee of the German Sport University, Cologne.

While it has been well documented that physical exercise may aid in reducing chemotherapy-induced side effects in various types of cancer <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, little is known on the effects of exercise with modified systemic oxygen concentrations on cancer-specific outcomes and this knowledge stems from studies in healthy subjects <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p id="p0190">The primary outcome of this study is to investigate the feasibility and compliance of HIIT with increased FiO<sub>2</sub> as well as both increased FiO<sub>2</sub> during exercise bouts and reduced FiO2 during rest intervals in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy. Based on previous studies in patients with diabetes <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and chronic heart failure <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, we hypothesize that such training will significantly reduce the perceived effort and, thus, the physical strain of strenuous exercise. This will be assessed by patient-related outcomes, such as fatigue and pain scales, as well as RPE-scores. As a novel tool in this population, we will also implement the assessment of autonomous nervous function by means of heart rate variability, throughout the exercise protocol as well as the consecutive nights. Furthermore, measures of hormone concentrations will provide an objective measure to determine the anabolic or catabolic state, acutely induced by a single exercise session and chronically after 4 weeks of training <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p id="p0195">Despite the investigation of feasibility and compliance, we are also aiming to gain initial insights into the physiological adaptations of such training regimen in cancer patients. In a previous review in healthy individuals, it was shown that exercise in hyperoxic conditions may acutely enhance endurance and sprint interval performance by accelerating recovery processes. Furthermore, studies clearly indicate that an increased FiO<sub>2</sub> leads to an enhanced cellular diffusion of oxygen <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, but significantly less is known about physiological adaptations to prolonged training <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Thus, in the present study oxygen delivery capacities will be assessed by means of oxygen consumption during an incremental bike ergometer test, pulse wave analysis, near-infrared spectroscopy and red blood cell deformability.</p><p id="p0200">Both moderate and intensive exercise in hypoxia have previously been associated with increased NK-cell mobilization and cytotoxicity in healthy individuals <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is likely that these effects were in part triggered by an increased secretion of stress hormones (e.g. catecholamines) due to an increased selective detachment of NK-cells from endothelial cells as shown both in animal <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and human studies <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Even though in the present study hypoxic air will only be administered during rest periods in between bouts of HIIT, changes in catecholamines will also be assessed and possible associations with potentially improved NK-cell mobility will be determined.</p><p id="p0205">Much of the beneficial effects of aerobic exercise in both healthy subjects and patients are thought to be brought about by oxidative stress <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Initially the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by exhaustive exercise may induce tissue damage <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and, thus, blunt muscle contractions <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In fact, it has also been shown that increased ROS potentially contribute to the progression of cancer <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, this transient increase in ROS is typically accompanied by an adaptive up-regulation of antioxidant genes, improving immune function <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and stimulating adaptive systemic responses <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Because it is reasonable to assume that modified FiO<sub>2</sub> during exercise will impact on the oxidative stress response, this will be assessed in the present study.</p><p id="p0210">To the best of our knowledge, to date no studies have investigated the combined effects of exercise and hyperoxic and/or hypoxic conditions in cancer patients. Based on findings of previous studies in both diseased and healthy populations, it is reasonable to assume that such method may substantially increase the adherence to regular exercise in these patients, while it may at the same time provide a larger window for beneficial physiological adaptations.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adamsen</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Quist</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of a multimodal high intensity exercise intervention in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy: randomised controlled trial</article-title><source>BMJ Clin.
