Increasingly, the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) is also used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Different methods can be used to report these composite indices: (1) response to treatment (eg, ACR criteria) versus disease state (DAS28 criteria); (2) &#x0201c;stringent&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;less stringent&#x0201d; assessment (eg, ACR70 versus ACR20); (3) time to onset of a successful response (eg, time to achievement of ACR50) or (4) sustainability of a response (eg, maintenance of an ACR50 over a given period of time).</p><p>To evaluate the performance of these methods, several different perspectives may be considered: those of the clinical trial investigator, the rheumatologist and the patient. For example, the trial investigator seeks to reduce the costs and risks associated with trial design by determining the discriminatory capacity of specific reporting methods. Primarily, this may be achieved by reducing the number of patients needed to study (NNS) to discriminate between active drug and placebo. In order to prevent irreversible loss of physical function, one of the rheumatologist&#x02019;s primary aims is to inhibit structural damage, as assessed by scores including the Sharp score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> and its modifications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Finally, patients are concerned with the impact of their condition on daily life, including dimensions such as quality of care. All three groups are concerned with efficacy, safety, sustainability of response to treatment or disease activity status.</p><p>The performance of different methods of reporting ACR and DAS28-based criteria according to the different viewpoints or perspectives described above has not previously been studied in a single patient cohort. To address this, we used data from the phase III, Abatacept in Inadequate Responders to Methotrexate (AIM) trial in patients with RA. The efficacy and safety results from this trial have been reported elsewhere, using prespecified primary and secondary endpoints.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> The objective of the present exploratory analysis was to evaluate different methods of reporting ACR and DAS28-based criteria for their ability to discriminate between active and inactive drugs, to reflect the absence of structural damage progression or to reflect whether patients are satisfied with their treatment. Whereas a range of additional methods is also currently used to assess clinical efficacy,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> exhaustive assessment of all of these measures is beyond the scope of this publication and we have focused on the most commonly used composite indices in clinical trials. To simplify the outputs of this analysis further, presentation of data relating to onset and sustainability have been limited to ACR50 and low disease activity state (LDAS; DAS28 &#x02a7d;3.2).</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Database</title><p>The analyses reported here were exploratory assessments of a global, phase III, 1-year, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study of abatacept compared with placebo (2 : 1) in combination with methotrexate in patients with active RA and an inadequate response to methotrexate (clinical trials registration number NCT00048568).

Responses were dichotomisd as follows: 1, 2, 3 (favourable) versus 4, 5 (not favourable). A sensitivity analysis was performed using different cut-offs for dichotomization (1, 2, (favourable) vs 3, 4, 5 (not favourable)); results were not affected by cut-off choice (data not shown).</p><p>To evaluate the relevance of the different reporting techniques for ability to reflect the inhibition of structural damage progression and patient satisfaction, positive likelihood ratios (LR)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> were calculated. Available abatacept and placebo data for patients in the AIM trial were pooled at each time point (as-observed analysis). An LR determines the likelihood of a given clinical finding in a patient with a studied disorder compared with that in a patient without the studied disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> The LR, which combines information on sensitivity and specificity, is used to select the best and most appropriate diagnostic tests. LR may range from 0 to infinity. An LR greater than 1 indicates an increased probability that the target disorder is present and an LR less than 1 indicates a decreased probability that the target disorder is present. Likelihood ratios of 2, 5 and 10 increase the probability of the studied disorder by approximately 15%, 30% and 45%, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> Based on the literature, a positive LR greater than 2 may be considered of relevant prognostic value and results will, therefore, be presented using this cut-off.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> In our study, the use of LR was transposed to express performance of reporting techniques in reflecting structural damage or patient satisfaction. Higher values are indicative of better techniques. Although an infinite positive LR generally indicates that a technique has good prognostic value, results should be interpreted with caution when the proportion of patients achieving success is low.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>In the 1-year AIM study, 433 and 219 patients were randomly assigned and treated with abatacept or placebo, respectively, on background methotrexate.

This is the first study to evaluate the performance of some of these methods in relation to outcomes deemed to reflect the perspectives of the clinical trialist, rheumatologist and patient.</p><p>From the perspective of researchers designing clinical trials to test the efficacy and safety of new compounds (eg, phase II trials), our data suggest that the &#x0201c;less stringent&#x0201d; ACR20 and MDAS criteria assessed at the end of the trial achieved the highest discriminatory capacity, allowing detection of a treatment effect using fewer patients. When onset of action and sustainability were considered, an increase was observed in the NNS required to detect a treatment effect, suggesting that when designing clinical trials, it may not be beneficial to take these aspects into account for ACR and DAS28-based criteria.</p><p>For the criteria examined in this analysis, sustainability of good disease status (LDAS) for 3 months or more during the first 6 months of the study was the only method of reporting that reflected the absence of radiographic progression at year 1 (using the positive LR cut-off of 2). Previously reported data support this finding. In a longitudinal study including patients who were followed for up to 9 years, fluctuations in disease activity (compared with sustained LDAS or high DAS) were predictive of more severe radiographic progression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> All other techniques of reporting assessed here were poor predictors of the inhibition of radiographic progression.</p><p>The methods that best reflected patient satisfaction with treatment were &#x0201c;stringent&#x0201d; reporting techniques for both response to treatment (ACR70) and status of disease (DAS28-defined remission). A faster onset (within the first 3 months) and the sustainability of a response/status of disease were important factors in the ability to reflect patient satisfaction. These results would be expected on the basis that a relatively early and sustainable improvement in terms of symptoms, pain, disability and fatigue is likely to be a primary concern for the patient in terms of treatment outcome and quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref></p><p>These findings highlight the importance of the onset and sustainability of a treatment response or disease activity status and support recent EULAR/ACR recommendations that propose that the reporting of clinical trials should include both the time to onset and the sustainability of the primary outcome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref></p><p>Interpretation of our findings should be made in the context of the study limitations. Results were obtained in an exploratory analysis of a single clinical trial evaluating a single compound (abatacept); before proposing firm recommendations, similar analyses should be conducted on data from different trials evaluating alternative compounds. Moreover, similar assessments using other criteria, such as LDAS by DAS28 (using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate) or by the simplified disease activity index or the clinical disease activity index need to be evaluated. For most of the analyses, the observed values of positive LR were not conclusive as the values were below 10 or even 5, the thresholds often used to reflect a &#x0201c;relevant&#x0201d; value for diagnostic purposes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> However, a clear, accepted definition of relevant positive LR thresholds does not exist. For example, in the case of evaluation of the risk of toxic events while taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, a positive LR value of 1.4 has been considered unacceptable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Conversely, other studies, including one evaluating the ability to predict persistent (erosive) arthritis, have demonstrated that positive LR values of more than 2 may be considered a relevant prognostic value,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> whereas more than 10 is considered a diagnostic value.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref></p><p>Finally, the relatively short duration of follow-up presented here could impact the results. Observations were limited to this time period because the number of patients achieving the more stringent criteria (eg, ACR70 or remission), or onset or sustainability at later time points, was too low to make valid comparisons. However, as most clinicians would expect to observe a treatment effect within 6 months of therapy initiation, this time frame is probably an acceptable period of assessment.</p><p>Considering these limitations, our analyses demonstrate that the optimal method of assessment can depend on the outcome of interest, and that onset and sustainability of success may be important factors to consider when assessing the efficacy of therapies for patients with RA. A potential &#x0201c;optimal&#x0201d; technique could be the life-table analyses technique, in which the event is defined by the time taken to reach an acceptable sustained status. Future studies are required to confirm and extend the findings presented here using other RA patient databases, longer study durations and similar analyses in other disease areas.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was supported in part by an unrestricted research grant-in-aid from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
