A subgroup of patients were randomized to perform a 12-week endurance training program (exercise group, <italic>n </italic>= 9) or to a non-exercising control group (<italic>n </italic>= 6). We measured maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2 </sub>max) and the associated power output during a progressive cycling test. Endurance was assessed as the cycling time to exhaustion at 65% of VO<sub>2 </sub>max. Lactate levels in the <italic>vastus lateralis </italic>muscle were measured with microdialysis. Mitochondrial function was assessed by measuring citrate synthase (CS) and &#x003b2;-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (&#x003b2;-HAD) activities in muscle biopsies. Clinical improvement was assessed according to the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) improvement criteria. All assessors were blinded to the type of intervention (that is, training or control).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Exercise performance and aerobic capacity were lower in patients than in healthy controls, whereas lactate levels at exhaustion were similar. Patients in the exercise group increased their cycling time, aerobic capacity and CS and &#x003b2;-HAD activities, whereas lactate levels at exhaustion decreased. Six of nine patients in the exercise group met the IMACS improvement criteria. Patients in the control group did not show any consistent changes during the 12-week study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Polymyositis and dermatomyositis patients have impaired endurance, which could be improved by 12 weeks of endurance training. The clinical improvement corresponds to increases in aerobic capacity and muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities. The results emphasize the importance of endurance exercise in addition to immunosuppressive treatment of patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01184625">NCT01184625</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, including polymyositis (PM) and dermatomyositis (DM), are characterized by muscle weakness and poor muscle endurance, especially in proximal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The mechanisms that lead to muscle weakness are not fully clarified but both immune-mediated and non-immune-mediated mechanisms are thought to be involved in the disease process and the latter mechanisms include endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, hypoxia, autophagy and mitochondrial pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Despite recommended treatment with high doses of glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents, few patients can regain their former muscle performance and the reason for this is not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Abnormalities in energy metabolism has been observed in inflammatory myopathies, including PM and DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Patients with established PM/DM display fewer oxidative slow-twitch type I muscle fibers and lower aerobic capacity compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thickened endothelial cells, reduced capillary blood supply and low total number of capillaries may impair oxygen transport to the muscle fibers in inflammatory myopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, up-regulation of hypoxia-related proteins, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), has been observed in muscle of patients with inflammatory myopathies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, physical exercise has not been recommended to patients with PM/DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. However, recent exercise studies in patients with established PM/DM revealed benefits and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], with a potential to prevent muscle loss due to muscle inflammation, physical inactivity and systemic glucocorticoid treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For instance, a resistance exercise program resulted in modulations of gene expression transcripts associated with inflammation (down-regulation), fibrosis (down-regulation) and aerobic metabolism (up-regulation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, available studies have limitations and it is not possible to recommend one exercise program over another, indicating a need for randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The major objective of this randomized, controlled, multicenter study was to determine whether endurance exercise can improve muscle function in patients with PM/DM in a chronically stable disease phase. We tested the following hypotheses:</p><p>1. Compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls, PM/DM patients display impaired performance during endurance exercise due to reduced aerobic capacity and muscle weakness (that is, an inability to fully activate the contractile machinery). To test this hypothesis, patients and healthy controls performed endurance exercise and we assessed performance, aerobic capacity, heart rate, muscular lactate concentration and self-reported exertion level.</p><p>2. Endurance training improves exercise performance in PM/DM patients by increasing muscle aerobic capacity. To test this hypothesis, patients were randomized into an exercise group (EG), performing a 12-week endurance training program, and a non-exercising control group (CG). Endurance exercise performance, muscular lactate concentration, aerobic capacity and mitochondrial capacity in muscle biopsies were assessed before and after the intervention period.</p><p>3. Endurance training has a general beneficial effect on the health status of PM/DM patients. The disease activity was assessed before and after the training period according to the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) improvement criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>In the first part of the study we compared patients with PM/DM with age- and gender-matched healthy controls.

Inclusion criteria: a) age &#x02265;18 years; b) exercising one time or less a week. Exclusion criteria: a) chronic musculoskeletal disorder; b) severe osteoarthritis or osteoporosis; c) severe heart or lung conditions. All participants gave informed consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the local ethics committees at Karolinska University Hospital, Sahlgrenska University Hospital and Uppsala University Hospital. The study followed the World Medical Association's 2008 Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Aerobic capacity</title><p>Ergometer cycle maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2 </sub>max) tests were performed by patients and HC at baseline and by patients after the 12-week intervention (training or control) period. Different cycling protocols were used for patients and HC because a previous study showed approximately 50% lower VO<sub>2 </sub>max in patients with PM/DM compared to HC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the patients started at 30 to 40 W and the required power output was increased with 10 W every minute, while the HC started at 50 W and the increase was 15 W every minute. The VO<sub>2 </sub>max was determined by incremental cycling to exhaustion. Pulmonary minute ventilation and gas exchange (O<sub>2 </sub>uptake and CO<sub>2 </sub>output) were measured breath by breath (Sensor Medics, V max 229&#x02122;, Yorba Linda, CA, USA). The system was calibrated for airflow and gas exchange before each test. VO<sub>2 </sub>max was defined as the highest O<sub>2 </sub>uptake rate measured during the test and is expressed as l min<sup>-1 </sup>and as ml min<sup>-1 </sup>(kg body weight)<sup>-1</sup>; the power performed (in W) at the time of VO<sub>2 </sub>max was recorded. At VO<sub>2 </sub>max, we also measured the respiratory exchange ratio (RQ) defined as the ratio between the exhaled CO<sub>2 </sub>and the inhaled O<sub>2</sub>. Electrocardiography was used to continuously follow the heart rate and the maximum heart rate was recorded. At the end of the test we recorded the self-reported ratings of peripheral exertion (lower extremity) and central exertion on the Borg RPE scale (6 to 20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cycling endurance test</title><p>Cycling endurance tests were performed by patients and HC at baseline and by patients after the 12-week intervention (training or control) period. Cycling was performed at a power requiring 65% of the VO<sub>2 </sub>max obtained in the baseline aerobic capacity test (see above) and was continued until exhaustion. The tests were supervised by the same physical therapist throughout the study. At exhaustion, self-reported peripheral and central exertions were recorded and the heart rate was measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Lactate measurements</title><p>The extracellular concentration of lactate was measured <italic>in vivo </italic>with microdialysis. Two thin catheters with a 3 cm long membrane with a diameter of 0.5 mm (CMA 63) were inserted in the <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>, 2 cm apart, under local anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A reference catheter was inserted in subcutaneous abdominal fat tissue. The microdialysis experiments were performed in patients and HC at baseline and in patients also after 12 weeks intervention (training or control) by the same two physicians, nurse and physical therapist throughout the study. The microdialysis probes were perfused with a physiological solution at a flow rate of 1 &#x003bc;l min<sup>-1</sup>. Water soluble substances in the interstitial fluid diffuse across the semipermeable dialysis membrane and enter the perfusate, which was collected in small vials. The cycling endurance test (see above) started after an 80-minute equilibration at rest, during which one vial of perfusate per catheter was collected every 20 minutes. After the endurance test, subjects rested for 60 minutes while vials with perfusate were collected every 20 minutes. Analysis of lactate concentration was made directly in a Clinical Microdialysis Analyzer (ICSUS, CMA, Solna, Sweden). Vials collected from the <italic>vastus lateralis </italic>muscle during the 20 minutes directly after cycling to exhaustion showed the highest lactate concentrations and the mean lactate concentration in vials obtained from the two catheters at this time interval was used in subsequent assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Muscle biopsies and measurements of mitochondrial enzyme activities</title><p>Muscle biopsies were taken from the <italic>vastus lateralis </italic>muscle under local anesthesia using a semi-open technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Biopsies were taken from the patients before and after the 12-week +/- endurance training. Due to technical reasons, biopsies were only taken from patients who were recruited at the Karolinska University Hospital and at the Uppsala University Hospital. We measured the activities of two mitochondrial enzymes, citrate synthase (CS) and &#x003b2;-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (&#x003b2;-HAD), which reflect the mitochondrial volume to cell volume ratio and the capacity for fatty acid &#x003b2;-oxidation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Muscle biopsies were freeze dried, dissected free of non-muscle constituents and weighed. Tissue was then homogenized with ground glass homogenizers in ice-cold buffer (HxB) consisting of 50 mM KH2PO4; 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, pH 7.5. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,400 &#x000d7; g for one minute (4&#x000b0;C). Aliquots of the supernatant were analyzed for CS and &#x003b2;-HAD with standard spectrophotometric techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Enzyme activities were assayed at room temperature (approximately 22&#x000b0;C) under conditions that yielded linearity with respect to extract volume and time (data not shown). Protein content was measured in the supernatant with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories AB, Sundbyberg, Sweden and activities were adjusted for protein content.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical outcome measures</title><p>Assessment of disease activity was performed using the proposed preliminary consensus core measures developed for PM/DM patients by IMACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The core measures include: patients and physicians global disease activity assessments recorded on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, 0 to 100); Manual Muscle Testing-8 (MMT (muscle strength), 0 to 10 in eight muscle groups); Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ (limitation in daily activities), 0 to 3); measurement of the blood serum activity of the muscle enzyme creatine phosphokinase (s-CPK, &#x003bc;cat l<sup>-1</sup>); and assessment of the degree of disease activity in six organ systems other than skeletal muscle using the myositis intention to treat activity index (MITAX, 0 to 1). We used the proposed core measures and the assessment of disease activity in the skeletal muscle system rated on VAS (0 to 100).

An independent nurse who was responsible for the randomization then contacted the exercise coach at each center to inform about group allocation. The EG performed an approximately one-hour exercise program three times a week for 12 weeks. The exercise program consisted of five-minute warm-up cycling at 50% of VO<sub>2 </sub>max, which was followed by up to 30 minutes of more intense cycling where the intensity was gradually increased during the training period aiming at 70% of VO<sub>2 </sub>max. This was followed by 20 minutes of muscular endurance exercise engaging both the upper and lower limbs at 30 to 40% of one voluntary repetition maximum. The program ended with a cool-down and stretch. At each participating center, the EG was supervised by the same physical therapist. The patients in the CG were instructed not to change their physical activity level during the 12-week intervention period, but they were invited to perform the same endurance exercise program after the intervention period.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flow diagram for patients according to the CONSORT randomized, controlled trials of non-pharmacologic treatment</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ar4263-1"/></fig><p>All patients used exercise diaries to register their physical activities during the 12-week intervention period.

We also show that 12 weeks of endurance training markedly improved endurance exercise performance in the patients and this improvement was accompanied by increased aerobic capacity. The training period also resulted in a general clinical improvement in the majority of patients.</p><p>In accordance with our first hypothesis, we show a decreased performance during endurance exercise in PM/DM patients compared to age- and gender-matched HC. The impaired performance in the patients was accompanied by a lower VO<sub>2 </sub>max and, hence, decreased aerobic capacity, which is also in agreement with our hypothesis. We also hypothesized that the patients' exercise performance would be limited by weakness and inability to adequately activate the exercising muscles. The results, however, show no difference between patients and HC in extracellular lactate levels, RQ values, experienced exertion level or percentage of maximum heart rate in the fatigued state; all these four measures would be lower if exercise ended prematurely due to improper muscle activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Nevertheless, the present cycling exercise requires relatively low muscle power output and exercises requiring a larger fraction of the available muscle force may well be limited by muscle weakness. For instance, such exercises like "walking up one flight of stairs" and "getting up from the ground/floor" have been reported as difficult to perform by patients with PM/DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, in the present study patients with PM/DM show decreased performance during cycling endurance exercise and this impairment can be explained by reduced aerobic capacity, which is in agreement with a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, we suggest that an important mechanism contributing to the reduced aerobic capacity and impaired endurance performance in the patients is a low mitochondrial capacity in muscle. Others have observed that a local inflammatory environment is associated with a mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. It is worth noting that the patients in the present study, as well as in previous studies, have been given conventional immunosuppressive treatment for at least six months, which consequently is not sufficient to regain full muscle endurance performance. In addition, long-term glucocorticoid treatment may cause mitochondrial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and atrophy in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and these deleterious effects may be aggravated when combined with low physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], which could be one explanation for persistent impaired performance in PM/DM patients after immunosuppressive treatment.</p><p>Our results show a marked improvement in endurance exercise performance in the PM/DM patients after 12 weeks endurance training, which is in agreement with our second hypothesis. This improvement could be explained by increased aerobic capacity after the training period as judged from a lower lactate level and an unchanged relative maximum heart rate in the fatigued state despite a longer cycling time; increased VO<sub>2 </sub>max and power output at VO<sub>2 </sub>max; and increased activity of the two mitochondrial enzymes CS and &#x003b2;-HAD. These findings of increased mitochondrial capacity by endurance training in patients with PM/DM are in accordance with previous studies showing improved aerobic capacity and up-regulated transcription of genes for proteins involved in aerobic metabolism in PM/DM patients exposed to a period of physical exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It is worth noting that all patients exposed to the training program improved their exercise performance, that is, also patients with initially severely decreased muscle function and endurance capacity. Thus, endurance training is effective in PM/DM patients even when they are in a chronic stable disease phase with severe muscle dysfunction. It would be of great value to know if endurance training is beneficial also in an acute disease phase, but this is outside the scope of the present study.</p><p>In the present study, we measured extracellular lactate concentration in muscle after an individually determined cycling endurance test; that is, subjects cycled until exhaustion at a power requiring 65% of their VO<sub>2 </sub>max at baseline. The lactate concentration and, hence, the extent of anaerobic metabolism required, was similar in PM/DM patients and healthy controls at exhaustion, despite the fact that healthy controls cycled for longer times and at higher power outputs (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). A markedly different picture would emerge if we instead would have used a fixed endurance test, that is, the same absolute power output and duration in both groups. The power output and duration tolerated by the PM/DM patients would then be rather mild for the healthy controls and markedly higher lactate levels would be expected in patients at the end of the test. In line with these assumptions, a recent case study showed markedly higher lactate levels after a fixed endurance test in a PM patient than in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, after five weeks of endurance training, the PM patient had a lower lactate concentration at the end of the endurance test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which is in good agreement with our present results (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>In accordance with our third hypothesis, a majority (six out of nine) of the patients exposed to the training program improved concerning disease activity according to IMACS improvement criteria. In a previous seven-week resistance exercise study, two out of seven patients improved according to the same criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. These results indicate that endurance exercise, longer exercise duration, or a combination of both might be more beneficial than resistance exercise for PM/DM patients in a stable chronic disease phase.</p><p>One limitation in this study is that the median age of the HC group was seven years lower than the patients, which might exaggerate the differences between the two groups. However, it should be noted that there was no statistical difference in age between the two groups and they had a similar level of physical exercise. Another potential limitation is the relatively low number of patients in the EG and the CG. Since the patients included in this study were in a stable disease phase, no consistent changes during 12 weeks was expected in the CG and this is also what our results show. A power analysis showed that for physiological assessments we needed measurements from at least six subjects before and after the endurance exercise period. Nine patients were included in the EG, but all measurements were not successfully performed both before and after training in each subject. This limitation resulted in measurements of mitochondrial enzyme activities being clearly underpowered with only three patients in the EG. However, all three subjects showed clear increases in both CS and &#x003b2;-HAD activities after the training period (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), which from a physiological perspective fits with the concomitant increases in aerobic capacity and cycling performance (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Finally, it would have been of interest to quantify a potential relationship between reduced disease activity and increased exercise performance in the EG after the training period. Unfortunately, the IMACS six-item core set does not consist of one total score and is, therefore, not suitable for quantifying relationships. However, we could demonstrate that all patients in the EG with reduced disease activity also improved in exercise performance (&#x02265;20 % increased cycling time).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, PM/DM patients show impaired endurance performance during cycling exercise due to reduced aerobic capacity. After 12 weeks of endurance training, PM/DM patients increased their mitochondrial enzyme activities in muscle, increased aerobic capacity, decreased disease activity and markedly improved exercise performance. These results emphasize that in order to improve muscle performance, PM/DM patients should be prescribed physical endurance exercise in combination with the recommended immunosuppressive treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>&#x003b2;-HAD: &#x003b2;-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase; CG: control group; CS: citrate synthase; DM: dermatomyositis; EG: exercise group; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; HAQ: Health Assessment Questionnaire; HC: healthy controls; HIF-1: hypoxia-inducible factor-1; IMACS: International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group; MDI: myositis disease damage index; MITAX: myositis intention to treat activity index; MMT: Manual Muscle Testing; PM: Polymyositis; s-CPK: the blood serum activity of the muscle enzyme creatine phosphokinase; VAS: Visual Analogue Scale; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor; VO<sub>2 </sub>max: maximal oxygen uptake</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LAM coordinated the study, participated in the study design, performed intervention and microdialysis experiments, analyzed clinical and experimental data, and drafted the manuscript.
