Zinc interacts with important hormones involved in bone growth and its concentration in bone matrix is very high compared with that in other tissues.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Childhood zinc deficiency remains a common problem in much of the developing world.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] About 50 years ago, a clinical syndrome characterized by dwarfism, hypogonadism and anemia was first attributed to zinc deficiency in Iranian boys.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] More recently, a national survey of micro-nutrient status in Iran revealed that based on serum zinc concentration, prevalence of zinc deficiency among children 15-23 months of age ranged from 6.3% to 70.2% with a mean of 19.4% across the country.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The same study also reported zinc deficiency among 31% of 6-year-old children, 28.0% of adolescents and 39% of pregnant women of gestational age 5 months and above.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The Iranian national food consumption and dietary intake data suggests that many Iranian children might be at risk of zinc deficiency beyond early infancy.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The major sources of zinc are animal products, which are consumed in low or very low amounts by people in many parts of Iran. Moreover, phytic acid in plant sources forms an insoluble zinc chelate, which markedly reduces zinc bioavailability from food.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Consequences of zinc deficiency other than growth failure include poor appetite, skin lesions and delayed wound healing, immunosuppression and increased rates of infections.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Fortification of staple foods with zinc has been suggested to improve the zinc status in adults.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, zinc intake by means of food might not be sufficient to cover the increased need of growing children. Zinc-responsive stunting has been identified in many parts of the world and several studies have found that malnourished children gain weight more rapidly during the nutritional rehabilitation when they are supplemented with zinc.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] On the other hand, studies from some developing countries have failed to identify a growth response to zinc supplementation,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] so the importance of zinc supplementation as a means to improve linear growth in at risk children remains controversial. Because of the widespread occurrence of zinc deficiency in Iran and the important functional and growth consequences that have been reported in association with it and since there exists not much international experience and no local evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of a zinc supplementation program, we carried out this pilot community trial to investigate the effect of supplemental zinc on linear growth of children 6-24 months of age in a disadvantaged setting and through primary health care (PHC) system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>The study was carried out from August to November 2009 in rural areas of districts of Damavand and Varamin at the Northeast and South of Tehran, respectively. These areas were reported to have the highest rates of malnutrition among children under five.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Diet in this area contains little animal protein and low amounts of zinc with high bioavailability, which places the children at higher risk of zinc deficiency.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Both rural and urban areas in Iran are under the coverage of health houses (HH). HH is the first point of contact in service delivery within the health system for preventive public health measures, medical assistance and routine check-ups, which covers an average population of 1200-1600 and is staffed by one or two trained community health workers named Behvarz. Behvarz is a young man or woman with high school education who is specifically trained to deliver maternal and child care, family planning and environmental/occupational health care. HHs are supervised by physicians who are based in the health centers and manage any emergency or complicated case of illness. In rural areas, every HH covers one main village and one or more satellite villages.</p><p>Particularly in rural areas, the system for service delivery within the PHC is active. All children 6-24 months of age receive iron (2 mg/kg body weight elemental iron in the form of ferrous sulfate) and vitamin A and D (or multivitamin) supplements from 15<sup>th</sup> day of life free of charge. Growth monitoring in terms of weight and height measurements in accordance with Well-Baby Integrated Program is in place and Behvarzes are actively involved in the early treatment of acute respiratory infections and control of diarrheal diseases.</p><p>Our study population consisted of children 6-24 months of age who lived in the households covered by HHs in the rural areas of Damavand and Varamin districts.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sampling and recruitment</title><p>A multistage randomized sampling deign was used, with HHs as the unit of randomization and children 6-24 months of age as the unit of analysis. According to the health records and family logbooks, there were 815 and 2073 children under 2 years of age covered by rural HHs in Damavand and Varamin districts, respectively. At the first stage, seventeen HHs with a total of 837 children under coverage from both districts were randomly selected for the study. HHs were then randomly allocated to intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and control (<italic>n</italic> = 9) arms within both districts. This type of randomization ensured the similarity of participants in both arms in terms of climate, socio-economic status, and access to health services. The study protocol was approved by the office of the World Health Organization in Tehran and by the Nutrition Department of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.</p><p>With a 95% confidence interval (CI) (<italic>z</italic> = 1.96) to observe a difference of 0.6 cm in height increment within the intervention group compared to control group, with a type two error &#x003b2;=0.10 and assuming the same population standard deviation of <italic>s</italic> = 2.6 cm for intervention and control groups,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] a sample of 400 children per group was needed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Intervention</title><p>Behvarzes could not be blinded to the intervention because of the required training. Behvarzes running the HHs in the intervention group received 1-day training on the study rational and procedures. Mothers in the intervention villages were then invited to attend the HHs and asked by Behvarzes to participate in the study. To minimize potential bias, mothers were informed about the aim of this study, but not about the intervention or control groups. Verbal informed consent was obtained from the parents of eligible children during their visit to the HH.</p><p>Behvarzes were instructed to provide each infant in the intervention group with three 60-ml screw threaded vials containing sweet-tasting syrup of 5 mg zinc (22 mg zinc sulfate, 7H<sub>2</sub>O and 1 mg sodium saccharin) per 5 mL for a 1-month period. Mothers were asked to collect the supplements on a monthly basis from the HH and to give a single dose of 5 mL/day of the syrup to their child, preferably after a meal. Behvarzes replaced the vials at each visit and monitored the intake by parent recall and recorded the compliance with supplementation as well as symptoms of illness. Mothers were also interviewed on the perceived side-effects of zinc supplement including abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation and increased crying or fussiness.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data collection</title><p>Anthropometric measurements were performed at baseline and followed-up on a monthly basis during the study period by Behvarzes in both intervention and control groups. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.02 kg with the use of a digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Recumbent length was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with the use of a locally produced wooden measurement board.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using the SPSS for Windows statistical package (version 12; SPSS Inc., Chicago) and organized as means &#x000b1; standard deviation for all children in one group. Mean values were compared within and between groups. General linear model and repeated measures&#x02019; analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed to examine the effect of zinc supplementation on height increment and the difference between intervention and control groups.

Moreover, the pattern of observed growth velocity in these trials could be negatively affected by the presence of infectious and parasitic diseases.</p><p>Past research also indicates that a number of micronutrients in addition to zinc are implicated in linear growth and supplementation with zinc plus other micronutrients can have a greater effect in increasing the growth velocity of children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has been shown that mild to moderate zinc deficiency in otherwise normal infants and children can contribute to low growth percentiles, which is correctable by the provision of supplemental zinc.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Given that children in the current study did receive iron and vitamin A and D or multivitamin supplements as part of the routine care within the PHC system, their nutritional status was supposedly better than that of children in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This might, at least to some extent, explain the greater effect of zinc supplementation on linear growth of our children compared with these studies. It should be noted that in some studies that reported no significant effect of zinc supplementation on linear growth, the findings however demonstrate a positive effect of supplementation that could become significant in case the sample size would have been greater.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Our findings are supported by the fact that the study used a community trial design with a concurrent control group and confirmation that the supplements were successfully delivered to the participants in the intervention group, with a compliance rate, which was found to be literally perfect. Furthermore, the period of supplementation lasted 12 weeks to ensure the detection of any linear growth response, since literature indicates that periods of supplementation less than 8 weeks may be insufficient in this regard.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The dropout rate of participants, which was relatively small, does not seem to be a source of attrition bias, since the main reason for drop out in both groups was migration and being locally unavailable for monthly measurements, which is a common phenomenon in disadvantaged rural settings.</p><p>The main methodological shortcoming of the current study is the lack of placebo use in the control group, which was primarily due to the technical problems associated with the provision of placebo syrups and also barriers to the logistics for a field trial in a disadvantaged setting. However, except for zinc supplements, children in the control group received exactly the same care in terms of monthly anthropometric measurements and iron and vitamins A and D or multivitamin supplements within the health care system and by Behvarzes.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with previous research, which reported limited effect of zinc supplementation on different indices of weight[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] possibly indicating that supplemental zinc is more likely to influence bone and therefore linear growth than accumulation of muscle or fat mass.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This can be explained by the fact that zinc is abundant in bone tissue and is needed to maintain bone mineral density and bone metabolism.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The organic matrix of bone is comprised of proteins that require adequate amounts of zinc for optimal function.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Zinc also acts as a cofactor for osteoblast activity during bone formation and is required for maintaining peak bone density.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Evidence demonstrates that zinc may act as a local regulator of bone cell formation by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts while at the same time inhibiting osteoclast differentiation.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The effect of zinc supplementation on height achievement in the current study does have important implications for practice within the health care system. National data on food consumption patterns suggest that suboptimal zinc intake is prevalent in many parts of Iran and the problem does not seem to be limited to any one socioeconomic or ethnic group.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Our findings suggest that zinc supplementation at the community level and as an integrated part of services provided through PHC can have a remarkable effect on the linear growth of children. However, although zinc supplements are easy to administer, daily supplementation requires commitment from parents and acceptance by children. Further, parents may not link the improvement in linear growth with supplementation. To ensure high compliance, it is therefore important to work closely with the community and to brief parents prior to supplement distribution.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This study was funded by the World Health Organization (APW/09/01728: Development of Protocols to Prevent Zinc Deficiency in Children under Two)</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Salgueiro</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Zubillaga</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Lysionek</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Caro</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Weill</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Boccio</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of zinc in the growth and development of children</article-title><source>Nutrition</source><year>2002</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>510</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12044825</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Peerson</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>SY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Preventive zinc supplementation among infants, preschoolers, and older prepubertal children</article-title><source>Food Nutr Bull</source><year>2009</year><volume>30</volume><fpage>S12</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19472600</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Halsted</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ronaghy</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Abadi</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Haghshenass</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Amirhakemi</surname><given-names>GH</given-names></name><name><surname>Barakat</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Zinc deficiency in man.
