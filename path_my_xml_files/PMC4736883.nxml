regimen concomitantly employing temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy and radiotherapy (RT) 4 weeks after surgery, followed by 6 cycles of TMZ is a common treatment for glioblastoma (GBM). However, its median overall survival (OS) is only 14.6 months. This study was to explore the effectiveness and safety of early TMZ chemotherapy between surgery and chemoradiotherapy plus the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A randomized, parallel group, open-label study of 99 newly diagnosed GBM patients was conducted at 10 independent Chinese neurosurgical departments from June 2008 to June 2012. Patients were treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical temozolomide (early TMZ group) or standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group). Overall response was assessed based on objective tumor assessments, administration of corticosteroid and neurological status test. Hematological, biochemical, laboratory, adverse event (AE), and neurological condition were measured for 24 months of follow-up. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study was overall survival (OS). The secondary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The median OS time in the early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared with 13.2 months in the control group (log-rank test <italic>P</italic> = 0.021). In addition, the OS rate in the early TMZ group was higher at 6, 12, and 18 months than in the control group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The median PFS time was 8.7 months in the early TMZ group and 10.4 months in the control group (log-rank test <italic>P</italic> = 0.695). AEs occurred in 29 (55.8%) and 31(73.8%) patients respectively in early and control groups, including nausea (15.4% vs. 33.3%), vomiting (7.7% vs. 28.6%), fever (7.7% vs. 11.9%), and headache (3.8% vs. 23.8%). Only 30.8% and 33.3% were drug-related, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Addition of TMZ chemotherapy in the early break of the standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and significantly improved the OS of the GBM patients, compared with standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen. However, a larger randomized trial is warranted to verify these results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chemoradiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>Glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>Malignant Glioma</kwd><kwd>Temozolomide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal form of malignant glioma. It accounts for the majority of gliomas, while astrocytoma and GBM account for about 75% of all gliomas.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Despite the increasing prevalence of GBM, only a few clinical strategies for treatment optimization have been developed due to presumed poor prognosis, comorbidities, poor physiological responses, and increased risk.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, there is an urgent need for novel treatment options to improve the survival for GBM patients.</p><p>Before the regimen proposed by Stupp <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (concomitant radiochemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy), there were no prospective controlled randomized, phase 3 clinical trials demonstrating a significant survival benefit with single-agent or multi-agent chemotherapy for GBM.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Stupp <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] demonstrated that adding temozolomide (TMZ), a clinically approved cytotoxic alkylating agent, to radiotherapy (RT) regimens in newly-diagnosed GBM patients resulted in a clinically meaningful and statistically significant survival benefit with only a minimal increase in toxicity. Stupp <italic>et al</italic>. recommended daily TMZ (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) administration from the first to last day of RT treatment (2 Gy given 5 days/week for 6 weeks, totaling 60 Gy). Thereafter, 6 cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150&#x02013;200 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) should be administered for 5 days during each 28-day cycle. In practice, however, treatment strategies remain highly variable in clinical settings,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] though several large clinical trials are currently being conducted with the aim of optimizing treatment of GBM.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Although the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen treatment employing TMZ along with conventional RT is a well-accepted strategy for improving survival in GBM patients, the median survival improved by this regimen (from 12.1 months with RT alone to 14.6 months with RT plus TMZ) was not satisfactorily substantial. According to the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen, TMZ is initiated 4&#x02013;5 weeks after surgery; however, the length of this time interval between surgery and chemo-RT (CRT) lacks substantiation from researches and there may be an opportunity to achieve improved results by administering TMZ in this early period. Some researchers found that new contrast enhancement indicative tumor growth appeared in 53% of the GBM patients in the interim between surgery and CRT.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This suggests that reducing the time between surgery and adjuvant therapy may be beneficial for GBM patients. The early use of TMZ aims to minimize or eliminate malignant growth during the immediate period following surgery. Thus, the current study examined patients treated with the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen with the addition of early TMZ chemotherapy to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this modified regimen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>A prospective randomized, parallel group, open-label study of newly-diagnosed GBM patients in 10 independent Neurosurgical Departments across China was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen plus early postsurgical TMZ chemotherapy (early TMZ group) with standard postsurgical concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen (control group) between June 2008 and June 2012.

However, this protocol has been modified to optimize treatment and improve outcome. In the present study, median OS of early TMZ group was 17.6 months, compared to 13.2 months in the control group. These data suggest that employing additional administrations of TMZ during the immediate 3&#x02013;4-week period following surgery may further improve the survival of GBM patients.</p><p>A systematic review of 6 recent randomly controlled trials demonstrated that postoperative radiation therapy was effective for management of GBM following surgery (pooled risk ratio, 0.81; 95% <italic>CI</italic>, 0.74&#x02013;0.88; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.00001).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Furthermore, treatment with 60 Gy, as applied in the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen in the current study, has been demonstrated to be the optimal RT dose in multiple-modality therapies, with doses &#x0003e;60 Gy and confocal RT showing no further benefits.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Thus, the RT dosage used in the current study was optimal, as demonstrated by these previous studies.</p><p>The 5 years analysis of EORTC-NCIC 26981 trial demonstrated the benefit of adjuvant TMZ with RT lasted throughout 5 years of follow-up. OS was 27.2% at 2 years and median OS was 14.6 months with TMZ in the combined-treatment group, versus 4.4% at 2 years and median OS of 12.1 months with RT alone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Comparatively, the current modified approach employing early TMZ plus standard concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen produced an OS of 17.6 months and a survival rate of 24.0% at the 24-month follow-up. These results demonstrate that survival rate is similar and OS may be increased by early application of TMZ. Some patients underwent only biopsy and partial resection in EORTC 26981 trial.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, the extent of surgical resection in our inclusion criteria is &#x0003e;70%. Hence, the rate of complete resection in our study is higher than EORTC 26981, which may contribute to the longer survival of patients in our study. There are several possible benefits for early application of TMZ in addition to concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen. First, despite surgery, infiltrating cancer cells that reside away from the main tumor mass are thought to be responsible for tumor recurrence, as well as radiation and chemotherapy resistance.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Pirzkall <italic>et al</italic>. examined the imaging of 32 patients with newly-diagnosed GBM who underwent MR examinations prior to surgery, after surgery, and prior to RT/TMZ CRT.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] They found that new contrast enhancement indicative of tumor growth was appeared in 17 patients (53%) in the interim between surgery and CRT. This suggested that reducing the time between surgery and adjuvant therapy may be important, and early application of TMZ can be a way to address this problem. Second, there were studies providing supporting evidences for the existence of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) with regenerating capacity in GBM.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] On the other hand, data of some studies suggested that TMZ chemotherapeutic protocols might substantially improve the elimination of CSCs.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Thus, early TMZ administration may reduce the regenerating capacity of CSCs and improve the survival of patients. Third, continuous application of TMZ depletes <italic>MGMT</italic>,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which is an enzyme necessary to repair damage to DNA caused by TMZ.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The continuous administration of TMZ (75 mg&#x00387;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x00387;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen is 6 weeks, and such administration in current regimen is 8 weeks. Hence, more MGMT might be depleted and the efficacy of TMZ may be enhanced.</p><p>Recently, a number of specialized early postsurgical treatments for GBM patients have become available, including surgical medication implants, such as Gliadel&#x000ae; wafers which release carmustine slowly over a period of 2&#x02013;4 weeks after placement.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Like the strategy employed in the current study, these drugs aim to minimize or eliminate malignant growth during the immediate period following surgery in order to improve GBM patient survival. A recent study, however, reported that over one third of patients eligible for such contemporary treatments, including wafer placement during surgical debulking of GBM tumors, were not treated due to surgeon preference, expense, or unavailability of the medication at the time of surgery.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Because TMZ is regularly available in most oncological clinics, it is highly likely that this early treatment is simple and practical. While further research will be required to compare the efficacy and safety of early postsurgical TMZ treatment plus concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen with other, more modern, early postsurgical treatment strategies, considering the current findings that this strategy could improve patient outcomes with minimal additional risk.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, a statistical difference was only found in OS rate, but not in PFS rate, between two treatment groups. The statistical difference in OS was hypothesis generating for primary endpoint and this finding warrants further investigations by a comparative randomized controlled trial design in Chinese diseased population. Second, accurate measurement of PFS was hard because there were no diagnostic criteria for disease progression or recurrence, and differentiating of disease progression/recurrence, pseudo-progression, and RT effects are difficult. While accurate OS can be measured easily because it was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death or last follow-up in both treatment arms. This may explain why OS was significantly longer in the early TMZ group, while PFS did not differ significantly between the groups. Furthermore, the entire study group was Chinese, and it is possible that some differences may exist between various populations in response to this treatment. Additionally, the <italic>MGMT</italic> expression in this study was only tested by IHC, which could not indicate the <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status, thus the correlation between <italic>MGMT</italic> promoter methylation status and this modified early TMZ regimen needs to be further investigated. There is a growing concern about the potential drug-related effects of TMZ chemotherapies.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Among alkylating drugs used in chemotherapy, the occurrence of the AE aplastic anemia appears unique to TMZ treatments and can even occur following short exposure, warranting disclosure to patients in many modern clinical settings.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In addition, TMZ may increase the risk of alkylator-induced acute myeloid leukemia. In a recent analysis of 5127 reports on 3490 patients, 76 aplastic anemia and aplasia cases, as well as 17 leukemia cases were identified to be possible drug-related following TMZ therapy.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Thus, further studies using larger cohorts will be required to fully assess the risk of alkylator-induced acute myeloid leukemia and aplastic anemia associated with prolongation of TMZ treatments for GBM.</p><p>In conclusion, cumulatively, these preliminary findings indicate that addition of 2 weeks TMZ treatments starting from 14<sup>th</sup> day after surgery to the concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen can improve OS in GBM patients. Compared to concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen alone, similar AE and SAE occurrences were observed, and no differences in physical, clinical, or biochemical parameters were observed between the two treatment groups. Further study, however, will be required to fully assess the safety profile of prolongation of TMZ chemotherapy in consideration of very rare SAEs, such as aplastic anemia and alkylator-induced acute myeloid leukemia that have been suggested to be associated with TMZ exposure. Due to the wide availability of TMZ, this modified concomitant radiochemotherapy regimen may allow notable improvements in OS for GBM patient with minimal additional risks and expense.</p><sec
