The prevalence of IBD in elderly patients is high, with 10&#x02013;30% of the global IBD population over the age of 60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and natural history of IBD are heterogeneous with respect to age of onset, and thus treatment should be individualized, including considerations for age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, safe and effective therapeutic options for aging IBD patients are limited and treatment is challenging, confounded by age-related comorbidities, immunodeficiency, and overall elevated rates of polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, the incidence of treatment-related adverse events and overall rates of mortality and morbidity are higher in older IBD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The therapeutic management of IBD in aging populations is an active area of research, and numerous studies have demonstrated marked deficiencies and risks associated with the use of several IBD treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For example, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapies, corticosteroids, and thiopurines&#x02014;as individual treatment regimens or in combination&#x02014;are associated with higher risks of malignancy and opportunistic infections in elderly IBD patients than their younger counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Increased infection rates with anti-TNF therapy in elderly IBD patients have, in turn, been proposed as an underlying reason for high rates of IBD treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and increased risk of mortality related to hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Further, long-term, high-frequency, or elevated-dose use of corticosteroids&#x02014;common in the elderly population&#x02014;may exacerbate several cardiometabolic and cognitive conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Oral corticosteroid therapy in elderly patients is also linked to diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which confers a nearly twofold increased risk of infections such as sepsis, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections in patients treated with immunosuppressants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Rates of non-melanoma skin cancer and risk of lymphoma associated with thiopurine use were found to increase with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or with successive years of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], making long-term use undesirable.</p><p>Vedolizumab is a novel humanized immunoglobulin G<sub>1</sub> monoclonal antibody to &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>7</sub> integrin that selectively inhibits inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract without inhibiting systemic immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This gut-selective mechanism of action may be particularly relevant to aging populations because of their elevated risk of systemic infections and malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The safety and efficacy of vedolizumab for moderately to severely active UC and CD were demonstrated in the phase 3 GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, aside from an analysis of the role of age as a risk factor for infection for vedolizumab-treated patients with UC or CD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], limited data exist on the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in older populations in part because few patients over the age of 65&#x000a0;years enrolled in the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies. In this paper we use available study data to report post hoc analyses of the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in patients grouped by age. In an effort to include meaningful numbers of patients in each age stratum, we divided the population as follows: aged &#x0003c;35, 35 to &#x0003c;55, and &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years. Recognizing that the elderly population typically refers to those aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, we provide safety and efficacy data for GEMINI patients in this age group as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>These results are based on post hoc subgroup analyses of data from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT00783718 and NCT00783692, respectively) which enrolled patients aged 18&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years with moderately to severely active UC or CD, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

Patients received double-blind vedolizumab or placebo [cohort 1; induction intent-to-treat (ITT) population] or open-label vedolizumab (cohort 2) during the induction phase (Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients from either cohort who demonstrated clinical response to vedolizumab at week 6 received vedolizumab every 8&#x000a0;weeks or every 4&#x000a0;weeks or placebo up to week 52 beginning at week 6 (maintenance ITT population) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients who did not have clinical response at week 6 with vedolizumab induction therapy and patients who had received placebo could continue with vedolizumab every 4&#x000a0;weeks or placebo, respectively, for the remainder of the study (Supplementary Fig. S1). Patients receiving stable doses of corticosteroids at study baseline were permitted to continue treatment, but had to begin a defined steroid tapering regimen once response to vedolizumab was achieved. At centers outside the USA, patients were permitted to continue stable doses of immunosuppressants throughout the study. However, in the USA, patients were required to discontinue immunosuppressant use after the induction phase. Patients who completed or withdrew early from GEMINI 1 or GEMINI 2 during the maintenance phase were eligible to enroll in the open-label extension trial, GEMINI Long-term Safety (LTS; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00790933). All patients received open-label vedolizumab every 4&#x000a0;weeks during GEMINI LTS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Efficacy Analyses</title><p>The primary and secondary efficacy endpoints from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies were evaluated post hoc in patients according to their age at baseline and compared descriptively.</p><p>The primary endpoint for the GEMINI 1 induction phase was clinical response [reduction in the complete Mayo Clinic score of &#x02265;3 points and &#x02265;30% from baseline (week 0) with an accompanying decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &#x02265;1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of &#x02264;1 point] at week 6. Secondary endpoints were clinical remission (complete Mayo Clinic score of &#x02264;2 and no subscore of &#x0003e;1) and mucosal healing (Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore of 0 or 1) at week 6. The primary endpoint for the GEMINI 1 maintenance phase was clinical remission at week 52. Secondary endpoints at week 52 were durable clinical response (clinical response at both weeks 6 and 52), durable clinical remission (clinical remission at both weeks 6 and 52), mucosal healing, and corticosteroid-free remission (clinical remission without corticosteroid therapy in patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The primary endpoints for the GEMINI 2 induction phase were clinical remission (CD Activity Index (CDAI) score of &#x02264;150 points) and enhanced clinical response (&#x02265;100-point decrease in the CDAI score from baseline) at week 6. The secondary endpoint at week 6 was the mean change in C-reactive protein (CRP) levels from baseline. The primary endpoint for the GEMINI 2 maintenance phase was clinical remission at week 52, and the secondary endpoints at week 52 were enhanced clinical response, corticosteroid-free remission (clinical remission without corticosteroid therapy in patients receiving corticosteroids at baseline), and durable clinical remission (clinical remission at &#x02265;80% of study visits, including the final visit) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>For each binary endpoint, the absolute differences in percentages of patients meeting the endpoint with vedolizumab and placebo were calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). For the continuous efficacy endpoint (i.e., CRP levels), the mean change from baseline was calculated for each treatment group using the last observation carried forward method and reported with its standard deviation. For the week 52 efficacy endpoints, the maintenance ITT vedolizumab every 8&#x000a0;week and every 4&#x000a0;week groups were combined in each study to increase the patient population of each subgroup.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety Analyses</title><p>Safety data were collected from week 0 through week 52 for all patients who received vedolizumab at any time during the study and all patients who received placebo only, and data from both studies were pooled. Adverse events were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), version 14.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Patients were monitored for infusion-related reactions during and after the infusion and were also instructed to alert investigators of the development of such reactions, including rash, hives, and pruritus. Adverse events that were considered to be infusion-related by the investigator were recorded. In addition, malignancies, deaths, and treatment-emergent adverse events leading to hospitalizations were reported. Of note, all safety results were based on a post hoc subgroup analysis of data from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, neither of which was powered for safety analyses. Therefore, descriptive statistics were used to compare incidences of adverse events between the different groups and no statistical conclusions were made. Adverse events were presented as the number of patients with the event and as exposure-adjusted incidence rates, defined as the number of patients experiencing the event per 100&#x000a0;person&#x02013;years (PY) of exposure. Exposure was calculated separately for each adverse event as the date of onset minus the date of first dose plus 1. PY of exposure were calculated for the first occurrence of each adverse event, and truncated after a patient experienced the adverse event. However, the patient could continue to contribute PY for different adverse events. Thus, the total PY of exposure for each adverse event could differ.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical Considerations</title><p>The study protocol and the informed consent documentation were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board(s) or independent ethics committee(s) at each investigational center. The study was conducted in compliance with the protocol, good clinical practice, and the applicable regulatory requirements (including International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines), and in accordance with ethical principles founded in the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964, as revised in 2013.

</p><p>The rates of adverse events were generally similar across all age groups. Rates of any adverse events per 100&#x000a0;PY were 337.8, 364.6, and 343.8 in vedolizumab-treated patients aged &#x0003c;35, 35 to &#x0003c;55, and &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, respectively, versus 482.6, 323.6, and 394.3 in patients who received placebo (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Infusion-related reactions were uncommon and occurred at similar rates throughout the age and treatment groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Psoriasis&#x02014;an adverse event observed with anti-TNF therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]&#x02014;in particular, was reported in &#x0003c;2 patients per 100&#x000a0;PY in any treatment group, irrespective of patient age. Memory impairment, when captured as an adverse event verbatim, was reported for 7 (1.4 per 100&#x000a0;PY), 8 (1.8 per 100&#x000a0;PY), and 4 (3.6 per 100&#x000a0;PY) vedolizumab-treated patients aged &#x0003c;35, 35 to &#x0003c;55, and &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, respectively, versus 0, 1 (1.2 per 100&#x000a0;PY), and 1 (4.3 per 100&#x000a0;PY) patients who received placebo.</p><p>In general, rates of infections were similar across all age groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). No patient &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years of age in either the vedolizumab- or placebo-exposed group had a clostridia infection versus &#x0003c;0.7 per 100&#x000a0;PY in any combined vedolizumab-treated population aged &#x0003c;35 or 35 to &#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years. The incidence of pneumonia was &#x02264;1.4 per 100&#x000a0;PY in vedolizumab-treated patients in any age group. There were no reports of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.</p><p>No increase in the occurrence of diabetes was apparent with age or with vedolizumab compared with placebo. Type 2 diabetes mellitus was reported with vedolizumab treatment in one patient &#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years old (0.2 per 100&#x000a0;PY) and one patient &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years old (0.9 per 100&#x000a0;PY). Blood glucose increased in &#x0003c;0.7 patients per 100&#x000a0;PY in all vedolizumab-exposed age groups and &#x0003c;1.2 in all placebo-exposed age groups analyzed. In addition, no meaningful differences were observed in the percentage of patients with adverse hematological events, in general, between vedolizumab and placebo treatment in any age group (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S5).</p><p>Similarly, the occurrence of serious adverse events, including serious infections, was generally consistent across all age groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, the incidence of serious adverse events in vedolizumab-treated patients was lowest in patients aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, with serious events reported in 17 patients aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years (15.9 per 100&#x000a0;PY) versus 149 (32.1 per PY) and 110 (27.5 per PY) patients aged &#x0003c;35 and 35 to &#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years, respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Compared with younger vedolizumab-treated patients, those receiving vedolizumab in the &#x02265;55-year-old age group had the lowest incidence of adverse events leading to hospitalizations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The most common adverse events that led to hospitalization in vedolizumab-treated patients aged &#x0003c;35, 35 to &#x0003c;55, and &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years were exacerbation of UC (3%, 4%, and 1% of patients, respectively) and CD (10%, 4%, and 3% of patients, respectively). No other individual adverse event led to hospitalization in &#x0003e;2% of vedolizumab-treated patients in any age group.</p><p>Malignancies were reported in two vedolizumab-treated patients aged &#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years (0.4 per 100 PY), two vedolizumab-treated patients aged 35 to &#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years (0.5 per 100 PY), and one patient who received placebo aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years (4.3 per 100 PY) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). There were two additional malignancies reported in the maintenance ITT placebo population (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), a group not represented in the safety population in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Overall, there was no apparent relationship to age in the number or type of malignancy reported. All patients with malignancy had risk factors that may have contributed to the etiology, including prior therapy with immunosuppressives, smoking history, and/or history of a prior cancer or related medical condition. Of the two patients aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, one had received only placebo before being diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the nose, which was resolved following excision. The second patient, a 73-year-old male with colon cancer, had a 14-year history of UC limited to the rectum and sigmoid colon. Both patients had previously received azathioprine/mercaptopurine and corticosteroids (rectal and systemic).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Malignancies reported in patients with UC and CD</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Age</th><th align="left">No. of events</th><th align="left">Age/sex</th><th align="left">Indication</th><th align="left">Neoplasm</th><th align="left">Treatment group (induction/maintenance)</th><th align="left">No. of VDZ doses</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="2">&#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years</td><td align="left" rowspan="2">2</td><td align="left">20.7/F</td><td align="left">CD</td><td align="left">Carcinoid tumor of the appendix</td><td align="left">VDZ/VDZ (Q4&#x000a0;W)</td><td align="left">14</td></tr><tr><td align="left">32.7/M</td><td align="left">UC</td><td align="left">Colon cancer</td><td align="left">VDZ/VDZ (Q8&#x000a0;W)</td><td align="left">7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="3">35 to &#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years</td><td align="left" rowspan="3">3</td><td align="left">40.5/M</td><td align="left">UC</td><td align="left">Transitional cell carcinoma</td><td align="left">VDZ/PBO</td><td align="left">2<sup>a</sup>

</p><p>Six deaths occurred during the studies: three vedolizumab-treated CD patients aged &#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years, one vedolizumab-treated CD patient aged 46&#x000a0;years, and two patients &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years old, one of whom, a 75-year-old CD patient, had received only placebo (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;S6). A 66-year-old male UC patient died of reported acute cardiac death 14&#x000a0;days after his first induction dose of open-label vedolizumab. His medical record included a 2-year history of chronic ischemic heart disease, and the postmortem examination showed diffuse multifocal cardiosclerosis. Detailed accounts of all deaths have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The post hoc analyses we report descriptively show that the efficacy of vedolizumab induction and maintenance therapy for UC and CD is generally similar between patients aged &#x0003c;35, 35 to &#x0003c;55, and &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, and no age-related differences were observed in the adverse event profile. As would be expected, disease duration was longer in the older GEMINI patients; however, an increase in disease severity was not observed with longer disease duration, as evidenced by baseline disease activity scores. Thus, the consistent efficacy and safety observed with increasing age were not confounded by variations in disease severity. These data are promising and especially relevant because of the rapidly rising global population of patients over the age of 60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, both studies enrolled small numbers of patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age and therefore further studies of the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in the elderly population are needed.</p><p>There are currently no formal guidelines for the treatment of IBD in elderly populations, leaving substantial gaps in the treatment paradigm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Elderly patients are underrepresented in clinical trials, and the sparse data that are available for this population indicate that managing elderly patients with IBD is complex and disparate from IBD management in younger patients. Factors that contribute to the complexity include the potential for a smaller response to treatment, altered clinical course of IBD, and increased risk of malignancies and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Clinical trials often exclude the elderly population either explicitly or implicitly through exclusion criteria and intensity of study-related visits. As a result, older patients are not well represented in phase 3 clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Indeed, the median patient age in most IBD studies is generally around the thirties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Similarly, neither GEMINI 1 nor GEMINI 2 was designed to investigate these subgroups specifically. Thus, these post hoc analyses are limited by small sample size and are not adequately powered to detect statistically significant differences. However, the efficacy of vedolizumab in UC and CD patients relative to placebo was overall consistent across all endpoints, irrespective of the patient&#x02019;s age group. Further, experience with anti-TNF therapy has shown an inverse relationship between disease duration and clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], suggesting that efficacy may decline as patients age. In the vedolizumab GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, patients aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years had longer disease duration than their younger counterparts but experienced similar clinical benefits, although some variability between subgroups was observed. For example, no difference was observed between vedolizumab and placebo treatment in the percentages of CD patients with corticosteroid-free remission at week 52 among those aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years. However, this observation in CD could be attributed to the small patient population with corticosteroid use at baseline in this age group (seven patients in each treatment group). Indeed, wide 95% CIs were associated with the percentage-point differences from placebo in the majority of endpoints for patients aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years, reflecting variability in the data likely due to the small number of patients in these post hoc subgroup analyses. Corticosteroid sparing is particularly important for older IBD patients since long-term, high-frequency or high-dose corticosteroid use in these patients often exacerbates conditions such as congestive heart failure, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, psychosis, depression, electrolyte abnormalities, cataracts, glaucoma, or infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Yet chronic corticosteroid use coupled with infrequent attempts to taper is a common practice in elderly IBD patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Importantly, the absolute percentages of patients achieving corticosteroid-free remission with vedolizumab maintenance treatment at week 52 were similar for all UC patients (33&#x02013;42%) and CD patients (27&#x02013;33%) regardless of age.</p><p>A recent integrated study of the vedolizumab clinical trials, including GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, found younger age was a risk factor for serious infection with vedolizumab exposure in a combined population of 2884 patients with UC or CD (hazard ratio 0.98; 95% CI 0.97&#x02013;0.99; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) but did not report any other safety&#x02013;age relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Indeed, we observed 10 fewer patients with infection per 100&#x000a0;PY of vedolizumab in the &#x02265;55-year-old age group than in the &#x0003c;35-year-old age group. Further, we found no evidence of a change in occurrence of malignancy, diabetes, other adverse hematological events, or infusion-related reactions with vedolizumab treatment in patients with advancing age from &#x0003c;35 to &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years. No major age-related trends in the occurrence of the most common adverse events reported were observed. While cognitive function was not evaluated directly in GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2, the occurrence of an adverse event of memory impairment with vedolizumab was low [4 patients (3%; 3.6 per 100 PY) aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years] and similar to that observed with placebo [1 patient (3%; 4.3 per 100 PY) aged &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years] in all age groups investigated. One malignancy was reported in a patient &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years of age exposed to vedolizumab induction; however, patient risk factors (i.e., a history of tobacco use, a long duration of UC, and prior therapy with immunosuppressives and corticosteroids) may have contributed to the etiology. Recently, a retrospective study of 14,733 patients with moderately to severely active IBD reported an incidence of 0.7 per 100&#x000a0;PY for primary solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In comparison, the incidence of cancer was &#x02264;0.5 per 100&#x000a0;PY in our combined vedolizumab-exposed population. Notably, a 1-year controlled study may not be long enough to detect malignancies and other adverse events that usually take longer to develop. Continued monitoring through epidemiological studies and patient registries will help evaluate the long-term safety profile of vedolizumab. Of note, percentages of UC and CD patients &#x02265;55&#x000a0;years of age who completed the 52-week GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies and of those who were continuing in the open-label GEMINI LTS trial at 100&#x000a0;weeks post-enrollment were similar to those of patients &#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years of age. In contrast, anti-TNF therapies have been linked to premature discontinuation in older IBD patients more often than younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In one retrospective single-center study, 53% of patients aged &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;years were continuing anti-TNF therapy at 12&#x000a0;months after initiation versus 90% of younger users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The increased susceptibility of older patients to infectious complications and adverse events, in general, has been proposed as an underlying reason for premature treatment cessation in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the current analysis highlighted important trends in the data favoring vedolizumab over placebo for most efficacy endpoints irrespective of age. Safety profiles were found to be similar between vedolizumab and placebo in all age groups. However, given the limitations of this study, further investigation of the safety and efficacy of vedolizumab in the elderly population is needed. As mentioned earlier, the current results are based on a post hoc subgroup analysis of data from the GEMINI 1 and GEMINI 2 studies, both of which were limited in size (particularly for patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years of age) and duration; and therefore they were not powered for efficacy or safety analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, as a result of the multiplicity of adverse events and the spontaneous nature of adverse event reporting, descriptive statistics were used to compare the incidences of adverse events between patient groups in the original pivotal studies and the current subgroup analyses. Finally, comorbidities, especially as patients age, may confound study results; however, monitoring of comorbidities was not prespecified in the trial designs, making stratification of patients based on comorbid conditions challenging.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Because of changing demographics, the safe and effective treatment of older IBD patients will be an ongoing challenge. The results of these post hoc analyses suggest that vedolizumab treatment was efficacious and well tolerated in IBD patients across all ages. Based on these results, and within the limitation of these analyses, vedolizumab may offer an attractive alternative to the currently available treatment options. In the absence of prospective interventional studies investigating the effects of vedolizumab in elderly patients, the emergence of real-world data will add to the findings of these post hoc analyses and provide further support for whether vedolizumab is a suitable treatment option for elderly IBD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
