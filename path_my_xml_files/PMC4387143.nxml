Investigators rated treatment outcomes on Allergan&#x02019;s Lip Fullness Scale, Perioral Lines Scale, and Oral Commissures Severity Scale. A blinded independent central reviewer (ICR) assessed 3-dimensional digital photographs using these scales. Subjects evaluated outcomes using the FACE-Q Recovery Early Life Impact and Recovery Early Symptoms modules. The primary endpoint was noninferiority of Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine to Restylane-L based on responder rate (percentage of subjects with &#x02265;1-point Lip Fullness Scale improvement at month 3 ICR assessment vs baseline).</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine was noninferior to Restylane-L. Although responder rates based on ICR assessments of lip fullness, perioral lines, and oral commissures did not differ between treatments, investigator assessments showed significant improvements in perioral lines and oral commissures with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine vs Restylane-L (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.029). Subjects treated with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine had higher mean FACE-Q scores on day 1 (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001), indicating less disruption of daily activities. Mean change in lip volume from baseline to day 1 was smaller in the Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine group (but similar between treatments on day 14), indicating less acute swelling.

Subjects were enrolled and treated in 2012; this report covers data collected through 3 months. The study (NCT01579305) was approved by independent ethics committees, and all subjects provided written informed consent.</p><p>Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine or Restylane-L based on a central randomization schedule. An automated interactive voice and Web response system was used to manage the randomization and treatment assignment. Sites dispensed treatment according to the instructions provided by the automated system. Investigators at each site determined the appropriate treatment injection volume based on clinical experience and subject lip treatment goals. The primary treatment site was the vermilion body and vermilion border; additional perioral sites could also be treated, including perioral lines, Cupid&#x02019;s bow, philtral columns, and oral commissures. An optional top-up treatment could be performed 2 weeks after initial treatment if the investigator and subject agreed that optimal lip fullness had not been achieved. The maximum allowable treatment volume was 4.0 mL (4 syringes) for initial and top-up treatments combined. Subjects, independent central reviewers (ICRs) from Canfield Scientific (Fairfield, N.J.), and all investigational site staff, except for the investigator and study coordinator, were blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Adults aged 18 years old or older desiring lip enhancement were eligible if they had a score of 1 (minimal) or 2 (mild) on the validated 5-point Allergan Lip Fullness Scale<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (LFS: minimal, mild, moderate, marked, and very marked) and had established a realistic treatment goal deemed achievable by the investigator. Subjects who had undergone cosmetic facial, lip, or perioral procedures or had received botulinum toxin therapy in the lower face within the previous 6 months were excluded. Other exclusion criteria were as follows: semi-permanent fillers or permanent implants in the lips; history of multiple severe allergies, autoimmune disease, or skin cancer; and allergy to lidocaine, hyaluronic acid, or streptococcal proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Effectiveness Assessments</title><p>Follow-up visits occurred at 1 and 14 days after each treatment and at 1 and 3 months after the last treatment. Additional visits are planned at 6, 9, and 12 months. Facial 3-dimensional (3D) images were taken at all visits for ICR use. Subjects completed the 23-item Recovery Early Life Impact and 17-item Recovery Early Symptoms modules of the FACE-Q on days 1 and 14 after each treatment.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The Recovery Early Life Impact module evaluated the effect of treatment on daily activities and feelings; the Recovery Early Symptoms module assessed whether various symptoms had been bothersome. Subjects also completed the 22-item Satisfaction with Lips and 10-item Satisfaction with Outcome modules of the FACE-Q through month 3 after treatment.</p><p>Investigators and subjects assessed lip fullness using the LFS.

Secondary analyses included between-group comparisons in Recovery Early Life Impact and Recovery Early Symptoms scores on day 1 posttreatment and changes in lip volume from baseline to month 3; each was assessed using an independent <italic>t</italic> test. Between-group comparisons of individual items on FACE-Q modules were assessed at day 1 or month 3 as applicable using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Between-group comparisons in Satisfaction with Lips and Satisfaction with Outcome scores were assessed at month 3 using an independent <italic>t</italic> test.

For both treatment groups, lip sensitivity and speech pronunciation were not affected by treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study met its primary endpoint: the effectiveness of Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine for lip enhancement was noninferior to treatment with Restylane-L. The analysis was based on a subjective assessment by the ICR of overall lip fullness from 3D images using the LFS. Results were supported by subjective assessments made by investigators and subjects and by objective measurements of lip volume and surface area from analysis of the 3D images. Besides improving overall lip fullness, Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine was at least as effective as Restylane-L for improving perioral lines and oral commissures, including fine lines and wrinkles in the perioral region. In the investigator assessment, a significantly greater percentage of subjects receiving Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine achieved improvements in perioral lines and oral commissures at month 3 versus Restylane-L. These results agree with studies using other injectable gels from the Juv&#x000e9;derm family, including Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella (without lidocaine) and Juv&#x000e9;derm Ultra, which were effective in augmenting lip fullness and reducing perioral lines and oral commissures.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine was also shown to be effective in the correction of tear troughs and sunken eyes in the periocular area.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Subjects receiving Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine reported better outcomes on day 1 than those receiving Restylane-L. This was evidenced by higher scores on the FACE-Q Recovery Early Life Impact and Recovery Early Symptoms modules, indicative of less disruption of normal daily activities. Lip volume measurements on day 1 support these findings. Subjects receiving Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine had a smaller mean change from baseline in lip volume on day 1 compared with those receiving Restylane-L, suggesting less acute, short-term swelling. At month 3, subjects reported greater satisfaction with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine versus Restylane-L on the FACE-Q. Although investigators evaluated satisfaction based on the aesthetic features at 3 months after treatment, subjects evaluated satisfaction based on aesthetic features and other factors, indicating that patient satisfaction is a multidimensional concept.</p><p>The responder rate for overall lip fullness in both treatment groups, based on ICR assessment, was surprisingly low, particularly compared with a recent lip augmentation study conducted in the United States with a Restylane formulation without lidocaine.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, the injection volume for upper and lower lips was &#x0003e;2-fold higher in the Restylane study, possibly reflecting cultural differences between European and American ideals of lip enhancement. In the present study, investigators enrolled subjects who had minimal or mild baseline LFS scores, and the primary endpoint was based on LFS assessments made by the ICR from 3D images. The ICR and investigator assessments of LFS at baseline differed considerably; the ICR assessment found a higher mean LFS score and rated &#x0003e;50% of the subjects as having moderate or marked lip fullness at baseline. Accordingly, these subjects had little room to show the 1-point improvement in overall lip fullness necessary for classification as a responder. Differences were also observed between assessors for oral commissures and perioral lines. Together, these data suggest that photographs may present less detail and therefore are less sensitive for measuring observable changes compared with in-person assessment. In the Restylane study, responder rates were notably lower when based on assessments from photographs compared with live evaluations.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the present study, the month 3 responder rates based on the investigator assessments (84.2% with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine and 81.4% with Restylane-L) suggest a much better outcome compared with the ICR assessments.</p><p>The overall incidence of subject-reported ISRs and device-related AEs was similar between treatment groups and consistent with expectations for hyaluronic acid dermal fillers. However, ISR severity was generally lower with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine, and several types of ISRs, including lumps/bumps and firmness, were reported less frequently with Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine.</p><p>Two study limitations are notable. First, subjects were enrolled based on in-person assessment of lip fullness by investigators, whereas the primary analysis of treatment effectiveness depended on ICR assessment of 3D images. This contributed to differences in responder rate depending on the assessor. Regardless of the assessor, Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine was at least as effective as Restylane-L. Second, investigators were not blinded to the treatment assignment; consequently, they may have been biased in their assessments. However, qualitatively similar findings were obtained by the ICR and subjects themselves, who were blinded to treatment assignment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study demonstrates that Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine is safe and effective for aesthetic lip augmentation and improvement in perioral lines and oral commissures. Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella with Lidocaine displayed a favorable risk-benefit profile for volumizing the lips and perioral area, including less early life impact and early symptoms compared with Restylane-L. Most ISRs and device-related AEs were mild or moderate in severity, and lidocaine effectively managed injection pain.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella Study Group Principal Investigators: Raj Acquilla, MD (Cheshire, United Kingdom) has no financial relationships to disclose; Lakhdar Belhaouari, MD (Toulouse, France) has received research grant support from Allergan for conducting the study; Jonquille Chantrey, MD (Cheshire, United Kingdom) has received research grant support from Allergan for conducting the study; Simon Connolly, MD (Glasgow, United Kingdom) has received a study fee schedule from Allergan, Inc.; David Eccleston, MD (Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom) has received speaker honoraria from Allergan in the past; V&#x000e9;ronique Gassia, MD (Toulouse, France) has received speaker honoraria from Allergan, Inc.; Annelize Meyer, MD (West Sussex, United Kingdom) received funding through Allergan, Inc. to act as an investigator in the study; Tapan Patel, MD (London, United Kingdom) has no financial relationships to disclose; Herv&#x000e9; Raspaldo, MD (Cannes, France) has received honoraria from Allergan, Inc.; Isabelle Rousseaux, MD (Loos, France) has no financial relationships to disclose; Roy Saleh, MD (Cheadle, United Kingdom) has received research grant support from Allergan for conducting the study; Michel Zbili, MD (Nice, France) has no financial relationships to disclose.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented in poster format at the 16th International Master Course on Aging Skin (IMCAS), January 30&#x02013;February 2, 2014, Paris, France, and at the 12th Anti-Aging Medicine World Congress (AMWC), April 3&#x02013;5, 2014, Monte Carlo, Monaco.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under the name &#x0201c;Safety and Effectiveness of Juv&#x000e9;derm Volbella With Lidocaine Versus Restylane-L for Lip Volume Enhancement&#x0201d; and the identifier number NCT01579305 (URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01579305">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01579305</ext-link>).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold>: Dr. Raspaldo has received honoraria from Allergan.
