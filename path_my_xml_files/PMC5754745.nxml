<bold>Background: </bold>Delirium is associated with many negative health outcomes. Postoperative sedation and opioid administration may contribute to delirium. We hypothesize that the use of dexmedetomidine and Intravenous acetaminophen (IVA) may lead to reduced opioid consumption and decreased incidence of postoperative delirium. This pilot study aims to assess feasibility of using dexmedetomidine and IVA in cardiac surgical patients, and estimate the effect size for incidence and duration of delirium.</p><p>
<bold>Methods: </bold>A total of 12 adult patients &#x0003e;60 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery were recruited and randomized into 4 groups: Propofol only (P), Propofol with IVA (P+A), Dexmedetomidine only (D), Dexmedetomidine with IVA (D+A). Preoperative baseline cognition and postoperative delirium was assessed daily until discharge. The feasibility was assessed by the number of patients who completed the study.</p><p>
<bold>Results: </bold>All patients completed the study successfully. The total incidence of delirium in the study population was 42% (5/12): &#x000a0;67% (2/3) in the group P, and 67% (2/3) in the group D, 33% (1/3) in &#x000a0;D+A group and 0%(0/3) &#x000a0;P+A group. The incidence of delirium was 17% (1/6) in the group receiving IVA compared to 67% (4/6) that did not receive IVA. The mean range of duration of delirium was 0-1 days. One patient expired after surgery, unrelated to the study protocol. One patient in the D group experienced hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90 mm of Hg.)</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The feasibility of performing a &#x000a0;project is ascertained by the study. Patients receiving IVA had lower incidence of delirium compared to patients not receiving IVA which suggests that IVA may have a role in reducing the incidence of delirium. A prospective randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be the next step in investigating the role of dexmedetomidine and IVA in reducing the incidence of delirium.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>delirium</kwd><kwd>dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>acetaminophen</kwd><kwd>cardiac surgery</kwd><kwd>coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)</kwd><kwd>propofol</kwd><kwd>cognitive assessments</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>National Institute for Health Research</funding-source><award-id>GM098406</award-id></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>Mallinckrodt</funding-source></award-group><funding-statement>Balachundhar Subramaniam is supported by the National Institutes of Health Research Project Grant GM 098406.</funding-statement><funding-statement><italic>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</italic></funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta><notes notes-type="version-changes"><sec sec-type="version-changes"><label>Revised</label><title>Amendments from Version 1</title><p>The following changes, applied to the manuscript, are based on the referees' comments:

<sup><xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Delirium increases the risk of mortality, readmissions, and accelerated cognitive decline
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;
<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Around 158 billion dollars of national healthcare cost is attributable to delirium
<sup><xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The incidence of delirium in cardiac surgery is 11&#x02013;46%
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Delirium is preventable in 30&#x02013;40% of the cases
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Some of the modifiable risk factors for delirium include the choice of analgesic and sedatives
<sup><xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Currently used sedatives, like midazolam, act via GABA receptors and release deliriogenic mediators
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 adrenergic agonist, with no interaction with GABA receptors.</p><p>A recent study by Li
<italic>et al.</italic> in 285 elderly cardiac surgical patients evaluated dexmedetomidine versus propofol and showed no difference in the incidence of delirium
<sup><xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. A major limitation of this study is that CAM- ICU is limited in delirium assessments and may miss the diagnosis. There are other tools that could help assess cognitive assessment more efficiently. A meta-analysis suggested that the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation in cardiac surgery patients may reduce the incidence of delirium
<sup><xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. The first study in the meta-analysis was a retrospective study by Corbett SM
<italic>et al</italic>. that does not mention how delirium was assessed in individual hospitals
<sup><xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. The second study by Shehabi Y
<italic>et al.</italic> was not powered adequately and used CAM-ICU for assessing delirium both in intubated and extubated patients which have reduced sensitivity for delirium in verbal patients and could have underestimated the incidence of delirium
<sup><xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. The third study by Maldonado JR et al. of recruited118 patients and 90 patients were finally analyzed. 28 randomized patients were excluded for protocol violations which introduce a significant selection bias
<sup><xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. It also showed a 94% reduction in the incidence of delirium and this effect size is almost implausibly large and has not been seen in other studies. The final study by Dasta JF
<italic>et al.</italic> was not designed to identify patients with delirium with any specific tools such as CAM and thus could have gross underestimated delirium incidence
<sup><xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. The use of IV acetaminophen (IVA) has been shown in multiple studies to reduce the amount of opioids consumed by patients undergoing surgeries
<sup><xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. IVA has never been studied in the context of cardiac surgery and delirium prevention. So, we hypothesized that the use of dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen would provide adequate analgesia, leading to a decreased opioid consumption and thus decreased incidence of delirium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>This is a pilot trial which ran from November 2013 to November 2014 to assess the feasibility of using IV dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit.

Patients who are 60 years of age or older who were undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and/or valve surgery were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c; 30%, emergent and percutaneous procedures, aortic surgeries, preexisting cognitive impairment, recent seizures, patients on medications for cognitive decline, serum creatinine &#x0003e; 2 mg%, liver dysfunction, known history of alcohol or drug abuse, and hypersensitivity to any of the study drugs. Patients who might not get extubated in a reasonable amount of time (hence the EF, aortic surgery exclusion, etc) were excluded. Since Q6H IV acetaminophen was given, any clinical situation that can potentially set up patients for drug toxicity etc. were avoided. (

The study protocol was easily incorporated into patient care. All the enrolled patients completed the study protocol. There were no instances where the implementation of the study protocol was abandoned by the physicians. Sedation provided was useful. Apart from the incidence of hypotension in one patient with dexmedetomidine use, no other adverse events recorded directly related to the intervention.</p><p>No other statistical evaluation was done due to the small sample size. The overall incidence of delirium in our trial, at 42%, is close to previous reports
<sup><xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. The incidence of delirium in patients receiving IVA was 17% compared to 67% in the other group suggesting that IVA may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of delirium following cardiac surgery. The pilot study led to a larger ongoing trial (NCT02546765).</p><p>A major limitation of our study is the small sample size, but this was a feasibility trial to study effect size for the design of future larger studies. Also, there was no blinding for the choice of sedatives used in the patients.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The investigators state, &#x0201c;The mean duration of delirium was 0-1 days.&#x0201d; This appears to be a range.
<bold>Thank you. Yes. We reported the mean duration as a range.</bold>

<bold>Thank you. We agree this is a pre-pilot study indeed.&#x000a0; It was a feasibility project and we certainly do not want to overinterpret.&#x000a0; Thus, we wrote &#x0201c;IVA may be beneficial in reducing the incidence of delirium following cardiac surgery.&#x000a0;&#x0201d;&#x000a0; Since this is a feasibility study we agree that a larger study is needed to draw a concrete conclusion.</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>I do not agree that using the CAM is a major limitation in delirium research (as the investigators suggest that it might lack sensitivity). I do agree that this might apply to the CAM-ICU.
<bold>Thank you. Agreed. &#x000a0;</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>More efficient tools might not necessarily be more sensitive.

<bold>Thank you. We planned this pilot study as a means to assess the feasibility of performing a large-scale project. &#x000a0;However, there is no other preexisting data to power the next larger trial.&#x000a0; Since this pilot study showed a 66% reduction in the incidence of delirium, for the power calculation, a 50% reduction in the delirium incidence was used.&#x000a0; Each group needed 56 patients (alpha=0.05 and 1-Beta=0.80).</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>From the registration site (for NCT02546765), it appears that 120 patients will be included in the (large) trial. This number is likely to be much too small to answer the research question with sufficient precision.
<bold>Thank you. &#x000a0;A multicenter trial is definitely required to answer with precision.&#x000a0; However, it will be a major leap to go from a pilot study to a multicenter trial.&#x000a0; Thus, we chose to do the second step of testing in a larger sample size with what is known so far.&#x000a0; Depending on what this study shows, the obvious next step will be a larger multicenter trial.</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>The reasons for the exclusion criteria are not clear.
<bold>Thank you. We chose a homogenous set of patients to determine the drug efficacy.&#x000a0; We wanted to avoid patients who might not get extubated in a reasonable amount of time (hence the EF, aortic surgery exclusion, etc).&#x000a0; As we chose to give Q6H IV acetaminophen, we wanted to avoid any clinical situation that can potentially set up patients for drug toxicity etc.&#x000a0; Preexisting cognitive dysfunction, etc. could muddle the picture in a 120 patient study.&#x000a0; In a larger multicenter trial if and when launched, the heterogeneity can be accounted for and thus need not necessarily be an exclusion criteria.</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>With the modified factorial design, was interaction between interventions considered? Specifically, both dexmedetomidine and acetaminophen might have an impact on the outcome of interest (delirium).
<bold>Thank you. Yes, these interactions will be analyzed in the ongoing trial</bold>
</p></list-item><list-item><p>The (secondary) results of the study were as follows: &#x0201c;The Propofol+Acetaminophen group had no occurrence of delirium. Interestingly, only 17% (1/6) of the subjects who received IVA were diagnosed with delirium compared to 67% (4/6) in the group who did not receive IVA.&#x0201d; The investigators should be cautious about over-interpreting these findings, or using these estimates to justify sample size for a large trial.

<underline>Response</underline>
</p><p>In this single-center randomized controlled trial (RCT), Susheela and coworkers investigate the use of dexmedetomidine and intravenous acetaminophen for the prevention of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This pilot study primarily aimed to assess the feasibility of a larger RCT with identical interventions.</p><p>As a pilot project, the study is methodically sound. Overall, the manuscript is well-written and pleasant to read. The authors applied CONSORT criteria which is a definite plus.</p><p>
<bold>Thank you</bold>
</p><p>Postoperative delirium has specific features that may be related to surgery (and anesthesia) and has a probable neuroinflammatory component. I, therefore, do not agree with your statement that 30-40% of delirium cases could be prevented, at least not in your sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. So far, multicomponent interventions to prevent delirium have only been proven efficacious in a general population of elderly hospitalized patients.1</p><p>
<bold>Thank you. These estimates are from the pilot study result.&#x000a0; The ongoing study will inform us better about the effect size.</bold>
</p><p>Please also discuss the opioid-sparing effects of intraoperative dexmedetomidine. Next, to the missing interaction with GABA receptors, this might be an additional mechanism for delirium prevention when using dexmedetomidine.</p><p>
<bold>Thank you. Agreed. It is possible that dexmedetomidine can reduce the analgesic requirements. The ongoing study will inform us of this effect size as well due to the crossover design.</bold>
</p><p>Please discuss the reasons to exclude patients with preexisting cognitive impairment from your study. Preoperative cognitive impairment was found to be one of the most important risk factors for postoperative delirium (odds ratio ranged from 6.3 (95% CI 2.9 to 13.7) up to 11.5 (95% CI 6.1 to 20.1)).2 By excluding these patients (also in the follow-up RCT), you likely decrease the number of patients affected by the primary outcome measure (postoperative delirium) in your study. It would be interesting to investigate the effects of dexmedetomidine and intravenous acetaminophen in these high-risk patients.</p><p>
<bold>Thank you. As this is the first study of this size, we would like to get a homogenous group examined first and definitely the next step is to do the patients with preexisting cognitive dysfunction</bold>.</p><p>I find it difficult to blind the intravenous administration of propofol and dexmedetomidine. At best, you may try to conceal the study drug from patient, surgeon, ICU caregivers, and investigators by using opaque syringes and lines. Was study drug administration really double-blind?</p><p>
<bold>Thank you. We only double-blinded the Acetaminophen arms.</bold>
</p><p>Was there any kind of standardization in anesthesiologic management? If yes, state drugs and dosage.</p><p>
<bold>Cardiac surgery is the most protocolized intraoperative setting. Patients were induced with 500mcg of IV fentanyl, 50-100mg of Propofol, and endotracheal intubation was facilitated with 1mg/kg intravenous rocuronium.&#x000a0; Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane (0.6-1.0 MAC) in 100% oxygen with intermittent fentanyl </bold>
<bold>up to</bold>
<bold> a maximum of additional 500 mcg of fentanyl and intermittent rocuronium.&#x000a0; All patients were taken intubated to the ICU</bold>
</p><p>
<bold>&#x000a0;</bold>
</p><p>At what frequency did you assess patients for postoperative delirium in the ICU/on the ward? Who assessed the patients?</p><p>
<bold>Assistants trained from Edward Marcantonio&#x02019;s lab (with initial half a day training session, witnessing the assessments for a few patients and also calibration with gold standard assessor). </bold>
<bold>Postoperative</bold>
<bold> delirium was assessed by a trained study team member with the help of cognitive assessments such as MMSE, CAM-ICU, and CAM starting from the day after the surgery. If cognitive assessments are negative for 3 consecutive days (i.e days 5, 6 &#x00026; 7), assessments were completed every other day until the&#x000a0;</bold>
<bold>date</bold>
<bold> of discharge.</bold>
</p><p>I wish the investigators of this pilot project the best of luck with the larger ongoing trial!</p><p>
