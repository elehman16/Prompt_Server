Targeting hotspots may represent an efficacious strategy for reducing malaria transmission. We determined the impact of interventions targeted to serologically defined malaria hotspots on malaria transmission both inside hotspots and in surrounding communities.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Twenty-seven serologically defined malaria hotspots were detected in a survey conducted from 24 June to 31 July 2011 that included 17,503 individuals from 3,213 compounds in a 100-km<sup>2</sup> area in Rachuonyo South District, Kenya. In a cluster-randomized trial from 22 March to 15 April 2012, we randomly allocated five clusters to hotspot-targeted interventions with larviciding, distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets, indoor residual spraying, and focal mass drug administration (2,082 individuals in 432 compounds); five control clusters received malaria control following Kenyan national policy (2,468 individuals in 512 compounds). Our primary outcome measure was parasite prevalence in evaluation zones up to 500 m outside hotspots, determined by nested PCR (nPCR) at baseline and 8 wk (16 June&#x02013;6 July 2012) and 16 wk (21 August&#x02013;10 September 2012) post-intervention by technicians blinded to the intervention arm. Secondary outcome measures were parasite prevalence inside hotpots, parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone as a function of distance from the hotspot boundary, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito density, mosquito breeding site productivity, malaria incidence by passive case detection, and the safety and acceptability of the interventions. Intervention coverage exceeded 87% for all interventions. Hotspot-targeted interventions did not result in a change in nPCR parasite prevalence outside hotspot boundaries (<italic>p</italic> &#x02265; 0.187). We observed an average reduction in nPCR parasite prevalence of 10.2% (95% CI &#x02212;1.3 to 21.7%) inside hotspots 8 wk post-intervention that was statistically significant after adjustment for covariates (<italic>p =</italic> 0.024), but not 16 wk post-intervention (<italic>p =</italic> 0.265). We observed no statistically significant trend in the effect of the intervention on nPCR parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone in relation to distance from the hotspot boundary 8 wk (<italic>p =</italic> 0.27) or 16 wk post-intervention (<italic>p =</italic> 0.75). Thirty-six patients with clinical malaria confirmed by rapid diagnostic test could be located to intervention or control clusters, with no apparent difference between the study arms. In intervention clusters we caught an average of 1.14 female anophelines inside hotspots and 0.47 in evaluation zones; in control clusters we caught an average of 0.90 female anophelines inside hotspots and 0.50 in evaluation zones, with no apparent difference between study arms. Our trial was not powered to detect subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions nor designed to detect effects of interventions over multiple transmission seasons.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite high coverage, the impact of interventions targeting malaria vectors and human infections on nPCR parasite prevalence was modest, transient, and restricted to the targeted hotspot areas. Our findings suggest that transmission may not primarily occur from hotspots to the surrounding areas and that areas with highly heterogeneous but widespread malaria transmission may currently benefit most from an untargeted community-wide approach. Hotspot-targeted approaches may have more validity in settings where human settlement is more nuclear.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01575613">NCT01575613</ext-link>
</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>In a cluster-randomized controlled trial, Teun Bousema and colleagues investigate whether interventions targeted to malaria hotspots in the western Kenyan highlands can reduce transmission in surrounding areas.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editors-summary"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sec005"><title>Background</title><p>In 2015, there were about 200 million cases of malaria (a mosquito-borne parasitic disease) worldwide and about 438,000 malaria-related deaths. Most of these deaths were caused by <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, which is transmitted to people by night-flying <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. When infected mosquitoes bite people, they inject &#x0201c;sporozoites,&#x0201d; a parasitic form that replicates in the liver. After a few days, the liver releases &#x0201c;merozoites,&#x0201d; which invade red blood cells, where they replicate before bursting out and infecting more red blood cells. This increase in parasitic burden causes recurring flu-like symptoms and can cause organ damage and death if not treated promptly with antimalarial drugs. Infected red blood cells also release &#x0201c;gametocytes,&#x0201d; which infect mosquitoes when they take a blood meal. In the mosquito, gametocytes multiply and develop into sporozoites, which completes the parasite&#x02019;s life cycle. Malaria can be prevented by controlling <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes and by avoiding mosquito bites. Methods for controlling mosquitoes include treating stagnant water with &#x0201c;larvicides&#x0201d; to kill immature mosquitoes and spraying houses with insecticides (indoor residual spraying); sleeping under insecticide-treated bednets is an effective way to avoid mosquito bites. Treatment with antimalarial drugs also decreases malaria transmission.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Improved malaria prevention has reduced malaria-related deaths over recent years, and experts are now trying to devise strategies to eradicate malaria. Targeting malaria transmission hotspots&#x02014;regions where the intensity of transmission is higher than in surrounding areas&#x02014;is one potential strategy for reducing malaria transmission. Mosquito densities are highest in hotspots, and people living in hotspots may transmit malaria parasites to a large number of mosquitoes that can then spread malaria transmission to wider areas. Targeting malaria hotspots might, therefore, benefit communities in both the targeted region and the surrounding area. Here, the researchers look for malaria hotspots in Rachuonyo South District in the western Kenyan highlands, an area where malaria transmission intensity is generally low, and undertake a cluster-randomized controlled trial to determine the impact of hotspot-targeted malaria control interventions on malaria transmission inside hotspots and in surrounding communities. A cluster-randomized trial compares outcomes in groups (clusters) of people (here, people living in different malaria hotspots) randomly assigned to receive different interventions.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>Using survey results and spatial scanning techniques, the researchers detected 27 serologically defined malaria hotpots (clusters of people with antibodies to the malaria parasite) in Rachuonyo South District. Of these, ten hotspots were at least 1.5 kilometers from the nearest neighboring hotspot (allowing space for evaluation zones and a buffer between hotspots). During the following peak malaria transmission period, they randomly allocated five of these hotspots to targeted interventions (larvicide treatment of stagnant water, community distribution of insecticide-treated bednets, indoor residual spraying, and mass drug administration) and five hotspots to the control intervention (the Kenyan national policy of annual indoor residual spraying, routine case management at clinics, and bednet distribution at antenatal clinics). Intervention coverage exceeded 87% for all the components of the targeted intervention. However, the intervention did not change the prevalence of parasites (the proportion of the population carrying parasites) at 8 or 16 weeks post-intervention in the evaluation zones&#x02014;the areas 1&#x02013;500 meters from the border of the hotspots (the study&#x02019;s primary outcome). There was a statistically significant reduction in parasite prevalence inside intervention hotspots at 8 but not 16 weeks post-intervention (a statistically significant change is one unlikely to have happened by chance). Finally, similar numbers of individuals from the intervention and control clusters attended local health facilities and were found to have confirmed clinical malaria, and there was no significant difference between intervention and control clusters in the number of mosquitoes caught within hotspots or evaluation zones.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that, despite high coverage, the impact of interventions targeting malaria hotspots in Rachuonyo South District on parasite prevalence was modest, transient, and restricted to the targeted hotspot. It may be that the number of clusters included in this study was too small to detect any subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions. Moreover, the effect of the targeted interventions may have been masked by other ongoing interventions in the region. However, these findings suggest that malaria transmission in Rachuonyo South District may not occur primarily from hotspots to the surrounding areas. Thus, areas where malaria transmission is widespread but includes hotspots might benefit most from an untargeted community-wide approach to malaria prevention.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Additional Information</title><p>This list of resources contains links that can be accessed when viewing the PDF on a device or via the online version of the article at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001993">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001993</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the World Health Organization on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/topics/malaria/en/">malaria</ext-link> (in several languages); its <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/9789241564991/en/">Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016&#x02013;2030</ext-link></italic> provides a framework to guide countries towards malaria elimination; the <italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world-malaria-report-2015/en/">World Malaria Report 2015</ext-link></italic> describes the current global malaria situation and includes information on malaria in individual African countries and recommended policies and strategies for malaria control</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/">malaria</ext-link> (in English and Spanish), including information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/index.html">malaria prevention</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/stories/index.html">personal stories</ext-link> about malaria</p></list-item><list-item><p>The UK National Health Service Choices website also provides information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/malaria/Pages/Introduction.aspx">malaria</ext-link>, including a personal story</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the Roll Back Malaria Partnership on the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/">global control of malaria</ext-link> (in English and French)</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to additional information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/malaria.html">malaria</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>More information about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01575613?term=nct01575613&#x00026;rank=1">this trial</ext-link> is available</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by the Bill &#x00026; Melinda Gates Foundation, under the Malaria Transmission Consortium, Grant No. 45114 and by the Grand Challenge Grant No. OPP1024438.

In the last decade, considerable efforts have been made to better estimate the global and local burden of malaria. At a micro-epidemiological scale in endemic areas, numerous factors influence malaria transmission dynamics, including distance to the nearest mosquito breeding site [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], wind direction [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], vegetation [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], house construction features [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and human genetic [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and behavioral factors [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Variations in these factors over a small area can result in spatially heterogeneous transmission and can result in malaria hotspots, where transmission intensity is higher than in the surrounding areas. These malaria hotspots may be present in all malaria endemic areas but are most readily identifiable in areas of low transmission intensity, where malaria incidence, parasite prevalence, and mosquito exposure may be elevated inside hotspots [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Malaria control efforts targeted to transmission hotspots may have benefits for both the targeted area and the wider community. Mosquito densities are highest in hotspots, and individuals in hotspots may amplify transmission by transmitting malaria parasites to a large number of mosquitoes that fuel transmission to wider areas. This amplified transmission can lead to 1.5- to 4-fold increases in the basic reproductive number of malaria parasites [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Successful targeting of malaria control efforts to hotspots may therefore be a highly efficient method to reduce malaria transmission in a wider area and achieve community protection by eliminating transmission in a relatively small geographical area [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

We hypothesized that combined malaria control interventions targeted at hotspots could reduce malaria transmission not only inside these hotspots but also in adjacent areas.

All analyses were based on intention to treat, whereby all clusters were included in the analysis, regardless of the level of coverage. The main outcome measure was nPCR parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone surrounding hotspots. Each cluster was divided into two areas for the analysis: the hotspot and the evaluation zone. To examine parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone as a function of distance from the hotspot boundary (secondary outcome), evaluation zones were stratified into compounds located 1&#x02013;249 m and 250&#x02013;500 m from the hotspot boundary. For each survey, comparisons between control and intervention clusters were made between hotspots as well as each stratum of the evaluation zone. Each comparison was made using a <italic>t</italic>-test on the cluster-level nPCR parasite prevalence. Measures of complexity of infection and prevalence were also compared separately for each of the strata by a <italic>t</italic>-test of cluster-level means.

These covariates, which were not part of the intervention, were defined a priori and were included simultaneously in a single prespecified adjusted analysis. This was done by first performing an individual-level logistic regression with only the factors we wished to adjust for as the predictors while excluding the intervention status of the cluster.

Larviciding of all water bodies continued for 16 wk after the start of the intervention until the week after the final evaluation survey. LLIN distribution, IRS, and focal MDA were implemented during a period of 3 wk, 22 March&#x02013;15 April 2012. The percentage of compounds that received PermaNet W 3.0 LLINs ranged from 94.5% (120/127) to 98.3% (58/59) of compounds across intervention clusters, and between 89.2% (379/425) and 97.5% (154/158) of sleeping spaces received IRS in the intervention clusters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1001993.t002">Table 2</xref>). Of those compounds that received IRS under the normal Kenyan national policy campaign (i.e., in control clusters), 62.8% (59/94) to 81.4% (79/97) of sleeping spaces were sprayed, as reported during the 8-wk post-intervention survey (June&#x02013;July 2012). In the intervention hotspots, 11.8% of compounds (cluster range 9.0% [11/120] to 16.2% [7/42]) required more nets due to missing or damaged LLINs, and there were no reported adverse effects associated with LLIN use. Ten individuals (age range 2&#x02013;62 y) residing in three compounds in the intervention hotspots reported adverse effects to IRS. Reported symptoms included mild skin rashes and itching and one report of swollen and reddish mouth. All participants were provided treatment at Rachuonyo District Hospital; these were the only identified safety issues associated with the interventions. Of all compounds in the intervention hotspots, 94.0% (406/432 compounds) participated in screening of the sentinel population; on average 42.3% of the screened compounds (range 14.0% [8/57 compounds] to 66.1% [72/109 compounds]) had &#x02265;1 RDT-positive member and were eligible for focal MDA. 94.9% (1,015/1,070) of inhabitants of these compounds completed treatment, with loss to follow-up accounting for the majority of non-compliance. There were no reports of side effects deemed likely to be related to treatment. Acceptability of interventions was not formally assessed in interviews or questionnaires; all households in intervention clusters were visited as part of the LLIN follow-up visits at 8-wk post-intervention to record any side effects or complaints. The high coverage levels achieved indicate a high degree of approval by the communities.</p><fig id="pmed.1001993.g004" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pmed.1001993.g004</object-id><label>Fig 4</label><caption><title>Overview of the cluster-randomized trial conducted in Rachuonyo South District in March&#x02013;September 2012.</title><p>Clusters were serologically defined hotspots with a surrounding 500-m evaluation zone and were randomly allocated to the intervention (<italic>n =</italic> 5) or control arm (<italic>n =</italic> 5).

An exploratory parasitological endpoint was the complexity of malaria infections inside and outside targeted hotspots. In the first post-intervention cross-sectional survey (at 8 wk), mean nPCR parasite prevalence was 9.2% in intervention hotspots (cluster range 5.1% [7/138] to 13.5% [17/126]) compared to 19.4% in control hotspots (cluster range 9.6% [12/125] to 33.3% [42/126]) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1001993.t003">Table 3</xref>; <italic>p =</italic> 0.024 after adjustment for baseline prevalence and covariates). However, malaria transmission inside targeted hotspots was not completely interrupted. Although not originally defined as a study endpoint, we determined parasite carriage in individuals who were repeatedly sampled during the study period and were parasite-free by nPCR before the intervention. Of 97 individuals who resided in intervention hotspots, were parasite negative prior to the intervention, and were coincidentally sampled during the first evaluation survey, four (4.1%) became parasite positive. These individuals (aged 4, 6, 10, and 34 y) did not report spending any nights outside their compound between surveys. Sixteen weeks post-intervention, at the end of the transmission season, there was no longer a statistically significant difference in nPCR parasite prevalence between intervention and control hotspots (<italic>p =</italic> 0.27). We observed no statistically significant trend in the effect of the intervention on nPCR parasite prevalence in the evaluation zone in relation to distance from the hotspot boundary 8 wk post-intervention (<italic>p =</italic> 0.27) or 16 wk post-intervention (<italic>p =</italic> 0.75). nPCR parasite prevalence was not statistically significantly associated with reported travel in the preceding 3 mo in the survey prior to the intervention (<italic>p =</italic> 0.30) or the surveys 8 wk (<italic>p =</italic> 0.24) and 16 wk (<italic>p =</italic> 0.58) after the intervention. Only one nPCR-positive individual reported traveling to an area that is considered to experience higher malaria transmission. MSP-2 typing and fragment sizing was successful in 97.2% (1,517/1,561) of nPCR-positive individuals coming from 421 compounds. We observed no statistically significant reductions in allelic richness or in the number of detected parasite clones inside malaria hotspots or in evaluation zones following the intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1001993.t003">Table 3</xref>).

Targeting these hotspots with a combination of four interventions, acting against the human parasitemic reservoir and vector populations, had no measureable impact on nPCR parasite prevalence in evaluation zones surrounding the hotspots and had only a short-lived effect on nPCR parasite prevalence within hotspots.</p><p>Hotspot-targeted interventions have been hypothesized to form a highly efficacious approach to reduce the burden of malaria in areas of heterogeneous malaria transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Operationally feasible approaches to detect stable hotspots form a prerequisite for targeted interventions. Our detailed community survey, conducted in preparation for the intervention, revealed a large number of serologically defined hotspots of malaria transmission. These serological hotspots, indicative of longer-term exposure [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], showed a strong association with current parasite carriage at both the individual and geographical level: malaria-antibody-positive individuals were significantly more likely to be parasite positive, and nPCR parasite prevalence decreased with distance from the center of serologically defined hotspots. This suggests temporal stability of spatially heterogeneous transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the suitability of targeting interventions at a fine spatial scale. We selected ten hotspots for a cluster-randomized trial on the impact of hotspot-targeted interventions with IRS, LLINs, weekly larviciding [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and focal MDA to minimize the parasite reservoir in humans at the start of the transmission season. Despite achieving high coverage with all interventions, we observed no measurable impact on our primary endpoint, the proportion of nPCR parasite-positive individuals in the evaluation zone surrounding targeted hotspots. nPCR parasite prevalence was only transiently reduced inside targeted hotspots, and there was no impact on the complexity of malaria infections inside or outside hotspots. Whilst heterogeneous malaria transmission may influence the acquisition of malaria immunity and clinical manifestations [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we hypothesized that our intervention would reduce not only the prevalence of asymptomatic infections but also the incidence of clinical malaria episodes in intervention compared to control clusters. PCD at health facilities identified 36 RDT-confirmed clinical malaria episodes in individuals who resided in intervention or control clusters, and no evidence that the intervention reduced the clinical burden of malaria. Our decision to monitor the incidence of malaria cases passively was based on the low efficiency of active monitoring of infections in low endemic settings [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], although we acknowledge that PCD leads to a considerable loss in power compared to active case detection [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As a consequence, our approach will have resulted in an unknown number of malaria episodes that were missed due to health care seeking behavior or other factors [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. It is also conceivable that we missed further malaria cases because health facility attendees failed to present with compound identification cards, although we would expect this bias to be non-differential between the control and intervention arms. These are shortcomings of our PCD system. As a result, we cannot exclude an impact of our interventions on the incidence of clinical malaria episodes but can conclude that parasitologically confirmed clinical malaria episodes were passively reported from both intervention and control clusters at a similar rate.</p><p>Our intervention failed to sustainably reduce malaria transmission inside targeted hotspots. Approximately 4% of individuals in intervention hotspots became parasite positive within 8 wk of the intervention. This infection incidence is remarkable considering the low level of transmission intensity in the area; the baseline nPCR parasite prevalence of 18.6%&#x02013;23.5% translates to an estimated microscopy parasite prevalence of 5.7%&#x02013;7.9% [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and indicates hypoendemic transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. There are several possible reasons for the apparent failure to completely eliminate malaria transmission inside hotspots and the undetectable impact in the evaluation zones surrounding targeted hotspots. First, it is possible that our interventions did not clear vector populations or prevent human&#x02013;vector contact inside hotspots to the extent that is required to interrupt local transmission. Insecticide resistance is a key consideration for any vector-based malaria intervention. Resistance to deltamethrin and permethrin has been detected in the study area for <italic>A</italic>. <italic>gambiae</italic> s.l. and <italic>A</italic>. <italic>funestus</italic> [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] but has not reached saturation, as observed in other African settings [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and there is currently no evidence that insecticide resistance affects control efforts in the region [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. We purposefully selected interventions that have potency in areas of insecticide resistance: LLINs that include piperonyl butoxide as a syngergist to enhance the efficacy of deltamethrin in resistant vectors [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and larviciding with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>thuringiensis</italic> var. <italic>israelensis</italic>, to which there is no reported vector resistance in the region [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and which is effective against both indoor- and outdoor-feeding mosquitoes. Activity against outdoor-feeding mosquitoes is of relevance because of increased outdoor biting rates following the scaling up of IRS and LLIN coverage [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and the presence of a previously unidentified malaria vector in the study area that exhibits a preference for outdoor biting [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite our intensive vector control efforts, we detected ongoing breeding site productivity and mosquito exposure in targeted hotspots. Second, there may have been residual transmission from parasite carriers who were unidentified and untargeted by our treatment campaign. Undetected low-density parasite carriage may have been responsible for sustained transmission following recent mass screening and treatment campaigns in Zanzibar [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. We estimate that our approach identified approximately 77% of all nPCR-positive individuals in the area [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether the untargeted fraction of infections, which are mostly of low parasite density, is sufficient to sustain transmission; however, infectiousness from low-density infections has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. A third potential explanation for the apparent failure to completely eliminate malaria transmission is the importation of parasites by individuals traveling to areas of higher endemicity such as the nearby Asembo Bay area [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. We failed to detect an association between reported travel and nPCR parasite prevalence during any of the surveys. Analysis of data from earlier surveys in this area indicates that most trips that involve an overnight stay occur within families or represent travel to urban areas where malaria risk is low [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In our surveys, only one nPCR-positive individual reported traveling to an area of known intense malaria transmission. A fourth possible explanation is the influx of infected mosquitoes from untargeted hotspots. We selected hotspots and evaluation zones for the intervention trial that were in relative isolation from neighboring hotspots, assuming that vector dispersion in a densely populated area would primarily occur over &#x0003c;1 km distances [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Importation of infected mosquitoes into the intervention hotspots is possible, most likely from areas that surrounded hotspots but were themselves not detected as transmission hotspots. The points above may all contribute to varying degrees and combine for the fifth possible explanation, which is that our hypothesis of how hotspots seed malaria transmission does not apply to the transmission dynamics in our study setting. Understanding host and mosquito movement in relation to fine-scale patterns of mixing parasite populations is of key importance for rationally deploying targeted interventions [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our findings suggest that transmission may not primarily occur from hotspots to the surrounding areas. Our hotspot definition encapsulated 34.7% of the total area and 44.4% of all inhabitants, but 32.5% (41/126) of all compounds with &#x02265;80% nPCR parasite prevalence were located outside statistically significant malaria hotspots. These high parasite prevalence compounds may have fueled transmission outside and into our serologically defined hotspots. The existence of isolated high parasite prevalence compounds has been described before [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and suggests that our hypoendemic study area has not yet reached the phase where parasite carriage is confined to malaria hotspots or primarily occurs from hotspots to surrounding areas.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. Our study was conducted in the presence of other ongoing interventions that may have made it difficult to attribute any specific, small changes in nPCR parasite prevalence to our intervention. The absence of detailed concurrent meteorological data makes it impossible to assess the impact of our interventions in terms of the exact timing of the local changes in rainfall and temperature that determine malaria transmission dynamics. Our trial included a total of ten clusters during a single season and was therefore not powered to detect subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions nor designed to detect effects of interventions that become apparent over multiple transmission seasons. Furthermore, we saw a higher than expected level of inter-cluster variation. Sample size calculations were based on an assumed coefficient of variation of 0.4. In fact, the baseline data indicate a coefficient of variation of 0.5, which would have also reduced the power of the trial to detect subtle effects of hotspot-targeted interventions. The limited number of clusters is a major limitation of the current study. Our sample size of five intervention and five control clusters was based on the assumption that our combination of four malaria interventions would (temporarily) eliminate malaria transmission inside targeted hotspots [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and would result in near elimination of malaria from the surrounding community. Neither hypothesis was confirmed. It is unclear to what extent the results from our trial can be extrapolated to other settings. Our study was conducted in a highland fringe setting with low and heterogeneous malaria transmission. Whilst this setting is markedly different from nearby lowland areas of intense malaria transmission, we believe our study setting is representative of many other East African settings with continuous habitation and low-intensity malaria transmission that is spatially heterogeneous as a consequence of large- and small-scale determinants of malaria transmission [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Our observation that individual compounds with high levels of asymptomatic parasite carriage exist within areas where parasite carriage is generally much lower has also been reported in coastal Kenya [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We consider the existence of such single-compound hotspots an important hurdle for hotspot-targeted interventions since these compounds are logistically very challenging to identify and may require very intensive community surveys. In coastal Kenya, hotspots that are unstable in space and time [<xref rid="pmed.1001993.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] may further affect the operational attractiveness of hotspot-targeted interventions.</p><sec id="sec035"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Approximately one-third of our study area fell within identified hotspots of malaria transmission. Hotspot targeting of interventions failed to influence malaria transmission dynamics outside the targeted area and resulted in a modest and transient reduction in nPCR parasite prevalence inside targeted hotspots. Whilst our study may have been underpowered to detect subtle effects on malaria transmission, we consider it unlikely that hotspot-targeted interventions are cost-effective in our setting. The considerable resources required for hotspot detection at the local scale are unlikely to be offset by savings from a more rational deployment of interventions in the study area. As a result, areas like our study site in Rachuonyo South District, with highly heterogeneous but widespread malaria transmission, may currently benefit most from an untargeted community-wide approach that reaches all malaria-infected and malaria-exposed individuals. The hotspot-targeted approach may have validity and should be tested further in settings where human settlement is more nuclear.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1001993.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Parasite prevalence before and after hotspot-targeted interventions in Rachuonyo South District in March&#x02013;August 2012.</title><p>nPCR prevalence (percent) in hotspots selected for the cluster-randomized trial, measured in July 2011 (community survey for hotspot detection), pre-intervention in March&#x02013;April 2012 and post-intervention June&#x02013;July 2012 and August&#x02013;September 2012.
