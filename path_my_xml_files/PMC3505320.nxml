Therefore, proteins in the myelin of the CNS are likely candidates to be involved in the pathogenic self- response.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is one of a few autoantigens on the surface of the myelin sheath that is readily available to autoreactive T-cells and because MOG is the only protein that is expressed in CNS, the response of T-cells likely plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Additionally, vitamin A plays an important role in the immune system and retinoids have been identified as having many functions that regulate immune responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Retinoids, metabolites of vitamin A and ligands of its steroid receptor superfamily are useful in the treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is an animal model of MS and occurs by immunization with myelin antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP), proteolipid protein (PLP) or MOG.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The studies that were conducted on retinoic acid (RA) make the assumption that vitamin A may perform a direct immune function through its effect on mitogenic adjustment signals in T-cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Retinyl palmitate is a retinol ester that can be converted to RA in the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] According to the positive impact of vitamin A on the immune system as well as on EAE, the animal model, and as a high level of RA is potentially toxic, this study aimed to examine the potential of vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) supplement to reduce a mitogenic response of MOG as an autoantigen in patients with MS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty six relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients consented to participate in this survey (written consent was obtained from all of them); they were under the guidance of two neurologists, (one subject withdrew for personal reasons in mid-project, so 35 people remained until the end of the study). The Ethics Committee of Tehran University of Medical Sciences approved the study. All patients used Interferon beta-1a (Avonex) as treatment. This study was a randomized double blind clinical trial with vitamin A (as retinyl palmitate) and placebo. A general questionnaire was provided for each patient that set out an explanation of the essential information about vitamin A supplementation. The supplements were taken for a period of 6 months as 25,000 IU retinyl palmitate (Zahravi, Tabriz, Iran) per day, to this way that they had been given either vitamin A or placebo for 3 months and after this period, their liver function and clinical signs were checked and either vitamin A or placebo was given to them for a further 3 months if no problems were diagnosed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample blood collection</title><p>Blood samples were collected from the subjects in sterile tubes with Heparin as the anticoagulant. 1 ml of blood samples were saved in a sterile microtube without any anticoagulant for serum blood isolation. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated on Ficoll-Histoprep gradients (BAG Health Care GmbH, Germany). Cells were counted and diluted to 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per ml culture medium (RPMI 1640; PAA laboratories GmbH, Austria). 500 &#x003bc;l of this cell dilution was separated and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Gibco, Invitrogen, UK) was added to the remaining cells. 75,000 PBMC were cultured in 96-well flat-bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, Denmark) in the presence of 5 &#x003bc;l/ml MOG [(35-55) human; Anaspec, USA]. 75,000 PBMCs from diluted cells without FCS were cultured in the presence of MOG as above and then 10 &#x003bc;l of serum from coagulated blood was added to these cells. 75,000 cells were left stimulated with 5 &#x003bc;l/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA; Sigma, USA) and untreated. Cells were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator for 96 h. After this period, a cell proliferation ELISA BrdU kit (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany) was used for cell proliferation assessment. Briefly BrdU was added to each well and incubated for 4 h in the same incubator. After this period, the next stages were performed according to company protocol.
