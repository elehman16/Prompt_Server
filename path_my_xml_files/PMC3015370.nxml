Thirteen subjects were enrolled after providing institutional review board approved consent. Demographic data is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref></bold> and indicates a similar makeup between the two groups. All were treated with leuprolide acetate (TAP Pharmaceuticals, Deerfield, IL) 3.75 mg intramuscularly for six months. Subjects were randomly assigned into treatment or placebo groups by the hospital's investigational drug service, and all medications were prescribed through this department. Time period one was considered to be pretherapy visits. GnRH agonist therapy was initiated on cycle day 1 to 3. Months 1, 2 and 3 were considered to be time period two, and all patients received leuprolide with no supplement. During time period three, months 4, 5 and 6 of leuprolide therapy, patients received the study medication: oral estradiol 1 mg daily (Estrace, MeadJohnson Laboratories, Princeton, NJ) or an identical-appearing placebo to be taken daily. All subjects agreed to use barrier contraception throughout the study.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Demographic Profile</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Estrogen</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.3 (+/&#x02212; 5.0)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.4 (+/&#x02212; 5.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (pounds)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156 (+/&#x02212; 41)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163 (+/&#x02212; 34)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (inches)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64 (+/&#x02212; 4)</td><td align="char" char="(" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66 (+/&#x02212; 3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smoker</td><td align="char" char="/" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/7</td><td align="char" char="/" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prior pregnancy</td><td align="char" char="/" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7/7</td><td align="char" char="/" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Daily pain and medication diaries including dysmenorrhea, headaches and hot flush scores were kept by the patient. Patients were seen for clinic visits prior to initiating therapy, then every four weeks until the completion of therapy. Dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, dyspareunia, hot flushes and headaches were assessed by verbal questioning of the patient at each visit. Pelvic induration and pelvic tenderness were scored by physical examination at each visit and three months following therapy. Pelvic tenderness, induration, headaches, and hot flushes were given a score of 0-3, with 0 = no symptoms, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe symptoms. Pelvic pain, dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea were given a score of 0-10 on a linear scale, with 0 indicating no symptoms and 10 representing the most severe symptoms. Estradiol levels were obtained at months 4, 5 and 6.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for the study included a history of prior GnRH agonist therapy, history of an emotional disorder, pregnancy or lactation. Further exclusions were osteoporosis, known or suspected breast cancer, present or past endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma, a history of thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, or thromboembolism and undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding. Usage of oral contraceptives or other treatment outside the protocol was not permitted.</p><p>The serum estradiol level was measured at visits 4, 5 and 6 by the COAT-A-Count&#x000ae; (Diagnostic Products Corporation, Los Angeles, CA) alternate &#x0201c;IVF&#x0201d; procedure, intra-assay CV &#x0003c;5.6%, interassay CV &#x0003c;5.5%.</p><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>For the purpose of analysis, the monthly visits were described as weeks (ie, pre-therapy visit is represented by week -4, baseline is represented by week 0, and month 1 of treatment is represented by week 4). All analyses were conducted using SAS/STAT Software, version 6.11.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> The demographic parameters were compared using an independent samples t-test for each continuous variable and a Fisher's exact test for comparisons of proportions. Means at each time point for each treatment group were estimated for each dependent variable. Longitudinal mixed effects analyses were applied to the four continuous dependent variables of pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and estradiol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> According to a mixed effects model, regression lines were fit through each of the period two data and the period three data for the placebo group and the oral estradiol group separately. Hypothesis tests were used to determine whether slopes differed significantly from zero, and contrasts were used to test whether the period three oral estradiol slope was significantly different from the period three placebo group slope.</p><p>A generalized estimating equation approach for analyzing repeated ordinal and categorical values was applied to the four ordinal variables of hot flushes, pelvic tenderness, headache and induration. Because of problems with available software, this approach was found to be limited. Instead, logistic regression analysis with the assumption of independence was used to analyze the ordinal variables.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Seven women were randomized to oral estradiol and six to placebo.

For the placebo group, the dysmenorrhea scores decreased at a slower rate during period three than in period two. For the oral estradiol group, the dysmenorrhea score increased during period two and decreased during period three.

This result indicates the oral estradiol add-back is likely causing an increase in endometriosis-related symptoms in the oral estradiol group. Because some subjects tended to experience increased pain, the blind was broken, and the data was analyzed after these first 13 patients had completed the study. Subsequently, the study was terminated and no further patients were enrolled. No adjustments were made to significance levels of hypothesis tests since this study was stopped due to safety concerns.</p><p>The GnRH agonist side effects were evaluated. As expected, hot flush and headache mean scores during time period three are usually lower for the estradiol group than for the placebo group, although these differences were not statistically significant. This trend toward fewer hypoestrogenic side effects with estrogen indicates that the estradiol add-back appears to be effective in reducing the GnRH agonist related hot flushes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The trend toward increased pain with low-dose estrogen therapy is surprising. Estrogen replacement therapy after menopause reduces menopausal symptoms and lowers the risk of osteoporosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> Estrogen replacement therapy has been successfully used for patients with endometriosis after hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Recurrent endometriosis-related symptoms are uncommon when estrogen replacement therapy is initiated after surgery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Approximately 90% of patients will tolerate estrogen replacement therapy in this situation without recurrent pain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup> In this study, we hoped that we could achieve suppression of endometriosis by three months of therapy, without recurrence of pain when estrogen was eventually added back at low levels.</p><p>The study was terminated after the first 13 subjects due to the concerning trend toward recurrent symptoms in women who received oral estradiol during leuprolide acetate therapy for endometriosis related pain. As a result, a statistically significant difference could not be found between the placebo group and the treatment group during time period three when pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, induration, hot flushes and headaches were compared. Although the progression of symptoms suggesting deterioration with oral estrogen cannot be supported by statistical significance, this study was designed as an exploratory study.</p><p>The lack of a statistically significant difference in this study should be interpreted with caution. Given the small sample size, the ability to find significant differences between the estradiol group and the placebo group is low. The power to find a significant difference with the observed differences between the slopes of the placebo group and the estradiol group in this study ranges from 0.03 for hot flushes to 0.27 for induration. Since an acceptable power is generally 0.80, a larger sample size should demonstrate a difference, if there is one. Our intention in this study was to reduce hypoestrogenic symptoms with estrogen without compromising efficacy of GnRH agonist therapy. Clearly, this study did not meet this goal, since pain tended to increase with estrogen. However, an expanded study to prove that estrogen treatment is harmful would be unethical.</p><p>Delaying the start of estrogen replacement therapy did not appear to be beneficial in our study. The delay was incorporated in the protocol to allow for regression of endometriosis and pain before adding estrogen. Effective relief of endometriosis-related pain occurs by the third month of GnRH agonist therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> In theory, estrogen could be added after the maximal benefit had been achieved in order to minimize the hypoestrogenic side effects and could be continued for a prolonged interval. However, delayed add-back of progestin was not found to be advantageous in one study.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> Based upon the observations in our study, it is doubtful that the immediate addition of estrogen would have resulted in a more acceptable regimen.</p><p>Since endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent condition, physicians have been reluctant to prescribe even low-dose estrogen for patients during GnRH agonist therapy for endometriosis. Recent studies have confirmed the safety of combined estrogen plus progestin add-back during GnRH agonist therapy for endometriosis. However, based upon the results of our study, estrogen add-back therapy without progestin cannot be advised.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
