Based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorder (ICSD)-3 of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, insomnia is present when one or more of the following persistent symptoms are seen: difficulty initiating sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep and early-morning awakening with inability to return to sleep.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Chronic insomnia disorder refers to these symptoms that cause clinically significant functional distress or impairment on at least three nights a week for at least 3&#x02005;months, excluding other sleep, medical or mental disorders.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Insomnia is highly prevalent in the general population and commonly encountered in medical practices. Prevalence estimates of insomnia disorder range from 12% to 20% in the adult population, with approximately 50% having a chronic course.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The latest guideline from the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that cognitive and behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) should be the initial treatment for chronic insomnia disorder in all patients.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> If CBT-I alone is unsuccessful, the ACP advises that clinicians discuss with patients whether to combine it with pharmacological therapy, including benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, the hypnotic agents have a range of undesirable side effects, such as memory and performance impairment, residual sedation, undesired behaviours during sleep, falls, somatic symptoms and drug interactions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, an increasing number of patients with insomnia resort to various kinds of complementary and/or alternative medicine (CAM) worldwide, including acupuncture, meditation, massage and Chinese herbal medicine.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine, a form of CAM, has been widely used to treat insomnia in China for a 1000 years.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Nowadays, it is still commonly being used for the patients with insomnia disorder in China and elsewhere around the world.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Suanzaoren decoction (SZRD) also has a long history of use as a classic herbal prescription for combating insomnia and was first documented in the classical Chinese text <italic>Jingui Yaolue</italic> (<italic>Synopsis of Prescriptions of the Golden Chamber</italic>) by Zhong-Jing Zhang (AD 152&#x02013;219).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It is composed of five kinds of Chinese herbal medicines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016014280TB1">table 1</xref>): Suanzaoren (<italic>Semen ziziphi spinosae,</italic> seed of wild jujube), Fuling (<italic>Poria,</italic> Hoelen), Chuanxiong (<italic>Ligusticum,</italic> Chuanxiong Rhizoma), Zhimu (<italic>Anemarrhena aspodeloidea,</italic> Anemarrhena) and Gancao (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra L.,</italic> Radix Glycyrrhizae), all of which are recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia (V.2015).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016014280TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Overview of Suanzaoren decoction</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chinese name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Common name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Latin name</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Species/family</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amount (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Suanzaoren</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spine date seed</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Semen ziziphi spinosae</italic></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The dried ripe seeds of Ziziphus jujuba Mill. var. spinosa (Bunge) Hu ex H.

The study will be conducted in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, a teaching hospital in China. Patients with sleep dissatisfaction undergo a standardised baseline evaluation before treatment comprising detailed history taking, physical examination and laboratory testing. The scale will be assessed by a professional psychological evaluator. The hospital clinical laboratory and the sleep monitoring room are responsible for biochemical and sleep quality indicator detection, respectively. All included patients are randomly divided into three groups; every patient will receive CBT-I as an initial therapy. Additionally, three groups are designed to receive SZRD granule plus zolpidem tartrate (ZT) placebo, ZT tablet plus SZRD granule placebo or both of the two placebo treatments, respectively. The efficacy and safety of the SZRD granule is assessed after 5-weeks&#x02019; treatment and at 20-weeks&#x02019; follow-up after drug withdrawal. The trial is conducted in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and China's regulations and guidelines on good clinical practice. Ethical clearance for the trial was obtained from the ethics committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. After a full explanation by the clinicians, written informed consent will be obtained from the included subjects before intervention. The trial was registered at the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-16009198) on 13 September 2016 and will be carried out from January 2017 to December 2017.

Participants may withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Concomitant treatments and forbidden drugs</title><p>Treatment must not be combined with other sleep medications in the study. Acupuncture therapy, psychotherapy and any drugs and diet such as psychopharmacological drugs, opioids, anxiolytic agents, coffee and alcohol, which may induce sedative or hypnotic effects, are also not allowed in this trial. Patients who have already taken medicine that does not act upon the central nervous system before the trial can be included. Nevertheless, all combined administration should be recorded on the case report form.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>The randomisation will be performed by an independent statistician. The randomisation sequence is generated by the use of SAS software and randomisation numbers are kept in a predetermined computer-made opaque sealed envelope. The random numbers are divided into three groups sequentially; the group numbers are printed inside the envelopes. The sealed opaque envelopes are properly preserved by the designer and the statistician until the end of the trial. All envelopes will be numbered consecutively and connected.

The evaluation of participants and analysis of results will be performed by professionals. Treatment assignments will not be revealed until the whole process is complete. If patients have severe adverse events, clinicians will unblind the patients as an emergency and provide relevant treatment. To achieve blinding, all three groups will use the same kind of packaging to encase the drug or placebo. Size, colour, shape, taste, smell and packaging of the placebo are made identical to that of the corresponding medicine by adding artificial pigment.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Intervention</title><p>All researchers are clinical doctors with certification in neurology for at least 3&#x02005;years and receive standardised training for the diagnostic interview before the start of the trial. Two clinicians make the diagnosis of chronic insomnia disorder. Participants in the intervention group will receive SZRD granule plus ZT placebo orally twice a day for 5&#x02005;weeks. Participants in the control group will take ZT tablet plus SZRD granule placebo twice a day for 5&#x02005;weeks. Participants in the placebo group are about to receive ZT placebo and SZRD granule placebo twice a day for 5&#x02005;weeks. Patient visits are required as often as once a week. The SZRD granule placebo is composed of 98% maltodextrin, 2% caramel and very little bitterant. ZT placebo is made of starch. SZRD granule and its placebo are produced by China Resources Sanjiu Medical &#x00026; Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd and can be preserved for 2&#x02005;years. ZT tablet is provided by Senofi (Hangzhou) Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd at a dosage of 10&#x02005;mg. The SZRD granule placebo and ZT placebo are similar to the SZRD granule and ZT in size, colour, shape, taste, smell and packaging, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Follow-up</title><p>All included patients will be re-evaluated at 4-, 8-, 12-, 16- and 20-week follow-ups through phone calls or as an outpatient.

This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SZRD in comparison with ZT or placebo. To facilitate high validity and reliability, a strict quality control and high-quality methodology is indispensable. We describe in detail the method of allocation concealment, recruitment, randomisation and data collection. Additionally, objective sleep measurement, such as PSG, is used to assess insomnia remission. Currently, the ACP recommends that patients with insomnia should receive CBT-I as first-line therapy. Thus, we provide every patient with CBT-I at the start and include only those subjects who are insensitive to CBT-I alone. The results from this trial may provide evidence on the effectiveness and safety of SZRD.</p><p>Our study has some limitations and strengths. One weakness is the participant self-rating scales, which might exaggerate the severity of sleep disorder. Another limitation is that the trial is implemented in only one hospital. Notwithstanding these limitations, the results from this study will provide new evidence about SZRD from a well-designed trial.
