with computer simulation, associated with the laboratory simulation in a blended course
on clinical evaluation of preterm infant.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The objectives of this study were: to evaluate the cognitive learning of nursing
students regarding neonatal clinical assessment from a blended course using computer and
laboratory simulation; to compare the cognitive learning of the students in the control
and experimental group when testing the laboratory simulation; and to evaluate the
extracurricular blended courses offered on clinical assessment of preterm infants,
according to students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental research study with 14 Portuguese students whose
intervention was composed of the stages of the <italic>Clinical assessment of preterm
infant</italic> course, which included an active pedagogical strategy, understood in
this study as educational activities in which the student is encouraged to be an active
member in the teaching-learning process, by means of challenges and questions.</p><p>Interactive tools were used, such as the s<italic>erious game e-baby</italic>
<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> (which virtually simulates the clinical assessment of a preterm infant with
respiratory problems maintained in the incubator), instructional
<italic>software</italic> semiology and semiotechnique of the preterm newborn
(SSRNPT)<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>, and laboratory simulation.</p><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>The blended course was offered in an extracurricular certificate program, by the
School of Nursing of Coimbra (ESEnfC), Portugal. It was available in the Moodle
virtual learning environment, with total time of 30 hours (15 days), administered in
the steps of pre-test, midterm test, and post-test of knowledge.</p><p>Student knowledge (pre-test) was verified on the first day of the course and the
inaugural class attendance on prematurity and the importance of clinical assessment
for caring for this customer. After class attendance, other planned activities for
the week were developed, aiming to facilitate the recognition of the
<italic>e-Baby</italic> and SSRNPT digital technologies.</p><p>A second physical meeting occurred after the presentation of digital tools to the
students, at the end of the first week of the course, at which point the midterm test
and simulation laboratory were performed, focused on the nursing care for a premature
infant with a health impairment requiring oxygenation.</p><p>For analysis of the laboratory simulation as intervention research, and so that the
proposed methodological model could be used, all students in the sample (n=14)
separately participated in this laboratory activity, considering the aim of this
study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), immediately before the midterm
test (experimental group n=7/50%) and after the midterm test (control group n
=7/50%).</p><p>Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> represents the study flowchart
for a better understanding of the method applied and the chronology of the study
procedures.</p><p>

</p><p>The second week of the course, after the laboratory simulation, was intended for the
use of online digital technologies and a theme-related discussion, by means of
<italic>Moodle</italic> activities: discussion forum, chat and e-mail. The last
physical meeting occurred in the 15th day of course. In that meeting, the post-test
for final evaluation of student learning, course evaluation and certification of
participants by the educational institution were conducted.</p><p>Three online tools available on Moodle was used, one for characterization of the
subject, one for the tests of cognitive learning (pre-test, midterm, and post-test)
and one for the course evaluation.</p><p>The characterization included issues related to personal data, such as sex and age,
as well as to identify the technologies used routinely by the students.</p><p>The learning performance was evaluated by means of a questionnaire composed of 20
objective questions, exclusively designed for this study (with multimedia), used for
all the tests, but in a randomized order of appearance of the questions and its
alternatives, ensuring the same level of difficulty. The questions were designed to
measure cognitive learning (conceptual knowledge hierarchically organized according
to the degree of abstraction and generalization, which were related to each other)

100. The desirable score was greater than or equal to 70.</p><p>Performance, established as the difference between scores achieved by students in a
subsequent test and a previous test, the, difference between the post-test and
pretest scores, and from the midterm test and the pre-test score <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>.</p><p>The instrument for the course evaluation by students was composed of 23 items using a
Likert scale, which used the scoring of: "insufficient", "sufficient", "good", "very
good" and "excellent." A free text space was included for expressions of their
opinions on the course, enhancing or adding information regarding the instrument
items. This instrument was developed for this course and included important aspects
for the teachers to identify strengths and opportunities for improvement, according
to the empirical experience of researchers, as well as teachers.</p><p>The items present in the instrument included the satisfaction and motivation of
students for the course, the practical activity in the simulation center, the access
to digital technologies, and the implementation of a forum and chat in the virtual
environment. In addition, the items investigated the relevance of all the activities
and teaching tools that supported the course, in the same way as the general
evaluation for organization and relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis </title><p>The general description of the data relating to the characterization of the students
was presented by use of descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median and
semi-quartile range).</p><p>The statistical analysis tests were performed using the <italic>Statistical Package
for the Social Sciences</italic> (SPSS), non-parametric analysis method, according
the nature of the main variable of interest which was poorly understood, and the
limited sample size.</p><p>The intra-group comparison was performed using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test,
while the comparison between control and experimental group was analyzed using the
Mann-Whitney test, both of which considered a significance level of p &#x0003c; 0.05 and
95% of confidence interval.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>This study was submitted to the Ethics Committee of the Research Unit in Health
Sciences - Nursing, of the Nursing School of Coimbra, and approved under the protocol
No 73-02/2012. The rights provided in the <italic>informed consent forms</italic>
(ICF) were explained by the researcher, exempting the volunteer of any benefit or
harm, according to the recommendations and standards of Good Clinical Practice.
Because of the relationship of authority, the institution's teachers linked to the
participants were not included in the invitation and presentation of the ICF, which
was conducted by a non-teaching researcher of ESEnfC.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of the participants</title><p>Among the 14 (100%) students who participated in the study, 12 (85.7%) were women
between 21 and 29 years of age (five of them with 21 years, another five with 22,
three with 23, and one student with 29 years). None of the participants in this study
reported working, but rather were exclusively dedicated to their academic pursuits.
All of them owned a computer and had internet access. Regarding the frequency of
computer use, 11 (78.6%) stated a frequent use, while others reported a regular use
and, in relation to the principal place of computer access, nine (64.3%) reported at
home, four (28.6%) at the university, and one (7.1%) at the home of relatives and
friends. All (100%) reported having a computer and, 30% had a laptop (notebook) and
70% a desktop; all connected to the internet (100%).</p><p>All the students reported have already used the internet to support the activities of
their university courses, and pointed as the main objectives of the network the
sending and receiving of e-mails and conducting research (both reported for n =
8/57.2%), participation in social networks and leisure (both reported for n =
4/28.6%).</p><p>Among the participants, 12 (85.7%) never used educational technologies and two
(14.3%) had used them previously. Half of our sample (n=7/50%) accessed internet
games, citing those developed in Flash<sup>(r)</sup>, Facebook<sup>(r)</sup> games,
Puzzle Bubble<sup>(r)</sup> with strategy of nature, reasoning, and other assorted
entertainment.</p><p>All students (n = 14/100%) reported that this was their first participation in a
course supported by educational technologies, but all of them had already
participated in a simulation laboratory previously.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive learning before and after the course</title><p>Data regarding scores obtained at the different periods of evaluation, according to

</p><p>A statistically significant difference (p=0.001) in the rate of correct answers on
the issue addressed in the course was verified, regarding the cognitive learning of
the students obtained by comparing the post-test and pre-test scores. This result
refers to the whole sample, without division into groups; that is, this result
indicates that, regardless of division of the groups, the learning in the subject
improved significantly for all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive learning before and after the laboratory simulation (midterm)</title><p>Comparing scores obtained on the midterm test with the pre-test, no statistical
significance was identified in the performance analysis of either group, expressed by
a p-value (0.058 for the experimental and 0.062 for control) using the Wilcoxon test.
During the course, specifically in the midterm testing phase, no statistically
significant difference was demonstrated in the student learning of either groups. A
statistical difference was identified only at the end of the course, as previously
shown.</p><p>No statistically significant difference (p=0.845) in performance was obtained from
the beginning until the midterm test, and p= 0.846 in the performance achieved from
the beginning to the end of the course was identified by the Mann-Whitney test, when
comparing the performance between the control and experimental groups. These data
reveal that students from both groups had similar outcomes in results when comparing
experimental versus control.</p></sec><sec><title>Opinion of the students on the course </title><p>Among the 14 participants, only one student did not respond to course evaluation
instrument, alleging forgetfulness. The results were mostly positive, ranging between
"very good" and "excellent" in all the variables evaluated. There was a negative
assessment characterized by "insufficient" only in the item: " time reserved for
simulation laboratory practice" by three students, - corresponding to 21.5% of the
study sample.</p><p>In the space designed for the considerations, such as suggestions and criticisms,
some comments emerged and are presented in three categories: laboratory simulation,
educational technology, and the course in general. These comments were submitted by
eight participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory simulation </title><p>

simulation associated with other teaching strategies,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> and that the digital technology is a valuable resource in the acquisition of
information. However, its use alone may not be reflected in the acquisition of
knowledge<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. This information is supported by the results of this study, in which a course
based on active learning methodology and associated tools was offered (digital material,
virtual learning environment including chats and forums, laboratory and virtual
simulation). </p><p>All educational intervention results improved learning, however, the relevance of the
improvement verified by this study, based on the value of p=0.001 must be noted, despite
the limitation of the sample size. A considerable improvement was identified, when
analyzing the measures of central tendency, showing an increase of the mean score
achieved by about 80% of the students (mean in the pre-test of 53.9 points and post-test
of 90.3).</p><p>The goals of nursing higher education institutions are that the student can interpret
and execute challenges, and search for creative solutions based on scientific theory.
The decision making process must be developed by means of reflection about the problem
to be solved and the use of critical thinking, associating the practice with theory.
Researchers reinforce the need for critical analysis of the results of nurses'
education, comparing this process with "praxis", in the context of the working process
and the quality demands of the health system <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The improvement of the processes that includes the complex task of teaching and learning
is the target of investigations throughout human history, studied since antiquity<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Increasingly, the teaching-learning process has been emphasized in the
healthcare, due to the need to develop more creative professionals, engaged in
problem-solving and guided by scientific evidence and ethics.</p><p>Studies attribute positive and successful characteristics to different strategies and
tools used in this research, including: laboratory simulation, such as stimulating
critical thinking<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>, virtual simulation as motivating and interactive with great potential as a
pedagogical approach<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>, chats and forums as tools for online communication and collaboration<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The results showed that the laboratory simulation, when analyzed as an isolated
intervention, did not represent a significant difference between the control and
experimental groups. However, at the end of the course, and after the several
activities, the students from both groups achieved a significant improvement in learning
without difference in their performance. The association of different educational tools
is advantageous and they should not be used singly<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. In addition, one should make use of innovative and creative strategies for the
teaching-learning process, according to some researchers who evaluated the relevance of
teaching technologies articulated to active learning methods<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>A study<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>, conducted with 54 nursing students, analyzed clinical reasoning performance,
comparing simulation by computer <italic>versus</italic> laboratory in simulation, in
the active context of teaching-learning. It concluded that one strategy was not
highlighted in relation to the other. This study provides a theoretical basis about the
impact on learning, in which the laboratory simulation was not better than the other
strategies used.</p><p>With regard to the participants' statements, the request for extension and expansion of
educational opportunities and tools employed is frequent, corroborating the data
obtained by means of the evaluation of satisfaction with the course. The enthusiasm of
the participants with the simulations (laboratory and virtual) - emphasized in the
statements - is fundamental because it is related to motivation and interest in the
educational process. Therefore, studies that incorporate innovative tools very often
assess user satisfaction as a way to measure positive or negative response, as evidenced
by an integrative literature review <sup>(</sup>

</xref>.</p><p>Despite satisfaction not necessarily being reflected in a good clinical performance<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>, it is a good indicator of quality education, as it is related to motivation and
interest of students in learning, in addition to the versatility in simulating the

of students when integrated into the game in the educational context is perceived.
Analyzing the positive impact of this strategy, the importance of promoting new
challenges and introducing new teaching tools can be highlighted. </p><p>The emotional design inculcated in the game development process may have reflected
directly on the motivation to play E-Baby. Emotional design is an aspect of unique
importance in the development of educational materials in the digital environment and in
education; it consists of the search for alignment between the user's desire for using
the educational tools and the feeling that you are emotionally integrated with them,
translated in motivation and improvement of learning outcomes <sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>It is important that the teacher, when selecting the teaching tools that contribute to
the teaching practice, recognizes their potentials and weaknesses, and understand their
mechanisms, knowing how to use them. In other words, the teacher must identify the best
way to use these tools in the activities offered to students.</p><p>The use of educational technologies has increased in recent years, and this is due to
both the advancement of devices and programming languages, as well as to the preference
of students and teachers. Especially, there is an interest among university students,
called "digital natives", who have very different learning needs in relation to previous
generations. Some researchers advocate that today's young people learn more easily when
in contact with technology, with group tasks based on experiences and problems, and with
collaborative and interactive learning <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>However, it is necessary to evaluate the developed educational tools, so that the
cost-benefit question with each innovation can be analyzed, with basis on their impact
and service to the development proposal. In addition to the validations of computer-user
interface and scientific content, there is the evaluation by the target population for
evaluation of satisfaction as to the results obtained with its use <sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The teaching tools must be evaluated and improved by students and teachers, who are the
end users. Thus, their use in education can be significant, again. The results presented
in this study reflect the Portuguese students' satisfaction with the course, from its
organization and composition through to the execution. We further suggest that the
evaluation process of nursing courses is encouraged, includes self-evaluation, teacher
evaluation by the students, and formative evaluation, just as was used by the
researchers<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>, when analyzing and discussing the education of health professionals with a
focus on problematization . Formative evaluation, among these, is a current challenge
whose objective is monitoring the students' performance throughout the courses and not
just at the end, allowing the educational reinforcement of the identified
weaknesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>According to the results, the cognitive learning of participants increased significantly
from the beginning until the end of the extracurricular course, with gradual increase in
scores on the tests (pre-test, midterm test and post-test). We believe that the teaching
tools used as a support for physical classes and online activities had a satisfactory
impact on the results.</p><p>On the other hand, the laboratory simulation, when analyzed alone, did not significantly
impact the students' test scores, which highlights the importance of the association of
tools and strategies in nursing higher education.</p><p>Considering the evaluation of the simulations (virtual and laboratory), the students
showed great satisfaction with participating and practicing in a safe and simulated
fashion, in terms of decision making grounded in a situation that is common in a
hospital neonatal unit scenario.</p><p> The positive course evaluation indicates students' motivation and interest in learning,
although the course was conducted during the vacation period of a Portuguese nursing
school. <italic>A priori</italic>, the course completion in this period generated some
anxiety, given the risk of students not to engage in the activities, but the results
were much better than expected. There was an intense participation in the discussion and
chat forums in the virtual environment, and access to digital technologies that could be
used over the two weeks at any time and as the student wanted.</p><p>The small sample size is recognized as a limitation of the study, nonetheless it was
possible to perform the statistical analysis with nonparametric tests. Further studies
should be conducted investigating the impact on learning, with larger samples and
technological innovation opportunities for education.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>To the School of Nursing of Coimbra (ESEnfC) in Portugal, and the School of Nursing of
