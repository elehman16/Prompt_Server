Patients were randomized, 1:1, into one of 2 study groups: those treated with trabeculectomy with MMC (0.04%) and a single-dose ScB (1.25 mg/0.05 mL) injection (the MMC+ScB group) at the end of the operation; and those treated with trabeculectomy with MMC and receiving placebo, balanced salt solution (BSS) subconjunctival injections (the MMC group). The allocation was performed using a sealed envelope system. Patients, operating physician (W.K.), and outcome assessors (L.O., K.K.) were masked to the treatment allocation during the operation, the follow-up assessment, and the bleb appearance analyses (by W.K.).</p></sec><sec><title>Surgical Technique</title><p>All surgeries were performed under local anesthesia, using the same technique, by a single surgeon (W.K.). An 8-0 nylon corneal traction suture was used. A fornix-based conjunctiva was dissected at the superonasal quadrant after injection of 1 mL of 2% lidocaine with epinephrine. Hemostasis was done meticulously, using a 15-degree knife to delineate and a crescent knife to dissect and create a half-thickness, 4&#x000d7;5 mm, rectangular-shaped scleral flap. In all eyes, 3 pieces of MMC 0.04% (0.4 mg/mL) (Kyowa Hokko Kirin Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) soaked Weck-Cel sponges (Inami Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) were applied in the Tenon&#x02019;s capsule pocket, and under the sclera flap, for 3 minutes. The sponges were then removed and the surgical area was rinsed with 30 mL BSS. Two diagonal scleral flap sutures were preplaced, using 10-0 nylon. A corneal paracentesis was made using the 15-degree knife. No viscoelastic was injected into the anterior chamber. Sclerectomy was performed with a Kelly-Descemet&#x02019;s punch, and peripheral iridectomy was performed with a Vannas scissors (Katena Products Inc., NJ). The scleral flap was approximated with 3 interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. The conjunctiva was closed with 2 interrupted 10-0 nylon wing sutures.</p><p>The trabeculectomy with MMC was performed in the same manner in both the groups. In the MMC+ScB group, at the end of the operation, 1.25 mg/0.05 mL of bevacizumab was injected subconjunctivally, over the scleral flap area, with a 30-G needle. The needle entrance was at least 8 mm away from the bleb to prevent any needle track leakage. In the MMC group, 0.05 mL of BSS was injected, using the same procedure. Postoperative treatment included topical antibiotic eyedrops (4 times daily, for 1 wk), topical 1% prednisolone acetate (every 2 h, for 2 wk, then decreased, over 6 to 8 wk). Antiglaucoma medications were discontinued on the day of surgery. After surgery, ocular massage, laser suture lysis (LSL), antiglaucoma medications, and postoperative procedures such as needling were permitted if necessary, depending on the target IOP, and based on the physician&#x02019;s discretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up Evaluations and Outcome Measures</title><p>Follow-up visits were scheduled on day 1; at weeks 1 and 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, and 12 postoperatively. The primary outcome measure was the IOP. Secondary outcome measures included BCVA, bleb appearance, numbers of antiglaucoma medications used, postoperative interventions and complications, and proportion of eyes achieving successful outcomes at the 12-month follow-up. Two measurements of IOP were taken and averaged to determine the mean IOP. Bleb photographs were obtained at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. The bleb appearances were graded by a masked investigator (W.K.), as per the Indiana Bleb Appearance System (IBAS), which is based on bleb height, extent, vascularity, and Seidel test results (H0-3, E0-3, V0-4, S0-2).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>A treatment success criterion was defined as the following: (1) an IOP&#x02264;target IOP (21 or 14 mm Hg) if preoperative IOP&#x0003e;21 mm Hg; or (2) IOP&#x02265;20% reduction from baseline if preoperative IOP&#x02264;21 mm Hg. Success was defined as &#x0201c;complete&#x0201d; when these criteria were achieved without any glaucoma medications and as &#x0201c;qualified&#x0201d; with or without medication. Failure of the treatment was defined as IOP&#x0003c;6 mm Hg or IOP&#x0003e;target IOP despite medication, or needing MMC, or further glaucoma surgery, or as a loss of light perception, or development of adverse events that needed treatment in the operating room, such as suturing bleb leakage and anterior chamber reformation. Ocular massage, LSL, and needling without antifibrotic agent injection, were not considered as failures.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A sample size of at least 18 patients in each arm was estimated to give an 80% power of detecting at least a difference of 3 mm Hg between groups with the SD of 1 mm Hg as significant at the 2-sided 5% level. Adjusting for a possible dropout rate of 20%, we planned to recruit 22 eyes per group. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize patient demographics and baseline ocular characteristics. Categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Fisher exact test was used for comparison of proportions. Paired and independent <italic>t</italic> tests were used to evaluate within-group and between-group mean differences, respectively. Repeated measures of 1-way analysis of variance were used for IOP comparisons. Nonparametric data were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test. The cumulative probability of success was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log-rank test. The analyses were performed with Stata software (version 12; StataCorp, College Station, TX) and MedCalc statistical software (version 13.0.2; MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> lists the flow of patients through the study.

Twelve glaucoma patients received a single-dose ScB injection (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), at the time of primary trabeculectomy, without using MMC.

Nilforushan et al<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and Akkan and Cilsim<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> have recently reported similar findings, in a prospective, randomized, comparative studies, that a single ScB injection (2.5 mg/0.1 mL), at time of trabeculectomy without using MMC, provided favorable IOP control, but it was less effective when compared with the group receiving MMC (0.02% for 3 min).

The qualified success rates at 12 months had a range of 84% to 96%. Their success rates were better than those of the ScB+MMC group in our study, and were possibly because of the higher dosage and the longer duration of MMC application. Our study used a fixed dose of 0.4 mg/mL MMC, applied for 3 minutes, for all cases, to reduce surgical technique variations.

A recent study has not shown a relationship between duration of glaucoma treatment and surgical outcomes in first-time trabeculectomy.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>Regarding the effect of anti-VEGF on bleb appearances, several studies determined the impact of ScB injection on postoperative bleb vascularity.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Li et al<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> reported, in a rabbit model, that ScB (2.5 mg) had beneficial effects on bleb area, but not on IOP. Grewal et al<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> reported bleb appearance, using the Moorfields Bleb Grading System (MBGS), in human eyes, after trabeculectomy with ScB injection. Bleb-related complications, such as thin cystic bleb leakage, and bleb-related infections were not observed, and the area of blebs decreased over time, but not the height or vascularity. A possible adverse effect of ScB on the trabeculectomy bleb was reported in the study of Akkan and Cilsim.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> They found that, within 1 month postoperatively, encapsulated bleb formation was not significant, and was observed in 29% of the bevacizumab group, and in 10% of the MMC group (<italic>P</italic>=0.23). However, at the end of the study, significant differences in bleb area, height, and vascularity were not observed. There is no study using a high dose of ScB (2.5 mg) plus MMC, in trabeculectomy. Biteli and Prata<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> used a 1.25-mg ScB injection, combined with MMC, and reported that no avascular bleb was observed. As reported in a previous study,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and because of safety concerns, we determined the synergistic effects of ScB plus MMC by using the lower dose (1.25 mg) of bevacizumab.</p><p>According to the parameters defined by IBAS, we did not find significant differences in bleb height, bleb extent, and leakage scores between the 2 groups. Interestingly, the mean vascularity score of the MMC+ScB group was significantly lower than the MMC group at the 1-month follow-up (1.55&#x000b1;0.51 vs. 2.26&#x000b1;0.65, <italic>P</italic>=0.01). The effect on bleb vascularity was not retained throughout the follow-up visits after a single injection of ScB. In contrast to the study by Akkan and Cilsim,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> we did not observe a high incidence of bleb encapsulation in the MMC+ScB group. The trend of bleb vascularity score in our study was similar to the study of Sengupta et al.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> They studied the use of ScB (1.25 mg) alone, compared with soaked-sponge bevacizumab, and with MMC alone, in phacotrabeculectomy. Bleb vascularity of the ScB group was significantly lower when compared with other groups, at 1 month after ScB injections (using the IBAS scoring system, <italic>P</italic>=0.05), and showed gradually increasing vascularization, thereafter. To maintain therapeutic concentrations, a total of 3 injections of ScB were given immediately before surgery, immediately after surgery, and on postoperative day 7.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Li et al<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> showed that bevacizumab reduced the number of both human and rabbit fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. We hypothesized that the use of a higher dose of ScB (2.5 mg), in association with MMC, would have better results on trabeculectomy and bleb appearance outcomes.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first randomized placebo-controlled trial that investigated the synergistic effects of ScB as an adjunct to trabeculectomy with MMC. The major limitations of the study were the small sample size and the short duration of follow-up. With the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, the study findings may not be applicable for other types of glaucoma. On the basis of the results of the bleb vascularity grading, in the first postoperative month, in the MMC+ScB group, multiple injections of ScB in the early postoperative period may sustain bleb survival. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of postoperative multiple injections of ScB as an addition to its intraoperative use in MMC trabeculectomy. The optimum bevacizumab dosage and timing to repeated injections should be further evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, a single subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab, when given intraoperatively, and adjunctive to trabeculectomy with MMC, was safe, but did not appear to have an additive benefit, when compared with MMC alone, in reducing IOPs and improving success rates. However, patients receiving bevacizumab-augmented MMC trabeculectomy may experience benefits on bleb vascularity, at least for 1 month postoperatively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University for funded support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>Supported by the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Disclosure: The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Azuara-Blanco</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group>
