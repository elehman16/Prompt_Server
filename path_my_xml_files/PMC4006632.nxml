Participants randomised to the education groups will be blinded to treatment, and will receive either olive oil placebo (OO+N-3) or LCn-3 provision, while the N-3 group will be open label. The education program includes nine 60-75min sessions over 12 weeks that will involve breast cancer specific healthy eating advice, plus a supervised exercise session run as a resistance exercise circuit. They will also be advised to conduct the resistance training and aerobic training 5 to 7 days per week collectively. Outcome measures will be taken at baseline, 12-weeks and 24-weeks. The primary outcome is % change in LBM as measured by the air displacement plethysmograhy. Secondary outcomes include quality of life (FACT-B&#x02009;+&#x02009;4) and inflammation (C-Reactive protein: CRP). Additional measures taken will be erythrocyte fatty acid analysis, fatigue, physical activity, menopausal symptoms, dietary intake, joint pain and function indices.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This research will provide the first insight into the efficacy of LCn-3s alone or in combination with exercise in breast cancer survivors with regards to LBM and quality of life.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Modern treatment protocols have resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 85% to 90% in developed countries, with Australia&#x02019;s reported at 89.4% in 2012
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Following treatment for breast cancer, a majority of women experience significant body weight increases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These changes unfortunately, are comprised of simultaneous lean body mass (LBM) loss and fat tissue gain
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, LBM loss and fat mass gains have been shown to occur in the absence of total body weight change
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Data from breast cancer cohorts reveal that weight gain is most strongly associated with premenopausal status at diagnosis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], those who experience menopause as a result of treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], lower weight at diagnosis, lower levels of physical activity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and longer chemotherapy treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Evidence from pharmacological trials indicate that initial use of
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], or switching to aromatase inhibitors from tamoxifen
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] increases LBM, possibly due to the alteration in sex steroid balance. The complete aetiology of general LBM loss in this population is unclear, however it appears to be associated with poorer metabolic outcomes, such as earlier onset of cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome related diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Currently, no definitive recommendations can be made in regards to the ideal weight or weight change for women who have completed treatment for breast cancer. Epidemiological studies using weight or BMI have indicated that weight stability may confer benefits in terms of mortality
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Currently there have been no trials assessing mortality and the impact of body composition change (LBM and fat tissue), however results from shorter intervention trials indicate that intentional weight loss and increased activity can improve biochemical markers associated with cardiovascular disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and conditions related to metabolic syndrome
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], which both account for significant morbidity and mortality in this population.</p><sec><title>Interventions to improve body composition in women diagnosed with breast cancer</title><p>A number of studies have assessed the impact of diet, exercise or combined therapies on body composition during or following treatment reporting mixed effects. From studies that have reported a high quality measure of body composition assessment (i.e. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry: DEXA; Air Displacement Plethysmography: ADP; Computed Tomography: CT-scan; and Magnetic Resonance Imaging: MRI) resistance training is most likely to cause an increase in LBM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], aerobic training overall has had mixed effects on LBM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], with most studies indicating no change. Two studies that prescribed a combination of resistance and aerobic training have shown an increase in LBM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Considering that aerobic exercise has been associated with improved disease-free survival in breast cancer populations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], a combination of resistance and aerobic two may promote LBM growth and survival benefits extending beyond the study timeline. Some data indicate LBM increases may be more likely in younger individuals, and separately, those taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Dietary energy restriction alone has resulted in significant body weight loss but also involves significant LBM loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], while combining nutrition and exercise prescription may help to preserve LBM during weight loss
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and/or ameliorate fat tissue gain during weight stability
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise and nutrition trials during chemotherapy</title><p>Numerous uncontrolled and controlled trials have been conducted assessing change in body weight and/or body composition. Of these trials, 11 studies that have used a high quality measure of body composition have indicated mixed effects on lean body mass for different modalities. Exercise only interventions conducted during chemotherapy have indicated that resistance exercise training is probably required to realise an increase in LBM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], while aerobic training alone has shown little to no impact on LBM change
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. When Courneya et al (2007) confined their analysis to women with more advanced breast cancer (Stage IIb &#x00026; IIIa) significant improvements were seen in the intervention group compared to control, these differences were not seen in those women with earlier stage disease (Stage 0-IIa)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Comparatively, combined exercise and nutrition interventions during chemotherapy have typically shown no effect on LBM change
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Lack of LBM gains may be a result of the less intensive/structured exercise training components prescribed in combined trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise and nutrition trials after completion of chemotherapy</title><p>A larger literature exists describing effects of exercise and nutrition on LBM in women after they have completed treatment (up to 3 to 4 years post). Of the four
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] studies reporting a high quality measure of body composition after exercise alone, two aerobic exercise studies (one controlled, one uncontrolled) reported statistically non-significant trends in LBM change
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], while separate aerobic
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and resistance training
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] trials indicated a significant increase in LBM compared to control groups (+0.8 kg vs -0.8 kg, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.047 &#x00026; +0.88 kg vs +0.02 kg, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008, respectively). After further analysis, Irwin et al
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] found that exercisers aged &#x0003c;56 years had greater LBM gains than women &#x0003e;56 years and non-exercisers, and those taking AIs and exercising had greater LBM increases than those not taking AIs.</p><p>One well-designed study investigated dietary energy restriction alone on body composition and examined the differing effects of a low energy and low fat intake or low energy and low carbohydrate intake
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Both groups lost a similar and significant amount of body weight (6.1 kg&#x02009;+&#x02009;4.8 kg) over 12 months, unfortunately this body weight change occurred at the expense of fat tissue and LBM. Incidence of sarcopenia, as defined by an appendicular LBM of &#x0003c;5.67 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, increased from 10% at baseline to 18% at the end of the trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>Of the two studies that have assessed the effect of exercise and nutrition combined on LBM, one study has shown that LBM may be preserved by exercise during dietary energy restriction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], while the other indicated a reduction in fat accumulation with no change to LBM during dietary energy balance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. After a 2000-4000kJ energy restriction plus a combined aerobic and resistance training protocol, Mefferd et al (2007) noted stable LBM in both intervention and wait-list control groups, however compared to control, the intervention group had a significant reduction in total body weight (-0.5 kg vs. -5.7 kg, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Preservation of LBM during significant weight loss could be viewed as a positive outcome in this population as losses of LBM are typical. In a later study that did not use an energy restriction, Demark-Wahnefried et al (2008)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] assessed the effects of calcium rich diet alone (1200-1500 mg/day), combined with low load resistance training (30 min, 3/wk), or combined with the exercise and a low-fat, high fruit and vegetable intake. No change over time in LBM was seen within or between groups, however when trunk fat was excluded from calculations, the third group experienced less body fat % gain over the 6 month intervention than the other two groups (Change in body fat%: Gp3: +0.2% vs Gp1: +1.7% &#x00026; Gp2: +1.1%, respectively, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The lack of LBM change is most likely due to the low frequency and low-load callisthenic type resistance training prescribed, which may not have been adequate for optimal stimulation of muscle protein synthesis.</p><p>Taken together, LBM loss is most likely prevented by resistance training in women who have been or are being treated for breast cancer. Increases in LBM may be confined to those women who adhere to more intensive exercise protocols
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], or in specific sub-populations related to younger age
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] or later stage disease
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Dietary energy restriction alone at this stage could be considered contraindicated due to the heightened risk of sarcopenia in this population, while the addition of exercise to an energy restriction may ameliorate this risk
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. At this stage, no studies have aimed to combine dietary prescription and exercise training to specifically increase LBM. Amino acids and long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCn-3 FAs) are two potential nutrients that can be targeted to compliment resistance training, yet data is lacking in breast cancer survivor populations.</p><p>Advances in nutritional supplementation and support for exercise training in other populations indicate that inclusion of specific nutrients, such as amino acids
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] or possibly long chain omega-3 fatty acids (LCn-3s)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], may significantly enhance the response of LBM in conjunction with exercise training. To date, studies using dietary interventions in breast cancer have not utilised either of these nutrients to improve LBM outcomes for survivors.</p></sec><sec><title>Omega-3 and body composition change</title><p>LCn-3s have been extensively investigated for their ability to preserve LBM in other cancer populations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. However, the populations typically studied have been those with metastatic or advanced cancer and cachexia. Breast cancer survivors do not experience LBM losses comparable to cachectic populaionts, they are much more like a metabolic syndrome population who undergo slower change often associated with fat gains
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Long chain omega-3 fatty acids have been considered as potential body composition modulators with or without dietary energy restriction
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, due to significant heterogeneity in population, body composition measurement, length of trial and dose of LCn-3s some trials have reported no effect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], while others have indicated some effect
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, of the studies reporting an improvement of one of more body composition parameters after increased LCn-3s intake, the clinical significance of the changes in LBM seen are minimal
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, recently published data indicate that LCn-3s may have clinical utility as an adjunct to an anabolic stimulus like resistance training
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] or during a hyperaminoacidaemic/hyperinsulinaemic clamp
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Preliminary evidence suggests that LCn-3s may have a permissive effect on muscle protein synthesis, i.e. reducing anabolic resistance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], and may improve neural activation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] such that skeletal muscle tissue exhibits a greater response to a given anabolic stimulus. In addition, LCn-3s were seen to improve the &#x02018;anabolic resistance&#x02019; found in older populations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The safety of LCn-3 supplementation for doses of up to 4g of EPA &#x00026; DHA/day has been established as low, with the most common concerns arising in regards to gastrointestinal upset and allergic reactions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. There is a theoretical link to an increased risk of bleeding when taken in conjunction with anti-coagulant medication, however this is not considered to be a contraindication in these populations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>].</p><p>To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, no studies have assessed the effect of exercise training and LCn-3 supplementation alone or together, in women who have had breast cancer. Therefore the current study is aimed at comparing the effects of LCn-3FAs alone, an exercise and nutrition program alone, or a combination of both, and how they influence LBM, QOL and inflammation over 12 and 24 weeks in women who have recently completed treatment for breast cancer. It is hypothesised that the greatest relative LBM gains will occur in the combination group.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Primary hypothesis</title><p>Breast cancer survivors participating in a specifically designed group based cognitive behaviour therapy nutrition and exercise program and supplementing with 3g LCn-3s will have greater attenuation of LBM after 12 weeks compared to participants taking a supplement of 3g LCn-3s alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary hypotheses</title><p>Breast cancer survivors participating in the group based cognitive behaviour therapy nutrition and exercise program taking a supplement of 3g LCn-3s will have improved quality of life after 12 and 24 weeks compared to participants of either the specifically designed nutrition and exercise program or participants taking a supplement of 3g LCn-3s alone.</p><p>Breast cancer survivors in the group based cognitive behaviour therapy nutrition and exercise program taking a supplement of 3g LCn-3s acids will have lower levels of inflammation after 12 and 24 weeks compared to participants of either the specifically designed nutrition and exercise program or participants taking a supplement of 3g LCn-3s alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>In order to determine the relative efficacy of each intervention, the design of the study is a parallel 3-arm randomised controlled trial. The intervention will occur at one site, with recruitment occurring at multiple sites. The primary investigators and the participants allocated to the exercise and nutrition groups (+/- LCn-3s) will be blinded, while the LCn-3 FAs alone group is open label.</p></sec><sec><title>Details of power calculation and sample size</title><p>The primary outcome measure is change in lean body mass (LBM) at 12 weeks. Exercise interventions In breast cancer populations have shown LBM increases of 0.7 kg to 1 kg
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], however other exercise intervention studies have reported attenuation of LBM loss rather than increase
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Assuming that the minimum difference in LBM across the comparison groups is a mean of 2%, 38 participants per group will be required to detect this difference with 90% power and type 1 error of 5% or less (two-tailed) A total of 114 participants are therefore required. Assuming 10% for attrition and allowing 15% for contingency, 51 subjects per group will need to be recruited to obtain complete data on at least 38 for each group.</p><p>The study is sufficiently powered to test the secondary hypotheses. A Bonferroni correction to the Type I error will accommodate the 3 pair-wise comparisons by 2 visits such that p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.008 will be considered statistically significant in order to preserve the family-wise Type I error rate of 5% for each secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>Women will be recruited through breast cancer oncology centres, radio advertising, social media and breast cancer research registries in Brisbane, Australia. Oncologists, breast care nurses and allied health professionals will inform potential participants of the study during or shortly following treatment (surgery, radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Participants will be asked to contact the primary investigator to express official interest in the study and have eligibility determined. Recruitment into the trial will be over 10 to 15 groups of 5 to 15 participants per group. A range of group sizes has been chosen to ensure the maximum number of participants can be recruited as delaying the start of intervention may result in some being excluded due to time elapse since treatment. Within each of these groups, participants will be randomly allocated to one of 3 groups. A record will be kept of the number of participants who have expressed interest to the primary investigator, the number of potential participants who are eligible, ineligible and then finally randomised into the trial. Ethical approval has been received from the participating hospital (UCH HREC: #1034) as well as from the University of Queensland (#2011000079).

Both participants and primary investigator will be blinded to group allocations, while all capsules will be given out separately to minimise product comparison. The sessions will run for 60-75 minutes at the Wesley Research Institute, Brisbane. The sessions will include 30 to 45 minutes of nutrition education, the remainder of the time is committed to resistance exercise training. The sessions will be facilitated by the Primary Investigator who is an Accredited Practising Dietitian and Accredited Exercise physiologist with relevant clinical experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Semi-supervised exercise program</title><p>The supervised exercise sessions are designed as circuit based training sessions. The sessions will be started with active range of motion exercises as a warm up, exercises will then performed and the session completed with specific stretches and flexibility exercises. The exercises include push ups, squats*, lunges, glute bridging, seated row*, shoulder press*, bicep curls* and a series of postural and abdominal exercises (*Exercises marked indicates the use of the Gymstick&#x02122;). The resistance exercise program is designed to be performed at home using body weight and the Gymstick&#x02122;, a specialised elastic resistance stick, which has been used in a previous non-cancer population of similarly aged participants
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. During the supervised sessions feedback will be given regarding technique, exercise progression and modification, and management of injury/discomfort. Participants will be prescribed to reach at least 3 resistance sessions per week including the supervised session, and at least 3 aerobic training sessions each week at home. The participants will be given access to specifically made video material that details the appropriate technique for the majority of the exercises performed in class. The program will be progressed with the addition of new exercises, increased difficulty of exercises by increasing the tension of the Gymstick&#x02122;, or exercise modification, and through an increase in workload volume (repetitions and sets). Typically, each exercise will be performed as many times as possible in 30-second to one-minute bouts, or until temporary fatigue. This type of workload has been chosen as it is most applicable to home training using body weight and elastic apparatus. In addition, research indicates that reaching temporary fatigue through a low load high-volume protocol results in a similar increase in muscle protein synthesis when compared to a high load protocol with less repetitions

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] and adapted to focus on healthy food choices for breast cancer survivors. It should be noted that participants will not be given additional advice regarding weight loss or energy restriction throughout the trial. The 9 sessions will include advice on general and breast cancer specific healthy eating, benefits of exercise and practicalities of incorporating healthy habits. Group discussion will be facilitated by the primary investigator to increase practical content. All of the nutrition sessions will be recorded on the Powerpoint slides and provided to the group members via an online portal.</p></sec><sec><title>Side effects of treatment</title><p>All participants will be asked to report the appearance of any adverse symptoms that may be related to the exercise program or capsule consumption. If a participant is diagnosed with a recurrence they will be excluded from the data analysis. They will also be advised in how to access ongoing lifestyle treatment in a private setting. If participants report an exacerbation of lymphoedema symptoms they will be referred to a breast cancer specialist physiotherapist for assessment, in addition, they will be advised to cease their upper body resistance training until medical clearance is given to continue as per the ACSM guidelines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. For gastro-intestinal upset, or unpredicted reactions that arise during the study period, participants will be asked to cease capsule consumption and advised to seek medical clearance before recommencing.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><p>All outcome measures will be performed at baseline, 12 and 24 week time points. The 24 week time point has been included to better understand the practicality of the intervention in terms of maintenance of lifestyle changes after the supervised time. Each assessment period will involve 2 visits to the WRI. Visit 1 measures will include body composition, questionnaires and aerobic fitness testing. Over the next 7 days participants will be asked to: complete the Diet History Questionnaire; wear a uniaxial accelerometer every day; and have a fasting blood sample. At Visit 2, the primary investigator will review the diet history questionnaire, collect the accelerometer and conduct the muscle endurance testing.

To compare the three treatment groups at baseline, a chi square test or Fishers exact test will be used for categorical variables and a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. Baseline demographic and disease-specific characteristics that differ among groups will be considered for covariate adjustments in analysis of all outcomes.</p><p>Measurements collected longitudinally will be summarised by group as number, mean and standard deviation, minimum and maximum at each visit (baseline, 12 week, 24 week). Absolute change from baseline will be calculated by subtracting the baseline measurement from the 12 week and 24 week measurements; percent change from baseline will be calculated by dividing the 12 week and 24 week measurements by the baseline measurement.

For each of the change from baseline outcomes, time (12 week vs 24 week), treatment (N-3, EX+N-3, OO+N-3), the time by treatment interaction and the baseline value of the outcome will be tested as fixed effects with a random subject effect specified. Interactions with p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.10 will be retained in the models. Contrasts will be constructed to compare pair-wise differences among the three treatment groups at each time point.
