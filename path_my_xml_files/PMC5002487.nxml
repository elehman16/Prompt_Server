Introduction</title><p>Corneal cross-linking is an established procedure aimed at slowing down or halting keratoconus progression [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The efficacy of the conventional riboflavin/UV-A irradiation procedure was primarily demonstrated by laboratory studies suggesting that it increases the biomechanical strength of the treated cornea. In addition, several clinical studies have evidenced how the treatment is effective in slowing down or halting the progression of keratoconus up to 10 years of follow-up [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>The conventional corneal cross-linking procedure includes the removal of corneal epithelium to permit adequate penetration of riboflavin in the stroma. Epithelial removal, however, is responsible for most of the major cross-linking related complications, which include postoperative pain, vision impairment, and risk of infection. Major efforts have been dedicated to overcoming the epithelial barrier to riboflavin penetration and reducing treatment time, with the aim of maintaining efficacy and improving safety of the treatment [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, there are still controversies on how riboflavin may penetrate in the stroma through an intact epithelium or how the epithelium may limit UV-A irradiation of the stroma soaked by riboflavin.</p><p>It has been widely shown that dextran-enriched solutions greatly limit the penetration of riboflavin in the stroma through the intact epithelium [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Recently, Shalchi et al. [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] have revised a series of peer-reviewed papers comparing the results of standard cross-linking (total of 45 papers) and transepithelial cross-linking (total of 5 papers) in the management of progressive keratoconus. Although transepithelial corneal cross-linking has been shown to be safe without any related epithelial wound healing complication, 75% of the cases have shown a continued keratoconus progression one year after treatment, whereas the majority of studies on standard cross-linking (&#x02265;90%) have shown reduction in maximum simulated keratometry in the same period. The only study that has shown comparable results between transepithelial and standard corneal cross-linking did not use dextran-enriched riboflavin solution for the transepithelial treatment [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Overall, the limited number of published outcomes from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) makes it challenging to draw clear conclusions on the efficacy of the many techniques used for transepithelial corneal cross-linking [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Robustly designed controlled trials are required to provide accurate results between techniques. Currently, five RCTs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02117999?term=NCT02117999">NCT02117999</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02456961?term=NCT02456961">NCT02456961</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02349165?term=NCT02349165">NCT02349165</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01181219?term=NCT01181219">NCT01181219</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01868620?term=NCT01868620">NCT01868620</ext-link>) are aiming to compare the results of transepithelial corneal cross-linking with the standard procedure for stabilization of progressive keratoconus; three of these trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02117999?term=NCT02117999">NCT02117999</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02456961?term=NCT02456961">NCT02456961</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01868620?term=NCT01868620">NCT01868620</ext-link>) are using dextran-free riboflavin solutions to moisten the corneal stroma through the intact epithelium using iontophoresis.</p><p>Iontophoresis is a noninvasive technique used to deliver a charged substance transcorneally by repulsive electromotive force using a small electrical charge applied to an iontophoretic chamber. In<italic> ex vivo</italic> studies, we have assessed the diffusion of riboflavin in dextran-free 0.1% hypotonic solution enriched with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and trometamol in the corneal stroma of eye bank donor eyes and the effect of rapid UV-A irradiation of the cornea (i.e., 10&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 9 minutes) after transepithelial soaking using iontophoresis. Experimental work has demonstrated that though the stromal concentration of riboflavin after iontophoresis was lower than conventional soaking, the stiffening effect on the anterior cornea was almost comparable to that of standard cross-linking [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Other laboratory studies have shown that iontophoresis is effective to deliver an adequate amount of riboflavin in the stroma through the intact epithelium, as previously discussed [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>The present RCT with identifier code <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02117999?term=NCT02117999">NCT02117999</ext-link> was designed to compare the treatment efficacy for progressive keratoconus by transepithelial corneal cross-linking using iontophoresis with the standard corneal cross-linking procedure at 12 months. In this paper, we present the technique and anticipate the outcomes from the complete cohort of 34 eyes after 6 months of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Study Design</title><p>This is an ongoing prospective, unmasked, randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at the clinical trials center of the IRCCS Fondazione G.B. Bietti, Rome, Italy. The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of transepithelial corneal cross-linking using iontophoresis (T-ionto CL or study group) in the treatment of progressive keratoconus in comparison with standard corneal cross-linking (standard CL or control group). The primary outcome measure of the study is the maximum simulated keratometry value (<italic>K</italic>

In addition, we asked all those patients to discontinue the use of contact lens during follow-up in order to avoid bias during the study.</p><p>At baseline and postoperative visits at 3 and 7 days and 1, 3, and 6 months, all patients underwent slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment of the eye; the haze in the anterior stroma was graded on a scale (grade 0&#x02013;4) used after photorefractive keratectomy [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; ocular surface inflammation was graded on signs of bulbar conjunctival hyperemia (grade 0&#x02013;3) and upper tarsal conjunctival papillae (grade 0&#x02013;3) according to Akpek et al. [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In addition, the following assessments were recorded: best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA, logMAR units) obtained using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study chart at 4 meters, contrast sensitivity function (CSF, log units) evaluated using Pelli-Robson chart, manifest refraction (expressed as spherical equivalent, diopters, D), <italic>K</italic>

All data were acquired and analyzed in an unmasked manner. At each time point, patients received a questionnaire to evaluate symptoms, such as itchiness, tearing, photophobia, and pain (grade 0&#x02013;3), after treatment.</p><p>To exclude infection, document epithelial healing, and provide general postoperative care, all patients were assessed also on day 1 after treatment in addition to the described follow-up schedule.</p><p>To improve the reliability of topography measurements, a minimum of 3 acquisitions were performed for each eye at each time interval. If the value varied by more than 10% between the scans, then a further scan was obtained. The best scan was then selected for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4.

The central 10&#x02009;mm corneal epithelium was removed using Amoils' brush (Innovative Excimer Solutions Inc., Toronto, ON); central stromal thickness was then measured by handheld ultrasound pachymeter. A solution containing 20% dextran-enriched 0.1% riboflavin (Ricrolin, Sooft Italia SpA, Italy) was instilled every 3 minutes for 30 minutes before UV-A irradiation. After corneal soaking, the stromal surface of each tissue was gently washed using chilled 0.9% sodium chloride solution; thereafter, the central stromal thickness was measured by handheld ultrasound pachymeter.

Because the main treatment objective is to stabilize the underlying disease process, corneal topography (<italic>K</italic>

Due to the inherent clinical interest in novel surgical techniques for treating progressive keratoconus, we are anticipating the 6-month clinical outcome.</p><p>At 6 months, we found statistically significant flattening of <italic>K</italic>

<sub>max</sub> of 1.2&#x02009;D during the same period. Less variability and more favorable outcomes have been in general reported for standard cross-linking from the 6-month follow-up onwards, due to epithelial-stromal remodelling [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; for this reason, the design of the present RCT did not include any further treatment before completing the 1-year follow-up. Retreatment of an ectatic cornea has been previously indicated if the <italic>K</italic>
<sub>max</sub> value increased by at least 1.0&#x02009;D over 2 consecutive follow-up visits compared with its value during the steady-state period after the first treatment [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Visual performance was not affected by T-ionto CL in the first days after surgery; at 3 days postoperatively, all eyes except for two (90%) had the same or improved BSCVA and CSF with respect to baseline. The same result was found in 50% of cases treated by standard CL in the same period. The differences between treatments were mostly related to epithelial debridement and wound healing. Six months after T-ionto CL, we found a significant average improvement in BSCVA (&#x02212;0.11&#x02009;logMAR; <italic>P</italic> = 0.001), which was not found after standard CL. No change in CSF was found after T-ionto CL (mean changes lower than +0.08&#x02009;log units during a period of 6 months), whereas a decrease in CSF was measured 3 days after standard CL (on average, &#x02212;0.23&#x02009;log units), which was likely caused by epithelial debridement and wound healing. The manifest refraction showed a statistically significant average reduction of myopia (+0.65 &#x000b1; 1.20&#x02009;D; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02) only after T-ionto CL treatment at 6 months.</p><p>No changes in CCT and ECD were measured during 6 months of follow-up after T-ionto CL treatment. After standard CL, corneal thickness increased, due to stromal edema, during the first week postoperatively (on average, +34&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m), decreasing during 6-month follow-up. A drop in ECD count, which was related to decreased transparency and more corneal scattering caused by stromal swelling in 50% of eyes, was measured at day 3 after standard CL (on average, &#x02212;337 cells/mm<sup>2</sup>). The use of hypotonic riboflavin solution to promote stromal swelling in order to achieve a minimum thickness of 400&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m before UV-A irradiation has been shown to minimize the risk of early postoperative stromal swelling [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Although there was no difference in pain score between groups at any time during follow-up, symptoms of ocular discomfort were greater after standard CL than after T-ionto CL during the first 3 days postoperatively. The eyes treated by standard CL showed greater conjunctival hyperaemia and tarsal conjunctival papillae than eyes treated by T-ionto CL during the first week [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At 3 months, 2 eyes (10%) in the T-ionto CL group showed faint corneal haze (grade &#x02264; 0.5), which disappeared in all cases at 6 months. In the control group, six eyes (50%) showed mild corneal haze (grade between 0.5 and 1.0) during the same period [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We had one case in the control group that showed peripheral sterile corneal infiltrates at day 3, which did not delay corneal wound healing or affect visual performance or topography outcome (<italic>K</italic>

No adverse events were recorded in the study group.</p><p>Data from the control group are consistent with those already published in the literature showing the time course of clinical and instrumental measures after standard CL [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In general, visual acuity and corneal steepness worsen in the first month postoperatively; resolution to baseline occurs by approximately 3 months, with improvement thereafter. Improvement includes flattening of <italic>K</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (on average between 1 and 2&#x02009;D in averagely 50% of cases), reduction in myopic spherical equivalent (averagely between +0.2 and +0.7&#x02009;D), and increase of BSCVA (&#x02265;1 Snellen line in 50% of cases), which occur during a period of 1 year after treatment [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Central corneal thickness remains slightly decreased from baseline to 12 months after standard CL and then recovers to baseline thickness after more than 18 months [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Early postoperative complications after standard CL include stromal swelling (averagely 70% of cases) and sterile infiltrates (averagely 8% of cases), which however have been shown to resolve in the vast majority of cases within 3 months after treatment [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Stromal swelling may be due to epithelial debridement, excessive stromal thinning due to the hyperosmolar riboflavin solution, and the direct UV-A irradiation of the corneal stroma. The mechanism underlying sterile infiltration is still unknown but may relate to an altered immune response to antigens in areas of static tear pooling beneath the bandage contact lens or may be a direct result of the phototoxic effect of corneal cross-linking [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Corneal haze is also a common adverse event in the early postoperative period after standard CL (up to 70% of cases), which however resolves in the vast majority of cases by 1 year after treatment [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In this RCT, the major technical differences between the T-ionto CL and standard CL treatments include the epithelial debridement in the latter case, the use of two different riboflavin solutions, and the total UV-A energy dose delivered to corneal stroma, which is on average 20% higher in standard CL than in T-ionto CL, due to the UV-A filtering effect of the epithelium [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Three previous uncontrolled studies [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] have reported the clinical outcome of transepithelial corneal cross-linking with iontophoresis for the management of keratoconus in adults. In general, the authors have reported an improvement in BSCVA, stable or decreased <italic>K</italic>
<sub>max</sub>, and no changes in CCT and ECD count during 1-year follow-up. In two studies [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], iontophoresis has been performed with the same iontophoresis device used in the present RCT. Recently, the 1-year clinical outcome of transepithelial corneal cross-linking with iontophoresis (20 eyes) to treat progressive keratoconus has been compared to the standard corneal cross-linking protocol (20 eyes). The authors have shown a significant reduction of <italic>K</italic>
<sub>max</sub> by &#x02212;0.31 &#x000b1; 1.87&#x02009;D and &#x02212;1.05 &#x000b1; 1.51&#x02009;D, respectively, with no patient eye showing continuous progression of keratoconus at the end of follow-up [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In this trial, iontophoresis was preceded by removal of precorneal mucin layer with the intent to increase epithelial permeability to riboflavin (molecular weight of 340&#x02009;Da) [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. At physiologic pH, the intact corneal epithelial surface acts as a chemophysical barrier due to the function of the intercellular tight junctions and the epithelium-associated mucins, which regulate paracellular transport of compounds [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. By removing the epithelium-associated mucins, we aimed to decrease the epithelial barrier function in order to ensure enough bioavailability of riboflavin in the stroma using iontophoresis, as found in laboratory studies [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Gentle applanation of the central corneal surface with Biopore membrane for 3 seconds was effective to remove the central precorneal tear film, as shown by confocal immunofluorescence analysis of the membranes containing MUC4 mucin, which is the predominant mucus moiety in the precorneal tear film [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and by corneal imaging using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fluorescein dye (molecular weight of 376&#x02009;Da). No damage to the corneal epithelium was made in any case and this clinical observation was supported by the presence of only scattered superficial epithelial cells on the Biopore membranes.</p><p>In conclusion, the preliminary outcome from the present RCT provides evidence that transepithelial corneal cross-linking with iontophoresis using 10&#x02009;mW/cm<sup>2</sup> UV-A device is safe for the treatment of progressive keratoconus in adults and improves keratometry readings in 90% of cases over 6 months postoperatively. Investigation of the long-term RCT outcomes is warranted to verify the efficacy of transepithelial corneal cross-linking and determine whether it may be comparable with standard corneal cross-linking in the management of progressive keratoconus.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Research for this work was supported by the National Framework Program for Research and Innovation PON (Grant no. 01_00110), the Italian Ministry of Health, and Fondazione Roma.</p></ack><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>No competing interests exist for any author.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Raiskup</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Spoerl</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Corneal crosslinking with riboflavin and ultraviolet A.
