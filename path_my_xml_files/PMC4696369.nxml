A number of therapeutic trials have been studied due to reduce the occurrence of postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP) but many of them were unsuccessful. Periampullary corticosteroid injection was proposed to use as prophylactic agents for PEP because of its anti-inflammatory property with relative low systemic side effects.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>By conducting a double blinded clinical trial study in a single center university hospital, all patients undergoing therapeutic or diagnostic ERCP in our gastrointestinal endoscopy ward, enrolled the study. During ERCP, we randomly assigned the patients in blocks of 40 to undergo a locally injection of methylprednisolone acetate (corticosteroid group) or saline (control group) on the major papilla and prospectively evaluated the occurrence of PEP pancreatitis in each groups. Clinical and laboratory findings of acute pancreatitis were collected by means of a validated questionnaire during the procedure and before discharge. At baseline and end of the study, were compared pancreatitis prevalence and also its severity by using Chi-square and <italic>t</italic>-test statistics.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The frequency of moderate to severe PEP pain was not significantly between the placebo and corticosteroid receiving group (13.7% &#x000b1; 3.2% vs. 9.3% &#x000b1; 2.1%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.8). There is no significant difference in the mean concentration of lipase and amylase between corticosteroid receiving group and placebo receiving group at the first, second, and third time. In the corticosteroid receiving group, 3 patients (10.3%) while in the control group, 11 patients (11.3%) developed pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>We found no significant difference in PEP rates and also severity between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. The mean increase in serum amylase and amylase level in pancreatitis patients and the frequency of abdominal pain were not significantly higher in the placebo group. Besides, there were no cases of severe PEP pancreatitis in either group.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Corticosteroid</kwd><kwd>endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography</kwd><kwd>pancreatitis</kwd><kwd>papillary edema</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rising of serum amylase concentration is common laboratory finding after endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), it may occur over 75% of patients, but association of abdominal pain and hyperamylasemia termed as acute clinical pancreatitis is not so common.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Postendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP) was found to be the most frequent complication after ERCP, with an average rate of 5-7% and incidence of 3.47%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In a recent systematic review of 108 randomized controlled trials, which included 13,296 patients undergoing both diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP, the overall rate of PEP was about 10%, with a mortality rate of 0.7% in the control group (placebo or no-pancreatic duct stent arms).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The exact mechanism of injury during ERCP is unknown, but they can be categorized as mechanical, chemical, enzymatic, and possibly thermal.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It seems that the ampullary edema may cause temporary outflow obstruction of pancreatic juice, and then increase ductal pressure, resulting in the occurrence of pancreatitis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A number of drugs have been applied for prevention or alleviation of the PEP pancreatitis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the results of these therapeutic drug interventions have been generally unsatisfactory.</p><p>A few studies referred to role of prophylactic systemic corticosteroid in the prevention of PEP because of its anti-inflammatory property and autodigestion theory of PEP pancreatitis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] On the other hand, most clinical trials did not recommend prophylactic use of corticosteroid after ERCP procedure.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] These agents may also induce acute pancreatitis in these patients. All studies did not recommend prophylactic use of corticosteroid for ERCP.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Numerous well described side effects of corticosteroids were described either. However, we think that these side effects will be significantly diminished after a single dose and locally injection.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Local injection of methyl prednisolone around the papilla may reduce papillary edema. Based on this hypothesis, in a hospital-based, prospectively randomized clinical trial study we evaluated if prophylactic local injection corticosteroids around the papilla decrease the incidence of PEP pancreatitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Trial registrations and organization</title><p>This clinical trial study is registered by the Iranian Clinical Trial registration Center at Iranian ministry of health and education (Trial Number: Irct-21342).

Secondary aims included the assessment of the severity of PEP pancreatitis, the duration of the hospital stay, the amylase and lipase levels measured 6 and 24 h PEP, and the in hospital mortality after ERCP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was done between September 2014 and February 2015. All patients, undergoing therapeutic or diagnostic ERCP in the gastrointestinal endoscopy ward of Al-Zahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, enrolled the study. This department is one of the recognized ERCP centers in the central part of Iran. Contributing endoscopists were highly skilled operators who had been performing ERCPs for at least 5 years.</p><p>In our study, the population of the study consisted of serially enrolled patients above 18 years scheduled to undergo ERCP. Exclusion criteria's were age lower than 18, active (&#x0003c;2 weeks before ERCP) or chronic pancreatitis, history of previous sphincterotomy, acute renal failure, pregnancy or refusal to give informed consent. Then, all eligible patients were invited to take part in the study and had to give written informed consent before study entry.</p><p>During ERCP, we randomly assigned the patients in blocks of 40 to undergo a locally injection of methylprednisolone acetate (prednisolone group) or a block of 91 to saline (control group) (in a 1:2 drug/placebo group ratio) around the major papilla and prospectively evaluated the occurrence of PEP pancreatitis in each groups. Deciding as using of either placebo or prednisolone was performed in the ERCP Unit, whereas gastrointestinal ward physician caring for PEP patients was unaware of assigned treatments.</p><p>All patients had fasted over night before doing ERCP. The procedures were done under local and light anesthesia with a combination of meperidine, hyoscine, midazolam, and propofol as premedications and during the procedure.</p><p>Primarily, a TRUEtome Cannulating Sphincterotome (M00545150; Autotome RX 49 Cannulating Sphincterotome; Boston, Massachusetts, USA) was used for cannulation and when this failed, a tapered catheter (M00530960; Fluoro Tip ERCP Cannula Standard Tip; Boston, Massachusetts, USA) was subsequently used with a guide wire. Placebo (1 mL of 0.9% saline solution) or methylprednisolone acetate (40 mg/1 mL Depocortin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, injection, Iran-hormone, Tehran, Iran), were injected periampullary using after the endoscopic session around the papilla in the second part of duodenum. Using of sedatives, analgesics, and antibiotics were permitted as needed. Finally, some independent variables such as: Total number of trials for pancreatic duct injections, length of sphincterotomy, number of cannulations, common bile duct morphological appearance, diameter of the bile duct; using needle-knife sphincterotomy, possibility of pancreatic acinarization during contrast injection, and the presence of choledocolithiasis were recorded by endoscopist in the questionnaires.

The severity of pancreatitis was graded according to Cotton <italic>et al</italic>. classification and it was categorized according to the duration of therapeutic intervention for PEP.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Usually mild PEP needs hospitalization not for more than 2-3 days; moderate PEP required 4-10 days; and severe PEP necessitated more than 10 days, and probably more needed to surgical or intensive care unit treatment, or contributed to death. Serum amylase and lipase levels were measured before ERCP and at 6 h and 24 h after ERCP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables and the Chi-square test for category data.

Several drugs were tried to find effective in the prevention of PEP pancreatitis including NSAIDS, allopurinol, glucagon, somatostatin, calcitonin, gabexate mesilate, and corticosteroid[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] but most have been disappointing.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Since the year of 1994, corticosteroids was proposed to use as prophylactic agents for PEP because of its anti-inflammatory property.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Hypothetically, local injection of corticosteroid may decrease the severity of inflammation in the papillary area so it may diminish edema and subsequently lower the pancreatic ductal outflow obstruction. Our study was performed to assess the effect of locally periampullary injection of methylprednisolone after the ERCP procedure could decrease the incidence and severity of PEP pancreatitis. However, we found no significant difference in PEP rates and also severity between the corticosteroid and placebo groups. The mean increase in serum amylase and amylase level in pancreatitis patients and the frequency of abdominal pain were not significantly higher in the placebo group. Besides, there were no cases of severe PEP pancreatitis in either group. To our knowledge, in spite of negative results, our study represents the first to evaluate the prophylactic role of local injection of corticosteroid in prevention of patients after ERCP. Several explanations are possible for this nonsignificant relation. First, the dose of corticosteroid is not sufficient for PEP prevention and the second is the noninflammatory cause of PEP.</p><p>However, there are several limitations to the present article. Small number of cases included the study was the main, so we could able to analyzed the role of ERCP indications separately. It is also important to emphasize that there is currently no method to quantify the risk of developing PEP based on known demographic, clinical, and procedural risk factors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, the present study did not show any statistically significant benefit of prophylactic corticosteroid use for prevention of PEP.
