known if and how this modality can improve neuromuscular performance and retain those
improvements. [Subjects and Methods] Joint position sense based on the bilateral knee
joint matching test and simple reaction time was investigated in 25 young healthy adults
who underwent an extended period of whole body cryostimulation. The measurements were
taken at baseline and after 10, 20, and 30 whole body cryotherapy sessions, with three
days elapsing after the last treatment, and comparing the results with 24 control
subjects. [Results] Only when 20 sessions were completed did joint position sense and
simple reaction time improve in the intervention group. After 30 sessions, the outcome was
similar. Equal results were found at baseline and after 10 sessions in both groups, but
the intervention group outstripped controls after 20 and 30 sessions in both joint
position sense and simple reaction time. [Conclusion] These results indicate that the
common standard of 10 sessions is insufficient, while approximately 20 sessions of whole
body cryotherapy may efficiently enhance neuromuscular performance with an ability to
sustain the effects for at least three days.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Whole body cryotherapy</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd><kwd>Neuromuscular performance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Improvement of motor skills has a fundamental significance in sports and therapy, and every
new approach that may enhance the performance outcome measures deserves the attention of
researchers. Whole body cryostimulation (WBC) is one such modality, has been commonly used
for decades, and was shown to have advantageous physiological and psychological effects on
humans. Even a single session in a climatic chamber alleviates pain and fatigue, reduces
edema and inflammation, creates a good mood, and increases vigilance and arousal<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A common WBC treatment consists of multiple exposures to cold, which magnifies its
therapeutic effect<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This evidence was
recently supported by Lubkowska et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
who reported much more favorable changes in lipid profile and the activity of antioxidant
enzymes after 20 WBC sessions as compared to 10 sessions. Similar results were presented by
Miller at al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and Wo&#x0017a;niak et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Given this evidence, it can be hypothesized that repeated WBC gives rise to favorable
conditions for optimizing neuromuscular control and, thus, may amend performance in selected
sensorimotor tasks, in particular after a reasonable time after the last session ends. If
this proposition became true, the spectrum of possible applications of cryostimulation would
expand by providing new potential benefits of this therapeutic modality.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of repeated WBC sessions on the
results of two simple neuromuscular tests in young healthy adults: simple reaction time
(SRT) and joint position sense (JPS). Based on Lubkowska et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, Szygula et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and their results regarding the optimal number of exposures to
produce beneficial hormonal changes, it was hypothesized that a standard treatment (10 WBC
sessions) would have no effect on the tests scores while a longer treatment (20 or 30 WBC
sessions) would decrease simple reaction times and reduce joint positioning errors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty-nine healthy men aged 22.5 (0.7) years participated after giving informed consent to

None of the subjects had contraindications to whole-body exposure to cold or
reported musculoskeletal or neurological disorders and/or physical injury at the time of the
experiment. The members of the intervention group were examined by a physician prior to the
procedure. No participants had ever been subjected to WBC. The study protocol was approved
by the Bioethics Committee. The WBC treatments were conducted in a cryotherapeutic chamber
(type CR-2011 CH-1/A) consisting of a vestibule and main chamber. The group was subjected to
30 sessions of daily WBC treatments for 6 consecutive weeks starting each Monday, with
breaks on Saturdays and Sundays. Each session lasted 3.5&#x02005;min: 30&#x02005;s in the vestibule at a
temperature of &#x02212;60<sup>&#x025e6;</sup>C and 3&#x02005;min in the main chamber at a temperature of
&#x02212;120<sup>&#x025e6;</sup>C. The participants were dressed in shorts, knee-length socks, gloves,
wooden clogs, and headbands to protect the ears. Just prior to entering the chamber, the
participants placed surgical masks over their faces to protect airways and dried their
bodies thoroughly with a towel to remove sweat. While in the chamber, the participants were
asked to walk slowly without any rapid body movements. According to the main purpose of this
study, JPS and SRT were measured 4 times using the procedures recommended for physiological
profile assessment by Lord et al<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trials
in the intervention group were performed on Mondays before the first, eleventh, and
twenty-first sessions, with the last test performed on Monday after the last WBC session.
This distribution of measurements was convenient for later comparisons of the JPS and SRT
performances measured after a two-day retention period with the baseline values. The
performance of participants from the control group was examined in the same way, i.e. 4
consecutive trials separated by 2-week intervals.</p><p>For the purpose of JPS evaluation, a method involving a lower limb matching task was
administered<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants were seated
with their eyes closed and asked to align their lower limbs simultaneously on either side of
a vertical clear acrylic sheet (60 &#x000d7; 60 &#x000d7; 1 cm) inscribed with a protractor and placed
between their legs. To prevent confounding of the results from limited motion at the knee
joint, the examiner ensured that participants matched their limbs near the midrange of knee
joint motion. Any difference in aligning the lower limbs (indicated by disparities in
matching the great toes on either side of the acrylic sheet) was measured in degrees.
Following 2 practice trials, the average of 5 experimental trials was recorded.</p><p>Simple reaction time was assessed in milliseconds using a hand-held electronic timer<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The light stimulus was located adjacent to
the response switches and was bright (supra-threshold) to ensure that the tests were not
influenced by the participants&#x02019; visual acuity. The timer had a built-in variable delay of 1
to 5 seconds to remove any cues that could be elicited from the test administrator
commencing each trial by pressing the &#x0201c;start&#x0201d; button. A modified computer mouse was used as
the response box for the finger press task. Five practice trials were undertaken, followed
by 10 experimental trials used to compute the average SRT for each subject. A two-way mixed
ANOVA was used to study the effects of group and time on SRT results, which had a normal
distribution. Tukey post-hoc analysis was applied to test for differences in SRT between
baseline data and the remaining tests and between the two groups in the consecutive trials.
Because the JPS results deviated markedly from normality, Friedman&#x02019;s Anova was used to test
for differences in JPS across 4 trials. The Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed
to examine the differences in JPS between selected trials and both groups, respectively. The
level of significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Friedmann Anova indicated a significant effect of time on JPS in the investigated group
(&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>(3)=8.57, p=0.035) and no effect in the control group. Post-hoc analysis
indicated that 10 WBC sessions did not change the baseline JPS while 20 and 30 sessions
improved JPS (Z=2.78, p&#x0003c;0.006 and Z=2.98, p&#x0003c;0.003, respectively). There were no
intergroup differences in JPS at baseline and after 10 sessions. However, after 20 and 30
sessions, the experimental group presented better JPS results (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) than the control group (Z=2.71, p&#x0003c;0.007 and Z=2.52,
p&#x0003c;0.012, respectively).</p><p>There were two main effects on SRT: group (F[1,47]=9.71, p&#x0003c;0.004) and time
(F[3,141]=5.44, p&#x0003c;0.002). These effects plainly reflected the strong decrease in SRT in
the experimental group after 20 and 30 WBC sessions (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, there was a group * time interaction (F[3,141]=5.42,
p&#x0003c;0.002) which accounted for a gradual improvement in SRT over time in the experimental
group as opposed to a lack of this effect in the control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table.1</xref>). Post-hoc analysis revealed that SRT after 20 sessions
and SRT after 30 sessions were reduced compared to SRT at baseline in the experimental group
(p&#x0003c;0.001 and p&#x0003c;0.0002, respectively). With regard to intergroup differences, only SRT
after 20 sessions and SRT after 30 sessions were reduced in the experimental group compared
to the control group (p&#x0003c;0.02 and p&#x0003c;0.00001, respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our results are not directly comparable to those of other authors because the research into
the relationship between the increasing number of WBC exposures and neuromuscular
performance, particularly after a considerable retention interval, does not exist. In the
majority of studies, the emphasis was placed on the assessment of this performance
immediately after exposure to cryogenic temperatures. These reports are inconsistent,
ranging from slight improvement to modest deterioration in several neuromuscular abilities.
Yet, all these changes were temporary indicating that WBC is not harmful and does not induce
general or specific negative effects<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the participation in
prolonged WBC treatment counterbalanced the transient adverse effects confirming an
efficient adaptation to repeated cold stimuli<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results warranted more systematic
studies on the relationship between the number of WBC treatments and the desired outcomes.
The pertinent work revealed that efficient adaptation to extreme cold is associated with
significant hormonal changes (e.g. enhanced levels of endorphins and adrenaline, whose
dynamics increase with the number of treatments)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been reported that advantageous changes in lipid profile and
the activity of antioxidant enzymes occurred after at least 10 to 20 sessions of
cryostimulation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results in the
present study are comparable, indicating that a similar number of sessions are necessary to
improve JPS and SRT.</p><p>However, despite the increasing number of studies reporting the effect of cryostimulation
on hematological indices and hormone secretion, which may account for the central effects of
long-term cold exposure, their results are limited and often inconsistent. Such findings
cannot directly add to our understanding of the relationship between the cold stressor and
neuromuscular performance, as their physiological significance has yet to be elucidated.
Still, these results provide growing evidence of the association between the increased
dynamics of biochemical changes and cold exposure duration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even if the direction of
these changes is variable and unpredictable, their growing intensity may account for the
onset of the transition between the system&#x02019;s initial state and subsequent adaptation. This
adaptation or acclimatization to repeated cold stimuli helps restore the organism to optimal
functioning after perturbations by external stressors.</p><p>As an example, Lubkowska et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
an increase in catalase activity in erythrocytes after 10 treatments of WBC with a
subsequent decrease after 20 treatments. A plausible explanation of these varying levels of
different hormones is still lacking, but it may indicate reciprocal adjustment between
several biochemical variables in an effort to optimally adapt the organism to a stressor.
Such an adaptation seems to be nonspecific and not limited to a particular stressor;
however, it may result in an advantageous effect on the whole organism, including better
proprioception and simple reaction time.</p><p>Proprioceptive acuity gains are commonly reported in scientific literature. It has been
shown that elderly persons and younger adult patients with various motor disabilities may
benefit from the application of different training modalities. However, similar results in
the healthy population are less common, probably indicating that further improvement in
proprioception is difficult and requires adequate specialized training, Adedoyin et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and Cu&#x0011f; et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported gains in proprioception in young adults from
exercises performed on a wobble and Swiss board, respectively. Similar results were obtained
by P&#x000e1;nics et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> following a specific
proprioceptive training program and by Han et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> who used vibration stimuli to leg muscles.</p><p>The common characteristic of the four latter modalities is a sustained high level of
dynamic, unpredictable challenge to muscles, tendons, and receptors, which, after an
adequate time, leads to better performance and adaptation to training. Though the action of
a cold stressor on soft tissue is entirely different, there are at least 2 similarities
between proprioceptive loading and low temperature effects on the final outcome. First, a
large number of proprioceptors receive unusual, uncertain, and/or noisy information
regarding body segment alignment. Therefore, the CNS searches for alternative, more credible
inputs that have the capacity to participate and play important roles, even after the
training or cold exposure is terminated. Secondly, the increase in blood circulation, which
is typically associated with increased physical activity, shows a similarly elevated level
during and just after cold application<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus, it seems plausible to propose that persons whose afferent system was subjected to
numerous disturbances from a cold stressor discovered some alternative mode of operation due
to the high adaptability of the CNS. For instance, Wassinger et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> did not find changes in active joint position replication
while applying shoulder cryotherapy and explained this finding as a compensatory activity of
mechanoreceptors which were not affected by the application of the cryotherapy. The newly
recruited mechanoreceptors would supplement the activity of the original ones had such
compensation been converted into adaptation, promoting enhanced proprioceptive acuity. This
process requires repeated confrontation with cold stimuli over time; therefore, positive
results were not seen in those undergoing less than 20 WBC sessions. With regard to SRT, it
has been shown that reaction time is fastest with an intermediate level of arousal, and
deteriorates when the participant is either too relaxed or too tense. An optimal level of
arousal was postulated to explain better performance during the reaction time test<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the elevated arousal following the series of WBC may have
facilitated the ability of our participants to discriminate between relevant and extraneous
cues during performance and to react faster to the visual stimuli. One last factor that may
have supported the improved neuromuscular performance of our participants was better
nourishment and oxygenation of body organs, which is associated with body cooling from
vasoconstriction<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In cryotherapy,
vasoconstriction leads to peripheral blood shunting, which results in larger blood flow and
oxygen delivery to other tissues and temporarily enhances their function. A cumulative
effect of 20 or 30 WBC sessions may have increased the capacity of systems vital for the JPS
and SRT tasks and contributed to the outcome improvement.</p><p>This is the first study to demonstrate that repeated short-term exposure of the whole body
to cryogenic temperature may promote better neuromuscular performance, provided a sufficient
number of sessions are performed. In conclusion, the number of prescribed sessions of WBC
should be re-examined to better serve the needs of patients. Due to the reasonable retention
period (3 days) of the enhanced performance, these results may also be of some interest to
athletic trainers by means of accelerating the return of injured athletes to full practice
and thereby facilitating optimal preparation for competition.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Pournot</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Bieuzen</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Louis</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Time-course of changes in inflammatory response after
