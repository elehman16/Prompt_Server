More specifically, we wanted to know whether menthol at different concentrations modulates the perception of burning and stinging pain induced by nicotine stimuli in the human nose. The study followed an eightfold randomized, double-blind, cross-over design including 20 participants. Thirty phasic nicotine stimuli at one of the two concentrations (99 and 134&#x000a0;ng/mL) were applied during the entire experiment every 1.5&#x000a0;min for 1&#x000a0;s; tonic menthol stimulation at one of the three concentrations (0.8, 1.5 and 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) or no-menthol (placebo control conditions) was introduced after the 15th nicotine stimulus. The perceived intensities of nicotine&#x02019;s burning and stinging pain sensations, as well as perceived intensities of menthol&#x02019;s odor, cooling and pain sensations, were estimated using visual analog scales. Recorded estimates of stinging and burning sensations induced by nicotine initially decreased (first half of the experiment) probably due to adaptation/habituation. Tonic menthol stimulation did not change steady-state nicotine pain intensity estimates, neither for burning nor for stinging pain. Menthol-induced odor and cooling sensations were concentration dependent when combined with low-intensity nicotine stimuli. Surprisingly, this dose dependency was eliminated when combining menthol stimuli with high-intensity nicotine stimuli. There was no such nicotine effect on menthol&#x02019;s pain sensation. In summary, we detected interactions caused by nicotine on menthol perception for odor and cooling but no effect was elicited by menthol on nicotine pain sensation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Nasal irritation</kwd><kwd>Sensitization</kwd><kwd>Transient receptor potential channel</kwd><kwd>Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="journal subjects"><kwd>Biomedicine</kwd><kwd>Neurosciences</kwd><kwd>Neurology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag 2012</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, taste and smell experiences are rarely elicited by just one chemical compound. For instance, sipping a glass of wine activates olfactory, gustatory, as well as somatosensory receptors, because food and beverages are composed of complex mixtures of flavors embedded in sophisticated matrices. In addition, recent evidence suggests that flavors do not act in isolation but rather influence each other&#x02019;s perception and they can even change detection thresholds (Dalton et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>; Diamond et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2005</xref>).</p><p>This paper focuses on the perception of chemicals in the human nose. Within the somatosensory system, interactions can occur on the same primary afferent nerve fiber through the activation of different receptor types, sometimes even by a single compound. Cross-modal interactions between the olfactory and somatosensory systems might happen at higher levels of the neuronal network (Cain and Murphy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1980</xref>; Schaefer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2002</xref>), as well as in the periphery involving axon reflexes that do not require synaptical transmission (Bayliss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1901</xref>; Bouvet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>; Finger and Bottger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1993</xref>; Silver and Finger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). Polymodal activities caused by single-flavor compounds seem to be a normal occurrence, because finding a compound that only activates one sensory channel, for example, olfaction, can be quite a challenge (Doty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1978</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that menthol activates olfactory receptors (minty smell) and the (trigeminal) somatosensory system (cooling and pain). Menthol&#x02019;s stimulating properties are complex, as different sensory modalities and qualities&#x02014;smell, cooling and pain&#x02014;do not have the same threshold. Low concentrations just above the detection threshold activate the olfactory receptors, which results in odor sensation; medium concentrations evoke a cooling sensation in addition to the smell; and higher concentrations add a pain sensation in addition to the smell and cooling (Cliff and Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1994</xref>; Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, it is now well established that menthol&#x02019;s cooling sensation is mediated through transient receptor potential melastatin type 8 (TRPM8) channel activation (Peier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>; McKemy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>), while its pain sensation results from the activation of transient receptor potential ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) channels.</p><p>Recently, it has been reported that nicotine at high concentrations activates TRPA1 channels (Talavera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>). It is also well known that nicotine activates other nociceptive transducers such as transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels (Liu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) (Renner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1998</xref>; Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1999</xref>;Alimohammadi and Silver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>; Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2006</xref>). Since both menthol and nicotine appear to activate TRPA1 channels in a similar manner (reversible, non-reactive), there is the possibility for TRPA1 channel interaction between these two compounds and, consequently, the modulation of perceived pain. A desensitizing effect of menthol on nicotine-induced activation of TRPA1 channels was recently observed in cultured cells overexpressing TRPA1 channels (Karashima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Talavera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, the only study that has investigated the interaction between menthol and nicotine on human sensory perception was conducted by Dessirier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2001</xref>), by applying both compounds to participants&#x02019; tongues. They found that the intensity of perceived irritation from nicotine was significantly diminished by pre-treatment with menthol. Since this study only covers a specific situation of potential menthol/nicotine interactions, more investigations need to be conducted to further our understanding of underlying mechanisms (Brand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>; Kreslake and Yerger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2010</xref>).</p><p>In this present study, we examined the interaction between menthol and nicotine, which has been shown to exert multiple sensations in a concentration-dependent manner (Hummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>; Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2000</xref>). Using an established model for the assessment of interactions between carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and menthol (Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>), we here investigated the effects of stimulation with three concentrations of menthol (eliciting odor, cooling and pain sensations) on the intensity perception of nicotine stimuli presented at two concentrations (eliciting burning and stinging pain sensations). We thought that the usage of different levels of nicotine and menthol associated with different sensory qualities would provide a broader view on potential interactions and sensory outcomes and further our understanding of menthol and nicotine effects on the human chemical senses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>In this study, we applied state-of-the-art stimulation and recording technologies. Stimuli were applied by an olfactometer that enabled exact and reproducible presentation of menthol and nicotine with defined time characteristics (Kobal and Plattig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1978</xref>; Kobal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1981</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>; Johnson and Sobel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>). Recordings were fully computerized including monitoring of participants&#x02019; vigilance and attention (Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>; Renner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Stimulation</title><p>Chemosensory nasal stimuli were applied using an olfactometer (OM4, Burghart Instruments, Wedel, Germany), which allowed the application of chemical stimuli without causing concomitant stimulation of mechano- or thermoreceptors (Kobal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>). Thirty short (phasic) nicotine stimuli (one of the two concentrations at 99.14 ng/mL &#x000b1;7&#x000a0;% and 133.57&#x000a0;ng/mL &#x000b1;13&#x000a0;% measured by high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC]; nicotine embedded in nitrogen) were applied to the left nostril (interstimulus interval of 1.5&#x000a0;min, stimulus duration of 1&#x000a0;s). The rise time of the stimulus concentration was below 100&#x000a0;ms (Thurauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1995</xref>). The olfactometer was operated with standard parameters (flow rate: 140&#x000a0;mL/min; humidity: &#x02265;80&#x000a0;% relative humidity; temperature: 36.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C). The two concentrations were selected based on previous findings (Hummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1992</xref>; Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2000</xref>). Nicotine exerts smell sensations at levels just above the detection threshold. With increasing concentrations, nicotine additionally evokes a burning sensation. At even higher concentrations, nicotine elicits a distinguishable, sharp, stinging pain in addition to the odor and burning sensations. The two concentrations chosen for this study exerted smell and burning sensations at the lower concentration and a greater level of stinging sensation at the higher concentration. We believe that the burning pain is due to C-fiber activation, while the stinging pain is due to A-delta fiber activation (Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1999</xref>).</p><p>Tonic menthol stimuli were applied in the second half of the experiment after the 15th nicotine stimulus. As in the pilot study, where we used CO<sub>2</sub> instead of nicotine (Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2000</xref>), three different concentrations of menthol were selected. The lowest concentration of 0.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL was determined in the pilot study to be just above the olfactory detection threshold. The medium concentration of 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL elicited an additional cooling sensation, and the highest concentration of 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL added a &#x02018;cutting&#x02019; pain sensation. In each of the experimental sessions, only one concentration of nicotine was combined with one concentration of menthol.</p><p>The concentrations for menthol and nicotine at the outlet of the olfactometer were routinely checked using analytical procedures previously described (Thurauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1999</xref>) as part of our quality assessment for clinical studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Test substances</title><p>Optically and chemically pure (&#x0003e;99&#x000a0;% measured by HPLC) S(-) nicotine was stored in glass tubes in a nitrogen atmosphere (&#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) until the experiments were started (Dr. Mark, Chemisches Laboratorium, Worms, Germany). Crystalline L(&#x02212;) menthol (&#x0003e;99&#x000a0;% measured by gas chromatography [GC]) was dissolved in 1,2&#x000a0;propanediol (&#x02265;99.5&#x000a0;% measured by GC) and was replaced before each experiment (Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany). Nitrogen (purity &#x0003e;99.9&#x000a0;%) and CO<sub>2</sub> (purity &#x0003e;99.9&#x000a0;%) gases were used to run the olfactometer (Messer Griesheim GmbH, Krefeld, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Psychophysical estimates and training</title><p>We trained participants to recognize the five different sensations associated with nicotine and menthol stimulation in the nose. Nicotine stimuli used in this experiment elicited a burning and stinging pain sensation, which was different to the more cutting pain sensation elicited by higher levels of menthol. Also, the nicotine stimuli were of a short duration (1&#x000a0;s) compared with the sensations elicited by menthol that lasted throughout the second half of the experiment but were absent in the first half (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Minty odor and cooling sensations were different to the other sensations participants experienced during this study. All participants became familiar with the five different sensations and could identify each one correctly at the end of the training session.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Experimental flow chart. During each experimental session, 30 phasic nicotine stimuli were applied to the nasal mucosa using an olfactometer (stimulus duration of 1&#x000a0;s; interstimulus interval of 1.5&#x000a0;min). Within one session, only one of the two nicotine concentrations was used (99&#x000a0;ng/mL or 134&#x000a0;ng/mL). In the second half of the session (i.e., after 22.5&#x000a0;min), the continuous background air flow was switched from clean air to one of the four menthol conditions (no menthol: placebo control; menthol-low: 0.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL; menthol-medium: 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL; menthol-high: 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL). Each of the four menthol conditions was combined with one of the two nicotine concentrations. All these combinations resulted in eight experimental sessions on eight different days. Acoustic rhinometry was performed in each participant before and after each session. On the VAS, participants rated the stinging and burning pain elicited by nicotine as well as odor, cooling and pain sensations caused by tonic background menthol stimulation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="221_2012_3063_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Participants were instructed to estimate both the intensity of the burning and the stinging pain after each nicotine stimulus on two separate visual analog scales (VAS) displayed on a computer screen. This resulted in a series of 30 estimates for each of the two nicotine concentrations (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Immediately after estimating nicotine burning and stinging intensities, participants estimated odor, cooling and pain intensities associated with menthol on a new computer display. This resulted in a series of thirty estimates for each concentration of menthol and placebo control and for each of the two nicotine concentrations used (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Participants did not know (a) which nicotine level or which menthol level was actually applied, (b) that concentrations for nicotine were maintained throughout the experimental session, (c) that the menthol concentration did not change once it was switched on and (d) at what time menthol was switched on.
<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Time course of estimated mean values (19 participants) of pain intensity estimates for 30 nicotine stimuli of low (99&#x000a0;ng/mL) and high (134&#x000a0;ng/mL) concentrations that were presented throughout the entire experimental session. Interstimulus interval: 1.5&#x000a0;min; total duration of experiment: 45&#x000a0;min. During the second half of each experimental session, an additional tonic menthol background stimulus was switched on (<italic>shadowed</italic>) and maintained throughout the rest of the experiment. Three concentrations of menthol (menthol-low: 0.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL, menthol-medium: 1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL and menthol-high: 3.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) and a fourth condition with clean air (no menthol) as placebo control were combined with each of the two nicotine concentrations resulting in a total of eight experiments. Participants estimated the burning pain and stinging pain sensation elicited by nicotine separately on visual analog scales (VAS) after each nicotine stimulus. After an initial sensitization, there was a uniform decline in perceived pain intensity (burning and stinging) that was not modulated by the background menthol/placebo control conditions (EU&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;estimation unit). The estimated mean values were derived from a linear mixed model for repeated measures using a least-square means statement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="221_2012_3063_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p>As described above, we used two sets of VASs that were displayed as columns on a computer screen in front of the participants. They were trained to adjust the size of the columns to the level of perceived intensity by using a joystick. The initial size of a displayed column was equal to 100 estimation units (EU). At the beginning of each experimental session, the size of the column was anchored to a pain sensation elicited by CO<sub>2</sub> (60&#x000a0;% v/v, 500&#x000a0;ms duration) and applied using the same olfactometer. Reducing the size of the column to nothing (0 EU) meant that no stimulus was detected. Elongating it above the initial size meant that the perceived intensity was higher than the initial anchoring sensation. The maximum length of the column was twice the original size and assigned to the value of 200 EUs. This and similar methods have been used in numerous studies carried out previously in pain research (Kobal and Hummel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1989</xref>; Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>; Renner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007</xref>).</p><p>During the entire experiment, participants wore earphones through which they heard white noise (50&#x000a0;dB SPL) in order to cover the switching sounds coming from the olfactometer. They were also asked to perform a simple tracking task on the same computer screen once they had completed their intensity estimations. For that, they used the same joystick to keep a small red square inside a larger green one that randomly moved around on the computer screen (Kobal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>). This procedure helped to stabilize the participants&#x02019; vigilance and attention but the corresponding data were not analyzed further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Acoustic rhinometry</title><p>Nasal cavity geometry was assessed using acoustic rhinometry before and after each experiment.

More specifically, we wanted to know whether menthol at different levels modulates the perception of the burning and stinging sensations induced by nicotine stimuli. In order to separate the modulatory effects from the direct sensory effects produced by these two compounds, we chose to administer nicotine stimuli phasically, that is, short stimuli repeated every 1.5&#x000a0;min, and the modulatory menthol stimuli tonically. This also helped participants to clearly discriminate between the intensity of the different sensations they had to estimate. In the first half of the experiment, phasic nicotine stimuli were applied alone in order to stabilize participants&#x02019; estimations after initial sensitization and desensitization processes. After this, the tonic menthol stimulus at one of the three different concentrations was administered for the entire remainder of the session. Stinging and burning estimates for nicotine significantly decreased during the first half of the experiment reaching the intended stability at perceivable moderate pain levels in the second half with no further significant decrease in pain ratings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, time effect &#x0201c;during&#x0201d; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Menthol stimulation, at all three concentrations used, did not affect nicotine pain perception, either by reducing or by enhancing intensity estimates for the stinging or burning sensations. There was one isolated exception; nicotine&#x02019;s stinging pain decreased more in the placebo (no-menthol) condition compared with the menthol-medium condition (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> bottom row second panel from the left). Since there are visible differences in baseline&#x02014;although not statistically significant&#x02014;this singular statistical result is probably irrelevant and clearly does not justify a statement that menthol could increase nicotine-induced pain perception.</p><p>Surprisingly, nicotine stimuli eliminated the concentration dependence of intensity ratings for menthol&#x02019;s odor and cooling sensations, but not for pain sensations. However, this modulation was only exerted by high nicotine concentration. In the case of weaker concomitant nicotine stimuli, concentration-dependent ratings could be observed for all intensity estimates of menthol&#x02019;s odor, cooling and pain sensations. We do not know to what extent the weaker nicotine stimuli might have affected menthol&#x02019;s perception, because a zero nicotine condition was not included in the study design. As already mentioned, this observation came to our surprise and was not theoretically anticipated.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Effects of sex, nasal congestion and pharmacology</title><p>The study population was balanced for sex but the protocol was not designed to investigate the differences in sex specifically. Nevertheless, we observed lower pain estimates for nicotine- and menthol-induced pain in females compared with males but only in the weaker nicotine stimulation condition. In the literature, examination of differences in sex for pain intensity perception seems to be inconclusive. There are reports of a higher (Cometto-Muniz and Noriega <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1985</xref>; Shusterman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2002</xref>; Olofsson and Nordin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>), as well as a lower (Nunez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1997</xref>; Hashmi and Davis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2009</xref>; Breimhorst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>), pain sensitivity in females. We do not believe that, in this study, the lack of nicotine&#x02019;s pain modulation by menthol was dependent on this effect of sex, as it was lacking in both conditions, that is, when stimulating with high and low nicotine levels.</p><p>Nasal congestion may result in different adaptation processes which may have influenced our data. However, the reported findings were obtained during steady-state nicotine pain perception (second half). Interestingly, there was only a tendency to higher congestion on the stimulated side and only in the case of lower-level nicotine stimulation. Since the lack of pain modulation by menthol was observed with and without congestion, we do not think that congestion is a relevant confounder. Also, we are not aware of a mechanism that would explain the marginal congestion influences on menthol&#x02019;s odor and cooling perceptions but not on its pain perception (see &#x02018;Nicotine&#x02019;s action on menthol estimates&#x02019;).</p><p>We cannot rule out the possibility that an unspecific pharmacological effect occurred through the modulation of central nervous system activity by the portion that might have been absorbed through the nasal mucosa, because we did not measure plasma concentrations of nicotine. On the other hand, it could be expected that a more uniform development of the potential unspecific effects from low-to-high nicotine concentrations was similar for all sensory channels, but not the observed switch from discrimination to the lack of discrimination between different stimulus strengths, which, moreover, was dependent on the sensory channel, that is, true for odor and cooling, but not true for pain.</p><p>Interestingly, Rosenblatt et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1998</xref>) found that smokers had elevated thresholds for nicotine stimuli, when sniffed from a vial, compared with non-smokers, but not for menthol. Abstinence from smoking (16&#x02013;20&#x000a0;h) lowered the threshold but not to the level of non-smokers. Our study population consisted of smokers only, so we conclude that this phenomenon did not influence our data. In addition, we conducted our study following a cross-over design, so any variation in threshold should have been equally distributed across experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Menthol&#x02019;s action on nicotine estimates</title><p>It is known that menthol activates recombinant mouse TRPA1 channels at low concentrations and inhibits them at higher concentrations; however, this does not seem to be the case for human TRPA1 channels (Xiao et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>). Our human data support this as we do not have any indication that high concentrations of menthol would result in decreased pain perception. Despite the fact that nicotine and menthol both activate TRPA1 channels (Talavera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>), this potential competition did not result in a modulation of perceived pain intensities in either the sensitizing or the potential inhibitory/desensitizing direction. Levels of nicotine used in this study probably did not reach concentrations in the mucosa that are required to activate TRPA1 channels (Talavera et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>), eliminating the potential for interaction. Hence, the perceived burning and stinging sensations of nicotine stimuli most likely originated from the activation of nAChRs (Thuerauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2006</xref>). So far, there are no published data on a potential interaction of menthol with nicotine at the nAChR. Due to the lack of evidence from our psychophysical data, there is no reason to postulate such an interaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Nicotine&#x02019;s action on menthol estimates</title><p>Although this study was not designed to investigate the effects of nicotine stimuli on the perception of menthol stimulation, the effect of eliminating participants&#x02019; discrimination of different menthol levels for odor and cooling by the strong nicotine stimuli seemed to be robust. The question about the underlying mechanisms, that is, where in the information processing chain did this happen and how, cannot be answered on the basis of these data. However, since the effect occurred in two different sensory systems, there is room for some speculation. The loss of discrimination of menthol&#x02019;s different concentrations was observed in the olfactory and TRPM8-related somatosensory system but not in the TRPA1- and nAChR-related nociceptive system (see above). Interactions of this kind could chiefly take place in the periphery or central nervous system.</p><p>For the periphery, there is the possibility that nicotine exerts a, to date, unknown modulation of (a) olfactory receptors that are sensitive to menthol and (b) of TRPM8 channels. Both modulations require a higher rather than a lower level of nicotine. A possible explanation for the lack of an effect on pain is that (c) nicotine, at the concentrations used in this experiment, is not a competitor of menthol at the TRPA1 channels, so the nicotine stimuli at the levels used only activated nAChRs.</p><p>In a recent study in mice using plethysmography as a surrogate for airway irritation, menthol had an inhibitory effect on acrolein, acetic acid and cyclohexanone-induced nociception (Willis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). Since all these compounds activate TRPA1 channels and we believe that the nicotine concentrations in our study were not high enough to stimulate TRPA1 channels, these results do not help us to interpret our data nor do they contradict our findings.</p><p>Next to potential peripheral interactions at the receptor level, there are possibilities for interactions across sensory channels based on axon reflexes as well (Bayliss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1901</xref>; Silver and Finger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). Indeed, studies in rats have demonstrated that some trigeminal ganglion cells with sensory endings in the nasal epithelium also have branches reaching directly into the olfactory bulb and even into the spinal trigeminal complex (Schaefer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2002</xref>). These unique morphological structures could be the substrate for the modulation of incoming sensory information with respect to smell, pain, temperature and touch. It is thought that axon reflexes, initiated where collaterals branch off the afferent nerve, could modify the sensitivity of peripheral receptive structures by the release of peptides such as substance P and calcitonin gene&#x02013;related peptide (CGRP) in the tissue innervated by these collaterals. Indeed, it has been found that electrical stimulation of the ethmoidal nerve inhibits olfactory bulb activity in cats and rabbits (Kerr and Hagbarth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1955</xref>; Stone et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1968</xref>). In Andre Holley&#x02019;s laboratory, stimulation of the trigeminal nerve was also found to inhibit olfactory receptor cell activity (Bouvet et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1987</xref>). In humans, there are a number of reports of interactions between the somatosensory and olfactory systems that seem to be inhibitory if both stimuli were applied in a close temporal context (Cain and Murphy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1980</xref>; Brand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). In our laboratory, we tried to find interactions between these two systems in humans by electrical stimulation of the facial skin on the perception of olfactory stimuli, but were unsuccessful (Livermore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1993</xref>). For the results described in this paper, we do not think that they fit into an axon reflex type of mechanism. Our data reveal a dose-dependent interaction between nicotine stimuli and menthol&#x02019;s odor and cooling intensity perceptions. This interaction is specific, because menthol&#x02019;s pain intensity perception is excluded, although the nociceptive neuronal activity should pass through the same spinal trigeminal complex as the cooling information. Also, there is not just inhibition as one might expect from previous work, but a differentiated influence: (1) increase in the intensity estimates for the weaker menthol stimulus (on odor and cooling), (2) no effect on the estimates for the menthol-medium stimulus and (3) a reduction in intensity estimates for the strong menthol stimulus (on odor and cooling). To our knowledge, there is no mechanism based on axon reflexes that could explain these divergent phenomena. Hence, we favor a more central location of the observed interactions.</p><p>For the central nervous system, one could assume that information about noxious stimuli is the most relevant input for the organism so that, at more intense pain perception, the smell or cooling information is less relevant for the integrity of the organism and therefore while still perceived, will not be differentiated. In the case of lower pain perception from the less concentrated nicotine stimuli, the discrimination between different intensities of cooling and odor is retained, because of their relatively higher relevance. This would represent a modulation of selective attention, which has been shown to affect pain perception (Marchand and Arsenault <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2002</xref>; Villemure and Bushnell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2002</xref>) but not, to our knowledge, cooling and odor perception by competing pain. However, a study where participants were exposed to visual and noxious heat stimuli found that attention was preferentially shifted to the painful stimulus (Miron et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1989</xref>), which supports our interpretation that, in case of competing sensory information, pain processing wins (Bain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1868</xref>). However, both hypotheses&#x02014;the peripheral and the central&#x02014;warrant further investigations. In order to determine whether the observed effects are peripheral or central, it would be advisable to conduct a study in which recordings are obtained from peripheral sensory structures. Fortunately, such recording techniques are available: The electro-olfactogram (EOG) is a summated generator potential of olfactory receptor cells (Kobal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1981</xref>; Hummel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1996</xref>) and therefore can be used to demonstrate peripheral olfactory effects. The negative mucosa potential (NMP) that correlates with somatosensory activities is a peripheral response as well (Kobal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1985</xref>; Thurauf et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>). We plan to further analyze the observed phenomena by using both recording techniques combined with chemosensory evoked potentials (L&#x000f6;tsch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1997</xref>; Knecht and Hummel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2004</xref>). A zero nicotine condition needs to be included as well in order to show the total modulatory effect of nicotine on menthol intensity perception.</p><p>In summary, results from this study demonstrate that stinging and burning intensity estimates for repeated phasic nicotine stimuli significantly decreased during the first half of the experiment. Additional continuous menthol stimulation did not alter the nicotine-induced steady-state pain sensations. Surprisingly, there was a nicotine effect on the menthol odor and cooling sensations, indicating potential modality-specific interactions at peripheral receptors or selective attention-related interactions at higher levels in the central nervous system.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all participants for their involvement and patience.
