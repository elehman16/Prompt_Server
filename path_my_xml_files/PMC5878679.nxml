Care</italic> by Koivusalo et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In a
randomized controlled trial, namely the Finnish Gestational Diabetes Prevention Study
(RADIEL), Koivusalo et al. report that lifestyle intervention reduced the incidence of
gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by 39% in pregnant women with a history of GDM and/or
prepregnancy obesity (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The authors highlighted
that this significant reduction in GDM incidence was achieved through a moderate lifestyle
intervention including only three visits to the study nurse and one group visit to the
dietitian during pregnancy, which was much less intensive than previous trials for the
prevention of type 2 diabetes among individuals with impaired glucose tolerance such as the
U.S. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The
RADIEL trial (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) underscored the importance of
adopting a healthy lifestyle in ensuring a healthy pregnancy.</p><p>In contrast, previous randomized controlled trials of metformin during pregnancy did not
show a significant reduction in the incidence of GDM (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In the Metformin in Obese
Nondiabetic Pregnant Women (MOP) trial, metformin (3.0 g/day) administration from 12 to 18
weeks of gestation until delivery did not reduce risk of GDM; the incidence of GDM was
12.4% in the intervention group vs. 11.3% in the control group (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In the Efficacy of Metformin in Pregnant Obese Women (EMPOWaR) trial
among obese pregnant women, the intervention group that received metformin
(500&#x02013;2,500 mg/day) from 12 to 16 weeks of gestation until delivery had a lower rate
of developing GDM than the control group (18% vs. 24%), but the reduction was not
statistically significant (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Although many factors
could explain the divergent findings in the lifestyle (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) versus metformin (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) intervention trials, these findings might indicate a
more profound reduction in GDM through lifestyle intervention than metformin. Although this
postulation is certainly warranted for confirmation in more studies, including those with
comparative effectiveness design, similar results (i.e., stronger reduction in diabetes
risk through lifestyle intervention than metformin) were observed in the DPP trial (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that the results reported by Koivusalo et al. (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) were from pregnant women among whom the lifestyle intervention was
initiated in the first or second trimester of pregnancy. It is possible that lifestyle
intervention with a longer duration (e.g., if initiated before pregnancy) would have a
greater effect. A large prospective cohort study has shown that adherence to a healthy,
low-risk lifestyle (i.e., maintaining a healthy body weight, consuming a healthy diet,
exercising regularly, and not smoking) before pregnancy was associated with a substantially
lower risk of GDM (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Specifically, women at low
risk for all the four lifestyle factors had more than 80% lower risk than those without any
of the low-risk factors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Fortunately, in addition
to the enrollment of pregnant women (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>), the original
RADIEL trial also recruited women before pregnancy for lifestyle intervention and
follow-up. With the growing epidemic of obesity and GDM among women of reproductive age,
findings from this trial regarding the effects of prepregnancy lifestyle intervention on
reducing GDM incidence will be of great interest and importance from both clinical and
public health perspectives.</p></body><back><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Funding.</bold> This work was partly supported by the University of Iowa College
