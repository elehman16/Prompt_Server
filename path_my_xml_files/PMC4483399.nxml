psychosocial factors in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder. [Subjects] Thirty
patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, who also complained of neck pain. [Methods]
The cervical exercise group (n = 15) participated in cervical exercises for 30&#x02005;min, 3
times/week for 6 weeks, and the control group (n = 16) underwent conventional physical
therapy alone, without exercise. The exercises were performed in the following order:
cervical relaxation, local muscle stabilization, and global muscle stabilization using a
sling system. [Results] Compared to the control group, the cervical exercise group
demonstrated significant decreases as follows: Visual analogue scale score, 4.2 vs. 1.0;
Neck disability index, 3.9 vs. 1.9; and depression on the Symptom checklist-90-revised,
9.4 vs. 4.3 and on the Hopkins symptom checklist-25, 6.3 vs. 2.8. However, anxiety on the
Symptom checklist-90-revised (3.1 vs. 1.3) was not significantly different. Effect sizes
were as follows: Visual analogue scale score, 1.8; Neck disability index, 0.9; depression,
1.0; and anxiety on Symptom checklist-90-revised and Hopkins symptom checklist-25, 0.6 and
0.8, respectively. [Conclusion] Cervical exercise is effective in improving neck pain,
disability, and efficacy of psychological treatment for depression in patients with
post-traumatic stress disorder.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Post-traumatic stress disorder</kwd><kwd>Neck pain</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial factors</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a general anxiety disorder that was first
introduced in 1980 in an American Psychiatric Association publication, Diagnosis of Mental
Disability and Statistical Manual<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. PTSD
occurs following an unexpected traumatic event or life-threatening physical and mental
shock, and is characterized by symptoms of hyper-arousal, re-experience of the shock, and
emotional avoidance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PTSD includes mental and physical disabilities and is often associated with pain<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic pain interferes with the efficacy
of psychological treatment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and PTSD
patients with chronic pain experience greater pain and pain-related impairment than non-PTSD
patients with chronic pain<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, the
occurrence of pain and disability involving the musculoskeletal system affects psychiatric
health and performance capability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. PTSD
causes physical and psychological problems<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. PTSD-related psychological problems (depression and anxiety) affect
neck and shoulder pain, and a previous study was able to predict neck pain in 71.1% of 200
subjects with depression and anxiety<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
regions of neck pain show higher electromyography values due to muscle tension, and a
broader area is affected by the pain with increase in stress<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PTSD subjects have high levels of depression, which has been reported to be associated with
neck pain, although not all subjects have neck pain. Neck pain is considered to influence
psychological and social factors. However, studies on the relationship between specific neck
pain and PTSD are still lacking. This studies provide evidence that exercise potentially
relieves PTSD symptoms. Diaz and Motta reported a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms in
91% of the children who performed walking exercise<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. To date, studies on therapy for PTSD have been limited to
medication and cognitive behavioral therapy, and only a few studies have focused on the
accompanying neck pain. Studies employing exercise as a therapy for PTSD-related neck pain
may help provide better treatment for the physical and psychological ailments associated
with PTSD. In particular, exercise using a sling system that allows pain-free range of
motion and minimizes the effect of gravity may be an appropriate exercise therapy for
patients with pain.</p><p>Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of cervical exercise (CE) on neck pain,
functional changes, and the psychological status of PTSD patients with psychological
disabilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial consisting of an intervention group that
participated in CE and a control group that did not undergo any exercise therapy. At the
Department of Physical Therapy of Psychological Center in Korea, from October 2013 to
February 2014, 46 individuals were diagnosed with PTSD after a calamity. This study was
approved by the psychological center, and all the participants provided their written
informed consent. Of these, 31 were included in the study, excluding 20 who did not meet the
criteria for neck pain and 7 who decided not to attend. The patients were assessed using the
Post-traumatic stress diagnosis index (r = 0.92) including the DSM-IV Diagnostic Criteria
and Severity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Those with neck pain for
&#x0003e;3 months and with Neck disability index (NDI) &#x0003c;15 were selected for assessment of
neck pain (to prevent pain from aggravation during the exercise). Exclusion criteria
included a history of cervical surgery within the previous 3 months, arthritis or cervical
spine fracture, accompanying neurological damage, malignant neoplasm or vascular disease,
and psychiatric problems with an inability to understand the details of the questionnaires.
In addition, those who had started receiving psychiatric drugs or whose dosage of
psychiatric drugs was changed within the previous 2 months were excluded from the analysis.
The CE group (n = 15) received exercise therapy for the neck muscles and joints and
conventional physical therapy (hot pack, ultrasound), and the control group (n = 16)
received only conventional physical therapy. Group assignment was determined by a coin toss;
the patient was assigned to the CE group if the result was heads and to the control group if
it was tails. As superficial thermotherapy for pain control in both groups, therapist A
applied a hot pack for 20&#x02005;min to provide heat to deeper tissues and conducted ultrasound
therapy for 5&#x02005;min. This was done prior to the intervention, 6 weeks after pre-assessment and
intervention, and upon a subsequent evaluation. Ethics approval was obtained from the Ethics
Committees of Daejeon University (1040647-201403-HR-008-03).</p><p>The CEs selected for this study were those proposed by Kirkesola<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both groups had a 10-min warm-up session, which involved
treadmill exercise and stretching prior to 4 different CEs. First, for relaxation, with the
head neutral in the supine position, the subjects actively moved from side to side on a
non-elastic strap. Second, to bend and stretch the neck, in the same position with the head
neutral, the subjects stretched their heads using an elastic strap, and bent lying face
downward. Third, as a stretching exercise, in the supine position, using a sling system
(Redcord Tainer, Redcord AS, Norway) with a non-elastic strap supporting the back of the
skull, the subjects kept their chin down for 30 sec. Fourth, to stabilize the cervical
region, subjects kept their chin down with the non-elastic strap supporting the pelvis,
shoulder, and occipital bone at knee height. The first exercise was conducted for 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;min;
the second exercise consisted of 3 sets (hold: 30 sec, rest: 10 sec) of 15 repetitions; and
the third and fourth exercises consisted of 3 sets (hold: 30 sec, rest: 10 sec). Each
intervention was conducted 3 times per week for 6 weeks.</p><p>To measure the intensity of the pain involving the musculoskeletal system, a 10-cm Visual
analogue scale (VAS) was used. For measurement of neck function, the Neck disability index
(NDI) was used; this questionnaire was developed based on the 10-question Oswestry
disability index, focusing on activities of daily life restricted by neck pain. For
measurement of psychological factors, the Symptom checklist-90-revised (SCL-90-R) was used;
this is a 90-question self-reported testing tool for adults to measure psychopathological
symptoms, consisting of 5 factors including somatization, obsessive-compulsive syndrome,
interpersonal susceptibility, depression, and anxiety<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the present study, depression (13 questions) included symptoms
clinically corresponding to clinical depression, including feelings of withdrawal or
emotional inactiveness due to lack of interest in life, lack of motivation, loss of
vitality, hopelessness, and suicidal thoughts. Anxiety (10 questions) included physical
symptoms related to tension, restlessness, nervousness, fear, and anxiety. The internal
consistency of this scale is 0.77&#x02013;0.90<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The Hopkins symptom checklist-25 (HSCL-25) gathers information about depression symptoms.
The original version consisted of 90 questions; the HSCL-25 is an abbreviated version with
25 questions<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The internal consistency
of this scale is 0.93<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Shapiro-Wilk
test was used to verify the normal distribution of the data. For parametric data,
independent t-tests were used to compare differences in between-group means, and paired
t-tests were used to compare within-group means, with the significance level set at p &#x0003c;
0.05. The effect sizes for each mean difference were calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s d<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Statistical analyses were carried out
using a statistical software package (SPSS for Windows version 18.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)
and G*Power 3.1 (Christian-Albrechts-Universit&#x000e4;t, Kiel, Germany). Data are presented as mean
(standard deviation).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There were no significant differences in age, height, weight, body mass index, time after

SCL-90-R (indicative of psychological status) and the HSCL-25 in PTSD subjects who underwent
CE for neck pain. Therefore, it is suggested that CE improves neck pain and NDI, and has
favorable effects on psychological problems, depression, and anxiety in PTSD subjects with
neck pain. Moreover, the CE group showed enhanced indices in the status of neck pain,
disability, and depression compared with the control group. It is surmised that CE may
initiate faster recovery of cervical function and psychological symptoms in PTSD
subjects.</p><p>The subjects in this study differ from those with only neck pain, because in this case, the
neck pain derives from their psychological problems. In general, subjects diagnosed with
PTSD of 48&#x02013;55% have major depressive disorders<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Treatment of PTSD patients mainly
involves psychotherapy, whereas musculoskeletal problems are overlooked. In fact, a high
proportion of neck pain has been reported in subjects with psychological problems<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CE used in this study is effective for
treating cervical problems<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Except for the change in anxiety, there were significant
differences between the CE and control groups. Therefore, CE may be clinically relevant as
it helps to resolve neck pain and disability and improve psychological problems.</p><p>The present study showed that 6 weeks of CE after conventional physical therapy improved
neck pain, reduced neck disability, and enhanced the depression index. The improvement in
neck pain and NDI in the CE group is consistent with that reported in prior studies<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. CE also improved depression as measured by the SCL-90-R and HSCL-25.
Subjects with a high depression level are more susceptible to neck pain<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chronic pain and depression often occur simultaneously;
individuals with pain have an increased risk of depression, and those with depression have
an increased risk of pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. A recent
systematic review examined risk factors and determinants of neck pain in the general
population and found consistent evidence of musculoskeletal system problems and
psychological factors in healthy individuals<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is in agreement with the current study, indicating that
musculoskeletal and specific neck pain may be predictors of depression.</p><p>The current study has significance as a promising therapeutic strategy for subjects with
psychological problems like PTSD, and it provides preliminary results for a specific
intervention for psychological problems and pain involving the musculoskeletal system.
Currently, there are no studies or guidelines on CE for PTSD subjects. In the present study,
CE consisted of a sling system, which has beneficial effects and is safe. Additionally, this
program was designed as a method most frequently used by patients with common chronic neck
pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the sling-based CE
minimizes the effect of gravity, patients need to exert less effort; moreover, it is a
regular exercise that utilizes the therapist&#x02019;s manual resistance, weights, and elastic bands
and applies closed-kinetic chain or open-kinetic chain exercises. Furthermore, this exercise
has no serious side effects and is used in physical therapy intervention and rehabilitation.
CE is a promising approach for subjects with neck pain as it reduces pain and disability and
improves the psychological status.</p><p>This study has some limitations. The PTSD in the study subjects was caused by a calamity;
it is therefore difficult to generalize the findings to all PTSD patients. In addition, as
the sample size was relatively small, the results may not be statistically significant, and
the study duration may be too short to demonstrate the effects of the CE. Lastly, there is a
lack of questions for measuring neck pain and disability with psychological factors, making
it difficult to generalize the results.</p><p>In this study, an exercise intervention was applied specifically to subjects with neck
pain. Future studies should address other musculoskeletal problems and changes in
psychological factors, and additional interventions for patients with PTSD and neck pain
should be developed.</p><p>In conclusion, CE reduces pain levels and cervical disability as well as the level of
depression in PTSD subjects with neck pain. However, it has no impact on anxiety.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Daejeon University research fund (2014).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Asmundson</surname><given-names>GJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Frombach</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>McQuaid</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dimensionality of posttraumatic stress symptoms: a
