However, there is worldwide increased interest in cervical epidural anesthesia (CEA) due to evolved surgical techniques, newer local anesthetics and adjuvant drugs. Regional anesthesia has advantages of the less postoperative stress response, superior analgesia, decreased intraoperative blood loss, early ambulation, and decreased hospitalization cost.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>CEA with a conventional epidural dosage of local anesthetics produced moderate restrictive pulmonary syndrome with subsequent oxygen desaturation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] To minimize these adverse effects, diluted concentration local anesthetics has been successfully studied in previous studies to conduct surgeries under epidural anesthesia.</p><p>There has always been a search for adjuvants to the epidural anesthesia with drugs that prolong the duration of analgesia but with lesser adverse effects. The search for the ideal adjuvant led us to try the novel alpha-2 adrenergic agent, dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists have been used as sedative, analgesic, and perioperative sympatholytic. Furthermore, these drugs are used as an adjuvant in various methods of administration, such as epidural, intrathecal, and plexus blocks either alone or in combination with another drug to prolong and intensify the local anesthetic agents.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a potent alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, is approximately 8-time more selective towards the alpha-2 adrenoceptor than clonidine.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There are no such studies which compared the epidural dose equivalence of clonidine, but observation of various studies have stated that epidural dose of clonidine is 1.5 times the dose of dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Till date, no studies have compared dexmedetomidine with clonidine with respect to duration of the block and postoperative analgesia as an adjuvant to low dose ropivacaine in CEA. The current study was planned as double-blind prospective randomized clinically controlled study at our institute with an aim to compare the analgesic and sedative effects of both these drugs when used for CEA as an adjuvant to ropivacaine in patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After ethical committee approval and written informed consent, a double-blind randomized prospective clinical study was carried out on 150 American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) grades I and II female patients, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, undergoing modified radical mastectomy under CEA. The study was conducted in two groups of 75 patients each. The patients were randomly assigned using &#x0201c;computerized random number table&#x0201d; to one of the following groups:</p><p>Group C: Ropivacaine 0.0375% (15 mL) + clonidine 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg</p><p>Group D: Ropivacaine 0.0375% (15 mL) + dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg</p><p>Patients on adrenoreceptor agonist or antagonist therapy, with known hypersensitivity to local anesthetic drugs, aortic stenosis, with a history of left ventricular failure, with atrioventricular conduction block bleeding disorders, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, were excluded from the study. Details of the anesthetic technique and study protocol were explained to the patients at the preoperative visit. Patients were not premedicated. No intravenous (IV) sedative medications were used.</p><p>On arrival in the operation room, an IV line was secured with 18-gauge cannula and ringer lactate drip was started. The patients were monitored with noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximeter and baseline heart rate (HR), blood pressure, and oxygen saturation were recorded. An anesthesiologist who was not involved in the data collection or intervention prepared the drug syringes. Patients were made to sit on a chair with head slightly flexed and supported on edge operation table; hands were rested on patient's thigh. The cervical epidural block was administered with loss of resistance to air with 18-gauge Tuohy needle C7-T1 space and catheter was secured 3&#x02013;4 cm into epidural space and fixed to skin after tunneling the catheter, patient were made to lie supine and a test dose of 3 mL of 2% lignocaine hydrochloride solution containing adrenaline 1:200,000 was injected. After 4&#x02212;6 min of administering the test dose, patients in Group C received 15 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine and 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine; and patients in Group D received 15 mL solution of 0.375% ropivacaine and 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine. The bilateral sensation ice cube was used to evaluate and check the sensory level at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 min intervals after the epidural administration of the drugs.</p><p>The following epidural block characteristics were observed and recorded: Onset of analgesia; upper and lower dermatomal level of sensory analgesia, grading of sedation was evaluated by a five-point scale (1 - alert and wide awake, 2 - arousable to verbal command, 3 - arousable with gentle tactile stimulation, 4 - arousable with vigorous shaking, and 5 - unarousable). Sedation scores were recorded just before the initiation of surgery and thereafter, every 20 min during the surgical procedure. The onset of postoperative pain defined as the time from completion of surgery to the onset of visual analog scale &#x0003e;4 were recorded.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To calculate the required study size, we took into account the results of a previous study.

Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, we attempted to recruit 75 patients in each group</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the program GraphPad Prism software package versus 5 (GraphPad Inc., CA, USA). Numerical variables were presented as mean, and standard deviation and categorical variables were presented as frequency (%). One-way ANOVA was used for between group comparisons of numerical variables, if its assumptions were fulfilled, otherwise for nonparametric, the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used. Tukey's honest significant difference test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test was used, whenever appropriate, as post-hoc tests. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for between group comparisons between categorical variables.

However, there has been rising interest in the use of cervical and thoracic epidural anesthesia due to advances in surgical techniques, newer local anesthetics, and adjuvant drugs. Regional anesthesia has advantages of the less postoperative stress response, superior analgesia, decreased intraoperative blood loss, early ambulation, and decreased hospitalization cost.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] CEA for modified radical mastectomy is one of the regional anesthetic techniques that can be done by using a low dose of local anesthetic in combination with epidural adjuvants for better analgesia with minimum weakness of respiratory muscle and sedation.</p><p>CEA is not used routinely in everyday anesthesia practice, mainly because routine high concentration local anesthetic drugs associated with moderate restrictive pulmonary syndrome with subsequent oxygen desaturation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] To minimize these adverse effects, we used 0.375% ropivacaine in combination with either clonidine or dexmedetomidine.</p><p>The pharmacologic properties of alpha-2 agonists as lumbar/thoracic epidural adjuvants have been studied vastly and been used clinically to achieve the desired effects in regional anesthesia,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] but none of the studies compared alpha-2 agonists as adjuvant to local anesthetic in CEA. The quicker onset of action of local anesthetics, rapid establishment of both sensory and motor blockade, prolonged duration of analgesia; dose-sparing action of local anesthetics and stable cardiovascular parameters makes these agents a very effective adjuvant in regional anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>This study was undertaken to compare the analgesic and sedative effects of alpha-2 agonists through CEA. The results of the study has shown that the addition of either 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine or 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine as adjuvant to low dose epidural ropivacaine not only prolongs the duration of analgesia, but also decreases concentration of local anesthetic required to produce optimum anesthesia during the surgical procedure. In comparison epidural clonidine, dexmedetomidine has shortened onset of sensory block and prolonged the duration of analgesia. Further, the epidural addition of dexmedetomidine with ropivacaine produced better sedation in comparison to clonidine. Overall the sedation scores were highly significant statistically with the administration of dexmedetomidine.</p><p>The hemodynamic parameters, as is evident from Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, remained stable throughout the study period which reaffirms the established effects of alpha-2 agonists in providing a hemodynamically stable intraoperative and perioperative.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Although a slight decrease in HR and MAP was observed in both the groups, it never fell down to more than 30% of the baseline values.</p><p>The respiratory rate and oxygen saturation did not change significantly from baseline as we used 0.375% of ropivacaine, but the depth of respiration may be decreases if 0.5% or 0.75% of ropivacaine is given. Many studies have observed the adverse events such as bradycardia, hypotension, and acute ventilatory failure due to the administration of high concentration local anesthetics.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The adverse events of both these drugs was quite comparable and favorable as none of the patient in either group had profound deep sedation, and only two patients in dexmedetomidine group had oxygen desaturation &#x0003c;90% which was corrected with prompt oxygen administration by simple mask. Co-operation of surgical team for CEA was excellent, and patient satisfaction was optimum due to the relative ease of the procedure, early ambulation, and good postoperative analgesia.</p><p>Our results should be considered in light of several limitations. First, lack of data on patient feedback and surgeons acceptance of CEA. Further prospective studies with particular stress on patient acceptance of CEA and postoperative feedback from both patients and the surgical team needed to mitigate the shortcomings of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Use of 0.375% ropivacaine with alpha-2 agonists as adjuvants is safer for CEA for radical mastectomy. It provides good surgical anesthesia with a lesser degree of motor blockade and the respiratory effects. In comparison to clonidine, dexmedetomidine is a better adjuvant for CEA as far as patient comfort, stable hemodynamic parameters, and intraoperative and postoperative analgesia is concerned. Dexmedetomidine also provides superior sedation during the surgical procedure under regional anesthesia.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Subbaiah Institute of
