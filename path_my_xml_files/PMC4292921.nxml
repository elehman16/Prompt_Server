Data are limited on calcium and phosphorus balance in CKD to support this. The aim of this study was to determine calcium and phosphorus balance and calcium kinetics with and without calcium carbonate in CKD patients. Eight stage 3/4 CKD patients, eGFR 36 mL/min, participated in two 3-week balances in a randomized placebo-controlled cross-over study of calcium carbonate (1500 mg/d calcium). Calcium and phosphorus balance were determined on a controlled diet. Oral and intravenous <sup>45</sup>calcium with blood sampling and urine and fecal collections were used for calcium kinetics. Fasting blood and urine were collected at baseline and end of each week of each balance period for biochemical analyses. Results showed that patients were in neutral calcium and phosphorus balance while on placebo. Calcium carbonate produced positive calcium balance, did not affect phosphorus balance, and produced only a modest reduction in urine phosphorus excretion compared with placebo. Calcium kinetics demonstrated positive net bone balance but less than overall calcium balance suggesting tissue deposition. Fasting biochemistries of calcium and phosphate homeostasis were unaffected by calcium carbonate. If they can be extrapolated to effects of chronic therapy, these data caution against the use of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Patients with chronic kidney disease-mineral bone disorder (CKD-MBD) have altered mineral metabolism due to disruptions in homeostasis of serum phosphate, calcium, and the mineral-regulating hormones, parathyroid hormone (PTH), 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D), and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Progressive hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia as kidney function decreased were the original biochemical hallmarks of mineral bone disorder (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Calcium and phosphorus absorption studies dating back to the 1970s&#x02013;80s (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) showed that intestinal calcium and phosphorus absorption were low in CKD and reversible with calcitriol and vitamin D analogs (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Hypocalcemia from calcium malabsorption and hyperphosphatemia from phosphorus retention, were considered to be responsible for the progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common feature of CKD (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). More recently it has been established that the reduced 1,25D is more likely due to elevation of the phosphate regulating hormone, FGF-23, which suppresses kidney 1-alpha hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) and that PTH, FGF-23 and 1,25D form a sophisticated hormonal axis that regulate mineral homeostasis and skeletal mineralization (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p id="P3">There has been increasing awareness that abnormalities in the mineral regulating hormones occur early in kidney failure (CKD stage 2) before serum calcium and phosphorus move from their fasting reference ranges (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Increase in serum phosphate and phosphorus retention in CKD-MBD are considered to be the main culprits in exacerbating vascular and other soft tissue complications of CKD, and even within the normal reference range, serum phosphate is independently associated with increased mortality in pre-dialysis CKD patients (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). To prevent phosphate retention and hyperphosphatemia, use of phosphate binders in the management of end stage renal disease began in the mid-1970&#x02019;s (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder was introduced in the mid-1980&#x02019;s as an alternative to aluminum-based phosphate binders which carried the risk of aluminum toxicity (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Calcium carbonate is a popular phosphate binder because of both its availability over the counter and its low cost relative to other phosphate binders. Not only does it bind dietary phosphate when given with meals but some believe it has the added advantage of preventing or reversing negative skeletal calcium balance, thought to contribute to the increased fracture risk in CKD (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, there is increasing concern over the risk of vascular calcification and cardiovascular events with use of calcium-based phosphate binders (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). There are only limited and inconsistent data regarding the safety of calcium-based versus non-calcium based binders (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Until recently (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) no data on calcium balance in either early or late stage CKD patients were available and there are no studies utilizing calcium kinetics. One study (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) showed that stage 3 and 4 CKD patients were in neutral calcium balance while consuming an 800 mg/d calcium diet, and in positive calcium balance while consuming a diet of 2000 mg/d calcium. No equivalent data are available on phosphorus balance in CKD patients. The purpose of this study was to determine whether calcium carbonate, used as a phosphate binder, altered calcium and phosphorus balance and calcium kinetics in patients with stage 3/4 CKD while on a controlled diet. Further, the effects of calcium carbonate on fasting serum mineral and mineral-regulating hormone biochemistry were also determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="S3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p id="P4">Seventeen volunteers were screened for the study. Five did not qualify based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Four enrolled patients were withdrawn from the study in the first week of study used both to assess dietary compliance and to equilibrate patients to the calcium and phosphorus content of the diet: three patients due to difficulties complying with the controlled diet and one patient due to starting kayexalate for high serum potassium. One patient who completed the study inadvertently remained on paricalcitol (2 mcg/d) during the study; despite this, this patient had the lowest calcium absorption out of all the study participants (6&#x02013;7% on both placebo and calcium carbonate). Therefore, the data from this patient was retained in the analysis. Eight patients completed the entire study and were included in the analysis and results.</p><p id="P5">Patients participated in a randomized cross-over study of calcium carbonate (daily elemental calcium 2457 mg) versus placebo (daily elemental calcium 957 mg) (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).

Increasing calcium intake with 500 mg calcium from calcium carbonate taken with three daily meals produced positive calcium balance. The ability of CKD patients to maintain neutral calcium balance on an adequate calcium diet was largely due to low urine calcium excretion, and to achieve positive calcium balance with calcium carbonate was largely due to increased calcium absorption and net retention, and failure to increase urine calcium excretion. The study demonstrated that phosphorus balance was also neutral on an average (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) U.S. intake of phosphorus of 1564 mg per day. Further, phosphorus balance was unaffected by calcium carbonate even although there was a reduction in urine phosphate excretion of about 148 mg/d. Thus, the overall effect of a 500 mg calcium supplement with three meals per day in CKD stage 3/4 patients was to produce a large positive calcium balance without affecting neutral phosphorus balance and only a modest effect on reducing urine phosphate. The decrease in urine phosphate was about 1mg for every 10mg elemental calcium supplement which is close to that found by others (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). The reduction in urine phosphate was likely due to a reduction in phosphate absorption although the increase in fecal phosphorus with the calcium supplement was not significant probably reflecting greater imprecision in the fecal phosphorus measurement.</p><p id="P14">Calcium kinetics demonstrated that calcium carbonate increased bone formation and decreased bone resorption and improved bone balance by about 200 mg/day. Calcium kinetic modeling is currently unable to estimate the rate of calcium deposition into extraskeletal tissues. However, overall calcium balance measured by chemical methods, after subtracting 79 mg calcium /day in sweat (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) showed an increase in calcium balance of over 300 mg/day, suggesting that an appreciable proportion of the retained calcium from calcium carbonate was deposited in extraskeletal tissue and/or in the skeleton independent of bone formation and resorption mechanisms.</p><p id="P15">It is generally assumed that CKD patients have phosphorus retention due to the need to excrete normal dietary phosphorus by increasing serum phosphate to accommodate for decreased GFR. However, this study demonstrated that despite phosphate retention in serum, CKD patients stage 3/4 remain in overall neutral phosphate balance. Phosphorus balance studies have not been performed previously in CKD patients partly because of concern over the accuracy of measuring fecal phosphorus (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Analysis of phosphorus-spiked fecal samples showed that the method used in this study (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental methods</xref>) gives 92.2% (82.5&#x02013;100.5%) mean recovery.</p><p id="P16">Small sample size may have limited our ability to detect significant differences of calcium and phosphorus balance from zero since the study was only powered to detect mean differences in balance between calcium carbonate and placebo. However, normal bone mineral density of the patients corroborates that they were not in long-term negative calcium balance on their habitual calcium intakes of 533 mg/d. Also the potential bias towards underestimating fecal phosphorus and thus overestimating phosphorus balance lends support to the conclusion that these patients are not retaining phosphorus while consuming a liberal amount of dietary phosphorus.</p><p id="P17">Fasting serum phosphate was unaffected by calcium carbonate, despite a decrease in urine phosphate. Additionally, the hormones regulating phosphorus homeostasis, PTH, 1,25D, and FGF-23, were not affected by calcium carbonate indicating that the decrease in phosphate excretion with calcium carbonate was insufficient to elicit changes in phosphorus homeostasis. Perhaps longer treatment periods are needed to observe changes in serum phosphate and its regulating hormones since studies with sevelamer showed a reduction in FGF-23 in dialysis patients (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) over four weeks and a reduction in FGF-23 and PTH in normophosphatemic CKD patients over six weeks (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p id="P18">To assess the abnormalities that occur in CKD patients, calcium balance and kinetics were compared with historical data (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) from healthy postmenopausal women on a similar calcium-controlled diet. CKD patients had lower urine calcium and lower fractional calcium absorption than postmenopausal women. Importantly, calcium balance was higher in CKD patients, providing further support that stage 3/4 CKD patients are not in negative calcium balance. The strength of these comparisons is that the historical data were generated by the same research group using the same methodologies in healthy postmenopausal women of similar age to the CKD patients.</p><p id="P19">Calcium balance studies combined with calcium kinetics in subjects in mineral equilibrium are the gold standard for measuring rates of calcium transport at gut, bone and kidney. Using the standard one week of dietary and environmental equilibration followed by two weeks of balance (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) our patients were well equilibrated as corroborated by constant outputs of fecal and urinary markers. As in most balance studies, the dietary calcium and phosphorus intake was fixed by protocol to be close to the average intake in the USA, and not on each patient&#x02019;s usual intake. Balance utilizing a randomized cross-over intervention represents a strong study design to test the effects of a treatment on mineral balance. On the other hand, balance studies are very exacting both for patient and investigator and they inevitably suffer from small sample size. Further, in this study as is typical of stage 3/4 CKD, the patients were not a homogenous sample and included men and women, American blacks and whites and a high incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, all factors known to affect mineral metabolism and bone mass. Thus the results may not be directly generalizable to all stage 3/4 CKD patients or to all dietary levels of calcium and phosphorus intake. Further, the results may not reflect the effects of chronic therapy on mineral balance.</p><p id="P20">This study is the first balance study in CKD to include both calcium and phosphorus balance and calcium kinetics, and to evaluate the effects of calcium carbonate on these measures. These results challenge the rationale for using calcium-based phosphate binders in stage 3/4 CKD patients to prevent negative calcium balance, reduce PTH, reduce serum phosphate, and prevent phosphorus retention because: 1) patients were not in negative calcium balance or positive phosphorus balance on placebo, and 2) calcium carbonate did not affect serum PTH, serum phosphate, or phosphorus balance. Although it is unknown whether the calcium retained from calcium carbonate is deposited into bone or soft tissue in these patients, it is unlikely that bone could serve as the sole reservoir considering the magnitude of the positive calcium balance and the patients&#x02019; age. Therefore, the positive calcium balance produced by calcium carbonate cautions against its use as a phosphate binder in stage 3/4 CKD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S12"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="S13" sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p id="P21">Men and women &#x02265;35 years old with GFR &#x0003c; 45 mL/min and serum PTH &#x02265; mid normal range mean were recruited (<xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref>) and studied on the Indiana Clinical Research Center under an Institutionally Review Committee approved protocol using a randomized cross-over design (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S14"><title>Controlled Diet, Calcium Intervention, and Compliance</title><p id="P22">The controlled diet, given as a 4-day cycle menu (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Methods</xref>) , contained 957 &#x000b1; 23 mg/d calcium (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and 1564 &#x000b1; 52 mg/d phosphorus (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).
