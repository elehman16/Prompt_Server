This first-human-dose, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial investigated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single and multiple doses of MC4-NN2-0453 in overweight to obese but otherwise healthy subjects. The trial included a single-dose part of ascending subcutaneous 0.03&#x02013;1.50&#x02009;mg/kg doses in overweight to obese but otherwise healthy men, and a multiple-dose part of ascending subcutaneous 0.75&#x02013;3.0&#x02009;mg/day doses in obese but otherwise healthy men/women. The single-dose part included 7 cohorts of 8 subjects, randomized 6:2 to active drug/placebo; the multiple-dose part included 4 cohorts of 20 subjects, randomized 16:4 to active drug/placebo. MC4-NN2-0453 was well tolerated and raised no safety concerns except for nonserious skin-related adverse events, this along with lack of weight loss effect led to premature termination of the trial. Headache, sexual&#x02013;arousal disturbance, and penile erection were also reported. Single-dose pharmacokinetics showed dose-linearity and dose-proportionality. Maximum plasma concentration was observed after 50&#x02013;100&#x02009;hours, which then declined with a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jcph0054-0394-mu1.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> of approximately 250&#x02009;hours. Plasma concentration reached steady state after 4 weeks for 0.75 and 1.5&#x02009;mg/day multiple-dose cohorts, and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jcph0054-0394-mu2.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was similar to single dose. There were no significant pharmacodynamic effects, including effect on body weight.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Obesity is associated with multiple co-morbidities, predisposing people to cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Weight reduction reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in obese people<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and is therefore recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) as a preventive treatment for type 2 diabetes<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>; weight reduction has also been shown to mitigate the risk of cardiovascular disease.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Few treatment options for obesity are available today that conform to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) draft guidance, which states that an anti-obesity drug should be safe and cause significant weight loss that is sustained for at least 12 months (loss of &#x0003e;5% of initial body weight). Currently marketed anti-obesity drugs have limited efficacy or a high frequency of adverse effects at the most effective doses.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, recently approved obesity treatments, Qsymia&#x000ae; (combination of phentaramine and topiramate, Vivus, Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA) and Belviq&#x000ae; (lorcaserin, serotonin 2C receptor agonist, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) have shown clinically meaningful results in terms of safety and efficacy.</p><p>The melanocortin system has been explored as a target for treatment of obesity due to its dual role in feeding behavior and energy expenditure contributing to body weight control.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Five types of melanocortin receptors (MCR) have been identified, and evidence confirms an association between MC4R and energy regulation.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> MC4R knock-out mouse studies have demonstrated the involvement of MC4R in feeding behavior and energy expenditure; the nonselective melanocortin agonist melanotan-II (MT-II) was shown to have no effect on food intake or energy expenditure in MC4R knock-out mice, but it did exert these effects in wild-type mice.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Genetic studies in humans link obesity with lack of or mutations in MC4R.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This evidence indicates MC4R as a possible target for the treatment of obesity.</p><p>Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH) analog MC4-NN2-0453 is a long-acting, selective MC4R agonist investigated for the treatment of obesity. Several MC4R peptide agonists have been identified and characterized using in vitro and acute in vivo assays.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Peptide agonist MC4-NN1-0182, referred to as peptide 11 and its derivative peptide 19 (analog MC4-NN2-0453), were found to have the desired potency, selectivity, solubility, and stability; however, MC4-NN2-0453 was comparatively more soluble at physiologic pH and more stable in solution than MC4-NN1-0182. Proof-of-principle for MC4-NN2-0453 was first established with the close analog MC4-NN1-0182. MC4-NN1-0182 significantly reduced body weight in diet-induced obese (DIO) rats when administered subcutaneously (s.c.) in a dose of 0.1 and 0.3&#x02009;mg/kg once daily for 3 weeks, and in obese minipigs when given as a s.c. bolus dose of 30&#x02009;mg on Day 1 followed by 0.1&#x02009;mg/kg every other day for 8 weeks.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> An unpublished study conducted with MC4-NN2-0453 in DIO rats with s.c. doses of 0.1 and 0.3&#x02009;mg/kg produced similar results. These results, along with those of nonclinical pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis and toxicology studies, indicated that MC4-NN2-0453 was generally well tolerated and was a candidate for clinical development as a weight-reducing agent.</p><p>Based on the above findings, this first-human-dose (FHD) trial was conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of single doses (SD) of MC4-NN2-0453 followed by a multiple-dose (MD) part in overweight or obese but otherwise healthy subjects.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The SD part enrolled overweight or obese but otherwise healthy men, aged 18&#x02013;64 years, with body mass index (BMI) of &#x02265;27.0 to &#x02264;39.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and the MD part enrolled obese but otherwise healthy men and women aged 18&#x02013;64 years, with BMI of &#x02265;30.0 to &#x02264;39.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Female subjects of childbearing potential were to follow a double-barrier method of contraception. Subjects with the same inclusion criteria were used for controls. Main exclusion criteria included obesity due to other endocrinological disorders, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) values outside the 0.4&#x02013;6.0&#x02009;mIU/L range, aggressive diet attempts, binge eating, use of weight-management drugs or medications that may cause significant weight gain in the 3 months before screening, weight change of &#x02265;5&#x02009;kg in the last 3 months, any surgical weight-reduction procedures such as liposuction, abdominoplasty, or similar procedure within 1 year of randomization, history of mood depressive disorder or severe psychiatric disease in the last 2 years, any clinically significant disease, laboratory values outside normal limits unless deemed not clinically significant, and lifetime history of suicide attempt. Subjects in both parts provided written informed consent prior to screening for trial participation. The trial was conducted at Covance Clinical Research Unit, Inc. (Evansville, IN) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and was approved by local ethics committee.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part trial (a sequential s.c. SD ascending part and a semi-sequential s.c. MD ascending part) conducted to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of MC4-NN2-0453 in overweight or obese but otherwise healthy male and female subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Single-Dose Trial Design (Part 1)</title><p>The SD part consisted of seven dose cohorts (0.03, 0.06, 0.15, 0.30, 0.60, 1.00, and 1.50&#x02009;mg/kg body weight), in each of which 8 subjects were randomized 6:2 to receive either active drug or placebo, respectively, except for the 0.60&#x02009;mg/kg cohort, for which the ratio 7:2 was due to a dropout, resulting in one additional subject randomization. In this sequential SD part, dosing of subjects in a successive cohort would commence only after safety evaluation was performed, considering safety data, PK, laboratory results, and adverse events (AEs) reported 10&#x02013;14 days after dosing of subjects from the previous cohort. All doses were administered by s.c. injection into the abdomen after an overnight fast. All subjects attended an information visit, a screening visit (Days &#x02212;28 to &#x02212;2), an extended in-house treatment visit (Days &#x02212;1 to 6), ambulatory safety visits (Days 7&#x02013;18), and an ambulatory follow-up visit (Day 22).</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple-Dose Trial Design (Part 2)</title><p>The MD part consisted of four dose cohorts. In each cohort, 20 subjects were to be randomized 16:4 to receive active drug (0.75, 1.5, 3.0, and 5.0&#x02009;mg/day) or placebo. Approximately 30 days after the start of each MD cohort, an internal trial safety group evaluated the cumulative safety, tolerability, and PK before agreeing upon the next dose level.</p><p>All subjects attended an information visit, a screening visit (Days &#x02212;28 to &#x02212;2), two extended in-house treatment visits (Days &#x02212;1 to 5 and Days 69 to 74), nine ambulatory treatment visits (Days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, and 64), five ambulatory safety visits (Days 77, 84, 91, 98, and 105), an ambulatory follow-up visit (Day 112), and an ambulatory visit for sampling anti-MC4-NN2-0453 antibodies (Day 210). All dose administrations except for those on Days 1 and 4 were done by the subjects themselves after instruction. The drug was to be administered once daily after an overnight fast on Days 1&#x02013;70.</p></sec><sec><title>Dermatological Follow-Up</title><p>Because of a high incidence of nonserious skin-related AEs in the active treatment subjects, all subjects on active treatment from both the SD and the MD parts were called to a dermatological safety follow-up visit, approximately 1 year after last dosing; during this follow-up visit only skin-related AEs were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood Collection for PK Analysis</title><p>For the SD part, blood was drawn for PK analysis just before dosing (0&#x02009;hour) and at time points 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, 88, 96, 104, 112, 120, 128, 144, 168, 216, 264, 312, 360, 408, and 504&#x02009;hours after dosing (Days 1&#x02013;22).</p><p>For the MD part, blood was drawn for PK analysis just before dosing on Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, and 70 (trough samples), and at time points 2, 6, 12, and 18&#x02009;hours post-dosing at Days 1 and 4. Following the last dose (Day 70) for cohort 1, blood was drawn at 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32, 40, 48, 72, 96, 168, 336, 504, 672, 840, and 1,008&#x02009;hours (42 days later) post-final-dose. For cohort 2, the last pre-dose sample was drawn on Day 50 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) or Day 36 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), 22 or 15 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 per day) and for cohort 3, the last pre-dose sample was drawn at Day 15 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) or Day 8 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2). Dosing was terminated within days hereafter for cohort 2 and cohort 3 subjects. Blood was thereafter drawn at 168, 336, 504, 672, 840, and 1,008&#x02009;hours post-last-dose.</p><p>The blood samples were collected by venipuncture or cannulation in EDTA tubes and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C after centrifugation at 4&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Injection Site and Methodology</title><p>All dose administrations were given before breakfast as s.c. injections into the abdomen while seated. Subjects had the injection site marked with a surgical marker (circle of at least 3&#x02009;in. in diameter), the area appropriately treated with alcohol, and the s.c. injection made according to customary s.c. abdominal injection practices. Volume of the injection did not exceed 2&#x02009;mL per injection and at higher &#x0201c;2-0453 doses,&#x0201d; in the SD part, multiple injections were required and injected in the same area.</p><p>In the MD part dose, administration on odd days (1st, 3rd, etc.) were done in the right site of the abdomen; dose administration on even days (2nd, 4th, etc.) were done in the left site of the abdomen.</p><p>2-0453 solution was used for injection at concentration 5&#x02009;mg/mL (only to be used in Part 2), 10&#x02009;mg/mL (to be used in Part 1 and 2), 20&#x02009;mg/mL (only to be used in Part 1).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Evaluation</title><p>The primary objective of the trial was safety and tolerability of ascending SD and MD of MC4-NN2-0453 assessed by AEs including sexual disturbance (examination for priapism by an urologist) and hypoglycemic episodes, clinical laboratory tests (anti-MC4-NN2-0453 antibodies for the MD part), Holter monitoring (for the SD part), 12-lead ECG, physical examination, vital signs including blood pressure (BP) monitoring, pulse and temperature, injection-site assessment, and determination of SD and MD maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Mental health was assessed using the PHQ-9 (patient health questionnaires): PoMS (The Profile of Mood States Questionnaire) and C-SSRS (The Columbia Suicidality Severity Rating Scale Questionnaire) questionnaires.</p><p>The trial was put on hold because of unexpected skin-related AEs, and all subjects were called in for a dermatologic assessment by a dermatologist. All subjects were offered biopsy and standard care by the dermatologist. Twenty-two (22) of the 27 subjects with clinically atypical nevi underwent biopsies including a histology evaluation. The dermatological report showed seven subjects diagnosed with mild histologic atypia. Three (3) of the 27 subjects did not consent to the biopsy, and 2 subjects did not attend the dermatologic assessment visit.</p><p>Given the dermatological findings, the sponsor decided to terminate the trial prematurely. All subjects in the MD-part were transferred to Visit 13 (ambulatory safety visit) and were followed as per the protocol for the next 10 weeks, and as described earlier all drug-exposed subjects were invited for an extra dermatological follow-up visit 1 year later.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic Evaluation</title><p>MC4-NN2-0453 was assayed in plasma by a validated LC-MS/MS assay including Plasma Protein Precipitation, (electrospray ionization, positive MRM mode, m/z: 698.5&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;279.5).

None of these events were serious, all were judged by the investigator to be possibly related to the drug, and all the events showed complete recovery. No melanoma was diagnosed in any of the examined subjects.

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first human-dose trial of the long-acting MC4R agonist MC4-NN2-0453, developed for weight loss and weight maintenance in overweight to obese individuals. There were no serious or severe AEs reported in this trial. The trial was prematurely terminated because of unexpected incidences of nonserious skin-related AEs in the three highest dose cohorts in the SD part and in all dose cohorts in the MD part. Though, these skin related AEs of mild severity were well tolerated (these AEs showed recovery) and did not lead to any discontinuations, no possible weight loss benefits were seen at doses where these nonserious skin related AEs started appearing and thus leading to trial termination. All the skin-related AEs were considered likely to be related to the trial drug (all events except one occurred in active treatment groups). Other common AEs reported were headache, sexual disturbance, nausea, and injection-site hemorrhage observed with both MC4-NN2-0453 and placebo.</p><p>MC1 receptors are located in the skin on human melanocytes mediating the melanogenic and proliferative effects of melanotropic peptides.<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The skin hyperpigmentation was therefore unexpected given the low affinity of MC4-NN2-0453 for MC1 receptors and high affinity for the MC4R (MC4:MC1R selectivity 1,000:1).<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Melanocortin analogs such as melanotan-I and -II are potent, nonselective melanocortin agonists. They have been tested as skin-tanning agents in clinical trials with the therapeutic potential to prevent skin cancer (and intolerance to sun exposure),<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> suggesting that regulated use of these agents at clinical doses could be safe. Unlicensed use of these nonselective &#x003b1;-MSH analogs has resulted in skin hyperpigmentation and darkening of existing nevus.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This could be explained by their action through MC1R in the skin by increased signaling and proliferation of well-differentiated melanocytes.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Skin hyperpigmentation occurring in the SD part could possibly be due to the constant and very high exposure to MC4-NN2-0453; exposure levels of 2.3&#x02013;3.1&#x02009;&#x000b5;M were observed, which is close to the K<sub>i</sub> value of 2.7&#x02009;&#x000b5;M of MC4-NN2-0453 on the MC1R.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Even in the presence of albumin binding, this may be enough to stimulate the melanocytes. In the MD part as well, steady-state exposure levels were 0.34 and 0.67&#x02009;&#x000b5;M with doses of 0.75 and 1.5&#x02009;mg/day, respectively; C<sub>trough</sub> reached with the 3.0&#x02009;mg dose was 1.05&#x02009;&#x000b5;M. It is known that exposure to &#x003b1;-MSH analogs leads to up-regulation of MC1 receptors in the skin and in congenital nevi expression of MC1 receptors are increased<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>; this, along with exposure to UV radiation (which indirectly stimulates &#x003b1;-MSH secretion), leads to increased expression of MC1 receptors.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Furthermore, a synergistic effect on tanning of melanotan-I and UV-B light was reported by Dorr et al.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Although MC4-NN2-0453 is an analog with very high receptor specificity for the MC4R versus the MC1R, the high-exposure level and the eventual increase in MC1R expression could explain the increase in number and pigmentation of nevi both in sun-exposed and acral area as well as the hyperpigmentation induced by MC4-NN2-0435 in this trial. Acral nevi have been shown to be associated with ethnicity, pigmentation, age, and cutaneous melanoma risk factors and are not uncommon phenomena.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>Change in penile erection observed during the trial was reported more frequently in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. The changes can be explained by the role of melanocortin in erectile function. Human trials with melanotan-II and its derivative PT141 have demonstrated erectogenic activity in males with erectile dysfunction<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and arousal in females with sexual behavior disorders,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> indicating a potential for the treatment of sexual dysfunction. In contrast, a clinical trial conducted with the MC4R agonist MK-0493 failed to demonstrate the same effect<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>; it also failed to demonstrate effect on body weight and energy intake,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> which perhaps indicates that exposure was too low to affect penile erection and body weight.</p><p>In the current trial, MC4-NN2-0453 exhibited a neutral effect on BP despite being an MC4R agonist. This is in contrast to the MC4R agonist LY2112688, which significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001) increased both SBP and DBP.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The melanocortin system through MC4R regulates BP by modulating central sympathetic flow.<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The lack of effect on BP in the current trial could have been due to the limited capacity of MC4-NN2-0453 to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. Though, there was an initial effect on penile erection, indicating some availability to the central nervous system, as penile erection is thought to be centrally mediated,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> apparently the central exposure may not have been high enough to mediate an effect on body weight.</p><p>In the SD part, the PK of MC4-NN2-0453 was dose-proportional and linear, but dose proportionality was statistically significant only for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub>. AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24h</sub>, however, most likely represented only a partial drug exposure during the absorption phase, as t<sub>max</sub> occurred after 50&#x02009;hours. After multiple dosing with 0.75 and 1.5&#x02009;mg, steady state was reached after 29 days of treatment. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jcph0054-0394-mu7.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was 232&#x02013;274&#x02009;hours and was dose-independent both in the SD and the MD parts. The accumulation was 25 times with 0.75&#x02009;mg/day dose, which is consistent with the dosing interval and the long elimination <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jcph0054-0394-mu8.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>.</p><p>MC4-NN2-0453 did not show any noticeable PD effects in the SD part. In the MD part, no definitive conclusions could be drawn on the effect of MC4-NN2-0453 on body weight, subjective self-reported appetite variables, or caloric intake because of inconsistent data and premature closure of the MD part. Proof-of-principle was obtained with the nonclinical studies conducted with MC4-NN1-0182 and MC4-NN2-0453, demonstrating a significant reduction in body weight, which was attributed to reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A similar effect with the peptide agonist MC4-NN2-0453 in humans could not be observed with the doses studied in this trial. Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials conducted by Krishna et al with the MC4R agonist MK-0493 also demonstrated a similar lack of efficacy,<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> indicating either that exposure was too low or that differential mechanisms or pathways were involved in regulation of human body weight; this would bring the viability of targeting MC4R in body weight regulation into some question.</p><p>The site of anorectic action of melanocortins has been demonstrated to be the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), suggesting accessibility to peripherally administered melanocortins. However, the effect on energy expenditure is mediated through MC4Rs located on neurons in regions of the brain other than the PVN.<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Thus an MC4R agonist like MC4-NN2-0453 must access these regions to regulate food intake and energy expenditure and we could possibly attribute the lack of efficacy of the molecule in humans to accessibility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, MC4-NN2-0453 was generally well tolerated with no safety concerns except for the skin-related AEs (skin hyperpigmentation and melanocytic nevus).</p><p>PK of MC4-NN2-0453 was dose-proportional and linear, and the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jcph0054-0394-mu9.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> was long, indicating a potential for once-weekly dosing.</p><p>MC4-NN2-0453 treatment did not appear to affect body weight in humans in the doses or treatment exposure tested.</p><p>Our data suggest the need for further research and insight into whether &#x003b1;-MSH-mediated weight control is centrally or peripherally mediated especially in the context of obesity, also whether a constant high exposure to the MC4R agonist downregulates the receptor response. Finally, the predictivity of the used animal models should be further investigated in general within obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the trial participants for their participation.
