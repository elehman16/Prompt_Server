One hundred and sixty-five patients with low-energy intertrochanteric fractures, classified as AO/OTA 31A, were prospectively included during a 2-year period (2005&#x02013;2006). Patients were randomized into two groups: group A included 79 hip fractures managed with sliding hip screws and group B included 86 fractures treated with cephalomedullary nails. Delay to surgery, duration of surgery, time of fluoroscopy, total hospital stay, implant-related complications, transfusion requirements, re-operation details, functional recovery, and mortality were recorded. The mean follow-up was 36&#x000a0;months (24&#x02013;56&#x000a0;months). The mean surgical time was statistically significantly shorter and fluoroscopy time longer for the group B. No intraoperative femoral shaft fractures occurred. There was no statistically significant difference in the functional recovery score, reoperation, and mortality rates between the 2 groups. A new type of complication, the so-called Z-effect phenomenon, was noticed in the cephalomedullary nail group. There are no statistically significant differences between the two techniques in terms of type and rate of complications, functional outcome, reoperation and mortality rates when comparing the SHS and the cephalomedullary nail for low-energy AO/OTA 31A intertrochanteric fractures.

It is estimated that 1.26 million hip fractures occurred in adults in 1990, with predictions of numbers rising to 7.3&#x02013;21.3 million by 2050 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These fractures are an economic burden because they occur in patients with co-morbidities which influence the quality of life of the patients and also increase the cost of treatment for the health systems. Prompt surgical fixation and fast-track rehabilitation programs have been adopted to facilitate rapid recovery, mobilization, and decrease the intraoperative and postoperative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One-year mortality varies from 12 to 37&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with about 9&#x000a0;% of these deaths being directly attributed to the hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Among the survivors after a hip fracture, 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% will require adaptation for a more dependent lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The sliding hip screw has been a gold standard of treatment for low-energy intertrochanteric fractures with good results overall. However, fracture collapse, medialization of the femur, and limb shortening are the known complications related to this type of fixation. Cephalomedullary nails are biomechanically superior for load transfer and have a biological advantage as minimal invasive techniques can be used for implantation; both advantages are thought to relate to a shorter healing and recovery times with improved functional outcome. There is, however, a risk of iatrogenic fracture, additional fracture comminution during nail insertion, and of suboptimal closed fracture reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this prospective randomized study was to compare a new dual lag screw cephalomedullary nail with the classic sliding hip screw for the treatment of low-energy extra-capsular fractures of the hip in terms of surgical time, blood loss, intraoperative and postoperative complications, reoperation, and mortality rates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>From January 2005 to December 2006, one hundred and ninety-eight patients with 198 extra-capsular hip fractures were admitted to our trauma unit. All hip fractures of the low-energy AO type 31-A were included. Patients younger than 65&#x000a0;years, multi-trauma patients, patients with previous ipsilateral hip or femur surgery possibly affecting functional outcome, and patients with pathological fractures were excluded. Thirty-three patients were excluded; 13 patients were too frail for any operative intervention, 7 were unable to walk before fracture, 4 had pathologic fractures due to metastatic disease, 3 were under 65&#x000a0;years of age, and 6 patients declined to participate in the study. Finally, one hundred and sixty-five patients (165 fractures) were enrolled and randomized by sealed envelope for treatment with either a sliding hip screw (79 fractures) or the dual proximal screw cephalomedullary nail (86 fractures).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Fracture fixation devices</title><p>The standard Endovis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Cephalomedullary Nail (Citieffe, Bologna, Italy) developed for the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures is a single sized titanium alloy design which features a cervico-diaphyseal angle of 130&#x000b0;, a metaphyseal angle of 5&#x000b0;, and a total length of 195&#x000a0;mm including 30&#x000a0;mm distal fluted section. The proximal (metaphyseal) diameter of the nail is 13&#x000a0;mm and the distal (diaphyseal) 10&#x000a0;mm. There are two holes for insertion of cephalic screws and one for a distal locking screw. The cephalic lag screws have a shaft diameter of 7.5&#x000a0;mm and an outer thread diameter of 9.7&#x000a0;mm. They also have a self-drilling and self-tapping screw tip design. The distal screw is available in four length sizes, 5&#x000a0;mm diameter, and is self-taping (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Showing the number of patients enrolled and randomized to the study, the drop outs, and the total number of patients that were followed up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="11751_2012_146_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e298"/></fig></p><p>The classic sliding hip screw was first introduced in 1956 for intertrochanteric, peri-trochanteric, and subtrochanteric fractures. We used either the keyed (CLASSIC) or key-less (AMBI) systems in angles 130&#x02013;140&#x000b0; with 2&#x02013;4 slots (Smith &#x00026; Nephew Co.).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Operative technique</title><p>The procedures were performed on a fracture table under spinal anesthesia. A closed reduction of the fracture was achieved and documented with the use of an image intensifier. A small lateral approach was utilized. Typically, the trochanteric entry point was identified and the nail was gently advanced to its desired position. In ten cases with a narrow femoral canal, we used an 11-mm-flexible reamer before insertion of the nail. The optimal position for the distal cephalic lag screw is distal to the midaxis of the femoral neck, close to or even onto the medial cortex so that the proximal screw is placed in the center of the head in anteroposterior and lateral images (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

A dramatic change in practice has occurred with the intramedullary nail fixation increasing from 3&#x000a0;% in 1999 to 67&#x000a0;% in 2006. This change has been noted despite a lack of evidence in the literature to support this change and potentially known complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Secondary intraoperative femoral fractures are shown to be the most serious complication related to the standard Gamma nail. Its reported incidence is as high ranges between 0 and 17&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Robinson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] estimated that incidence of secondary femoral fractures in patients treated with a standard Gamma nail was 18.7 fractures per 1,000 person-years in contrast to the rate of 4.4 per 1,000 person-years with a SHS. In a recent meta-analysis of 25 relevant randomized trials from 1991 to 2005, Bhandari et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] found that intramedullary nails increased the risk of femoral shaft fracture by 4.5 times compared with a compression hip screw. However, among the most recent studies (2000&#x02013;2005), intramedullary nails did not significantly increase femoral shaft fracture risk. They concluded that previous concerns about increased femoral shaft fracture risk with Gamma nails have been resolved with improved implant design and improved learning curves with the device. In most prior studies, first generation intramedullary nails were used and had proximal nail diameters of 17&#x000a0;mm, available distal diameters between 12 and 16&#x000a0;mm, mediolateral curvature of 10&#x000b0; and a length of 200&#x000a0;mm. These nails required 2&#x000a0;mm overreaming of the femoral medullary canal for easier insertion and this may have been an explanation of the high incidence of secondary fractures intraoperatively.</p><p>Leung et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] published a multicenter trial using a modified nail for Asian people with a length of 180&#x000a0;mm, mediolateral curvature of 4&#x000b0;, proximal diameter of 16&#x000a0;mm, and distal diameters of 11 and 12&#x000a0;mm. This modified design of intramedullary nail was associated with a lower rate of intraoperative and postoperative complications than the standard nail. Utrilla et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] who used a new design of Trochanteric Gamma nail reported that the postoperative complications were similar to those with the SHS, without postoperative femoral shaft fractures as had been reported in association with the standard Gamma nail. There was no intraoperative femoral shaft fracture in our study. This is probably explained by the specifications of the IM nail which does not require reaming or hammering during insertion in the medullary canal. Moreover, the design which has 5&#x000b0; of metaphyseal angle, a total length of 195&#x000a0;mm including 30&#x000a0;mm of a distal fluted section, and smaller proximal and distal diameters may be the reasons for the lower complication rates.</p><p>Distal locking with one screw was not used routinely in our study but only for A3 reverse oblique fractures as well as in some unstable A2 types when there was rotational or axial instability. It was the judgement of the senior surgeon after releasing the traction and checking for instability by image intensifier screening. This is also supported by Baumgaertner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], who showed that the nail should be locked distally (generally with one screw) only if rotational or axial instability was observed after the nail and screw are in place and traction is released, but routinely in A3 AO/OTA fractures.</p><p>Two biomechanical studies that directly compared the stability of single and dual lag screw implants used for treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures have shown favorable results for implants with dual lag screws. Kubiak et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in the first study found that the two implants showed equivalent rigidity and stability and that the dual lag screw implant had a significantly stronger fixation than the single lag screw one when loaded to failure in an unstable intertrochanteric hip fracture model. In the second study, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] the fixation strength of the Endovis dual lag screw construct was found to be significantly greater than the classic SHS when multidirectional dynamic forces were used for loading. Additionally, double-proximal-screw cephalomedullary nails demonstrated significantly less rotation compared to the SHS. These findings support Ingman`s assumption that the increased rotational stability of the femoral head fixation established by two proximal screws would decrease femoral head cutout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, in the clinical setting, these biomechanical advantages are not associated with a decrease in complication rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Our results similarly show no significant difference in cutout between the two implants. There were 5 cases of proximal screw cutout for the SHS group and 3 cases for the cephalomedullary nails; these were all unstable fractures. Moreover, the presence of dual lag screws has introduced a new type of complication, the so-called &#x0201c;Z-effect&#x0201d; and reverse &#x0201c;Z-effect&#x0201d; phenomena [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These are axial migrations of the lag screws forward or backward, one at a time or simultaneously and following the same or, more often, the opposite directions. Characteristic screw migration patterns have been described in the literature as the Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the inferior screw, varus collapse of the fracture, and perforation of the femoral head by the superior screw. The reverse Z-effect involves the lateral migration of the superior screw accompanied by the medial migration of the inferior screw. However, in practice, sometimes only one screw actually migrates during the postoperative weight-bearing period. On reviewing the 3 migrations in this series, it was noted these were not typical Z-effect phenomena. In one case, the superior screw backed out 3&#x000a0;weeks postoperatively, and in the other 2 cases, only the inferior screw backed out 3&#x000a0;months after operation. All these 3 patients had unstable trochanteric fractures with comminution of the medial cortex. The reasons for screw migration observed in some types of fractures are still pending and require further investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. To prevent the so-called Z or reversed Z effects, Lin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] emphasized the importance of inserting the inferior lag screw as close as possible to, or even right on, the inferior cortex of the femoral neck in order to achieve better anchoring of the screws to a bony area of increased density, thus preventing screw cutout.</p><p>Strauss et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] in their experimental study suggested that in cases of intertrochanteric hip fractures with significant medial cortical comminution, surgeons may wish to avoid the use of a two lag screw intramedullary nail. In our opinion, careful surgical technique as well as selection of patients is important and may reduce the complications with these new implants.</p><p>Surgeon experience is a critical factor when comparing a familiar implant with a new one. Because of the universal familiarity with the SHS device, any comparison with a new implant must take account of the significant learning curve effect as a source of potential bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The vast majority of operations in our study were performed by orthopaedic residents under a senior surgeon&#x02019;s assistance. The participating residents had almost equal experience with both implants. The senior surgeons had already performed more than fifteen Endovis procedures each prior to this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, there is no clear advantage of one implant over the other. Both can be used successfully for the treatment of 31 AO/OTA intertrochanteric hip fractures in the elderly. The duration of surgery was significantly shorter (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) for the cephalomedullary nail group but with significantly more time for fluoroscopy (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). These differences are of little clinical importance and did not affect the final outcome or the complication rate between the two methods. The two lag screws of the cephalomedullary implant do not seem to carry any significant difference in clinical practice as supported by previous biomechanical experimental studies. Furthermore, the risk for the so-called Z-effect phenomenon exists while using with this new implant design.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Open Access</title><p>This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gullberg</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnell</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanis</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>World wide projections for hip fracture</article-title><source>Osteoporos Int</source><year>1997</year><volume>7</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>407</fpage><lpage>413</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1007/PL00004148</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9425497</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hornby</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Vardon</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Operative or conservative treatment for trochanteric fractures of the femur: a randomized epidemiological trial in elderly patients</article-title><source>J Bone Jt Surg Br</source><year>1989</year><volume>71</volume><fpage>619</fpage><lpage>623</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bong</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>HK</given-names></name><name><surname>Leong</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of the hip: a prospective trial of 150 cases</article-title><source>Injury</source><year>1981</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>139</fpage><lpage>146</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/0020-1383(81)90049-8</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7327728</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jain</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Basinski</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kreder</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nonoperative treatment of hip fractures</article-title><source>Int Orthop</source><year>2003</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>11</fpage><lpage>17</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12582802</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lyons</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical outcomes and treatment of hip fractures</article-title><source>Am J Med</source><year>1997</year><volume>103</volume><issue>2A</issue><fpage>51S</fpage><lpage>64S</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0002-9343(97)90027-9</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9302897</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Anand</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>What is the true mortality of hip fractures?</article-title><source>Public Health</source><year>1991</year><volume>105</volume><fpage>443</fpage><lpage>446</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0033-3506(05)80614-6</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1803403</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR7"><label>7.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosell</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional outcome after hip fracture.
