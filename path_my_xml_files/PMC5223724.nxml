However, surgery is still often preferred over conservative treatment. When conservative treatment is non-inferior to surgery, shifting the current standard treatment choice to conservative treatment alone could save over &#x020ac;30 millions of direct medical costs on an annual basis. Economic evaluation studies comparing surgery to conservative treatment are lacking.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A multicentre randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an economic evaluation alongside was performed to assess the (cost)-effectiveness of surgery and conservative treatment for meniscal tears. We will include 402 participants between 45 and 70&#x02005;years with an MRI-confirmed symptomatic, non-obstructive meniscal tears to prove non-inferiority of conservative treatment. Block randomisation will be web-based. The primary outcome measure is a physical function, measured by the International Knee Documentation Committee &#x02018;Subjective Knee Form&#x02019;. Furthermore, we will perform a cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis from societal perspective and a budget impact analysis from a societal, government and insurer perspective. Secondary outcomes include general health, quality of life, activity level, knee pain, physical examination, progression of osteoarthritis and the occurrence of adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This RCT will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the Ethics Committee (number NL44188.100.13). The results of this study will be reported in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences. We further aim to disseminate our results to guideline committees.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3908">NCT01850719</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>meniscus</kwd><kwd>meniscectomy</kwd><kwd>physical therapy</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Economic evaluation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meniscal surgery is the most performed orthopaedic surgical intervention with over 41&#x02005;000 procedures annually in the Netherlands.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In the USA, an increase of 49% was seen in arthroscopic partial meniscectomies (APMs) between 1996 and 2006. Half of these were performed in patients over 45&#x02005;years old<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and these numbers continue to rise since the proportion of population over 60&#x02005;years will double from 11% to 22% between 2000 and 2050 (WHO). APM therefore contributes significantly to the costs of our healthcare system.</p><p>The quality of the menisci decreases with age and they become more vulnerable to damage and tears.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> Both surgery and conservative treatment do not prevent the development of osteoarthritis (OA). APM in degenerative knees may even accelerate the process of OA more than a non-operative approach since more of the meniscus tissue is removed. However, to the best of our knowledge, no properly designed studies have been published investigating this hypothesis. The expected accelerated progression of OA after APM may influence the number of knee arthroplasties subsequently needed. Faster progression to OA will lead to more patients on waiting lists for knee replacement and subsequently raise costs. In 2003, the National Hospital Discharge Survey in the USA described a total of 402&#x02005;100 knee arthroplasties in that year and predicted this to grow by 673% to 3.48 million by 2030.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Preventing the accelerated progression of OA may result in stagnation of these numbers. Therefore, it could accomplish a substantial reduction of costs of healthcare usage.</p><p>Although arthroscopy for obstructive meniscal tears is widely accepted,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> non-obstructive symptoms may not be triggered by the meniscal tear, but by early onset OA in middle-aged and older patients. Englund <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> identified a meniscal tear on MRI in 61% of nearly 1000 asymptomatic volunteers over 50&#x02005;years old. APM in the non-obstructive meniscal tear group could therefore be seen as overtreatment since many are asymptomatic. Despite the wide use of APM for treatment of non-obstructive meniscal lesions, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on this subject are sparse. Three recently published meta-analyses of 6&#x02013;9 RCTs all found a small short-term benefit of surgery over conservative treatment, disappearing over time.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> With these data and the lack of economic data, no recommendations can be made on a treatment of choice.</p><p>A meniscal tear could lead to knee OA, but knee OA could also lead to a meniscal tear.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatment, consisting of physical therapy (PT), of non-obstructive meniscal injuries in patients older than 45&#x02005;years.</p><p>We hypothesise that meniscal tears are not a predominant factor causing knee symptoms in patients over 45&#x02005;years and assume equal improvement of physical function in both groups and reduced costs with PT.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will perform a multicentre RCT with an economic evaluation in the Netherlands.

We recruited patients at the orthopaedic outpatient clinic of nine hospitals, of which one was an academic hospital, in the Netherlands (Academic Medical Center Amsterdam, Diakonessenhuis Utrecht, OLVG Amsterdam, Medisch Centrum Alkmaar, Medisch Centrum Haaglanden Den Haag, Medisch Centrum Jan van Goyen Amsterdam, Sint Elisabeth hospital Tilburg, Slotervaart hospital Amsterdam, Tergooi hospital Hilversum). Eligible participants are randomised into two equal groups receiving either APM at the hospital of inclusion or PT. PT is performed at several preselected PT clinics in the area of the hospitals. These PT clinics are selected according to their qualifications and specific instructions regarding the protocol are provided prior to the start of the trial. Participants may prefer receiving treatment at another PT clinic. In these cases the researcher will contact these clinics prior to the start of the treatment to inform them about the study and provide them the PT protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants between 45 and 70&#x02005;years old with a symptomatic, non-obstructive, MRI-confirmed meniscal tear are being recruited at the outpatient clinic of the participating medical centres.

Standardised surgery forms for this study are used including assessment of the lateral and medial menisci, the ACL, the level of chondropathy, and a general classification of the level of degeneration. After general or spinal anaesthesia, standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals were introduced for inspection of the knee joint. The affected meniscus is partially removed until a stable and solid meniscus is reached and all unstable and loose fragments are removed. All patients receive an information letter with perioperative instructions. Eight weeks after surgery (about 3&#x02005;months after randomisation), patients visit the outpatient orthopaedic department for a postsurgery check-up. Considering that standard PT after APM has not been proven effective, patients are referred for PT in case of swelling or signs of atrophy, as advised by the Dutch Orthopaedic Association Guidelines.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Control group</title><p>After randomisations, participants are referred to a PT clinic and the treatment on average starts within 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;weeks.

We used the previously mentioned clinically relevant difference of 8.8 points on the IKDC &#x02018;Subjective Knee Form&#x02019;, and to increase the power of our results, we rounded this down to a non-inferiority threshold of 8 points. We calculated that with 10% loss to follow-up after 24&#x02005;months and 25% delayed APM in the PT group, 201 patients were needed per group in this non-inferiority trial. This meant a total of 402 patients. The sample size was calculated for the intention-to-treat analysis.</p><p>In order to avoid unnecessary inclusions and unnecessary delay, we recalculated our SD halfway through the study. This interim analysis was performed by an independent committee consisting of an orthopaedic surgeon/expert in the field and an orthopaedic research coordinator/statistical expert. Only the SD was recalculated, all other outcome data remained blinded and no analyses were performed for any of the outcomes with different sample sizes. With an SD of 18 points (compared to the SD of 20 in our initial calculation) the committee recalculated the sample size. We agreed on a sample size reduction to a total number of 320 patients (160 per group). The Ethics Review Board granted approval for this on 27 October 2015. The change of sample size has been updated in the trial registries.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s2i1"><title>Effectiveness analysis</title><p>To investigate the clinical effectiveness of both treatment groups, we will use linear mixed-model analysis for continuous outcomes. Logistic generalised estimation equation analysis will be used for dichotomous outcomes. This method takes into account the dependency of observations within a patient, and the fact that not all patients may be assessed at each time point (missing data). All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat and per/protocol basis, as well as cross-over analysis.</p><p>In the primary linear mixed model, the outcome variable studied (eg, physical function on the IKDC) will be analysed as a dependent variable. To investigate the effect at the different time points, we will analyse the model, according to a four-level structure (treatment group, centre, patient and time, in which time will be treated as a categorical variable to assess the treatment effects at the different time points). Time will be included as a dummy variable (reference is baseline T0), and four interaction terms will be analysed (T2Xgroup; T3Xgroup; T5Xgroup; T7Xgroup). To investigate the overall effect of both treatments (irrespective of time), we will also analyse the model according to a three-level structure (treatment group, centre, patient). The baseline outcome will be included as a covariate in all models.</p><p>Besides analysing the basic model (eg, analysis of main effects for treatment group and time and a time-by-treatment interaction), we will also control for possible confounders, by adding them as covariates (eg, body mass index, gender, profession, ASA classification, the affected meniscus, the type of tear and the status of OA according to Kellgren and Lawrence Grading Scale for Osteoarthritis). Covariates are defined as resulting in more than 10% change in the parameter estimate of time-by-treatment interaction.</p><p>In the secondary linear mixed models, the outcome variables studied (eg, general health on the RAND-36, quality of life on the EQ-5D-5L, level of activity on the TAS, knee pain on the question 10 of IKDC, the correlation between a patient's expectation and satisfaction, productivity losses on the Trimbos/iMTA questionnaire for Costs associated with Psychiatric Illness (TiC-P), muscle strength, range of motion and squatting) will be analysed in a similar way.</p><p>The estimated main effects for treatment at different assessment points under these different models are reported as in differences in means with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes, and ORs with 95% CIs for dichotomous outcomes</p><p>At the time points 3&#x02005;months (T2), 6&#x02005;months (T3), 12&#x02005;months (T5) and 2&#x02005;years (T7), we will describe the incidence of revisions (intervention group) or treatment failures (=delayed APM, control group) using descriptives.</p><p>After 2&#x02005;years (T7), we will compare the incidence of development or progression of OA between groups using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (or Fisher&#x02019;s exact as appropriate).</p><p>For all analyses, a two-tailed value of p&#x0003c;0.05 is considered to be significant.</p><p>We will consult a statistician for all longitudinal analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><sec id="s2i2a"><title>General considerations</title><p>The economic evaluation will be conducted from a societal perspective.

Subsequently, we could use this for a recalculation of our sample size in order to avoid unnecessary inclusions and any further (unnecessary) delay. The SD in our own group was found to be 18, compared with the SD of 20 used for our initial sample size calculation. This resulted in a reduction of 82 patients. As previously mentioned, an independent committee consisting of an orthopaedic surgeon/expert in the field and an orthopaedic research coordinator/statistical expert were appointed for this recalculation. During this process, all other data remained blinded and no analyses were performed for any of the outcomes with different sample sizes. The Ethics Review Board approved this recalculation.</p><p>This RCT will be the first to investigate and publish data on cost-effectiveness of both treatment groups in this specific group of patients. Therefore, this trial adds to the clinical evidence of treatment of meniscal tears which contributes to the ongoing debate to reduce healthcare costs in the western world.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Victor van de Graaf <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/victorvdgraaf">@victorvdgraaf</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Escape research group&#x02014;VictorAvdG: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; VABS: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; NW: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, St. Antonius Ziekenhuis, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands; JCAN: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; CN: Neeter Fysiotherapie, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; MWvT: Department of Health Sciences &#x00026; EMGO+ Institute, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; DBFS: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands; AdG: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Diakonessenhuis, Utrecht, The Netherlands; RWP: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Julius Wolkenfelt: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Eduard LAR Mutsaerts: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Joint Research, OLVG, Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Department Orthopaedic Surgery, Medisch centrum Jan van Goyen, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Gino MMJ Kerkhoffs: Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Rolf W Peters: Department of Trauma Surgery, Academic medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Dirk-Jan Hofstee: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Noordwest Ziekenhuisgroep, Alkmaar, The Netherlands; Igor CJB van den Brand: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Elisabeth Tweesteden Ziekenhuis, Tilburg, The Netherlands; Daniel Haverkamp: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Slotervaart Ziekenhuis, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Anton MJS Vervest: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Tergooi Hospital, Hilversum, The Netherlands; Ewoud RA van Arkel: Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Medisch centrum Haaglanden, Den Haag, The Netherlands.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors have contributed to the design of this trial protocol.
