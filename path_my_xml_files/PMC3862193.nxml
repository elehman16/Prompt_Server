Written informed consent was obtained from each participant, and the institutional review board approved our study. The assessment of stone size and location was performed by plain x-ray of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder (KUB) and/or ultrasound imaging. The exclusion criteria were age younger &#x0003c;18 years; weight &#x0003c;50 kg or &#x0003e;100 kg; severe skeletal malformation; pregnancy; aortic and/or renal artery aneurysm; a history of drug or alcohol abuse; long-term use of drugs such as antidepressants, histamine blockers, and anxiolytics and allergy to one of the study medications; concomitant treatment with calcium antagonists and/or an &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic antagonist; concomitant renal stones; previous unsuccessful attempts at SWL; elevated serum creatinine (&#x0003e;2 mg/dL); urinary tract infection; diabetes; peptic ulcers; history of spontaneous stone expulsion; hypotension; coagulopathy; urinary congenital anomalies; or previous nephroureteral surgery. The patients were randomly allocated to conservative treatment (group 1) and tamsulosin treatment (group 2) using the coin toss method in order to choose the nontreatment and Tamsulosin arms. All patients were evaluated before treatment with KUB and renal ultrasonography. Before lithotripsy, clinical (history and brief physical examination) and laboratory (complete blood count, urine culture, renal function, coagulation parameters screening, and pregnancy test) examinations were conducted. Additional KUB and ultrasonography were performed just before lithotripsy. Drug administration was started immediately after SWL and was continued for a maximum of 28 days or until an alternative treatment was started. The patients who were not stone free at this examination were excluded from the study and underwent additional treatment. A total of 123 patients met these requirements. Group 1 (64 patients) received standard medical therapy alone and was used as the control group. Group 2 (59 patients) was assigned to receive our standard medical therapy in association with 0.4 mg tamsulosin once daily. Our standard medical therapy after SWL was 75 mg diclofenac injected intramuscularly on demand. A gastroprotective therapy (40 mg pantoprozol once daily) was given to every patient. After discharge, all patients were instructed to drink a minimum of 2 L of water daily and were asked to complete a diary about postdischarge pain, stone expulsion, use of analgesic drugs, and side effects of medical therapy. Patients were evaluated for stone clearance, time to stone clearance, and number of SWL sessions. The pain intensity was evaluated with the visual analog scale (VAS). The patients were requested to define pain in a scale of 1 to 10 by comparing it with the most severe pain the patients could imagine (0, no pain, to 10, the most severe pain imagined). Follow-up included clinical examination, urinalysis with culture and sensitivity testing as required, renal KUB, and/or ultrasonography, repeated 5 days after each lithotripsy session.</p><p>The final examination was performed with ultrasonography or helical computed tomography at day 28 to confirm stone-free status. All SWL treatments were performed with Storz Medical AG Modulith Slk (T&#x000e4;gerwilen, Switzerland) with both ultrasonic and fluoroscopic focusing. The mean intensity and number of shock waves after the first SWL session were 18.5 kV (range, 6&#x02013;19) and 3140 (range, 2700&#x02013;3600). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, version 16.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). The differences between groups 1 and 2 were tested using the <italic>t</italic> test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, and Fisher exact test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s0015"><title>Results</title><p>Demographic and clinical characteristics of all patients are summarized in <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>.
