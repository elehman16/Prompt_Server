Because thrombopoietin and erythropoietin signal through JAK2, dose-dependent cytopenias are expected with treatment. In the COMFORT-I (COntrolled Myelofibrosis study with ORal JAK inhibitor Treatment I) trial, these cytopenias were effectively managed with dose adjustments. These analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between ruxolitinib titrated doses and changes in platelet count and hemoglobin level as well as efficacy measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>COMFORT-I was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 309 patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk MF and a platelet count &#x02265;100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L.

Percentage changes from baseline to week 24 in spleen volume and MF-related symptoms were assessed in subgroups defined by final titrated dose (average daily dose during weeks 21 to 24).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The median final titrated doses for patients starting at doses of 15 and 20 mg BID were 10 and 20 mg BID, respectively, at week 24. Most dose reductions occurred in the first 8&#x02013;12 weeks of treatment and coincided with decreases in platelet count and hemoglobin level. Subsequently, platelet counts stabilized and hemoglobin levels gradually returned to near baseline levels (red blood cell transfusion rates followed a similar trend). Final titrated doses of &#x02265;10 mg BID were associated with clinically meaningful improvements in MF-related symptoms that were comparable across doses, while marginally greater reductions in spleen volume were observed at higher doses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This COMFORT-I analysis shows that dose-dependent cytopenias were effectively managed with ruxolitinib dose adjustments, and titrated doses of &#x02265;10 mg BID were associated with clinically meaningful reductions in spleen volume and symptom improvement at week 24.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COMFORT-I</kwd><kwd>dose titration</kwd><kwd>JAK2 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>myelofibrosis</kwd><kwd>ruxolitinib</kwd><kwd>treatment-related cytopenias</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelofibrosis (MF) is a life-threatening chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ott-7-013">1</xref> The median age at diagnosis is around 65 years,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ott-7-013">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ott-7-013">3</xref> and the estimated survival time for patients with advanced MF is 5 years or less, depending on the number of risk factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ott-7-013">4</xref> Although the natural history of MF is highly variable, typical manifestations are splenomegaly, which may be massive; cytopenias, particularly anemia and thrombocytopenia; and debilitating symptoms, which commonly include fatigue, fever, night sweats, pruritus, weight loss, early satiety, and abdominal pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ott-7-013">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ott-7-013">6</xref> MF may develop de novo (primary MF) or evolve from two other MPNs: essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ott-7-013">7</xref> Irrespective of the etiology of MF, the pathobiology of the disease is primarily characterized by dysregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-ott-7-013">8</xref></p><p>The oral JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib (Jakafi&#x000ae;; Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE, USA) is currently the only therapy approved in the US,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ott-7-013">9</xref> Canada,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ott-7-013">10</xref> and Europe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ott-7-013">11</xref> for the treatment of patients with MF.

Therefore, changes in spleen volume and symptoms were evaluated by the average daily dose received during the 4 weeks prior to the 24-week assessment. This analysis showed that final titrated doses of ruxolitinib of 10 mg BID or higher were associated with median reductions in spleen volume from baseline to week 24 of 31%&#x02013;41%, with slightly greater efficacy observed at higher doses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-013">Table 1</xref>). Patients with final titrated doses of 5 mg BID or less achieved a more modest improvement in spleen volume, with a median reduction from baseline to week 24 of 10.4%. In contrast, patients in the placebo group had a 9.2% median increase in spleen volume (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-013">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Median reductions in TSS were similar at titrated doses of 10 mg BID and higher (60%&#x02013;71% improvement) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-013">Table 1</xref>). Similar results were obtained for abdominal and cytokine TSS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-013">Table 1</xref>). Overall, symptom improvements associated with ruxolitinib doses of 5 mg BID or less were more modest than those achieved with doses of 10 mg BID or higher, and patients in the placebo group experienced symptom worsening (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ott-7-013">Table 1</xref>). An analysis of individual MFSAF symptom scores and the PROMIS fatigue score confirmed that a final titrated dose of 10 mg BID was associated with maximal or near-maximal reductions in symptom scores compared with higher doses, with the exception of pruritus, which showed greater improvements at higher doses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ott-7-013">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in platelet count over time</title><p>Individual dose adjustments were implemented in response to changes in platelet count, and as expected, based on the findings reported previously,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ott-7-013">12</xref> the greatest decrease in platelet count was observed within the first 8 weeks. By week 8, patients with a baseline platelet count of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L had a 25% mean decrease in platelet count (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, 145&#x000b1;29 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline to 109&#x000b1;46 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L at week 8), whereas those with a baseline platelet count greater than 200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L had a 43% mean decrease in platelet count (416&#x000b1;191 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L to 234&#x000b1;146 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L). However, after these initial decreases, platelet counts generally stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ott-7-013">Figure 2</xref>). Furthermore, with careful patient monitoring (ie, at least weekly hematology parameters for platelet count &#x0003c;100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L) and dose adjustments, only one patient in the ruxolitinib group discontinued for thrombocytopenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in hemoglobin level over time</title><p>Mean changes in hemoglobin level in patients randomized to ruxolitinib were characterized by a temporary decrement with a nadir around weeks 8&#x02013;12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-7-013">Figure 3A</xref>). At week 12, hemoglobin levels (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) in patients with a baseline platelet count of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and greater than 200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L decreased from baseline by approximately 10% and 12%, respectively, to 9.4&#x000b1;1.4 g/dL and 9.6&#x000b1;1.7 g/dL.

In COMFORT-I, RBC transfusions were optional in patients who developed anemia, and as previously reported, the proportion of patients receiving RBC transfusions increased after treatment initiation and then declined to levels observed in the placebo group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ott-7-013">12</xref> To assess the effects of RBC transfusions as well as study discontinuations on hemoglobin levels over time, a separate analysis was conducted that included only patients who received no postbaseline RBC transfusions and completed the first 24 weeks of the study. This analysis included 17 patients with baseline platelet counts of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L and 46 patients with baseline platelet counts greater than 200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L. Mean percentage changes in hemoglobin levels over time in this patient group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-7-013">Figure 3B</xref>) were similar to those seen in the analysis of all patients, regardless of transfusion status or time of discontinuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ott-7-013">Figure 3A</xref>). During this time frame of the primary analysis, only one patient discontinued for anemia in the ruxolitinib group.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in WBC count and ANC over time</title><p>Overall, patients tended to have elevated WBC counts and ANCs at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-7-013">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-ott-7-013">B</xref>). Few patients had low counts (&#x0003e;90% of patients had grade 0 leukopenia or neutropenia at baseline). In patients with starting platelet counts of 100&#x02013;200 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L, the mean WBC count (&#x000b1; standard deviation) decreased during the first 4 weeks of ruxolitinib therapy by 23%, from 21.3&#x000b1;22.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L at baseline to 16.3&#x000b1;18.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L at week 4.

Our results indicate that final titrated doses (average daily dose during weeks 21&#x02013;24) of 10 mg BID or higher were associated with clinically meaningful reductions in spleen size and improvements in MF-related symptoms, including fatigue, night sweats, pruritus, bone/muscle pain, and abdominal symptoms. In addition, maximal improvement in symptoms (with the exception of pruritus) was seen at final titrated doses of 10 mg BID, whereas further reduction in spleen volume was seen with higher doses. Our findings are supported by preliminary results from an ongoing study of patients with MF and baseline platelet counts of 50&#x02013;100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L. After starting with a dose of 5 mg BID, patients could receive higher doses, provided that they maintained adequate platelet counts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ott-7-013">18</xref> The majority of patients (with available data) were receiving doses of 10 mg BID or higher by week 24. At this time, the proportions of patients who achieved at least a 35% reduction in spleen volume and at least a 50% reduction in TSS (33% and 36%, respectively) approached the corresponding numbers for the ruxolitinib group in the COMFORT-I study population (42% and 46%, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ott-7-013">18</xref></p><p>The management of cytopenias in COMFORT-I involved careful monitoring of blood counts, and therefore dose adjustments could be implemented in a way that minimized large declines in hematology parameters that would necessitate dose holds or the receipt of less optimal doses. The utility of this strategy was most evident in the group of patients starting with a lower baseline platelet count. This group experienced the greatest percentage of dose reductions, yet many were able to continue treatment at a stable and efficacious dose. Although initial dose increases were optional in COMFORT-I (for inadequate efficacy), these analyses suggest that aggressive dose increases early in the course of therapy should be reserved for those patients able to maintain adequate platelet counts.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that careful patient monitoring and appropriate ruxolitinib dose titration as needed is an effective approach to optimizing treatment benefit for patients with MF. Because inhibition of JAK2 is expected to result in dose-dependent cytopenias, it is important to consider that new-onset or worsening anemia and thrombocytopenia during ruxolitinib therapy may not be a sign of worsening of the underlying disease. These treatment-related cytopenias tend to occur early in the course of treatment, and appropriate management may contribute to better patient outcomes. Additional follow-up from COMFORT-I will further our understanding of these outcomes with longer-term therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The COMFORT-I clinical trial was sponsored by Incyte Corporation.
