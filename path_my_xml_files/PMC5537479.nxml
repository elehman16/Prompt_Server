Patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or Heart Valve Surgery (HVS) after discharge enter phases II and III of cardiac rehabilitation. This period may be marked by initial physical inactivity, fear of activities of daily living, and difficulty in adapting to conventional physical training. Thus, FES has been used by different protocols and remains as a potential research tool in the processes of CR. We hypothesized that FES increases lower limb muscle mass, strength, and endurance, thus improving the functional capacity of patients in CR. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of FES on lower limb functional capacity, muscle mass, strength, and endurance after discharge from cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The project was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Universidade Federal de Santa Maria (UFSM; CAAE 0187.0.243.000-10), recorded in the protocol system ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT02088138" id="intr0005">NCT 02088138</ext-link> identifier) and informed consent was obtained from all patients. After consulting the database of the cardiology department of Hospital Universit&#x000e1;rio de Santa Maria (HUSM), the invitation was extended to the patients by telephone. The inclusion criteria were patients of both sexes who underwent CABG or HVS and who had already been discharged from hospital. All patients were submitted to phase I of cardiac rehabilitation postoperatively, but were sedentary on admission to the study. Patients with cognitive impairment that prevents performing evaluations, as well as those who were unable to understand the informed consent form were excluded. Patients were also excluded if they presented with peripheral vascular changes in the lower limbs, such as deep vein thrombosis or thromboangiitis obliterans, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular disease, musculoskeletal disease, or who presented the following contraindications to the use of FES: epidermal lesions at the site of application, intolerance to electrical stimulation, any change in skin sensitivity, or use of pacemaker.</p><sec id="sec0015"><title>Randomization</title><p>Eligible patients were randomized to the FES placebo group (FESPG) or the intervention group (FESG).

The sequence of numbers was generated by researchers blinded to the study after the selection of patients and only disclosed prior to the start of the intervention program to the physical therapist responsible for applying FES or FES placebo, in order to ensure concealment of the allocation sequence and to keep patients blinded to the type of intervention. Furthermore, the sessions were performed individually and at different times to avoid contact between groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec0020"><title>Evaluations</title><p>The electronic medical records of patients were consulted and an interview was performed for data collection identification, type and date of surgery, medications and comorbidities.

Our results also showed a significant increase in the muscle strength of the knee extensor muscles in the FESG over time and a significant between-group difference. These findings corroborate those of Banerjee et al.,<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> who studied 10 patients with CHF using a protocol of 60&#x000a0;min daily, five times a week for eight weeks and found that electrical stimulation increased the maximum lower limb strength. However, in our study only two weekly sessions of FES were performed, demonstrating that similar effects can be achieved with a lower frequency of treatment and with just 16 sessions of FES.</p><p>The study results also demonstrated that lower limb muscle endurance was improved in the FESG, with a significant between-group difference. This finding indicates that electrical currents applied at frequencies up to 20&#x000a0;Hz can recruit tonic/slow-twitch muscle fibers with high fatigue resistance. As suggested by Sbruzzi et al.,<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> the recruitment of certain types of muscle fibers appears to be related to the frequency of electrical stimulation. With a frequency below 20&#x000a0;Hz, the work is directed predominantly at type I fibers,<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> which feature fatigue resistant muscle contractions being performed at low metabolic cost.<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> With an electrical stimulation frequency between 35 and 70&#x000a0;Hz, type II fibers predominate.<xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> This offers the possibility of working strength gain using selective muscle stimulation,<xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> which can be advantageous when the aim is to recruit specific muscle fibers, such as fibers with a high oxidative potential that is decreased in heart failure patients.<xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>In a study by our group, Sbruzzi et al.<xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> compared the acute effect of functional electrical stimulation with frequencies of 15 and 50&#x000a0;Hz on the strength of quadriceps and found that FES with 50&#x000a0;Hz determines higher peak torque muscle than FES with 15&#x000a0;Hz. The study attributed this to the fact that muscle strength is proportional to the frequency of stimulation and the number of motor units recruited. Thus, the higher the frequency, the greater the motor recruitment producing greater muscle force.<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> In this context, assuming that muscle strength and tropism pose a direct proportional relationship, the absence of increased muscle mass for both groups after the end of the 16 sessions seems to be related to the stimulation of tonic muscle fibers, since we use a frequency of 15&#x000a0;Hz, aiming at muscle endurance.</p><p>Nuhr et al.<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> applied FES with a frequency of 15&#x000a0;Hz for 4&#x000a0;h/day, overload 20&#x02013;30% of maximum strength for 10 weeks in patients with heart failure and reported increased lower limb muscle mass, especially type I fibers (+20%), with a reduction in type II fibers (&#x02212;20%). Thus, the lack of change in muscular mass reported in our study may be further attributed to the shorter application period (8 weeks) as well as to shorter sessions (40&#x000a0;min). Other authors also mention the use of different FES parameters that can justify our findings: 60&#x000a0;min daily/5 days per week for 5 weeks,<xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> 60&#x000a0;min daily/5 days per week for 8 weeks,<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> 30&#x000a0;min a day/5 days per week for 6 weeks.<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref></p><p>In the analysis of functional capacity, both groups traveled greater distances in the 6MWT after intervention with functional electrical stimulation; however, it was not possible to identify differences between groups. This significant increase in functional capacity, even in subjects who received FES placebo, may be related to the natural recovery process after surgery and the stimulus provided by the attention given to patients by rehabilitation. The patients were instructed not to do any other form of exercise during the treatment with FES, but it is not possible to control the activities undertaken by patients in their everyday life, which may have affected the results for this variable. In contrast, in a study by Karavidas et al.,<xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> an increase in the 6MWD was only observed in the group treated with FES. Applying FES for a longer period of time and with a greater frequency of weekly sessions could offer more appropriate therapy to increase functional capacity. In addition, another proposed intervention based on an aerobic exercise program could offer greater specificity to change the 6MWD.</p><p>Overall, the results demonstrate a positive effect on the cardiac rehabilitation process of patients after cardiac surgery and encourage further research regarding FES as part of treatment programs offered to these patients. However, new tests should be conducted on this topic with a longer follow-up and with the inclusion of a larger number of subjects as well as variables that assess a broader dimension to the functional aspects in response to FES. Moreover, biochemical and morphological analyses of the quadriceps femoris muscle could promote a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in our findings.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the protocol used and described in detail in this study can be applied in patients undergoing cardiac surgery after hospital discharge safely and effectively; however, although FES is an interesting alternative of treatment, it does not replace conventional rehabilitation.</p><p>Among the main limitations, this was a small study in which an ideal intention to treat analysis was not fulfilled because the data of patients with loss of follow-up were incomplete. Thus, further studies are needed to confirm our findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec0065"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This randomized controlled trial helped to expand the level of scientific evidence regarding the use of FES as an alternative and valuable resource, since even a short period of application and low weekly frequency increased lower limb muscle strength and endurance in patients after cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0115"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0115"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>King</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lui</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>AACVPR/ACC/AHA 2007 performance measures on cardiac rehabilitation for referral to and delivery of cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention services endorsed by the American College of Chest Physicians, American College of Sports Medicine, American Physical Therapy Association, Canadian Association of Cardiac Rehabilitation, European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation, Inter-American Heart Foundation, National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists, Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons</article-title><source>J Am Coll Cardiol</source><volume>50</volume><issue>14</issue><year>2007</year><fpage>1400</fpage><lpage>1433</lpage><comment>PubMed PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pmid:17903645" id="intr0015">17903645</ext-link></comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17903645</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0120"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0120"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Santos</surname><given-names>A.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Silva</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanderlei</surname><given-names>F.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Christofaro</surname><given-names>D.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gon&#x000e7;alves</surname><given-names>A.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Vanderlei</surname><given-names>L.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Analysis of agreement between cardiac risk stratification protocols applied to participants of a center for cardiac rehabilitation</article-title><source>Braz J Phys Ther.</source><year>2016 Apr</year><comment>PubMed PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pmid:27049503" id="intr0020">27049503</ext-link></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0125"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0125"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lavie</surname><given-names>C.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>R.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Squires</surname><given-names>R.W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Allison</surname><given-names>T.G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Milani</surname><given-names>R.V.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Exercise training and cardiac rehabilitation in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease</article-title><source>Mayo Clin Proc.</source><volume>84</volume><issue>4</issue><year>2009</year><fpage>373</fpage><lpage>383</lpage><comment>PubMed PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pmid:19339657" id="intr0025">19339657</ext-link>.
