It has a high nutritive profile. It is composed of various vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, enzymes, etc., A recent study has identified the antimicrobial properties of honey <italic>in vitro</italic> H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and methylglyoxal (MGO) are distinct mechanisms involved in the bactericidal activity of honey.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>MH being a medical-grade honey is not easily available in all countries and regions. Although it is expensive, it has often been used in different studies as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; to test and evaluate the various biochemical properties of different kinds of honey from different botanical and geographical origins.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>A few <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments have studied the role of honey on plaque and dental microorganisms and most have used honey without dilution in its pure form to check the anti-plaque activity, but the current study was the first study that planned out the use honey as a mouthwash.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>This is because antibacterial properties of honey are increased when diluted. This action of honey can be explained through the paradox that honey contains an enzyme glucose oxidase that produces hydrogen peroxide when diluted which is a potent antibacterial substance and used widely and popularly among dentists.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The probability of demineralizing action of honey-based mouthwash formulation due to the presence of intrinsic sugar such as glucose and fructose was reduced by the dilution, and this was further supported by a study done among the orthodontic patients which showed that pH of plaque sample did not drop below the critical pH up to 30 min after the use of undiluted honey.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Another study has shown that the pH of the saliva rapidly resumes to the normal level of 6.8 after swallowing of the honey. The honey mouthwash formulation can be safely used twice daily, even during the night when the salivary flow rate is less as it has shown to have negligible effect on enamel microhardness due to its components such as Ca, phosphate, and other ions, as well as the buffering capacity.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Plaque scores</title><p>All the mouthwashes (MH, RH, and CHX mouthwash group) showed significant reductions in the plaque scores at 22<sup>nd</sup> day and 28<sup>th</sup> day as compared to the baseline.</p><p>The result of MH mouthwash in a reduction of mean plaque scores as compared from baseline was in accordance to the study done by English HK <italic>et al</italic>. and Nayak <italic>et al</italic>., after chewing lather made of honey and direct application into gingival sulcus, respectively.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Dental plaque is a host-associated matrix-enclosed biofilm with different bacterial populations which adhere to the tooth or other surfaces. Inhibition of bacteria leads to impairment of plaque formation and can explain the antiplaque effect of the mouthwashes.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The antiplaque effect of MH and RH can be attributed to the bactericidal activity of hydrogen peroxide which causes oxidative damages to the membrane, proteins, enzymes, and DNA.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The reduction in plaque levels by honey-based formulations could also be attributed to the other antibacterial components of honey such as low pH, high osmolarity, flavonoids, and bee defensin-1.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Unique manuka factor known as MGO present specifically in MH is toxic toward pathogens at low concentrations, interrupts cell divisions, and specifically causes the degradation of bacterial DNA.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Gingival scores</title><p>Reduction in a mean gingival index of all the three types of mouthwash (MH, RH, and CHX mouthwash group) was observed from baseline to 22<sup>nd</sup> day and 28<sup>th</sup> day. Results of MH mouthwash were in accordance to the study done by Atwa <italic>et al</italic>., where the anti-gingivitis effect of Honey on orthodontic patients was noticed after chewing lather made of honey due to which the number of <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> in the plaque were significantly reduced by the honey group compared to the other treatment groups. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies were done by Eick <italic>et al</italic>. and Schmidlin <italic>et al</italic>. where MH inhibited the growth of the planktonic <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> also showed results in accordance with the present study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The simplest form of gingivitis is associated with the accumulation of supragingival plaque along the gingival margins of the teeth. Hence, the previously described antiplaque/antibiofilm potential of honey due to various antimicrobial components of the honey could have led to the decrease in the gingival bleeding scores.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>The maximum reduction in the mean gingival scores and plaque scores was demonstrated by CHX and the equal reduction was shown by MH and RH mouthwashes. Although no true comparison could be made to the existing literature since no study has compared all the three types of mouthwash, the lower effectiveness of the honey-based mouthwashes could be attributed to the heterogeneous nature of honey and interference in their action by the other local factors of the mouth.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, significant reductions in plaque and gingival scores by RH and MH mouthwashes cannot be ignored.</p><p>Comparable reductions in plaque and gingival scores by RH honey and MH is a key finding in this study since MH is very expensive and not locally available, RH can serve as a good indigenous cost-effective alternative due to its equivalent reduction in plaque and gingival scores.</p><p>These mouthwash formulations showed no adverse effects and no staining of teeth with the usage which is a common drawback of CHX.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Honey-based mouthwash formulation can also serve as a good alternative for pediatric patients who might experience taste alteration upon usage.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Further, honey mouthwashes did not contain alcohol, artificial color, and artificial sweetener (such as saccharine). These ingredients in mouthwash formulation are easily fermentable by microorganisms, thereby releasing byproducts that cause halitosis.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Apart from improving dental health, the role of honey can be further tested on other type of mouth ailments such as aphthous ulcers, dry socket, and radiation mucositis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Among the three types of mouthwash tested, 0.2% CHX was most effective in reduction of plaque and gingival scores.

Within the limits and scope of the study, it can be safely concluded that both RH and MH may be used as an adjunct to mechanical therapy for achieving a significant reduction in inflammatory periodontal changes.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the study participants and Mr. Uday Kumar Bolmal for the help and support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marsh</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental plaque as a biofilm and a microbial community &#x02013; Implications for health and disease</article-title><source>BMC Oral Health</source><year>2006</year><volume>6</volume><issue>Suppl 1</issue><fpage>S14</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16934115</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bachrach</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Faerman</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ginesin</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Eini</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sol</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Coppenhagen-Glazer</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral microbes in health and disease</article-title><source>Beneficial Microorganisms in Multicellular Life Forms</source><year>2012</year><publisher-loc>Springer Berlin Heidelberg</publisher-loc><fpage>189</fpage><lpage>201</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Carounanidy</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Satyanarayanan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Velmurugan</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Use of an aqueous extract of <italic>Terminalia chebula</italic> as an anticaries agent: A clinical study</article-title><source>Indian J Dent Res</source><year>2007</year><volume>18</volume><fpage>152</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17938489</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vallianou</surname><given-names>NG</given-names></name><name><surname>Gounari</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Panagos</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kazazis</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Honey and its anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant properties</article-title><source>Gen Med Open Access</source><year>2014</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>5</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Holcombe</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Colyer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Deusch</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Flynn</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Early canine plaque biofilms: Characterization of key bacterial interactions involved in initial colonization of enamel</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><year>2014</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>e113744</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25463050</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Silness</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Loe</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Periodontal disease in pregnancy.
