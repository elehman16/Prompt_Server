These studies demonstrated tumor antigen-specific CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the peripheral blood of PND patients<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but also generated a paradox. PND antigens are normally expressed in the brain, and are ectopically expressed in tumors, but are not expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) that are necessary to prime na&#x000ef;ve T cell responses.<xref rid="pone.0012367-Banchereau1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Based on observations made with lupus antigens<xref rid="pone.0012367-CasciolaRosen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, we hypothesized that apoptotic cells might serve as an effective means of antigen transfer into DCs and presentation on MHC I for the activation of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Darnell3" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. This proved to be correct for both tumor<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and viral antigens<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and it is likely that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells serve as a general means by which the immune system surveys antigens throughout life. Insights from studying natural tumor immunity in PND provide a compelling base upon which to model clinical studies<xref rid="pone.0012367-Darnell2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Palucka1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Dunn1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Several observations support the suggestion that apoptotic tumor cells may serve as a potent source of antigen for stimulating host immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. Theoretically, all potential tumor antigens within an apoptotic tumor cell, and multiple epitopes from each antigen, can be cross-presented by DCs, where processed antigen may be placed on all (typically six) MHC I alleles. This offers considerable advantages over peptide-pulsed DC protocols, in which the investigator must have knowledge of the tumor antigen and must choose specific MHC I-restricted peptides for antigen stimulation. Antigen presentation from apoptotic cells has been estimated to be 10,000&#x02013;50,000 more efficient than free peptide in loading the MHC molecules of a DC<xref rid="pone.0012367-Inaba1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Apoptotic material is processed by a natural pathway: apoptotic cells are internalized by DC-restricted receptors, including the &#x003b1;<sub>v</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>5</sub> integrin receptor<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, then processed within DCs by distinct pathways<xref rid="pone.0012367-Blachere1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These DCs then generate both MHC I and MHC II peptide epitopes<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert4" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, leading to the activation of both CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. Since the ability of DCs cross-presenting apoptotic cells to activate effector CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells requires signals from CD4 helper cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert5" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, the ability of apoptotic material to be loaded on both MHC I and MHC II molecules is of particular importance in considering its potential in immunotherapy.</p><p>DCs presenting apoptotic tumor cells stimulate T cell responses in animals and <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0012367-Benencia1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Clinically, several studies have used killed tumor cells in vaccine trials, including glial<xref rid="pone.0012367-Okada1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0012367-Yu1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, prostate<xref rid="pone.0012367-Simons1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, melanoma<xref rid="pone.0012367-Palucka2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, breast<xref rid="pone.0012367-NeidhardtBerard1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, ovarian<xref rid="pone.0012367-Koido1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and pediatric solid tumor cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Geiger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> (reviewed in <xref rid="pone.0012367-Palucka1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Benencia1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Saito1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>). These studies have not focused on apoptotic death per se, but rather have killed tumor cells by various means (e.g. freeze-thawing, or large amounts of UVB and gamma irradiation), leading to incompletely characterized mixtures of necrotic and apoptotic cell death. Interpretation of these studies is complicated by controversy regarding the immunogenic potency of different forms of dead cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert6" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Nonetheless, some trials have indicated the potential for immunologic and clinical responses to autologous DC presenting dead tumor cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Palucka2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Here we set out to more precisely test the relationship between induction of PND-like tumor immune responses and development of a clinical vaccine. We induced apoptotic death of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, and allowed them to be phagocytosed by autologous DCs generated from prostate cancer patients' peripheral blood monocytes; such DCs were previously shown to stimulate both CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0012367-Orange1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and in a B16 mouse melanoma model DCs cross-presenting apoptotic tumor were effective in preventing tumor growth (Blachere et al., unpublished data). Here we report the safety and immunogenicity of DC/apoptotic LNCaP prostate tumor cells in a controlled study of 24 prostate cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Population</title><p>Twenty-four consecutive eligible patients were vaccinated with DC/LNCaP, together with control vaccinations.

We did note small ANA elevations post vaccine in 5 patients (titer of 1&#x02236;160 in one patient, &#x02264;1&#x02236;80 in four patients) which resolved over time in 4/5 patients. However, we also noted that of 7 patients with detectable ANA levels pre-vaccination, 5 became lower after vaccination. Statistical analysis of ANA changes pre versus post vaccine/placebo in Arm 1 versus Arm 2 revealed no significant differences (Fisher's exact test), and we conclude that ANA changes were not clinically meaningful; moreover, such transient responses have commonly been seen in DC based vaccines<xref rid="pone.0012367-Geiger1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Banchereau2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. One reason that we chose prostate cancer as an initial tumor for study using this vaccine approach is that these tumors are rarely associated with PND. Despite the safety of the vaccine here, caution is warranted in extending this approach to patients harboring tumors known to be associated with PND (for example gynecologic tumors expressing the cdr2 or Nova antigens and small cell lung cancers expressing the Hu antigen)<xref rid="pone.0012367-Darnell1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0012367-Darnell2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Our dendritic cell/apoptotic tumor vaccine was immunogenic. Sixty-seven percent of patients developed DTH responses to LNCaP antigens. Furthermore, these DTH responses were positively correlated with post-vaccine bulk T cell proliferation responses. This high level of immunogenicity was similar to that reported in other studies of peptide-pulsed or tumor cell associated DC vaccines. Importantly, these responses included CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses to prostate tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0012367-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). This is significant, as a critical determinant of successful tumor vaccines is likely to be induction of CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses<xref rid="pone.0012367-Raychaudhuri1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. The ability to detect such responses here is consistent with the observation that cross-presentation of apoptotic cells are able to stimulate na&#x000ef;ve and memory CD8&#x0002b; T cell responses to tumor cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> or to virally infected cells<xref rid="pone.0012367-Albert3" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>

Such background responses have been seen before in DC-based vaccines and are of uncertain etiology<xref rid="pone.0012367-Palucka3" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and may be reflected in transient increases in ANA seen in some patients. It is likely that patients had variable immune responses to tumor vaccination, either resulting from intrinsic differences in immune repertoire, or from actions of the tumor itself to modify patient immune responses<xref rid="pone.0012367-Bui1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Significantly, we found that PSA slopes decreased and PSADT increased after vaccination in our patient population as a whole (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.016). We hypothesized that if this correlation was related to the immunogenicity of the vaccine, PSA changes should be present in the subset of patients showing immunogenic response to vaccine but not in those who do not. In fact, patients who had DTH responses to LNCaP after vaccination had significant decreases in PSA slope (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.020), compared to patients who did not have DTH responses (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.631).

These observations suggest that this vaccination approach warrants further exploration as a safe and potent means of triggering tumor immune response in the general population of cancer patients.

The quality and viability of the vaccine was monitored by flow cytometry; to pass release criteria the HLA-DR (DC) cell fraction had to be &#x0003e;70&#x00025; CD83&#x0002b;, &#x0003c;15&#x00025; CD14&#x0002b; and &#x0003c;20&#x00025; Propidium Iodide (PI) &#x0002b; (Serologicals). All antibodies were purchased from BD Pharmingen. Sterility was tested by gram stain, by culture for bacterial and fungal contamination (BacT/ALERT, Biomereux), and by DNA fluorochrome for mycoplasma (Bionique Testing Laboratories, Inc.). The LAL method (Associates of Cape Cod) was used to test for endotoxin. The final product was divided into 4 equal aliquots, each containing 2&#x02212;10&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> DCs each. The first aliquot was given as a &#x0201c;fresh&#x0201d; dose; all other aliquots were frozen and thawed prior to administration.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Clinical and Immunomonitoring</title><sec id="s4c1"><title>Clinical Monitoring</title><p>Patients were monitored at each study visit by history, physical examination, and by laboratory evaluations including CBC, chemistries, and urinalysis, for any adverse effects. The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3 was used to grade toxicities. Patients were also asked to maintain a diary of local injection site reactions and systemic adverse events for one week following each vaccination.</p><p>To assess for clinical response, PSA levels were measured in the serum using MSA Bayer Immuno I or IEA Tosoh Nexia assays at each study visit. The PSA slope was calculated for each phase of the study (pre-vaccine, vaccine, and post-vaccine phases) using a linear mixed model with two knots representing the change in slope in each phase of the study. In addition, for each phase of study for each patient, a PSA doubling time (PSADT) was calculated using the formula: 1 divided by the slope log<sub>2</sub> PSA derived from this linear spline model.</p></sec><sec id="s4c2"><title>Immunomonitoring</title><p>A DTH panel was placed intradermally at weeks 1 (vaccine), 3 (Boost #1), 5 (Boost #2), 7 (Boost #3), 9, 17 and 29 to assess for T cell responses. The panel included lysate of 10<sup>5</sup> LNCaP cells (in 0.1 ml normal saline), 0.05 mg KLH, candida or tetanus toxoid (whichever the patient had responses to at baseline, as positive control), and saline (as negative control). Responses were considered positive if erythema was equal to or greater than 5 mm at 48 hours post implantation.</p><p>We evaluated immunogenicity outcomes against apoptotic LNCaP and PC3 (another prostate cancer tumor cell line) by <sup>3</sup>H thymidine or CFSE proliferation assays as described<xref rid="pone.0012367-Orange1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> with the following modifications. In the <sup>3</sup>H thymidine assay, autologous monocytes (CD14&#x0002b; cells) were used as APCs. 3T3 cells, an irrelevant cell line, were used as the negative control antigen and influenza infected (strain A/P/R8) 3T3 cells were used as a positive control for both pre-vaccine and post-vaccine T cell responses. 3T3 cells were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture. In the CFSE assay, DCs cross-presenting prostate tumor antigens or 293 cells (irrelevant cell line used as negative control antigen) were used as APCs and cultured with T cells stained with CFSE (Vibrant CFDA SE Cell Tracer Kit, Invitrogen). On day 5, T cells were stained with anti-CD8 conjugated antibody (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed using FlowJo software. All cell lines were UV-B irradiated to induce apoptotic death three hours prior to co-culture with APCs<xref rid="pone.0012367-Orange1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>To assess for correlations between patients who had a DTH response to LNCaP lysate and those who had T cell proliferation responses to apoptotic LNCaP <italic>in vitro,</italic> patients were ranked by a DTH index and a T cell (<sup>3</sup>H thymidine) proliferation index. The DTH index was calculated as the number of positive DTH responses to LNCaP lysate divided by the total number of DTH time points for each patient. The T cell proliferation index was calculated as the post-vaccine LNCaP response (CPM) minus 2 standard deviations, divided by post-vaccine 3T3 response (CPM) plus 2 standard deviations.</p><p>FACS staining of regulatory T cells was done by surface staining with anti-CD4-FITC (Becton Dickinson) followed by intracellular staining with anti-Foxp3-APC (eBioscience, clone PCH101) per manufacturers instructions. For analysis, PBMCs were gated on CD4&#x0002b; T cells and the percentage of Foxp3&#x0002b; cells was determined (FlowJo).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The protocol called for 12 patients to be recruited to each of two arms, which would have 90&#x00025; power to detect an increase in cumulative serious adverse events (SAEs) from 5&#x00025; in the placebo group to 50&#x00025; in the vaccine group at the 10&#x00025; level. All adverse events were analyzed using Fisher's exact test to compare placebo and vaccine phase. Significance of DTH responses to LNCaP cell lysate was determined by the exact binomial test with 95&#x00025; confidence intervals. To analyze pre- to post- T cell proliferation data (per antigen) for study subjects as a group, a two-sampled paired t-test was used with 95&#x00025; confidence intervals. The Spearman rank correlation test was used to determine if those that had DTH responses to LNCaP lysate also had T cell proliferation responses to apoptotic LNCaP <italic>in vitro</italic>. The paired t-test was used to compare the percentage of pre- vs post-vaccine Foxp3&#x0002b; cells in PBMCs with 95&#x00025; confidence intervals. In all of the above tests, the differences or correlation were deemed statistically significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.</p><p>To model the evolution of PSA (in log-scale) during the three study phases (pre-vaccine, vaccine, and post-vaccine phases), a mixed linear spline model was used. Two knots (one at the start of the vaccine phase and the other at the start of the post-vaccine phase) were used to directly quantify the differences in slopes between each phase. To account for the heterogeneous treatment effect and the repeated measures structure, random effects are incorporated into the model. For the general model, random effects for the intercept, slope and the first knot were considered. To determine if there was any difference in PSA slopes between those that did have an immunologic response (DTH responders to LNCaP lysate) and those that did not (DTH non-responders to LNCaP lysate), a second model, stratified by these response indicators (with separate knots for the two groups), was fitted and the likelihood ratio test was conducted. Similarly, a third model was fitted, this time, stratified by PSA at study start of &#x0003c;1 ng/ml or &#x02265;1 ng/ml. The models with stratification were then compared to the general model. All models were fitted and hypotheses were tested using the <italic>lme</italic> package from R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org">www.R-project.org</ext-link>). The Wilcoxon matched-paired signed rank test was used to determine statistical significance of the difference in PSADT between phases (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/service/statistics/signed_rank_test.html">www.fon.hum.uva.nl/service/statistics/signed_rank_test.html</ext-link>). A PSADT can be a positive number as a result of rising PSA levels or a negative number as a result of declining PSA levels. For the purpose of statistical analysis, negative PSADT (indicating declining PSAs) were replaced with 9999 months to represent an infinitely long doubling time so that they rank higher than any value for which doubling time was a positive number. Differences were deemed significant if the p-value was less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0012367.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>Consort checklist.</p><p>(0.13 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0012367.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0012367.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>FDA-approved IND 10710 protocol.</p><p>(0.58 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0012367.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Michel Sadelain for helpful discussions, members of the Darnell laboratory for critical discussion and review of the manuscript, members of the Rockefeller University Hospital Nursing Staff for their compassionate care of the study participants, members of the MSKCC clinical and research nurses, Gabrielle Aruz, Anthony Delacruz, and Tracy Smart-Curley, for their assistance with study patients, Sarah Schlesinger and Mary Marovich for help drafting SOPs, Stephen Paget for advice regarding relevance of ANAs, and Denise Larone for help with release criteria.
