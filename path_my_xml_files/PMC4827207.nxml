They may contribute significantly to day-to-day personal care and psychological support. The importance of nonprofessional caregivers has been recognized by the Dutch government, which encourages a greater role for caregivers in providing psychological support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], as the care for these patients is virtually unattainable by professional health care providers alone. However, caring for a loved one with depression also has drawbacks, such as the risk of overburden due to decreased time for personal activities, disrupted everyday life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], communication problems, financial difficulties, and social exclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This puts these nonprofessional caregivers at risk for developing symptoms of stress, anxiety, and depression, which often are associated with reduced quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Research by de Boer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed that 80&#x000a0;% of nonprofessional caregivers express a need for more support in the form of information, advice, or guidance.</p><p>Prevention research has demonstrated that early intervention is effective in preventing overburdening and decreasing distress. Stam and Cuijpers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], for example, have demonstrated that a group psychoeducational intervention can reduce the experienced burden of nonprofessional caregivers of patients with a range of psychological problems. Likewise, a group psychoeducational intervention for nonprofessional caregivers caring for a patient with bipolar disorder, as compared with a control group, also demonstrated a reduction in experienced burden as well as an increase in knowledge about the disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, these group interventions are time-consuming and often do not fit into a caregiver&#x02019;s busy schedule.</p><p>An online self-management intervention for the nonprofessional caregiver of a patient with depression that is aimed at increasing mental resilience and self-reliance to reduce subjective burden and prevent the development of psychological symptoms may overcome these barriers. It could be accessed 24&#x000a0;h per day, 7&#x000a0;days per week at a location and within a time frame that are the most convenient for the caregiver. Such an intervention would also be relatively easy to implement on a larger scale in the general population with minimal costs.</p><p>Previous research demonstrated robust evidence that Internet-based treatments can be effective for reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The effect sizes are comparable to those observed in face-to-face treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, Internet-based interventions have the potential to be more cost-effective than face-to-face treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Also, an online intervention that was developed for nonprofessional caregivers caring for people with dementia was well-received (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dementieonline.nl">www.dementieonline.nl</ext-link>). One study showed positive results of web-based peer support for families of patients with depression, although the researchers in that study recommended including professional feedback as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, to date, no study has examined the effects of online interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles for caregivers of patients with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>This paper describes the protocol of a pilot study designed to evaluate (1) the feasibility of an online self-management intervention, E-care 4 caregivers, for nonprofessional caregivers of patients with depression, and (2) the initial effects of E-care 4 caregivers on psychological distress, subjective burden, symptoms of anxiety and depression, level of mastery, and quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the online intervention E-care 4 caregivers with a wait list control group (WLC).

Caregivers who are interested in taking part can find more information about the study on the website of the Mental Health Fund (Fonds Psychische Gezondheid), which hosts the study website. If they are interested in taking part in the study, they can register via the website. Next, they have to provide digital informed consent before being directed to the online baseline assessment. Those who are eligible to take part will be randomized to the intervention condition or the WLC group. Subjects in the intervention condition will have access to the online intervention for 6&#x000a0;weeks, while those assigned to the WLC condition will get access to the E-care 4 caregivers intervention after the 6-week assessment. Participants in both arms will be invited to complete an online assessment 6&#x000a0;weeks after baseline. Participants in the E-care 4 caregivers intervention group may also be approached for a qualitative interview. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) will be followed for reporting the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

This book is based on psychoeducation, CBT principles, and the experience of the book&#x02019;s author in working with support groups for family members of depressed people.</p><p>Relevant stakeholders were also included in the early development phase of the intervention by means of two focus groups in which the needs of nonprofessional caregivers were assessed. The first focus group included five nonprofessional caregivers currently caring for a loved one with depression. The second focus group consisted of eight professionals in the field of depression, nonprofessional caregivers, and/or professionals in the design and use of Internet interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Content</title><p>Both caregivers and experts agreed that the focus of the content should be on the caregiver, not on the patient with depression. Key components are recognition and validation for the nonprofessional caregiver. Psychoeducation about depression, stress, burnout, and self-care is needed, as well as practical information about general mental health care and tips regarding communication, grief, assertiveness, boundaries, and how to cope with negative feelings (guilt, responsibility, anger). Optional information for certain situations would be about coping with suicidality, changes in a relationship, and how to support children of a parent with depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Format</title><p>Both caregivers and experts preferred a cherry-picking design of the intervention (i.e., caregivers can choose which modules they would like to follow). Both groups agreed the content should be visually attractive and informal in tone, yet professional. Information should be provided by experts in an interactive manner by using text, videos, exercises, and examples. Interestingly, the caregivers differed in their recommendations about the frequency of use. Professionals preferred a more structured form, whereas nonprofessional caregivers recommended that the online course be available whenever they could find the time. Also, caregivers highly valued professional guidance by a coach, as they require validation and recognition of their stressful situation. The opportunity for peer contact would also be highly advisable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Prerequisites</title><p>Both focus groups agreed that the online intervention should also be accessible via smartphones and tablets. Furthermore, it should be free of charge, password-protected, and run without technical difficulties. Also, it would be beneficial if participants could track their own progress to feel a sense of accomplishment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Assessments</title><p>All quantitative assessments are self-report measures and will be administered online.

The SUS is composed of 10 statements that are scored on a 5-point scale of strength of agreement. Final scores for the SUS can range from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate better usability. This means that products that are at least passable have SUS scores above 70, with better products scoring in the high 70s to upper 80s. Truly superior products score better than 90. Products with scores less than 70 should be considered candidates for increased scrutiny and continued improvement and should be judged to be marginal at best.

We estimate that the benefits of the study will be greater than any possible risk. Serious adverse events (e.g., negative life events, symptoms) are regularly monitored by the coach during the intervention. They will be documented by the research team and reported immediately to the principal investigator. If there is an adverse event, it will be discussed with a senior clinical academic independent of VU University and the research team. Appropriate courses of action will be agreed on and implemented. Participants are also advised to contact their general practitioner if they experience increased mental health symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study is being conducted in accordance with local laws and regulations and follows the Medical Research Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and European Union directives to ensure trial integrity as well as participants&#x02019; safety and well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Respondents who are interested in taking part receive detailed information about the study and have the opportunity to ask questions. Digital informed consent will be obtained from all study subjects before the start of the study. Participants are allowed to terminate study participation at any time without giving a reason. The study has been reviewed and approved by the ethics committee of VU Amsterdam, Amsterdam, the Netherlands (VCWE-2015-126). Modifications to the protocol require a formal amendment to the protocol. This will be completed by the principal investigator. All changes and amendments to the protocol are supervised and approved by the sponsor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this study will be the first pilot RCT to evaluate the feasibility and initial effects of E-care 4 caregivers, an online self-management intervention for nonprofessional caregivers of patients with depression. Previous research among nonprofessional caregivers in general revealed an urgent need for support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and group interventions showed positive results in reducing stress and experienced burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The strength of the study design is the inclusion of a qualitative analysis to assess the feasibility of the intervention. Further, this pilot study will provide a reliable indication of the sample size needed for an RCT testing the effectiveness of the intervention. Only preliminary conclusions on the effectiveness of the intervention can be drawn, owing to the small sample size. Conclusions regarding the prevention of disorders is, at this stage, preliminary. Also, this intervention targets the general population, and it is possible that potential improvement cannot yet be detected. However, the population is still at higher risk for psychological complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], so a first indication would therefore be needed.</p><p>This intervention is one of the first [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] to be developed for this type of nonprofessional caregiver, and recruitment results as well as previous research underscore the need for more support in this particular group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also, the intervention has the potential to be cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and relatively easy to implement in general health care to reduce costs and increase availability for professional mental health care.</p><p>This study will provide insight into the feasibility and initial effects of an online self-management intervention for nonprofessional caregivers of patients with depression. E-care 4 caregivers could potentially benefit nonprofessional caregivers, as well as patients and professionals indirectly.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started recruitment in September 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>cognitive behavioral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GAD7</term><def><p>7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K10</term><def><p>Kessler Psychological Distress Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUS</term><def><p>System Usability Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WLC</term><def><p>wait list control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ZBI-12</term><def><p>12-item Zarit Burden Interview</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>TD obtained funding for the study, participated in the design and will coordinate and supervise the study and data collection.
