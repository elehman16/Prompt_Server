Sphingomyelin (SM), a major part of sphingolipid, is localized to the plasma membrane and lysosomal and golgi membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. SM is present in considerable quantities in the Western diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The per capita consumption of SM in the United States is estimated to be 300&#x02013;400&#x000a0;mg/d; milk (dairy products) and eggs provide 220&#x000a0;mg/d of SM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Sphingomyelin plays an important role in cell membrane formation and plasma lipoprotein metabolism including cholesterol efflux, cholesterol absorption, synthesis, and conversion to bile acids, cholesterol esters and other metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ABCG1 mediates the efflux of SM and cholesterol from cell membranes depending on their level and distribution in the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Metabolic regulation of SM and cholesterol appear to be inter-coordinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. SM has a strong affinity with cholesterol and correlates with the quantity of cholesterol in cell membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As SM binds to cholesterol, it could bind to luminal cholesterol and inhibit absorption directly.</p><p>SM may be relatively resistant to solubilization into bile salt micelles or form cholesterol-SM bilayers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. SM enriched micelles have been shown to markedly reduce cholesterol solubility compared to phospholipid (PL) enriched micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Hence, SM and the ratio of cholesterol to SM have the potential to markedly alter cholesterol trafficking and homeostasis in cells, including enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition to affecting sterol balance across cells, SM could affect cholesterol absorption from the lumen of the gut. Indeed, SM has been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol absorption in mice and reduce cholesterol uptake by CaCo2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Consumption of SM affects plasma and tissue levels of cholesterol and reduces cholesterol absorption in intestines of rats and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In mice, diet enriched with 0.1% SM reduced cholesterol absorption by 20.48% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This dose is near the range possible for enrichment of human diets that would allow assessment of the effects of dietary SM on cholesterol absorption and synthesis. Co-administration of cholesterol and SM leads to inhibition of absorption of both lipids in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. At 1:1 molar ratios (SM/Cholesterol), cholesterol absorption is reduced from 68 to 9% while at ratios of 0.5:1.0, absorption is reduced to 25% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since the average diet contains 300&#x02013;400&#x000a0;mg/day of sphingolipid (an amount comparable to dietary cholesterol and accounting for 0.01-0.02% of the diet by weight), it appears very likely that, even without any dietary manipulation, sphingolipids impact cholesterol absorption.</p><p>Reduction of LDL cholesterol and elevation of HDL cholesterol by SM consumption in rats and mice makes SM a potential &#x0201c;functional food&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, Ohlsson et al. found no significant changes in plasma lipid profile after consumption of SM by humans, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. These studies were free living studies and not well controlled with the background diet during the study. Earlier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] was a parallel designed study and the latter one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] analysed the postprandial lipids with single dose SM administration. Both these studies tested a milk drink -like formulation containing sphingolipids (975&#x000a0;mg) including SM (700&#x000a0;mg), glucoceramides (180&#x000a0;mg) and gangiosides (95&#x000a0;mg). Hence, there is a need of a study with well controlled background diet and cross design to determine the effect of SM when consumed alone on lipid metabolism. There are no such studies with humans to report the effect of SM consumption on cholesterol kinetics including cholesterol absorption and synthesis. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of dietary SM supplementation on serum lipids, cholesterol absorption and synthesis and its effects on the intraluminal cholesterol solubilization process under a well controlled situation in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Ten subjects (5 males and 5 females) of age 32.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.1&#x02009;y; height 170&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11&#x000a0;cm; body weight 66.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.5&#x000a0;kg and BMI 23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) completed the controlled randomized cross over study.

Current study represents the first definitive study to measure the lipid profile, cholesterol absorption and synthesis in humans under well controlled background diets. Studies in humans, to date, on the effect of SM on cholesterol metabolism or absorption have been limited despite its potential effect demonstrated in rodents and cell culture. Although there has been a human trial with administration of SM enriched formulated drink, study had been conducted under free living conditions without robust control on background diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Effect of dietary sphingolipids on plasma lipids was examined by Ohlsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] in a parallel design of 48 healthy adults who consumed a sphingolipid enriched milk drink containing 975&#x000a0;mg sphingolipid with 700&#x000a0;mg as SM daily for 4&#x000a0;weeks. Consumption of sphingolipids in this amount had no effect on plasma lipids. Previous studies on effect of sphingolipids on postprandial lipid concentrations showed no change in plasma lipid profile. Although our study was only 2&#x000a0;weeks in duration and was 1&#x000a0;g SM/day with a cross over design, we found similar results with the exception of increased HDL-cholesterol with SM dietary enrichment.</p><p>Findings from studies with various animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] have shown reductions in plasma total and LDL cholesterol along with reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption. SM supplemented diet (0.5%) for 45&#x000a0;days reduced the hepatic lipids and plasma non HDL cholesterol levels in Zucker fatty rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Hyperlipidemic APOE*3 Leiden mice consuming a Western diet supplemented with 0.2 and 0.4% sphingolipids for 3&#x000a0;weeks had reduced plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, whereas, lower supplementations (0.1%) had no effect on plasma lipids. When higher levels were fed (1%), cholesterol absorption was reduced by 50% in this animal model leading to a 57 and 58% reduction in plasma total cholesterol and triglycerides respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In male Sprague Dawley rats, cholesterol absorption was 19.5% after SM treatment compared to 37.6% in control animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Rodent studies have also suggested that the ratio between SM and cholesterol may also be a significant determinant for the inhibitory effect of SM on cholesterol absorption. Cholesterol absorption was reduced by different range of molar ratios of SM and cholesterol between 0.5 and 2.6 in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Intestinal cholesterol absorption was 17, 9 and 25% when rats treated with SM and cholesterol at 2.6:1, 1:1 and 0.5:1.0 ratio respectively, compared to 68% when treated with cholesterol alone without SM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, our study used SM to cholesterol molar ratio of 1.0:0.3 which is closer to one of the molar ratios used in the animal study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] but we found no significant change in either cholesterol absorption or synthesis.</p><p>It is disappointing that the previous findings in animal and cell culture studies could not be replicated in humans because of the potential that SM might be used as a functional food. There may be several reasons for these species/experimental condition differences in our findings. SM is not rapidly hydrolysed in intestine in rodents. SMase, which is responsible for digesting SM, is present in very low quantities in pancreatic juice and bile from liver of rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. SMase is an alkaline enzyme that is active at pH&#x000a0;9 and hence is inactive in gastric and duodenal lumen. Hydrolysis of SM in the upper small intestinal lumen is very deliberate, ineffective and incomplete which might be responsible for the inhibitory effect of cholesterol absorption by SM in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In contrast, in humans the hydrolysis of SM is faster and more efficient than rodents as SMase is secreted into the bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Recently it has been demonstrated that humans can digest and absorb most of the SM consumed in normal diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. It has also been reported that enzymes responsible for digestion of SM including intestinal alkaline SMase and ceramidase are well expressed in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Unlike animals, SMase is expressed both in the intestine as well as in liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in humans. However, the digestion of sphingolipid by these enzymes remains poorly defined. The effects of these enzymes may be affected not only by the presence of other lipids but also the ratio between bile salt and SM as well as bile salt and ceramide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Although it has been reported that SM could bind to luminal cholesterol and resist solubilization into bile salt micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we found no changes in the concentrations of luminal bile acids and cholesterol in humans in the current study. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of SM on cholesterol absorption in rodents is likely different than the effects in humans. Although this is the first definitive study of the effect of SM on cholesterol metabolism and absorption in humans, there were some limitations of current study: 1. The presence of multiple enzymes in the human gut including SMase were not analysed which may explain why we did not see the effects of SM in humans found in rodents. 2. Our sample size was small but given the minimal changes observed a larger sample would likely have shown similar results. 3. There may have been confounding problems with solubilizing SM with olive oil as this may not truly represent how SM might be present in the matrix of a high SM diet; however, this was only practicable way to ensure added SM in the diet. 4. The dose of SM may not have been sufficient to observe changes in cholesterol absorption/metabolism given the proposed higher efficiency of SMase in humans vs. rodents.</p><p>The current study included only healthy subjects. More studies may be needed to determine whether SM affects cholesterol absorption and plasma lipids in hyperlipidemic subjects. The dose of SM supplementation used in the current study was 1&#x000a0;g/day and was well tolerated as observed in a previous human study in humans consuming 975&#x000a0;mg per day of sphingolipid or 4&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To determine an inhibitory effect on cholesterol absorption and reduction in plasma lipids, the dose could be increased provided that the increased dose does not cause any deleterious effects. Unfortunately, the cost of such supplementation may make additional supplement prohibitive and identifying foods with high SM content might be a more practicable approach.</p><p>In conclusion, consumption of 1&#x000a0;g/day of SM added to the diet in humans does not affect cholesterol absorption, synthesis and blood lipid profile except an increase in HDL. Hence, further studies are needed to investigate the safety and efficacy of SM consumption with optimal higher doses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Human subjects</title><p>Healthy adult males and females (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;10), ages 18&#x02013;45, were recruited by advertisement.

Thereafter, subjects visited the GCRC every third day to pick up prepared diets which were frozen after preparation. Subjects were weighed weekly to ensure maintenance of basal weight.</p><p>After two weeks on the diet (Day 14), study subjects were seen after a 16&#x000a0;hours fast at the GCRC. Urine samples were obtained for pregnancy testing on women of childbearing age. Topical anesthesia was applied to the nose and throat, and sedation was used with intravenous midazolam if subjects wished. A nasoduodenal tube was placed with fluoroscopic guidance with the tube tip at the ligament of Treitz. Subjects ingested a meal consisting of olive oil, egg and egg white, sucrose, vanilla extract and 0.15&#x000a0;M NaCl in 240&#x000a0;ml water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Duodenal drainage (15&#x000a0;ml - 20&#x000a0;ml) was collected by siphonage in 15-minute intervals for 1&#x000a0;hour and then 30-minute intervals during the second hour. Aliquots were saved and stored at -70&#x000b0;C for each time period until analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>On day 16, subjects received oral and intravenous doses of stable isotope labeled cholesterol and blood was collected at baseline and at 24, 48, 72, and 96&#x000a0;hours for measurement of cholesterol absorption using the dual isotope method. On Day 19, cholesterol fractional synthesis rate (FSR) was assessed. After an overnight fast, baseline blood was drawn for RBC cholesterol isotopic ratio and for serum total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Subjects were given oral deuterated water and the next day (Day 20), blood was obtained at the same time as isotope administration on Day 19.</p><p>After completing the baseline studies, subjects participated in the alternative arm of the study with a washout period of at least 4&#x000a0;week between studies. Thereafter, the same sequence of events was performed as described for the first phase of the study. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of CCHMC and the Scientific Advisory Committee of the GCRC.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Laboratory analyses</title><sec><title>Serum lipid profile analysis</title><p>Serum total and HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were measured enzymatically by Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute, a certified Center for Disease Control Lipid Research Clinic.</p></sec><sec><title>Cholesterol absorption measurement</title><p>Free cholesterol was extracted from RBC according to established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. <sup>13</sup>C cholesterol enrichments in RBC lipid extracts were determined using an on-line gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry approach (Agilent 6890&#x000a0;N chromatograph interfaced with a Finnigan Delta V Pulse isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Bremen, Germany)). Isotope abundance, expressed in delta (d) per mil (&#x02030;), was calculated using CO<sub>2</sub> as a reference gas and further corrected against the international reference standard, Pee Dee Belemnite limestone.
