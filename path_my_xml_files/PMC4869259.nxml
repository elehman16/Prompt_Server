Here, the authors report on a clinical trial using fulvestrant and show that mutations in the oestrogen receptor alpha gene are prevalent in circulating tumour DNA and do not influence the clinical outcome of patients to fulvestrant.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Oestrogen receptor alpha (ER&#x003b1;), encoded by the <italic>ESR1</italic> gene, is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily that is expressed in &#x0223c;70&#x00025; of newly diagnosed breast cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. ER&#x003b1; and its cognate ligand oestrogen are the major drivers of tumour development and disease progression in luminal breast cancers, and agents that impair ER signalling in ER-positive breast cancers represent highly successful targeted therapies that are widely used in both early breast cancer, as well as the metastatic setting<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. The selective oestrogen receptor modulator tamoxifen was approved in 1997 and still represents the standard of care for adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> especially in premenopausal patients, though aromatase inhibitors (AIs) that block biosynthesis of oestrogen are commonly incorporated into adjuvant treatment algorithms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> and represent a first-line standard of care in advanced, metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. While the SERD fulvestrant is similar to selective oestrogen receptor modulators in antagonizing ER transcriptional activity, fulvestrant also causes ER degradation and has proven to be just as effective as AIs in advanced breast cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>Despite the effectiveness of the various anti-hormonal therapies, intrinsic and acquired resistance remains a persistent problem that limits the ultimate effectiveness of these treatments<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. The issue is particularly acute in the ER&#x0002b; metastatic breast cancer (MBC) setting, where up to half of all patients show intrinsic resistance and do not benefit from therapy, and ultimately all ER&#x0002b; MBC patients develop acquired resistance and progress on anti-hormonal therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Preclinical and clinical investigations have demonstrated that these resistant ER&#x0002b; breast cancers often retain ER&#x003b1; expression and dependence on oestrogen receptor signalling. In clinical practice, continued ER dependence is observed with patients who have progressed on one form of endocrine therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> often remaining responsive to different endocrine therapies in subsequent lines of therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. The discovery of acquired mutations in <italic>ESR1</italic> that confer ligand-independent and constitutive activation of ER&#x003b1; revealed one potential mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapies. <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were originally reported in a small cohort of metastatic breast cancers in 1997 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and confirmed recently in several larger studies that utilized next-generation sequencing and suggested that such mutations are present in &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of metastatic tissue samples but are generally not found in primary tumour samples<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The most frequently occurring <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of ER&#x003b1;, generally clustering between amino acids 534&#x02013;538, though mutations at other positions including S463 and E380 have also been described. Biochemical studies demonstrated that the Y537S mutation is constitutively active and results in full transcriptional activity in the absence or presence of oestrogen<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, and subsequent reports demonstrated that other ER&#x003b1; LBD mutations similarly confer constitutive, ligand-independent activation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Functional <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, along with the observation that mutations were found in metastatic tissue collected from patients who had undergone therapy with AIs, suggest a model wherein these mutations have an important role in acquired resistance to oestrogen deprivation mediated by AIs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>An important unresolved question is whether ER&#x003b1; LBD mutations retain sensitivity to other endocrine agents, particularly SERDs such as fulvestrant that cause ER&#x003b1; degradation. <italic>In vitro</italic> findings have suggested that mutant ER&#x003b1; can still bind and be inhibited by fulvestrant, but that higher doses are required to inhibit mutant ER&#x003b1; compared with wild-type (WT) ER&#x003b1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Little is known as to how these mutations affect clinical outcomes in patients receiving endocrine therapies, and whether SERD treatment can achieve high enough clinical exposures to effectively degrade mutant ER&#x003b1;. The FERGI study (GDC4950g, NCT01437566) is a randomized phase 2 study that compared the pan-PI3K inhibitor pictilisib plus fulvestrant with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with ER&#x0002b; MBC who had received prior AI therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. As such, the FERGI study represents an excellent setting to analyse the prevalence of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in MBC patients that failed prior AI, as well as to explore the impact of these mutations on the therapeutic benefit of fulvestrant in these patients. In this study, baseline and on-treatment <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status was assessed in plasma samples from patients enrolled in the FERGI study. Several recent studies have shown the feasibility of detecting <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and that the mutation status in plasma DNA can more accurately reflect the extent of disease heterogeneity than the analysis of tissue from a single metastatic site<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. In addition, ctDNA analyses offer the possibility of non-invasive monitoring of tumour mutation status over time and treatment, an approach that has been used successfully in the identification of circulating <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in colorectal patients receiving anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, but which has not been well explored in the context of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations and endocrine therapies. The major findings reported herein are that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are present in &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of patients that have progressed on AI therapy and are numerically enriched in luminal A and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-mutated tumours. Of the patients with a detectable <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation, 40&#x00025; harbour multiple <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, suggesting the convergent evolution of multiple AI-resistant clones. Serial monitoring of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in plasma from 71 patients suggests that RECIST responses are associated with decreases in allele frequency (AF) for both <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic>, but decreases in on-treatment AF did not reliably predict response since patients with stable or progressive disease (SD/PD) in some cases show decreases. In contrast, increases in on-treatment AF are only seen in patients with best response of SD or PD. Most importantly, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are not associated with differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in either the fulvestrant control arm or the experimental arm, suggesting that they may not be strongly associated with clinical resistance to SERD treatment.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title><italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA baseline plasma samples</title><p>We used a sensitive and quantitative digital PCR assay to screen for 9 hotspot mutations in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and 12 mutations in <italic>ESR1</italic> in ctDNA (see Methods). <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> shows <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations as they relate to baseline clinical and demographic features, while <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> shows the prevalence of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> in breast cancer subsets. <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations were detected in ctDNA from 39.7&#x00025; (62/156) of patients from the unselected phase of the study (part 1), which enrolled patients irrespective of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> tissue status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). The majority of patients (90.3&#x00025;, 56/62) had only a single detectable <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation in ctDNA (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were detected in ctDNA from 37.3&#x00025; (57/153) of patients at baseline and exhibited markedly more heterogeneity than <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations. Among patients with any detectable <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation, 22.8&#x00025; (13/57) had two mutations and 17.5&#x00025; (10/57) had greater than two mutations. Mutations resulting in the amino-acid substitutions D538G, Y537S and E380Q were the most common alterations, found in 54&#x00025;, 33&#x00025; and 26&#x00025; of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In addition, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations had a higher median AF than <italic>ESR1</italic> (3.6&#x00025; versus 0.45&#x00025;) and samples with mutations in both genes generally showed a higher AF for <italic>PIK3CA</italic> compared with <italic>ESR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Of the 11 <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations we detected in ctDNA, transiently expressed ER&#x003b1; proteins encoded by the most commonly detected mutations generally showed the strongest ligand-independent transcriptional activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, with the exception of E380Q that did not show significantly increased ligand-independent activity relative to WT ER&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). Overall <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA were 86&#x00025; concordant with tissue <italic>PIK3CA</italic> status determined by quantitative PCR assay (77&#x00025; sensitivity and 93&#x00025; specificity; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). We also compared <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation status between tissue and plasma for a subset of patients and examined the relationship between the type of tissue (primary tumour or metastatic lesion) and collection time relative to AI therapy in the metastatic setting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). We did not find any <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in primary tumour tissue collected at diagnosis, consistent with previous reports. Moreover, we rarely found <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in tissue that was collected before AI therapy (3/81 patients), but did detect <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in tissue that was collected after progression on prior AI therapy in a much higher proportion of patients (12/21 patients). The most abundant <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation detected in plasma (that is, highest AF) was almost always the mutation detected in tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 3</xref>). The overall concordance of <italic>ESR1</italic> tissue and ctDNA status was 31&#x00025; when primary and metastatic samples are pooled together. The concordance between <italic>ESR1</italic> status in ctDNA and metastatic tissue was 47&#x00025;, while concordance between ctDNA and primary tissue was 5&#x00025;. Concordance was 57&#x00025; and 23&#x00025; for patients whose tumour tissue was collected after or before the administration of an aromatase inhibitor, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Association of mutations with clinical features</title><p>We examined the relationship between plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation status and a range of baseline clinical and demographic features. Overall, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations occurred more frequently in patients who also harboured <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations, as 44.4&#x00025; of patients with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations detected in tissue also had a plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation compared with 30.3&#x00025; of patients without a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were also found in 44.4&#x00025; of patients enrolled in part 2 of the FERGI study, which selected patients based on <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation tissue status (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The presence of an <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation in the plasma also showed a trend towards enrichment in patients with luminal A status determined by PAM50 algorithm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, as 41.4&#x00025; of patients with PAM50 defined luminal A tumours had <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations compared with 31.8&#x00025; of patients with luminal B tumours (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). A smaller numerical increase was seen in patients with PgR&#x0002b; (38.5&#x00025;) compared with PgR&#x02212; (33.3&#x00025;) tumours. Increases in plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation prevalence were also associated with several clinicopathologic parameters. Sixty-one per cent of patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations had visceral disease, whereas only 46.9&#x00025; of <italic>ESR1</italic> WT patients had visceral disease (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, 71.9&#x00025; of patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations had secondary resistance to prior AI therapy compared with 56.3&#x00025; of <italic>ESR1</italic> WT patients, and 75.4&#x00025; of patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations had two or more metastatic sites compared with 56.3&#x00025; of <italic>ESR1</italic> WT patients. Other demographic and clinical parameters were generally balanced between patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations and <italic>ESR1</italic> WT patients, including age, race, region, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, baseline tumour burden and others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 5</xref>). In similar analyses, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA generally were not associated with particular demographic and clinical features (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 6</xref>), with the exception of luminal status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Similar to <italic>ESR1</italic>, a slightly higher proportion of patients with luminal A tumours had <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA compared with patients with luminal B tumours (44&#x00025;, 44/100 versus 38&#x00025;, 17/45).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Association of baseline mutations with clinical outcome</title><p>The FERGI study was a randomized phase 2 study comparing the pan-PI3K inhibitor pictilisib plus fulvestrant with placebo plus fulvestrant in patients with ER&#x0002b; locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, and so is an excellent setting to examine the association of <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA with clinical outcome to these agents. <italic>PIK3CA</italic> status determined by quantitative PCR assay on archival tumour tissue was not associated with enhanced clinical benefit from the addition of pictilisib to fulvestrant in the FERGI study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. Here we retrospectively analysed whether <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations detected in ctDNA were associated with differential benefit in either the control or the experimental arm of FERGI. Patients with a detectable plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation did not show differential PFS in either the fulvestrant or fulvestrant plus pictilisib arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4A</xref>). We also examined whether patients with more than one <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>) or a higher than median AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>) showed differential outcome in the fulvestrant control arm, based on previous reports suggesting higher AFs of <italic>BRAF</italic> V600E mutations are associated with higher disease burden and shorter PFS to <italic>BRAF</italic>-targeted therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. Neither the presence of multiple <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations nor higher <italic>ESR1</italic> AFs were associated with a clear difference in risk of progression on fulvestrant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>). Patients with a <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation in ctDNA had a PFS hazard ratio of 0.994 compared with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> WT patients in the fulvestrant control arm, and showed a PFS hazard ratio of 0.991 comparing <italic>PIK3CA</italic> WT patients in the fulvestrant plus pictilisib arm, with overlapping 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 4B</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mutant AF changes and tumour response</title><p>Longitudinal plasma samples from 71 patients were used to look at changes in AF over the course of treatment. Of these, 60 patients had at least one <italic>ESR1</italic> or <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation detected in at least one time point (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>). Patients were binned based on their best clinical response irrespective of treatment, with complete or partial responses (CR/PR) defined by RECIST criteria, and stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) as assessed by the investigator. Patients whose best response was CR or PR demonstrated robust decreases in <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> AF post treatment and did not show any evidence of increases in AF for either <italic>ESR1</italic> or <italic>PIK3CA</italic> at the time points monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, patients whose best response was SD or PD displayed more variable changes in AFs, with some mutations decreasing at cycle 2 but many others remaining unchanged or increasing at this time point. We also looked at whether <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation AF showed reproducible changes in the fulvestrant control arm, which might be predicted if these alterations resulted in structural changes in the protein that impaired the ability of fulvestrant to bind to ER and promote degradation of mutant ER protein. In fact, we found that a substantial majority of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in ctDNA showed decreases in AF at the initial time point and most of these decreases persisted at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>).

Specifically, of the 14 patients randomized to the fulvestrant control arm and on study for at least 140 days with no detectable <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations at baseline, 10 continued to be free of detectable plasma <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations.

Another two patients (1655 and 3501) had progressive disease and crossed over to the pictilisib plus fulvestrant arm and had detectable <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations at cycle 2 of this regimen, one with E380Q (0.13&#x00025;) and the second with Y537C (0.08&#x00025;).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Intrapatient monitoring suggests clonal heterogeneity</title><p>Intrapatient patterns of AF changes over time were examined in all 60 patients with longitudinal data who had at least one detectable mutation.

Initial prevalence estimates varied widely, ranging from 12&#x00025; (9/76) in an overall population of metastatic ER&#x0002b; breast cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> to 55&#x00025; (6/11) in a small cohort of patients selected based on having had multiple rounds of hormonal therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. These tissue-based findings have been extended to ctDNA in several small studies of limited numbers of patients, and recently in a cohort of 171 patients receiving AI therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Guttery <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> analysed ctDNA from 48 ER&#x0002b; breast cancer patients receiving a variety of therapies and showed that they could detect <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in 11 patients, while Sefrioui <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> analysed ctDNA and matched tissue from 7 ER&#x0002b; patients and detected mutations in ctDNA in 4 of 6 patients with tumour mutations. Recently, Wang <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> showed that they could detect <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in 25&#x00025; of advanced breast cancer patients (9/29), and that changes in AF could be monitored longitudinally. Schiavon <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> recently showed convincingly that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in ctDNA are rarely acquired during adjuvant AI treatment but are commonly selected by AI therapy for metastatic disease. To our knowledge, this report is the first to examine <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in a large, clinically well-defined cohort of patients who all received prior AI therapy, followed by the SERD fulvestrant in the context of a randomized trial.</p><p>These findings regarding the prevalence and overlap of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> help define an emerging model of polyclonal breast tumour evolution under the selective pressure of endocrine therapy. Genome-wide &#x02018;phylogenetic' analysis of breast cancer through next-generation sequencing has suggested that most <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations occur early in the process of tumour development and generally are associated with a tumour's dominant subclonal lineage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In contrast, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations have been proposed to arise late and in a subclonal manner, since these mutations are generally not detected in primary tumour samples but only in metastatic lesions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We found that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations in ctDNA occurred on average at 10-fold higher allelic frequencies than <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations and generally each patient had a single mutation in <italic>PIK3CA</italic>. In contrast, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were often polyclonal, as 40&#x00025; of patients had more than one <italic>ESR1</italic> mutation and in rare cases patients had four or five detectable low-frequency <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations. Most patients in the study submitted only primary archival tissue for analysis, but a subset had metastatic biopsies available. Analysis of matched metastatic tumour tissue and ctDNA showed that while generally a single mutation could be detected in metastatic biopsies, matched ctDNA often showed additional mutations beyond the one identified in the tumour sample. These results suggest that mutational analysis of ctDNA may offer a superior platform to survey intrapatient mutational heterogeneity, likely by virtue of integrating data from diverse metastatic lesions, whereas analysis of one site may not provide an accurate picture of the overall genomic landscape.</p><p>Our data also provide a comprehensive survey of the prevalence of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in advanced ER&#x0002b; metastatic breast cancer patients who have received prior AI therapy, as prior AI treatment was an enrollment criterion for the FERGI study. Overall, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were detected in ctDNA from 37.3&#x00025; of patients enrolled in part 1 of the clinical study. We found that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations showed a trend towards higher prevalence in patients with tumours classified as luminal A by PAM50 compared with luminal B (41.4 versus 31.8&#x00025;), as well as in patients with tumours harbouring <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations (44.4&#x00025;). <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations were also found in 44.4&#x00025; of patients enrolled in the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> selected part of the FERGI study. These findings are consistent with a model wherein more oestrogen-dependent, luminal A tumours are particularly susceptible to selective pressure to maintain ER signalling in the presence of oestrogen depletion, and that acquisition of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations is a highly prevalent mechanism of resistance. Intriguingly, exploratory <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analysis in the FERGI study suggested improvement in PFS in patients with ER&#x0002b; and PgR&#x0002b; tumours treated with pictilisib plus fulvestrant (median of 7.2 months in the combination arm versus 3.7 months in the control arm)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. The finding that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are numerically enriched in luminal A, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-mutated and PgR&#x0002b; tumours, together with the FERGI clinical results, may indicate that highly endocrine sensitive tumours are particularly sensitive to combined targeting of ER and PI3K signalling, a hypothesis that should be explored in future clinical studies.</p><p>The careful annotation of tumour collection date relative to AI therapy also allowed us to ask whether mutations were specifically associated with prior AI therapy. Indeed, we found that mutations were very infrequently detected in metastatic samples collected before AI therapy, but were common in patients where tissue was collected after the initiation of AI therapy, supporting the notion that these particular <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations arise in the setting of AI exposure as a means of conferring ligand-independent oestrogen receptor signalling to tumour cells. These findings are consistent with recent work from Schiavon and colleagues, which suggested that <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations are found exclusively in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients previously exposed to AI, and that patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations had a substantially shorter PFS on subsequent AI-based therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Overall, the data suggest a model of convergent evolution, wherein multiple metastatic subclones acquire independent activating mutations in <italic>ESR1</italic> as a means of maintaining oestrogen signalling in the presence of anti-endocrine therapies. These data also have implications in terms of understanding the functional significance of the various hotspot mutations in <italic>ESR1</italic>. While the distribution of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations at the hotspot residues Y537 and D538 was consistent with previous reports, we found a slightly higher than expected distribution (26&#x00025; of patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations detected in plasma) of the N-terminal LBD mutation E380Q. While previous studies report increased sensitivity of this mutant to low concentrations of oestrogen and varying degrees of oestrogen-independent activity of this mutant <italic>in vitro</italic> in ER-negative models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>, its functional significance <italic>in vivo</italic> remains unknown. We do not find significant ligand-independent activity of this mutant in ER-negative cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with studies from an <italic>ESR1</italic> E380Q patient-derived xenograft model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>; however, our finding that the E380Q mutation occurred in two breast cancer patients' tissues and in one case at a high AF (18.1&#x00025;), and further, one of these samples were collected before the administration of AI therapy suggest a functional role of this mutation in ER&#x0002b; breast cancer independent of AI resistance. Some clues to its mechanistic role come from a recent study showing that in contrast to the Y537S and D538G mutants, the <italic>ESR1</italic> E380Q mutant cannot bind the ER&#x003b1; co-regulatory protein prohibitin-2 (PHB2), which directly represses the transcriptional activity of activated ER&#x003b1;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. These data suggest a possible mechanism whereby the E380Q mutant could enable increased ER signalling or prolonged ER signalling in the presence of oestrogen by virtue of its inability to bind the co-repressor PHB2, and our findings are consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>Recent studies have highlighted the ability of mutational analysis of ctDNA to serve as a potential surrogate for antitumour activity and for therapeutic monitoring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. Dawson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> used a next generation sequencing (NGS)-based approach to derive personalized panels of assays that could be used to monitor response over time and treatment, and found that circulating tumour DNA levels showed a greater dynamic range, and greater correlation with changes in tumour burden, than did CA 15-3 or circulating tumour cells, in advanced breast cancer patients. Similarly, Frenel <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> used serial next-generation sequencing of circulating ctDNA to monitor mutational response to a collection of targeted agents in patients from phase I studies, and found that the monitoring of mutation AF in consecutive plasma samples during treatment demonstrated potential treatment-associated clonal responses. Our results are broadly consistent with these studies but highlight some of the challenges associated with using ctDNA mutation status as a surrogate marker of antitumour activity. We found that patients that had radiographically confirmed RECIST responses (CR or PR) uniformly showed substantial decreases in both plasma <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> AF, and that these changes were apparent at the earliest time point we assessed. However, we also observed plasma <italic>PIK3CA</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> AF decreases of similar magnitude in a substantial fraction of patients whose best response was stable disease or progressive disease. This finding suggests a speculative model in which certain lesions in these patients were potentially responding to these therapies based on the decreased AFs, and possibly that progression was due to growth of other lesions that did not harbour the specific mutations being tracked. Analysis with multiplexed panels, perhaps based on NGS platforms, may be necessary to interrogate and monitor overall tumour status and response to therapy. In contrast, increases in plasma <italic>PIK3CA</italic> or <italic>ESR1</italic> AFs were only seen in patients with stable disease or progressive disease, suggesting some potential utility in using the increase of mutation AFs to predict reduced clinical benefit if such findings can be confirmed in future prospective studies.</p><p>Our findings also have important implications for the treatment of patients with acquired <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations. Previous studies have not addressed the impact of treatment with the SERD fulvestrant on PFS in patients with baseline <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations. Our study does not provide any evidence that patients with plasma mutations in <italic>ESR1</italic> have differential PFS with fulvestrant treatment, compared with patients without <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, suggesting <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in aggregate may not be associated with innate or acquired resistance to fulvestrant. Previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies showing reduced sensitivity of the constitutively active mutants Y537S and D538G to fulvestrant suggested potential clinical resistance of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutant patients to clinically achievable fulvestrant exposures<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. These studies consistently showed that high suprapharmacologic concentrations of fulvestrant were required to inhibit transcriptional activity of ER&#x003b1; mutants. Of note, these experiments were primarily conducted in ER-negative cell line models, and it is possible that ER&#x003b1; mutants may behave differently on dimerization with WT ER&#x003b1; and in transcriptional complex with co-regulator proteins expressed in ER&#x0002b; breast cancers. Indeed, when these same mutations were expressed in two ER&#x0002b; cell lines, fulvestrant could downregulate WT and mutant ER&#x003b1; protein levels, and could partially suppress growth of the mutant-expressing cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. Thus, the concentrations of fulvestrant needed to inhibit mutant ER&#x003b1; activity may differ in the ER&#x0002b; versus ER&#x02212; cell line setting, and effective clinical exposures of fulvestrant to address mutant ER&#x003b1; may have been achieved in the FERGI study of ER&#x0002b; breast cancer patients, although the data presented were an exploratory <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis. Whether additional <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations beyond the 12 evaluated in our study could alter the structure of ER&#x003b1; and impair its degradation by fulvestrant, impacting therapeutic benefit from fulvestrant, remains to be determined. We also examined whether patients with more than one mutation, or a higher AF, potentially indicative of higher disease burden, showed longer PFS and again did not find any relationship between these parameters and clinical outcome. Moreover, serial analysis of mutations over time did not reveal the consistent appearance of <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations at later time points, and in fact, <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations in general showed a pattern of decreased AFs in most patients. This is in contrast to resistance mechanisms in other disease settings, such as <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations in patients treated with anti-EGFR antibodies, where a clear pattern of increases in <italic>KRAS</italic> in ctDNA occur post treatment and which are associated with disease progression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Caution is required interpreting these findings since they are retrospective in nature and derived from exploratory subsets of a phase 2 trial, but our findings suggest that SERDs may have activity in patients with <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations who are refractory to AI therapy and that prospective testing of this hypothesis is warranted. Next-generation orally available SERDs designed to more completely downregulate and degrade ER&#x003b1; are currently in clinical development, and our findings can inform the design of future clinical trials involving fulvestrant as well as these next-generation SERDs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. It will be of great interest to determine if these inhibitors are efficacious in patients harbouring multiclonal <italic>ESR1</italic> mutations, ideally through prospective stratification with a validated diagnostic assay optimized for ctDNA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Patient population</title><p>Study GDC4950g was an international, multicentre, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of pictilisib plus fulvestrant versus placebo plus fulvestrant in AI-resistant locally advanced or MBC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.
