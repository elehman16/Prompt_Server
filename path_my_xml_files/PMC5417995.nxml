However, current treatment paradigms lack objective, high level evidence of long-term efficacy. This multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial aimed to evaluate the effect of autologous fat grafting in patients with cutaneous scars.</p><p><bold>METHODS:</bold> 17 patients with cutaneous scars affecting quality of life were enrolled and underwent Coleman-type fat grafting. Grafting was completed with either autologous fat or saline at 1mL/cm<sup>2</sup>, and outcomes measured at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Grafted scars were evaluated using the following criteria(instrument): subjective scar quality assessment (POSAS), hardness (durometer), elasticity (cutometer), color/pigment (colorimeter) and histological analysis. Statistics were completed using SPSS.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> Patients were 42% female, with an mean age of 42.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.9 years. POSAS score totals, cutometer and durometer analyses were not significantly different between grafted (fat) and control (saline) scar apperance, elasticity or hardness at 0, 6, or 12 months, respectively. A single significant colorimetric difference in the a* coordinate at 6 months (p = 0.037) was demonstrated, but was not durable at 12 months (p = 0.49). Individual POSAS parameter statistics and histology results are pending.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSION:</bold> Recently, fat grafting has been increasingly touted for its ability to improve skin/scar quality and appearance. However, our study results demonstrate that this may not be supported by objective or subjective evidence obtained under randomized, placebo-treated conditions. Any putative improvements in scar quality from fat grafting are also achieved using saline controls.</p></body></article>
