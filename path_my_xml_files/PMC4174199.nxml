Thus, the aim of this novel experimental study was to evaluate the capacity of a TRRBF perfusion pattern to enhance AVF viability. The chosen experimental model was the rabbit ear because it contains a well-defined vascular pedicle and a valved venous system.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a pilot study designed to evaluate whether this form of revascularization may maintain viable tissues. For this reason, 15 healthy female and male New Zealand rabbits, weighing 3&#x02013;3.50&#x02009;kg, were used. Twenty-seven ears of these rabbits were used in the experimental surgical model. Anesthesia was induced with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (80&#x02009;mg/kg) and epontol (20&#x02009;mg/kg) with supplemental doses administered as necessary. Preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis was administered with a single intraperitoneal injection of amoxicillin (100&#x02009;mg/kg). The ears were assigned to 3 groups: group 1, total surgical devascularization (<italic>n</italic> = 3); group 2, TRRBF using the right ears (<italic>n</italic> = 12); and group 3, AVF using the left ears (<italic>n</italic> = 12). The surgery was performed under sterile conditions. Surgical dissection was performed under operating microscope magnification (6&#x000d7;). End-to-end anastomoses using interrupted sutures with 10-0 and 11-0 nylon were performed under microscope magnification (16&#x000d7;). Immediate postoperative lidocaine infiltration was administered in the base of the ears for anesthesia. The same experienced microsurgical surgeon (M.I.) performed all of the surgical procedures.

Revascularization of the ear was performed as follows: the proximal recipient artery was anastomosed to the central vein of the ear and the proximal recipient vein was anastomosed to the artery of the ear. The patency of both vascular anastomoses was confirmed visually for 20 minutes. Finally, the wound was closed with simple 3-0 silk sutures.

The animals were housed in individual boxes with temperature control (20&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C). Ad libitum access to water and food was provided. Postoperative treatment included intraperitoneal administration of amoxicillin (100&#x02009;mg/kg) every 24 hours for 3 days and 5 drops of metamizole in the rabbit&#x02019;s drinking water every 12 hours for analgesia.</p><p>Oxygen saturation (PaO<sub>2</sub>) was determined in all ears with a transcutaneous oximeter placed at the most distal region of the ear. Measurements were taken immediately after anesthesia (day 0) and just before euthanasia (day 30). Both measurements were recorded without supplementary oxygen administration. The purpose of these evaluations was to assess for differences in PaO<sub>2</sub> between the different forms of revascularization.</p><p>Viability of the ears was evaluated clinically every 24 hours until the end of the study. Tissue viability was determined by the color of the ear. A color scale was established and printed (pink = normal, blue and violet = mild cyanosis, purple = intense cyanosis, and black = necrosis). Observers at each assessment used this printed scale. There were only 2 observers. These changes were registered as: normal = 0, mild cyanosis = 1, severe cyanosis = 2, and necrosis = 3. The duration (in days) of the coloration changes was recorded. The necrotic area was expressed as a percentage of the total ear surface. A graduated pattern was used to assess the necrotic area in the ear. The necrotic tissue was defined when the tissue perfusion was not detected, with loss of firmness and warmth, and when the color skin changed to black. Failure was defined as necrosis of more than 50% of the ear surface. Success with partial necrosis was defined as necrosis of less than 50% of the total ear surface.</p><p>Edema of the ears was also recorded. The edema was evaluated using a clinical scale: grade 0 = without edema, grade 1 = bulking edema without the loss of the shape and creases, and grade 2 = bulking and deforming edema with loss of creases. Duration of edema was recorded. The clinical changes of the ears were documented by clinical photography.</p><p>At the end of the follow-up, all rabbits were euthanized with an intraperitoneal lethal overdose of sodium pentobarbital. Biopsies of the arterialized vein of the main pedicle were taken. To evaluate tissue biopsy away from the main vessels, full thickness biopsies, including skin, subcutaneous cellular tissue, cartilage, and vascular network, were taken from the middle of the ear in the area located between the central pedicle and the lateral edge of the ear. Ears that showed necrosis were not sent to pathology.</p><p>Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined. Endothelial hyperplasia was evaluated and classified: grade 1 = vascular occlusion less than or equal to 25%, grade 2 = vascular occlusion between 25% and 50%, grade 3 = vascular occlusion between 50% and 75%, and grade 4 = vascular occlusion greater than 75%.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The results were expressed as percentages, means, and standard deviations.

The experimental model in rabbit ears is ideal, as shown in previous studies.<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Revascularization was performed in previously devascularized ears, mimicking an AVF with a retrograde perfusion pattern and thereby forcing blood flow through the entire venous system of the ear. In this manner, the efferent blood flow exits the flap through the only available efferent vessel, which is the artery of the flap that had been anastomosed to the recipient vein.</p><p>Total devascularization of the ear without revascularization procedures caused a 100% necrosis rate (group 1). The 3 ears in the study all showed very similar clinical evolution and complete necrosis at 2.66&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.57 days, suggesting that this would be typical even with a larger sample size. These data suggest that arterial afferent blood flow is required for flap survival. The surgical revascularization performed in AVF ears (group 3) exhibited a significantly lower rate of necrosis than total devascularization without revascularization (group 1) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0001).</p><p>To our knowledge, AVF with TRRBF has not been previously reported. The position of the venous valves impedes the advancement of retrograde blood flow in the venous system, and thus hinders the perfusion and viability in the distal tissue. We developed our model in this way to evaluate its feasibility. Although a higher necrosis rate was observed in group 2 ears than in group 1 and 3 ears, this rate was within the ranges previously reported with traditional AVFs (0&#x02013;42.3%).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Our 100% success rate with AVFs with a retrograde perfusion pattern is identical to the success rates reported by Koch et al<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Woo and Seul.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>The clinical course of TRRBF ears (group 2) was characterized by edema and cyanosis occurring over a 10-day period, compared with the 4.5-day period observed in the AVF ears (group 3). The edematous and cyanotic period observed in group 3 ears is within the 3- to 6-day period reported by other authors.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Higher intensity edema and cyanosis was observed in group 2 ears than in group 1 and 3 ears, which is attributable to the high resistance to flow within the artery. These signs were more evident in the vicinity of the arterialized efferent veins, causing partial necrosis proximal to the wound site in 3 ears of the group 2 and 1 ear in group 3. After 2 weeks, necrotic areas healed by secondary intention. The percentage of partial necrosis was similar to the results previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> There was no significant difference in the clinical courses of group 2 and group 3.</p><p>The TRRBF ears (group 2) showed a significant reduction in PaO<sub>2</sub> at the end of the study when compared with AVFs with retrograde perfusion patterns (group 3). The results observed in group 2 are consistent with previous studies of AVFs examining fibrosis and atrophy as primary endpoints.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It was also suggested that the presence of a good recipient bed where revascularization will take place after 3 days might prevent the appearance of alterations like fibrosis and atrophy. In our experimental model, the survival of the ears depended exclusively on the revascularization. However, there was no recipient bed in our model.</p><p>Our experimental model did not fulfill the previously reported requirements for improving AVFs survival.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The arterialization of the flap was performed in the main vein of the ear instead of using a small diameter vein. Additionally, there was only 1 efferent vessel with high resistance to flow. However, the survival rate at the end of the follow-up was 75% for TRRBF. Flap survival increased to 100% when we had endowed ears with an efferent vein with low resistance to flow (<italic>P</italic> = 0.046). For both groups, the survival rates were similar to those previously reported.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>If a total vascular occlusion develops, collateral circulation would already be formed and may allow flap survival. Evaluation of this concept requires long-term follow-up. AVFs with TRRBF have high probabilities of surviving, even though their clinical evolution is torpid and prolonged. In this study, 9/12 ears with TRRBF survived. We demonstrated that if we had not vascularized these ears, they would have been lost. Despite the fact that our sample number is small, we conclude that TRRBF could be used as a rescue method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is only a pilot study to evaluate whether this form of revascularization may maintain viable tissues. Our model requires more experimental work. Nevertheless, we consider that reconstructive microsurgeons should be familiarized with TRRBF to have them succeed and should also be familiar with their prolonged clinical evolution.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Disclosure: The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.
