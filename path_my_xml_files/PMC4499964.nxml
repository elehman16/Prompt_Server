activation of the quadriceps during 3 weight-bearing tasks of the Wii Fit
Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. [Subjects] Thirty male healthy volunteers were recruited. [Methods]
Activation of the vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and rectus femoris muscles was
recorded during virtual lunge, single leg extension, and single leg reach exercises. Each
exercise was performed twice in 3 randomized experimental conditions (with visual
feedback, with auditory feedback, and with no feedback). The normalized electromyographic
data (using maximum voluntary isometric contraction) were analyzed using repeated measures
analysis of variance and Tukey&#x02019;s test. [Results] No significant difference was found in
the muscles among the feedback conditions during the 3 exercises. However, the variation
in the muscle activity of the vastus medialis and vastus lateralis (18.23&#x02013;29.20% of
maximum voluntary isometric contraction) was higher (47&#x02013;62%) than that in the rectus
femoris (7.35&#x02013;12.98% of maximum voluntary isometric contraction). [Conclusion] Real-time
feedback did not alter quadriceps activation during the Wii tasks. Additionally, these
games showed electromyographic activation levels similar to those for the same tasks
outside the virtual environment. The Wii weight-bearing tasks could therefore constitute a
physical activity program but without the additional benefit of feedback.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Electromyography</kwd><kwd>Functional exercises</kwd><kwd>Exergames</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional weight-bearing tasks (WBT) are commonly prescribed in rehabilitation for

following conditions: with visual feedback; with auditory feedback; and with no

recruited from the physical education faculty. Demographic data for the sample were as
follows (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation [SD]): age (20 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;years); body mass (74 &#x000b1; 9&#x02005;kg); height
(175 &#x000b1; 7&#x02005;cm); fat percentage (16 &#x000b1; 4%); lean mass percentage (83 &#x000b1; 4%); and body mass index
(24 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The following inclusion criteria were used: (a) no history of
injuries of the skeletal muscle system; (b) independent in ambulation; and (c) able to
perform all the experimental tasks. All participants read and signed an informed consent,
and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Camilo Castelo Branco University
(Protocol no. 223.695). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Figure 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Design of experimental procedures, MVIC: maximum voluntary isometric contraction</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1701-g001"/></fig> illustrates the design of the experimental protocol.</p><p>The virtual reality environment was simulated by the Nintendo Wii. Input devices that
allowed the user-Wii interaction process were the Wii Balance Board and Sensor Bar. The Wii
Balance Board has 4 pressure sensors that measure the users&#x02019; body weight distribution on the
lower limbs and their balance. The Wii Fit Plus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software was used, which
incorporates balance, aerobic, yoga, and strengthening activities. For this study, 3 WBT of
the strengthening category were chosen: lunge; SLE; and SLR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Initial and final positions of the following exercises: Lunge (A and B), Single leg
extension (C and D) and Single leg reach (E and F)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-1701-g002"/></fig>).</p><p>All WBT studied provide both auditory and visual real-time feedback. During the execution
of these tasks, the subjects were positioned above the Wii Balance Board located 1.0&#x02005;m from
the Sensor Bar, which was attached at the base of a 42-inch television. Each exercise was
performed twice in 3 randomized experimental conditions (with visual feedback, with auditory
feedback, and with no feedback), with an interval of 5&#x02005;min between the tasks.</p><p>The 4-lead EMG system, Miotool 400 (Miotec, Equipamentos Biom&#x000e9;dicos, Porto Alegre, RS,
Brazil) coupled to a personal computer was used to record muscle activity. Muscle activation
of the dominant limb&#x02019;s vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL), and rectus femoris (RF)
was recorded for each participant using bipolar surface disc electrodes (Ag-AgCl, Meditrace,
Mansfield, MA, USA) measuring 10&#x02005;mm in diameter, with an inter-electrode distance of 20&#x02005;mm.
The EMG signals were collected using a sampling rate of 2,000&#x02005;Hz and stored in a computer
with a 14 bit A/D card (Miotec, Equipamentos Biom&#x000e9;dicos, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil). The
average EMG value of a muscle is presented as a percentage of the maximum voluntary
isometric contractions (%MVIC).</p><p>GraphPad Prism (GraphPad<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to perform
the statistical analysis, with &#x003b1; = 0.05 set as the level of statistical significance.
Comparisons were made for the %MVIC activation of each muscle for the 3 exercises and 3
feedback conditions using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Post hoc analyses
were performed, when necessary, using Tukey&#x02019;s test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Normalized electromyographic activation during the lunge, single leg extension,

employed in the context of sports training and rehabilitation. Activity-promoting gaming
systems are considered an attractive exercise tool perhaps due to their relative
inexpensiveness, graphics that enable more enjoyable playing as well as potentially aid in
adherence to physical activity programs, and generation of real-time feedback to improve
task performance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, rehabilitation
using real-time feedback could alter the EMG activation pattern of the quadriceps muscles,
resulting in different joint movement patterns and promoting more efficient muscle
activation. This hypothesis, if confirmed, could favor the incorporation of Wii games into
clinical programs. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to verify the influence
of real-time feedback on EMG patterns of quadriceps muscles during WBT conducted using the
Wii console, as well as the level of activation among the muscles (VM, VL, and RF) in each
exercise. To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigated these associations.
Our primary findings revealed that there are no differences among the EMG patterns generated
in the visual feedback, auditory feedback, and no feedback conditions. However, considering
the potential of Wii-games for entertainment, fun, and motivation, it is advantageous to
include these exercises in clinical programs to strengthen the quadriceps muscle but without
the additional benefit of feedback. Also, we found that the muscle activity of the VM and VL
varied between 18.2&#x02013;29.2% MVIC and was higher (47&#x02013;62%) than the variation in the RF, which
was between 7.3&#x02013;13.0% MVIC.</p><p>Noehren, Scholz, and Davis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> studied a
group of runners with patellofemoral pain syndrome and determined that gait retraining using
real-time feedback (visual feedback during 4 sessions for 1 week) was effective in reducing
pain and improving hip mechanics during single-leg squats. White and Lifeso<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that after 8 weeks of gait
retraining using real-time feedback from an instrumented treadmill, the subjects were able
to significantly improve their loading symmetry. These results suggest that motor patterns
may be altered after at least 1 week of exposure to the feedback stimulus. Thus, we believed
that the short-term generation of both visual and auditory feedback was insufficient to
promote learning of new and more efficient motor patterns and, consequently, alter EMG
activity.</p><p>In the present study, the WBT were selected based on their wide application related to
practicality, functionality, and efficiency in promoting strengthening of lower limb
muscles. Dynamic squatting exercises have been studied as important tools for rehabilitation
programs, primarily those utilizing knee EMG<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to our results, the 2 vasti muscles produce approximately
50% more activity than the RF during WBT. The lower EMG activity of the RF during the WBT
studied compared with that of the VM and VL muscles may be due to the biarticular function
of the RF as both a hip flexor and knee extensor. Clinically, it is important to note that
increased activity in the RF would increase hip flexor torque, with a concomitant increase
in the activation of the antagonist muscles (<italic>e.g.</italic>, hamstrings and gluteus
maximus) to extend the hip, thereby altering the biomechanics of the tasks<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another aspect that deserves mention is
the similarity between the EMG activation patterns of the vasti muscles. Considering that
healthy adults with normal knees show VM/VL ratios of close to 1<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, the study subjects had adequate EMG behavior for these
muscles (healthy subjects). These findings could also justify the insufficiency of real-time
feedback to promote additional improvements in EMG activation patterns of the quadriceps. In
addition, selective strengthening of the VM is necessary to prevent and improve knee joint
dysfunction<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this case, the lunge,
SLE, and SLR exercises did not show any selectivity, at least in the experimental conditions
studied.</p><p>There is a need for a better understanding of the EMG activation pattern strategies that
occur in EXG and their implementation. In the only study found that was conducted for this
purpose, Park, Lee, and Lee<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that
EXG was an effective intervention for the muscle activities of the tibialis anterior and
gastrocnemius of normal adults. For future research, we suggest investigation involving
subjects with motor impairment, which could highlight a possible feedback effect, other Wii
exercises with a greater degree of difficulty, and a longer duration of feedback exposure
(<italic>e.g.</italic>, during a training protocol).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>F.F. Silva thanks Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of South of Minas
