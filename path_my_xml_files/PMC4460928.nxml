The effects of aerobic exercise on maternal health have been long understood, with the body of research indicating the safety and efficacy of maternal exercise training regarding fetal and neonatal health is growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The fetus is not at risk of hypoxia or significant bradycardia during maternal exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The neonate of exercising women is also not at risk of being born disproportionately or underweight, but is similar to women who have not exercised. Moreover, fetuses of exercising women have decreased body fat mass compared to fetuses of non-exercising mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has shown fetal adaptations in response to maternal aerobic exercise training, including heart rate modulation and improved autonomic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The fetal heart adapts similar to the adult heart when exposed to exercise training. For example, fetuses of exercising women had improved cardiovascular autonomic control indicated by decreased heart rates and increased HRV, relative to those of non-exercisers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further analysis demonstrated a dose&#x02013;response relationship, indicating that an increase in maternal exercise intensity and time spent participating in physical activity results in a greater fetal cardiovascular adaptation (i.e. decreased fetal HR and increased fetal HRV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent study reported that both continuous (aerobic) and intermittent (strength) exercise training throughout pregnancy are positively correlated to fetal cardiovascular adaptations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. May et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] observed that intermittent exercise (i.e. strength exercises) throughout pregnancy may increase fetal heart adaptability compared to continuous exercise training (i.e. aerobic exercise) throughout pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. While fetal HRV can be altered with exercise, the effects of maternal exercise on fetal cardiac compliance remain elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Cardiac compliance improves during normal maturation of the healthy neonatal heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Exercise training in childhood further contributes to these natural increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, since the cardiovascular and endocrine response differs with exercise type (i.e. aerobic, strength), the adaptation differs accordingly. For example, aerobic exercise in children is associated with lower heart rate, blood pressure, and lower lipid levels; conversely, resistance training in children has little or no change in heart rate, blood pressure, and lipid levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, both forms are known to decrease body fat composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is currently unknown if the fetal physiological adaptation to exercise type is similar to the response of exercise in children as a result of in utero exposure to maternal exercise.</p><p>These studies have focused primarily on maternal aerobic exercise training or self-reported physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], measuring fetal HR and HRV. A scarce amount of research exists regarding the effects of other training modes, such as resistance training or circuit training during pregnancy, on fetal health and development as well as any continued benefits for the neonate, especially with regards to cardiovascular development and function. Research to date has only determined that various modes of maternal exercise training do not present undue risk to fetal or neonatal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim is to determine the effects of different modes of exercise training (aerobic, circuit, and resistance) throughout pregnancy on health until the first year of life. The study presented will control individual exercise programs of varying modes throughout pregnancy to assess the effects of each on fetal and neonatal health adaptations.</p><p>We hypothesize that we will find: (1) lower measurements of maternal resting heart rate, weight gain, and body fat composition in women as follows: aerobic trained group&#x02009;=&#x02009;combination training group&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;strength training only group&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;&#x0003c; control group; (2) lower fetal HR, and increased infant HRV, stroke volume &#x00026; cardiac output at 34&#x000a0;weeks gestation, 1, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months postnatal when exposed to various modes of maternal exercise compared to fetuses of women in the control group with greatest differences in aerobic trained group&#x02009;=&#x02009;combination training group&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;strength training only group&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;control group; and (3) normalized weights with lower fetal and birth body fat measures (i.e. BMI, body fat percentage) of all exercising groups compared to controls.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to present the design and methodology of the Enhanced Neonatal Health and Neonatal Cardiovascular Efficiency Developmentally (ENHANCED) by Mom pregnancy study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study will be a cross sectional comparison using convenience sampling.

Upon arrival, a non-fasting venous sample will be collected, processed, and stored for later analysis of maternal factors (i.e. blood glucose). All participants will perform submaximal VO<sub>2</sub>peak treadmill testing using a modified Balke protocol as validated and replication by Mottola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] in order to determine individual THR zones. In order to enhance retention, we will utilize a restricted randomization process, in which the content of each protocol will be explained to participants and they provide us with two or three group preferences of which they are then randomized into one of those groups. Participants in the circuit training and resistance training groups will complete 1 repetition maximum testing on Cybex machines after completion of the treadmill exercise test to determine appropriate external loads for exercise training. This will also be used as a time for proper instruction on the technique of each exercise used. Upon completion of pre-exercise testing, participants will complete a modified physical activity questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] to determine pre-pregnancy activity levels and a nutrition questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] to ensure that participants are maintaining adequate diet and nutrition levels not only for increased energy needs of pregnancy, but also for the increased energy needs of exercise. These questionnaires will be completed a second time at the end of the intervention period to verify maternal activity and nutrition levels throughout the duration of the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exercise protocols</title><p>All groups, including controls, will begin each exercise session with a 5-min aerobic warm-up of low intensity (i.e. treadmill speed &#x02264;3.0 mph) followed by their respective protocols. HR will be monitored using a Polar FS2C heart rate monitor and maintained in the THR range determined by each participant&#x02019;s pre-exercise test, but not to exceed THR ranges validated for pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Moderate intensity will be maintained using the Borg scale of perceived exertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], with the goal of 12&#x02013;14 for moderate intensity, as well as the &#x0201c;talk test,&#x0201d; which means being able to converse while exercising without feeling short of breath.</p><p>The aerobic training group will perform aerobic exercise using treadmills, ellipticals, or recumbent bicycles for a 45-min workout. Treadmill speed will be maintained at &#x02264;3.0 mph, adjusting the percent grade to maintain the individual&#x02019;s pre-determined THR range. Elliptical and recumbent bike resistance and speed levels will be adjusted as necessary throughout the study&#x02019;s duration to maintain the individual&#x02019;s pre-determined THR zone.</p><p>The resistance training group will perform 45&#x000a0;min of various resistance exercises. Two to three sets of 15 repetitions will be completed at a moderate resistance per ACSM guidelines for resistance training in pregnant individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], using an RPE of 12&#x02013;14 to maintain moderate intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Resistance exercises will consist of seated Cybex machine exercises including leg extension, leg curl, shoulder press, chest press, triceps extension, and latissimus dorsi pull down. Dumbbells will be used for bicep curls, lateral shoulder raises, and front shoulder raises. Resistance bands and dumbbells will also be used as an alternative method for Cybex machine exercises if the participant is unable to maintain proper form or experiences discomfort in the machine&#x02019;s positioning of the body. Core exercises will be completed on an exercise ball or bench for stability or side-lying on a mat, avoid supine positioning at all times, and vary among participants based on individual levels of comfort at the present stage of pregnancy. All exercises used will be selected from safe core exercises during pregnancy based on previous research findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].

Resistance exercises will be 1 set of 15 repetitions, following that of the resistance training group, while aerobic training will be similar to the aerobic training group. An RPE of 12&#x02013;14 will be used to maintain moderate intensity during resistance training exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Throughout the study&#x02019;s duration, each participant will progress accordingly with changes in the resistance and speed of aerobic training exercises as well as increases in resistance of the resistance training exercises. The continual switch between resistance and aerobic training exercises will be used to maintain the participant&#x02019;s HR in the appropriate THR range throughout the exercise duration to induce a training effect similar to the aerobic training only group.</p><p>The control group will have personal coaching to perform daily activities only with a maximum participation of 45&#x000a0;min of stretching, breathing, and flexibility exercises.

Breathing exercises will combine stretches with inhalation and exhalation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Flexibility exercises will consist of transitions between stretches with controlled breathing techniques similar to low intensity yoga training.

All healthcare providers will be blinded to participants&#x02019; group allocation. Fetal weight is estimated in grams. Fetal morphometric measures of biparietal diameter, femur length, humerus length, head circumference, and abdominal circumference are measured in millimeters. Right and left ventricular diameters and widths are also measured in millimeters. Heart physiological measures are calculated for both the right and left ventricle based on anatomical measurements assessed in the ultrasound. Stroke volume, measured in milliliters is calculated by subtracting the end diameter in systole from the end diameter in diastole. Ejection fraction is calculated by dividing the stroke volume by the end diameter in systole and multiplying by 100 for a percentage.

Correlation coefficients will be used to identify potential covariates of these measures including maternal characteristics (maternal age, maternal resting HR, gestational weight gain, pre-pregnancy BMI, pre-pregnancy sedentary or active) to determine any initial difference for maternal, fetal, and neonatal measurements. lifestyle) and offspring characteristics (gender, gestational age). Analysis of covariance and repeated measures ANOVA will be used on all variables to compare among groups controlling for baseline values and potential confounders (for instance, weight status, activity status, age, etc.). Spearman correlation procedures will be used to assess relationships between maternal physical activity and fetal measures (i.e. length, circumference, HR, HRV) as well as neonatal measures. Multiple regressions will be performed for fetal and neonatal measures to determine correlations with maternal exercise measures. Repeated measures ANOVA or linear mixed models will be adopted to investigate the effect of exercise mode on infant outcomes at birth, 1, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months. All analyses will be completed using SPSS software (SPSS version 20, Chicago, 2009).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Because of the increased popularity of various modes of training among pregnant women, it is essential to identify the health benefits to the fetus and neonate, especially regarding cardiovascular function and development. This study protocol is designed to assess the effects of varying exercise modes throughout pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes. This study aims to address many unanswered questions by determining if various modes of exercise training throughout pregnancy provide different benefits to maternal, fetal, and neonatal health in normal weight, overweight, and obese women of varying pre-pregnancy activity levels. A better understanding on the effects of exercise training on fetal cardiovascular autonomic control and function and ensuing neonatal autonomic control, cardiovascular function, and body composition could have a profound impact on in utero fetal adaptations to stress and labor as well as the prevention and development of chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HR</term><def><p>Heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRV</term><def><p>Heart rate variability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>Rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>THR</term><def><p>Target heart rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ACSM</term><def><p>American college of sports medicine</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>All authors (Carmen Moyer, BA, MS, Jeffrey Livingston, MD, Xiangming Fang, PhD, Linda May, MS, PhD) fulfill all conditions for authorship.
