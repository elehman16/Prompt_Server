Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is a simple,low-cost and promisor intervention for arresting caries lesions, but it has never been tested on approximal surfaces. Our aim is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-efficacy of SDF in arresting initial lesions compared to resin infiltration and exclusively flossing (control group). Our second aim is to assess discomfort and satisfaction regarding interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a randomized clinical trial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. Children/adolescents presenting at least one approximal initial caries lesion in primary molars/permanent premolars and molars will be included. Surfaces with advanced dentine lesions identified by radiography and participants who refuse to participate or present negative behaviors will be excluded. A minimum sample size of 504 surfaces will be required for each subgroup. Individuals will be randomly allocated in three groups of interventions: SDF, resin infiltration, and control group. Depending on the allocation, the patients will receive the active treatment and respective placebo therapies. All patients will be oriented to daily flossing the included surfaces. Our primary outcome will be caries progression by clinical and radiographic examinations. Appointments will be timed and costs of materials will be considered to calculate cost-efficacy. Patient discomfort will be assessed after interventions. Parent and patient satisfaction with the treatment will be collected after treatment and in the last follow-up visit. Individuals will be assessed at 1 and 3&#x000a0;months after treatment to evaluate dental biofilm and at 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;months to assess caries progression by visual examination and/or radiography. Multilevel analyses will be used to verify if the type of treatment influenced on the tested outcomes. Costs will be compared and analyses of cost-efficacy will be performed. Poisson analysis will test the association between intervention and reported discomfort and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our hypothesis is that SDF is the most cost-efficacious option from all tested interventions. If our hypothesis is confirmed, the use of SDF in private and public contexts could represent an easier and effective option in the treatment of enamel approximal caries in children/adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01477385">NCT01477385</ext-link>), Initial release: 11/16/2011: last update: 06/02/2014.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1745-6215-15-448) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Approximal surfaces</kwd><kwd>Dental caries</kwd><kwd>Flossing</kwd><kwd>Randomized clinical trials</kwd><kwd>Resin infiltration</kwd><kwd>Silver diamine fluoride</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Approximal surfaces are a challenge regarding the control of caries lesions due to the area of contact between them and limited salivary access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, poor compliance to flossing by children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] contributes to difficulty in arresting approximal caries lesions.</p><p>Despite flossing being the most suitable method for mechanical removal of biofilm from the interproximal area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the controlling of approximal caries just by flossing has not been shown to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], probably because its use by children and adolescents is not constant and adequate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, early interventions to initial caries lesions become even more important to arrest these lesions and prevent cavitations or their progression into dentine.</p><p>Recently, the use of silver diamine fluoride (SDF), an effective cariostatic agent used in caries prevention since 1960 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], has been proposed to arrest enamel caries lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A previous study of our group showed the SDF efficacy in arresting enamel caries lesions on occlusal surfaces of erupting permanent molars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which are areas of difficult mechanical control of biofilm, much like the approximal surfaces. However, this cariostatic agent has not been tested in the arrest of approximal caries lesions.</p><p>Other options, such as sealants and resin infiltration, have been pointed as promisor to controlling approximal caries lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The resin infiltrant is a novel low-viscosity resin that promotes sealing into the lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Previous studies have shown caries infiltration to be an efficacious treatment for permanent and primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], superior to exclusively flossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and probably even approximal sealing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Contrary to SDF, resin infiltration requires the use of a rubber dam and clamps. Thus, we hypothesized the resin infiltration would result in higher costs and reduce patient acceptance for arresting initial caries than the use of SDF. Therefore, not only the efficacy but also the cost-efficacy and patient discomfort/satisfaction should be comparatively investigated for these approaches, in order to propose a cost-effective and acceptable technique for controlling caries lesions on approximal surfaces.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-efficacy of SDF in arresting initial caries lesions compared to the resin infiltration and exclusively by flossing. Furthermore, patient discomfort, as well as parent and patient satisfaction with different treatments for initial caries lesions will be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical considerations and registrations</title><p>The protocol was previously approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Dental School, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (protocol 140/11). Each child and adolescent must assent to participation in the study. Informed consents are obtained from their parents or guardians previous to their allocation in the study. This study protocol was also registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01477385 &#x02013; November 16<sup>th</sup>, 2011) and written following CONSORT guidelines for randomized trials of non-pharmacologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and the Standard Protocol Items &#x02013; Recommendations for Interventional Trials guidelines for clinical trial protocols.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomized clinical trial, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study conducted in three-arm parallel groups. The participants will be allocated to one of the three arms in order to compare different options for arresting initial caries lesions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

This approach follows since differences between SDF and infiltrant are expected to be lower and thus a bigger sample may be required to present statistical power. As no study has tested the SDF on approximal initial caries, we used differences between other tested treatments and/or similar treatments on other surfaces to estimate minimum expected difference among the groups tested in our protocol.</p><p>Considering flossing vs. other interventions, we considered a minimum difference of 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], an alpha error of 5%, and a study power of 80%. A minimum sample size of 36 surfaces per group were found. To compare SDF and infiltrant, we considered 20% as minimum expected difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Then, the minimum sample size found was 86 surfaces. Rates considered for estimating differences among treatments were obtained from previous studies in permanent teeth. As caries progression tends to be faster in primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we believe similar or even smaller samples could achieve statistical power to prove existent differences in these teeth.</p><p>Considering we will include similar sample sizes for all groups, we assumed the biggest sample as reference (n = 258 surfaces). To ensure the power of the study, we added 30% to this sample to compensate possible follow-up drop-outs, totalizing a minimum sample size of 336 surfaces (112 surfaces/per group). Since child and adolescent patient characteristics were significantly different, we opted to conduct two parallel studies, with similar designs, each one including one of these groups of patients.</p><p>To compensate the clustering effect, since more than one surface may be included in each child/adolescent, we added an additional 50% on the calculation. Thus, we reached a final simple size of 504 surfaces (on average, 168 surfaces per group) to be included in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participant selection</title><p>A total of 141 children (3 to 10&#x000a0;years old) and 141 adolescents (12 to 18&#x000a0;years old), who seek for dental treatment in our Dental School, will be evaluated according to inclusion/exclusion criteria as follows.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Presence of at least one active initial caries lesion (scores 1, 2, or 3 according to International Caries Detection and Assessment System &#x02013; ICDAS), detected by visual and tactile examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] on approximal surfaces of primary molars for children or permanent premolar/molar for adolescents.

However, few studies assessed its efficacy on initial caries lesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, no previous study verified its application on approximal surfaces. A systematic review showed that SDF seems to be more effective than fluoride varnish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. A possible explanation for this superior effect could be the fluoride concentration on SDF, which is higher than that found in the fluoride varnish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the effect of SDF on caries lesions could be explained not only by fluoride action, but also by the silver ions, which react with thiol groups in amino and nucleic acids leading to bacterial lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and thus to probable quicker caries arrestment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], especially if compared to other options of arresting initial caries lesions such as other fluorides.</p><p>There are some aesthetic concerns regarding the use of SDF since it could cause black staining on carious lesions due to the precipitation of silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, aesthetics did not seem to be jeopardized in the case of initial caries lesions on approximal surfaces of posterior teeth due to their localization. However, the staining could be a limitation of our study regarding examiners&#x02019; blinding, since it could suggest which surfaces were treated with SDF. Nevertheless, inactive lesions could also present dark coloring, minimizing this limitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, resin infiltration is a new procedure, with promising results, but it could be costly and be less accepted by patients. Previous studies have shown that flossing is less effective than infiltration, sealing, and other fluoride treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that has previously compared flossing, which would be the simplest technique to be used on approximal surfaces, with SDF. As children/adolescents who will be enrolled in this study live in an area of fluoridated water and regularly use fluoridated toothpaste, if we had not included the control group, we could not affirm which is the actual simplest and most cost-efficacious technique for approximal initial caries, which is why we decided to conduct this study in three-arm parallel groups rather than design a non-inferiority trial comparing just SDF with resin infiltration. However, depending on the results of this study a posterior effectiveness trial could be conducted. Besides, all children have been exposed to daily fluoride, have been motivated to floss every day, and are monitored regularly. Therefore, we believe that using flossing as a control group has not compromised the ethics of the trial.</p><p>To compare these three interventions, we considered important the use of placebo therapies to ensure that interventions are as similar as possible among individuals. If individuals are aware of which group they will be allocated to, they may judge more complex techniques, which demands a lot of clinical steps, as more effective and underestimate the correct daily flossing in these cases. Due to the vulnerable individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] included in our study, the perfect placebo therapies could be questionable. Thus, for ethical issues, the placebo of resin infiltration will be performed just simulating the rubber dam on teeth, without local infiltration anesthesia and clamp. Despite being an imperfect placebo, simple measures like this can be enough to blind patient regarding adopted treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, in such a type of imperfect placebo-controlled study, we expect that daily flossing is not influenced by the intervention received.</p><p>On the other hand, we must consider that sequential treatments may influence patients&#x02019; perception about the treatment. Because of its sensitivity to light, a light-curing or light curing simulation will have to be applied after the use of SDF. Thus, the sequence has been standardized and our option was to apply the faces scale at the end of all procedures, and not only after the active treatment, despite the latter being ideal. The use of the scale only after active treatment would compromise the blinding, which would be worse. In addition, using the procedures in sequence will make the sessions longer. Therefore, we believe we should discuss our results considering that a session for application of SDF on initial approximal caries lesions would certainly consume less time than will be presented in the results of this trial. A pilot study is ongoing to check the partial times for each approach separately and the influence of each individual treatment and their respective placebos on patient perception.</p><p>Finally, we should expect a degree of memory bias, especially a named choice-supportive bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] when we checking daily flossing. Actually, children and adolescents, as well their parents/guardians, may be conscious of the correct flossing behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], especially in a study like ours, since they are orientated to act in a specific way during a certain time. Therefore, they could report the daily use of dental floss, regardless of this being the case. This bias could underestimate the actual efficacy of this practice and should be considered when interpreting our findings.</p><p>At the end of this study we expect to contribute to point out the option(s) which would be definitely more efficacious/cost-effective than the mechanical removal of biofilm from approximal surface by flossing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>This is an ongoing trial, which is still recruiting the patients at this moment.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2014_2324_MOESM1_ESM.tif" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2014_2324_MOESM2_ESM.tif" id="MOESM2"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 2</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMFS</term><def><p>Decayed, missing, filled surfaces in permanent teeth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Dmfs</term><def><p>Decayed, missing, filled surfaces in primary teeth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICDAS</term><def><p>International Caries Detection and Assessment System</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDF</term><def><p>Silver diamine fluoride.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MMB, JMS, and FRF were responsible for drafting the protocol and conducting this trial.
