The registration number of randomized clinical trials is ChiCTR-TRC-13003850 (The URL is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/cn/">http://www.chictr.org/cn/</ext-link>. The name of the principal investigator is Jinchao Song). A total of 80 ASA I-III patients undergoing ERCP, aged 18-70 years and weighing 45-90 kg, were enrolled in this study. Written consent was obtained from all subjects. Patients with known adrenocortical insufficiency, chronic sedative or opioid analgesic use, known allergy to the study drugs, heart failure (ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%), and/or severe respiratory disease (vital capacity and/or forced expiratory volume &#x0003c;50%) preoperatively were excluded from this study. The patients were computer-randomized into either the etomidate group or the propofol group. The patients, gastroenterologists, anesthesiologist assistant and nurses in the recovery room were blinded to the grouping. The anesthesiologist assistant observed and recorded vital signs through a local area network in the next room.</p><p>All patients were premedicated with an intramuscular injection of 100mg pethidine twenty minutes before entering the endoscopy room. BIS (BIS&#x02122; XP sensor), noninvasive blood pressure, heart rate (HR), ECG and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored continuously throughout the study in the endoscopy room (Philips HP Viridia 24/26 M1205A). A 20-gauge intravenous cannula was placed in the peripheral vein for 0.9% normal saline infusion and drugs. The BIS sensor (BISTM XP) was applied according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Oxygen was administered at a rate of 5 L/min by nasal catheter during ERCP. All the patients underwent ERCP in the prone position without tracheal intubation. After recovery, 50-100mg of pethidine was given, if necessary.</p><p>Baseline values of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) were measured at 5 minutes after the patient entered the endoscopy room. Then, all patients received 2-2.5 mg midazolam (IV). After 5 minutes, induction was started. In the etomidate group, etomidate was delivered at a rate of 30 &#x003bc;g&#x02022;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02022;min<sup>-1</sup> by a Graseby 3500 syringe pump (SIMS Graseby Ltd., Herts, England) until the BIS was 50, then ERCP was started. Anesthesia was maintained with etomidate (8-12 &#x003bc;g&#x02022;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02022;min<sup>-1</sup>) during ERCP. In the propofol group, propofol was delivered at a rate of 0.3 mg&#x02022;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02022;min<sup>-1</sup> until the BIS was 50, and anesthesia was maintained with propofol (0.12-0.18 mg&#x02022;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02022;min<sup>-1</sup>). BIS was used to monitor the depth of anesthesia during the ERCP operation, and controlled at about 50 by fine-adjusting anesthetic agents. Emergency equipment was available throughout the ERCP procedure. Dopamine (2-5 &#x003bc;g &#x02022; kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x02022; min<sup>-1</sup>) or an appropriate dose of metaraminol was given once MBP fell below 60 mmHg, and 0.25mg atropine was given once HR fell below 50 bpm. Appropriate nitroglycerin was given once MBP rose above 120 mmHg, and appropriate esmolol was given once HR rose above 120 bpm. If spontaneous ventilation was insufficient (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 92%), the anesthesiologist performed assisted mask ventilation as necessary. If myoclonus was observed in the etomidate group, 50-100mg propofol was given and propofol took the place of etomidate in anesthesia maintenance. ERCP procedures were performed in a standardized manner under the supervision of two experienced gastroenterologists.</p><p>MBP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub> were measured and recorded at the designated time points: T<sub>0 </sub>= baseline values, 5 min after entering the endoscopy room; T<sub>1 </sub>= 5 min after the patients received midazolam; T<sub>2</sub>= when BIS was 50 (after induction of etomidate or propofol); T<sub>3</sub> = at scope intubation and T<sub>4-10 </sub>= by 5-min intervals during the ERCP. The induction time, duration of ERCP and recovery time were recorded.</p><p>The patient's satisfaction with the procedure (1 = unacceptable, 2 = extremely uncomfortable, 3 = slightly uncomfortable, 4 = no discomfort) was assessed 1 hour after ERCP. The gastroenterologist's satisfaction was assessed immediately after ERCP as: 1, poor; 2, fair; 3, good; 4, excellent.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Clinical signs of adrenocortical suppression such as hypotension and arrhythmia were monitored carefully after ERCP since etomidate may transiently cause adrenal suppression. After ruling out the general reason of hypotension and arrhythmia, we may consider adrenocortical suppression in etomidate group. Hydrocortisone (200-300 mg per day) was given if necessary.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the average percent change to baseline in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. Percent change = (MBP<sub>T1-10 </sub>- MBP<sub>T0</sub>)/ MBP<sub>T0</sub>* 100. The secondary endpoint was overall survival. Overall survival was defined as the interval between treatment and death of any cause.</p><p>The group sample size was calculated based on the result of a pilot study, in which we found that the average percent change to baseline in mean arterial pressure was -7.5&#x000b1;8.3 (n = 12) in the etomidate group and -13.5&#x000b1;10.3 (n = 12) in the propofol group. 38 samples for each group met the requirement of &#x003b1; = 0.05 and power = 0.8.<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>All data in the text and tables are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD, number (n) or percentage.

The results showed that etomidate anesthesia during ERCP caused more stable haemodynamic responses compared with propofol.</p><p>In our endoscopy center, as a rule, the patients underwent ERCP in the prone position without tracheal intubation. It is known that the prone position may lead to inhibition of breathing because of airway obstruction. To reduce the incidence of respiratory depression caused by opioid agents, patients received pethidine pretreatment (100mg i.m.) instead of intravenous opioids. The absorption of intramuscular injection of drugs may be irregular and a confounding factor to the hemodynamic stability. Patients in both groups received pethidine pretreatment, therefore, the analgesia level could be comparable between two groups. In the present study, no patient experienced desaturation or apnoea, and the incidence of respiratory depression was much lower than in the other reports.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> There are at least two factors that may help explain this. First, the low incidence of respiratory depression primarily due to the normal BMI in the studied Chinese patients. Secondly, patients with known severe respiratory disease (vital capacity and/or forced expiratory volume &#x0003c;50%) were excluded from this study. There were not enough data in obese patients and in patients with severe respiratory disease. Therefore, we must be careful of hypoxia during ERCP under the general anesthesia without tracheal intubation in these patients. New techniques, such as supraglottic jet oxygenation and ventilation, can be used to minimize hypoxia/hypercapnia during ERCP under infusion of etomidate or propofol in these patients.<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>It has been known that sedation and anesthesia are routinely required during ERCP <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, because ERCP is a complex endoscopic procedure requiring a high level of patient cooperation. Various types of sedative and analgesic techniques have been used during ERCP procedure. It is generally accepted among gastroenterologists that propofol is a good hypnotic with rapid onset, rapid recovery, and minimal side effects.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> It was reported that a target-controlled infusion system for administration of propofol provided safe and effective sedation during ERCP.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In a pilot study, it was shown that patient-maintained sedation with TCI propofol was safe and fully effective in 16 patients.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, it was reported in a guideline of sedation and anesthesia in GI endoscopy that transient hypotension occurs in 4% to 7% of cases using propofol sedation and transient hypoxia occurs in 3% to 7% of cases.<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Etomidate is a nonbarbiturate hypnotic that induces anesthesia through GABA receptors in the central nervous system.<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It has a rapid onset of action (&#x02264;1 minute) and a short duration of action (3-5 minutes). According to Miller's Anesthesia, &#x0201c;The properties of etomidate include haemodynamic stability, minimal respiratory depression, cerebral protection, and pharmacokinetics enabling rapid recovery after a single dose&#x0201d;.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Etomidate's haemodynamic stability may be due to its unique lack of effect on the sympathetic nervous system and on baroreceptor function.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Most patients who need ERCP suffer from obstructive jaundice. In the present study, the baseline of bilirubin was 118.2&#x000b1;117.8&#x003bc;mol/L in the etomidate group and 108.2&#x000b1;142.2 &#x003bc;mol/L in the propofol group. Patients with obstructive jaundice are more prone to develop hypotension and bradycardia during anesthesia induction and maintenance compared with non-jaundiced patients.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It was reported that patients with obstructive jaundice had decreased sensitivity in both the sympathetic and vagal components of the baroreflex.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Reich <italic>et al. </italic>suggested that &#x0201c;To avoid severe hypotension, alternatives to propofol anesthetic induction (e.g., etomidate) should be considered in patients older than 50 yr of age with ASA physical status &#x02265;III.&#x0201d;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Myoclonus was a common side effect of etomidate for procedural sedation, which occurred in 20% to 45% of the patients in the Falk review.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Miner <italic>et al.</italic> noted a 20% incidence of myoclonus in their randomized clinical trial comparing etomidate with propofol.<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In the present study, only one patient in the etomidate group experienced myoclonus, and required a brief period of mask ventilation and 50mg propofol (i.v.). The incidence of myoclonus in the present study was far lower than in other studies, which may be due to midazolam (2-2.5 mg i.v.) pretreatment in all patients before induction. Midazolam pretreatment reduces etomidate-induced myoclonic movements.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, in the present study, etomidate was delivered at a rate of 30 &#x003bc;g&#x02022;kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02022;min<sup>-1</sup> by a Graseby 3500 syringe pump. This relatively &#x0201c;slow&#x0201d; delivering speed may also reduce the incidence of myoclonus.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>It was reported mean aortic and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased 5 and 15 min after midazolam, 0.2 mg/kg iv. <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Marty <italic>et al.</italic> noted that midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) used for induction of anesthesia resulted in a transient depression of baroreflex function and a sustained decrease of sympathetic tone. <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, Lim <italic>et al.</italic> found that co-induction with midazolam and propofol could prevent a marked BP decrease at tracheal intubation for induction in aged patients. <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> In the present study, the blood pressure on T<sub>1</sub> decreased compared with T<sub>0</sub>, which may be partly attributable to small dose of midazolam (2-2.5 mg i.v.). However, because patients in both groups received the same dose of midazolam, the same effects would be expected in both groups.</p><p>Other side effects of etomidate are nausea and vomiting.<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Vinson's study reported that 4% (5 of 134 patients) of patients experienced nausea and vomiting,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but in the present study, only one patient in each group experienced these side effects.</p><p>Our study had two limitations. The first is that we did not measure plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone levels. It has been well known that adrenocortical suppression is one of the most important adverse effects of etomidate.<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> A recent paper compared much larger numbers of patients given etomidate and propofol (2616 patients were given etomidate, and 28,532 were given propofol), they found that etomidate was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and prolonged hospital stay. They thought that etomidate should be used judiciously, considering that improved haemodynamic stability may be accompanied by substantially worse longer-term outcomes.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, in a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, it was reported that single-dose etomidate does not increase mortality in patients with sepsis.<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> In the present study, no patient experienced adrenal crisis. There was no significant difference between groups for pancreatitis, cholangitis or sepsis after ERCP. Etomidate did not prolong hospital stay. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the survival distributions between groups. Etomidate did not worsen longer-term outcomes. Differences in patient characteristics might contribute partly to the different results between our study and Ryu Komatsu's study: ASA I-III patients were enrolled in this study, while ASA III-IV patients were evaluated in Komatsu's study. Our data indicate that etomidate can safely be used in ASA I-III patients during ERCP.</p><p>The second limitation is that we did not measure respiratory rate, as the prone position makes it difficult to accurately count respiratory rate both artificially and automatically. In the present study, the effect on respiratory function was judged only by SpO<sub>2</sub>, which may lead to missing subclinical respiratory depression.</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated that etomidate anesthesia during ERCP caused more stable haemodynamic responses compared with propofol. Etomidate is an alternative to propofol during ERCP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Bing Hu, MD, PhD and Fenghai Yu, MD, PhD (Endoscopy center, Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital) for some suggestions.
