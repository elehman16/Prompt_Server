shoulder pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although workers with these types of work-related musculoskeletal
disorders (WRMSDs) recover with time through rest, the rate of reoccurrence is as high as
60%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of neck pain include abnormal neck and head posture as
well as excessive neck movevment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. At the
atlanto-occipital joint, an anterior transition of the head, which is defined as a forward
head posture (FHP), develops a long moment arm for the cervical extensor (CE) muscles to
counteract the load of the head<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. This
long moment arm generates a low muscular requirement for CE, with greater activation of the
upper trapezius, so that weakness in the CE often occurs in patients with a FHP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Conversely, the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle is shortened in FHP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. An effective therapeutic exercise for FHP may include neck
retraction, for activating the CE and reducing the SCM. Such an exercise should include
extension of the lower and flexion of the upper cervical areas, the opposite of FHP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few materials are available for
assisting or guiding this type of exercise with respect to direction and resistance.
Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to develop an exercise device for assisting
neck retraction exercises and to investigate the device&#x02019;s effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Assistive Device for Neck Retraction (ANR)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-537-g001"/></fig><p>The study subjects were 15 males aged 22.7 &#x000b1; 2&#x02005;years (mean &#x000b1; SD), with an average height of
174.7 &#x000b1; 4.7&#x02005;cm and an average body weight of 69.1 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;kg, respectively. None of the
subjects had any musculoskeletal disorders or pain in the upper extremities. EMG data were
collected by an MP150 system (Biopack System, Santa Barbara, CA, USA). The sampling rate was
1,000&#x02005;Hz, and the mean of the root mean square value was calculated. Maximal voluntary
isometric contraction (MVIC) for each muscle was measured to normalize the EMG signal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. EMG activities of the lower cervical
erector spine (LCE) and the sternocleidomatoid (SCM) muscles were recorded. Two bipolar
electrodes were attached to the right dominant side of each subject. The present study
compared two conditions of neck retraction exercises with and without the assistant device.
A newly designed assistant device was used as a neck retraction (ANR) tool. The ANR includes
two different types of tubing bands attached to a wooden frame. The upper band provides high
resistance at the atlanto-occipital joint, while the lower band provides low resistance at
the 4th level of the cervical spine. The ANR is designed to provide direct resistance in the
cervical section. The ANR is also designed to provide proper guidance for the neck
retraction exercise, and the tubing band support prevents excessive neck extension or
flexion. The ANR is constructed of very lightweight wood and weighs a total of 0.7&#x02005;kg. The
subjects used the ANR by placing it on both shoulders and supporting it against a wall. They
performed neck retractions while holding the handles with both hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The subjects performed the neck retraction exercise, with
and without the ANR, for five seconds, retracting their chin until it was in a vertical line
with the chest. The paired t-test was conducted to test the differences between the
conditions using the SPSS statistical package (version 18.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Significance was accepted for values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The %MVC of the LCE differed significantly between the conditions. The ANR condition
(47.4&#x000b1;19.3%) significantly increased LCE activation compared to the control condition
(14.3&#x000b1;5.4%) (p &#x0003c; 0.05). There were significant differences in the %MVC values of SCM. The
ANR condition (8.3&#x000b1;4.7%) significantly decreased SCM activation compared to the control
condition (16.7&#x000b1;8.3%) (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Under the ANR condition, there was a significant increase in LCE activation and
significantly decrease in SCM activation compared to the control condition. Office workers
with neck and shoulder discomfort show a tendency to have a flexed neck posture and low
activity of the cervical erector spine muscles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The %MVC of LCE was significantly higher in
the ANR condition than in the control condition, which was expected since the tubing band
provides resistance against neck extension. The neck retraction exercise used in the present
study is similar to a previously suggested craniocervical flexion test (CCFT)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The CCFT examines the endurance of the deep
cervical flexors and could be used as a retraining exercise for these muscles. The function
of the deep cervical flexors is flexion of the atlanto-occipital joint. Although the deep
and superficial cervical flexors both provide the same action in neck flexion, the
contractile function of the deep cervical flexors could be interrupted by activation of the
superficial neck flexors, such as the SCM, which serves to flex the lower cervical area<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, we consider that the ANR would
help to ensure the effectiveness of neck retraction exercises because of the direct
resistance it provides in the cervical section. In addition, most patients are unskilled in
neck retraction exercises, so they commonly show excessive movement of the head during these
exercises. The ANR provided appropriate guidance in the neck retraction exercise and the
tubing bands prevented excessive neck extension or flexion. This study had some limitations
as loading in the neck retraction exercise was not controlled. Also, we were unable to show
a correlation between the resistance and muscle activity.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research
