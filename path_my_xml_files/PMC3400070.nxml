Recovery can be protracted and incomplete, with important and sustained effects upon everyday life, including family life, social participation and return to work. In stark contrast with other critically ill patient groups (eg, those following cardiothoracic surgery), there are comparatively few interventional studies of rehabilitation among the general intensive care unit patient population. This paper outlines the protocol for a sub study of the RECOVER study: a randomised controlled trial evaluating a complex intervention of enhanced ward-based rehabilitation for patients following discharge from intensive care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The RELINQUISH study is a nested longitudinal, qualitative study of family support and perceived healthcare needs among RECOVER participants at key stages of the recovery process and at up to 1&#x02005;year following hospital discharge. Its central premise is that recovery is a dynamic process wherein patients' needs evolve over time. RELINQUISH is novel in that we will incorporate two parallel strategies into our data analysis: (1) a pragmatic health services-oriented approach, using an a priori analytical construct, the &#x02018;Timing it Right&#x02019; framework and (2) a constructivist grounded theory approach which allows the emergence of new themes and theoretical understandings from the data. We will subsequently use Qualitative Health Needs Assessment methodology to inform the development of timely and responsive healthcare interventions throughout the recovery process.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Lothian Research Ethics Committee (protocol number HSRU011). The study has been added to the UK Clinical Research Network Database (study ID. 9986). The authors will disseminate the findings in peer reviewed publications and to relevant critical care stakeholder groups.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Article summary</title><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is a nested, qualitative longitudinal study of informal support and healthcare needs among participants in a randomised controlled complex rehabilitative intervention for survivors of critical illness (the RECOVER study).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Its central premise is that recovery is a dynamic process wherein patients' needs evolve over time.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study will explore patient experience and will identify specific needs at key points in the recovery process, for the purpose of developing timely healthcare interventions.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Qualitative studies of recovery are comparatively rare among survivors of critical illness, and longitudinal studies are rarer still.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Qualitative approaches provide rich and detailed insights into patient experience that are often inaccessible by questionnaire based approaches (alone).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A key strength of this study is its analytical strategy.

It is increasingly recognised, however, that survival is associated with a broad spectrum of physical and psychosocial sequelae<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6">1&#x02013;6</xref> with often refractory effects upon health-related quality of life (HRQoL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7 b8 b9 b10">7&#x02013;10</xref> Common physical morbidity includes muscle wasting, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, joint stiffness and breathlessness on exertion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> Survivors report impairment in mobility and the performance of everyday activities for many months and sometimes years following hospital discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref></p><p>An increased prevalence of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (characterised by distressing and intrusive &#x02018;flashbacks&#x02019;) has been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and is associated with poorer functional outcomes,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> the protraction of the recovery process<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> and reduced social participation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> Cognitive deficits in memory, concentration and executive function (eg, decision making) are also prevalent,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> often interfering with the ability to perform everyday activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> (eg, managing money, shopping, etc) and return to work.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>An impressive corpus of literature has described decrements in health status and their recovery over time using standardised HRQoL questionnaires. Comparatively little is known, however, about the significance or effects of prevalent morbidity (eg, weakness and fatigue) in survivors' <italic>everyday lives</italic>. The little that is currently known has been extrapolated from qualitative studies among other patient populations (eg, stroke and cancer), from clinicians involved in critical care outreach or follow-up services or from longitudinal critical care studies, which engage with participants <italic>face to face</italic>. Herridge <italic>et al</italic>'s work among survivors of adult respiratory distress syndrome is particularly notable,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> prompting calls to abandon a &#x02018;compartmentalised view of critical illness&#x02019; and to adopt instead the notion of a continuum which includes pre-existing illness, the critical illness episode and survivors' physical and psychosocial rehabilitative needs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref></p><p>This &#x02018;continuum&#x02019; should sensibly include (1) recent work on transitions of care across healthcare settings among patient populations with complex needs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16 b17 b18">16&#x02013;18</xref> and (2) contemporary conceptualisations of recovery which focus upon intrapersonal and psychosocial adaptation as opposed to the mere resolution of symptoms or improvement in functional status.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> The following sections outline the breadth and complexity of the issues.</p><sec><title>The critical care continuum</title><sec><title>Pre-existing health status has important effects upon processes of care and recovery</title><p>Comorbidity is of particular importance in critical care research, given its increased prevalence among ICU patient populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> and current demographic trends. Poor HRQoL among survivors is more strongly associated with previously poor HRQoL or prior chronic illness than with illness severity scores on ICU admission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref> Comorbidity has been associated with acute hospital length of stay<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> and has implications for the fragmentation of care, given the increasing emphasis upon specialisation in healthcare.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> Synergistic effects may also exist between prevalent chronic and age-related disorders (eg, cardiovascular and chronic respiratory disease) such that patients may experience an increased risk of physical impairment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref> poorer rehabilitative outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref> and reduced HRQoL<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref> than might reasonably be expected from their separate effects.</p><p>The relationship between comorbidity and outcomes has been explored using, almost exclusively, standardised indices of comorbidity and health status instruments. Very little is known about the cumulative effects of pre-existing health status and critical illness-related morbidity in the <italic>everyday lives</italic> of survivors or about the significance and effects of intrapersonal and psychosocial adaptation associated with pre-existing or chronic illness. Research among the chronically ill suggests, for example, that notions such as resilience<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> and self-efficacy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> may, in fact, attenuate poor perceived health status in the face of debilitating or life-threatening illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> This work has received remarkably little attention in the critical illness literatures. Although not a primary feature of this research, we will attempt to explore these phenomena in the RELINQUISH study.</p></sec><sec><title>The ICU experience</title><p>Amnesia, dreams (of an often persecutory nature) and delusional memories are extremely common and may constrain survivors' ability to &#x02018;piece together&#x02019; the events surrounding ICU admission, the chronology of clinical events or indeed to develop a realistic appreciation of illness severity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Dreams and delusional memories can be more vivid and emotive than the recall of factual events (eg, care or treatment-related activities) or bodily sensations (eg, thirst, discomfort) and have been consistently associated with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress symptomatology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Unlike other illnesses with a common cultural paradigm and/or a more insidious onset (eg, rheumatoid arthritis), the frequently emergency, opportunistic or inexplicable nature of critical illness may deny survivors a tangible basis upon which to attribute meaning or causality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Ward-based care and rehabilitation can have important effects upon recovery</title><p>ICU survivors are at increased risk of deterioration or serious adverse events following discharge to the general wards.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> ICU outreach or liaison nurse roles have been widely adopted elsewhere in the UK as part of a service-wide approach to critical care. In the absence of centralised funding, there is little such provision in Scotland, with potential implications for this patient group. Survivors are dispersed widely throughout the acute hospital setting, and ward-based staff may have limited recognisance of the broad spectrum of early critical illness-related morbidity (see online appendix 1). They may also be poorly equipped in terms of resource, knowledge and clinical skills to manage the acuity or complexity of this patient group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref></p><p>ICU survivors frequently suffer from profound weakness, generalised muscle wasting, impaired mobility and weight loss on transfer to the general ward, a situation described as &#x02018;inexplicable and worrying&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and a &#x02018;critical defining characteristic&#x02019; of the distress survivors experience at this time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> These patients are often highly dependent. Recent qualitative research suggests that they may receive inadequate levels of care, which are attributed to low levels of staffing and a perceived lack of understanding or indifference among hard-pressed nursing staff to their basic care needs, with, importantly, deleterious effects upon short-term recovery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref></p><p>Qualitative research among stroke populations suggests that while patients perceive physiotherapy to be central to the recovery process,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> many are dissatisfied with its frequency, intensity and brevity and the extent of recovery at hospital discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref> Indeed, our local service evaluation revealed that patients practiced mobility treatments (ie, transfers and walking) with physiotherapists only once per week.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> Our local qualitative research also suggests that survivors' informational needs with regard to the likelihood and aetiology of ICU-acquired weakness, self-management strategies and the extent and likely time course of the recovery process following discharge home were rarely met.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Post-hospital discharge experiences</title><p>Patients are rarely able to anticipate and/or articulate their own post-discharge needs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and while many perceive discharge home as the start of a &#x02018;proper&#x02019; recovery,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> the transition between hospital and home is often unexpectedly difficult.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> A number of factors have been implicated in suboptimal post-discharge outcomes. These include failure to develop comprehensive discharge plans due to time and resource constraints,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and with clinicians in the community setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref></p><p>ICU survivors in our local qualitative research reported significant and unanticipated difficulties in their everyday lives following discharge home and were highly dependent upon close family members, often as a result of inadequate rehabilitative input, inadequate discharge planning, unrealistic expectations of recovery, ongoing morbidity and variability in access to community-based support.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> Qualitative work among participants in a UK ICU follow-up service revealed that patients' psychosocial needs were rarely addressed during the acute hospital stay.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> Participants valued continuity of care; additional monitoring and expedited referral; the receipt of information on the admitting illness, the chronicity of treatments and events; and the opportunity to ask questions and expert reassurance. They also valued the timely organisation of follow-on (ie, community based) support but noted, importantly, a lack of knowledge among general practitioners with regard to their critical illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> In the absence of ICU follow-up services, these needs are likely to remain unmet.</p></sec><sec><title>Social support</title><p>In the absence of a dedicated rehabilitative pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> and burgeoning policy initiatives towards early acute hospital discharge, survivors may be discharged home &#x02018;sicker and quicker&#x02019;. Family members therefore often shoulder significant care responsibilities following hospital discharge, making important lifestyle changes (eg, balancing family, work and leisure activities) for which many are unprepared.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> Recent qualitative work among the critically ill describes family support as central to recovery; participants, for example, emphasised that &#x0201c;had they not had family to depend on, they might have taken longer to recover, not recovered so well or not recovered at all.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref></p><p>Perceived social support may be associated with a decrease in psychosocial problems among survivors of critical illness,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> although the processes through which this might occur are not currently understood. Indeed, remarkably little is known about the nature and scope of ICU survivors' support needs following discharge home due, potentially, to the perspective that social support is beyond the remit of medical intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref> They are likely to be significant, however, given the physical and psychological sequelae of critical illness and the effects of shortfalls in the processes of care previously described.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventional studies of rehabilitation are rare</title><p>Data from other patient populations (eg, stroke) consistently demonstrate that patients derive significant and sustained benefit from organised multidisciplinary rehabilitation in the acute healthcare setting.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref> In contrast to other critically ill patient groups (eg, following cardiac surgery), integrated rehabilitative pathways do not currently exist.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, however, recently developed guidelines for rehabilitation specific to the general ICU patient population (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, 2009).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Due to the limited available evidence upon which to base their recommendations, the guidelines are based upon expert opinion and consensus. Interventional studies of rehabilitation are nonetheless beginning to emerge among the critical care community. The RELINQUISH study, as previously described, is a nested longitudinal qualitative study of family support and perceived healthcare needs among one such study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>The &#x02018;parent&#x02019; study: RECOVER</title><p>The RECOVER study is described elsewhere in this journal in detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> RECOVER is based upon extensive literature review and completed local research comprising: a prospective audit of physiotherapy and dietetic intervention between ICU and hospital discharge,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> a qualitative study exploring quality of life among survivors of prolonged critical illness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref> and a feasibility randomised controlled trial of enhanced physiotherapy and dietetic management using a dedicated rehabilitative assistant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref></p><p>Participants in the RECOVER study (n=240) will be randomised into one of the two groups.

Concerns during early adjustment to life at home included physical and emotional dependence upon informal care givers (emotional and instrumental needs) and the desire for more &#x02018;tangible&#x02019; professional support such as additional physiotherapy (instrumental and appraisal needs), guidance on self-management (instrumental and appraisal needs), information and psychosocial support (emotional needs). Longer term needs, in contrast, centred upon the maintenance of health, the management of long-term sequelae and the secondary prevention of illness (informational and appraisal needs). These categories will guide our analysis in terms of whether, how, when and by whom these needs were met at identified stages in the recovery process. We will also explore experiences and perceptions of <italic>unmet</italic> need and examine their impact upon recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Approach 2: a constructivist grounded theory approach</title><p>A priori categories such as those of the TIR framework do not exist in approaches such as grounded theory. This approach is characterised by the use of flexible analytical guidelines aimed at building inductive middle-range theory though successive processes of data analysis and theory development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref> The steps involved in grounded theory are reiterative in nature and consist of the following: simultaneous collection and analysis of data, a two or three stage coding process (from open coding at the beginning to focused coding as the analysis progresses, categorising data under emerging conceptual themes), constant comparison of incidences within and across the entire data set, memo writing (aimed at capturing conceptual analytical processes&#x02014;audit trail), theoretical sampling and, finally, the integration of the themes into a theoretical framework which explains the data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> A <italic>constructivist</italic> grounded theory approach directs attention to the complexity of the world we live in by accounting for multiple perspectives on and interpretations of social phenomena (eg, recovery from critical illness) and recognising participants' active engagement in &#x02018;making sense&#x02019; of their experiences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref></p><p>Data analysis will begin with open coding and progress to focused coding within and across data sets. Focused coding is the second major step in grounded theory analysis identifying common themes and thus shifting analysis to a higher conceptual level.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref> In order to capture change over time, we will summarise each interview and case before analysing change <italic>across</italic> cases to derive at a theoretical framework of recovery over time. Part of this process is the iterative adaptation of the interview guides, which will reflect the emerging themes and foci of analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative Health Needs Assessment</title><p>We will subsequently use Qualitative Health Needs Assessment methodology<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref> to identify the key attributes and preferences, as perceived by patients, for informal support and healthcare provision at key stages in the recovery process. With regard to evolving informational needs among patient groups, for example, the existing literature suggests that patients have a preference for face-to-face dialogue with clinicians, telephone follow-up or written information at subsequent stages in the recovery process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Analysis will inform the development of a questionnaire-based instrument which will be used in a subsequent large-scale study of stated values and preferences for alternative models of service development among survivors and their family members.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Qualitative research among survivors of critical illness is comparatively rare, and longitudinal approaches are rarer still. This study is novel in that it incorporates both methodological and theoretical triangulation into its analytical strategy. Importantly, this strategy addresses the <italic>empirical practice-related</italic> concerns of health services researchers while enhancing its analytical or explanatory potential in terms of advancing our <italic>theoretical</italic> understandings of recovery.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001507-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e641" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001507-s2.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e646" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001507-s3.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e651" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD4"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001507-s4.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e656" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD5"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2012-001507-s5.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d34e661" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Ms Louise Sanford, Dr Natalie Pattison and Professor Pam Smith for their contribution on RELINQUISH's Steering Committee.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Ramsay P, Huby G, Rattray J, <italic>et al</italic>.
