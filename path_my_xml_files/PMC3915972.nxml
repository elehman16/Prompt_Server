Because of increasing interest in non-invasive imaging in interventional cardiology and growing quality of obtained images, we designed a prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial to evaluate the role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in the planning of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) of bifurcation lesions. Eighty eligible patients scheduled for PCI of bifurcations in stable coronary artery disease will undergo additional CCTA examination and will be randomized 1: 1 to either planning of PCI using angiography and CCTA or to PCI planning with use of angiography alone. Primary endpoints will include PCI strategy (one or two stents), technique, size of implanted stents and direct angiographic effect of the procedure. Immediate PCI effect measured with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and the effect on fractional flow reserve (FFR) in the side branch (in a subgroup of patients), as well as plaque morphology assessed in CCTA, patient radiation exposure and amount of contrast will be compared in secondary analysis. The study is intended to clarify the influence of CCTA analysis on the technique and direct effect of PCI of bifurcations and to provide evidence on the relevance of performing a CCTA scan prior to PCI of bifurcation lesions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>computed tomography</kwd><kwd>bifurcations</kwd><kwd>planning</kwd><kwd>coronary interventions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Percutaneous coronary interventions in bifurcation lesions are the most challenging procedures due to their complexity and higher risk of adverse effects, including in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. On the other hand, a bifurcation is involved in about 20% of all PCI, which means that the issue of its optimization remains fundamental [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Several possible techniques are used, including provisional side-branch stenting, spot stenting, T-stenting, culottes, V-stenting, crush stenting, etc. Moreover, there is a growing number of dedicated bifurcation devices. Since provisional stenting technique with one stent is commonly advised as a first-line approach [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], in some cases it may lead to side branch (SB) compromise and the need for second stent implantation, which is considered non-inferior in terms of adverse effects [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To date, no universal protocol of performing PCI in bifurcations is available. Procedure planning is routinely based on visual estimation of angiography, sometimes facilitated by quantitative coronary analysis (QCA) software.</p><p>Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a diagnostic modality of growing recognition in coronary artery imaging, characterized by high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of lesion severity. The advantages of CCTA in comparison with angiography (CA) include the possibility of assessing the vessel wall (instead of the lumen only), detection of vessel remodeling, analysis of calcification pattern and visualization of distal segments of chronically occluded vessels. Estimation of lumen compromise in non-calcified lesions may be more reliable in CCTA than in CA, which was suggested in studies using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Coronary computed tomography angiography also provides better insight into the morphology of overlapping and crossing vessels in comparison with angiography. Sensitivity and specificity of CCTA in detection of significant bifurcation lesions were assessed in comparison with CA as 96% and 99% respectively [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The CCTA classifies bifurcations into Medina subtypes as precisely as angiography and has even better performance in assessment of the angle between the main branch (MB) and SB [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Studies carried out to date suggest that analysis of CCTA in the process of planning of bifurcation PCI may reveal additional information helpful in PCI planning and influencing the result of the procedure as assessed by IVUS. It has been suggested that analysis of CCTA before stenting of &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; lesions influences the strategy leading to better lesion coverage and stent deployment [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>There are no reliable data on the assessment of the role of CCTA in planning of bifurcation stenting. The majority of these procedures are planned on the basis of coronary angiography, sometimes, especially in cases involving the left main stem, accompanied with IVUS [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Coronary computed tomography angiography, which is less expensive and less invasive in comparison to IVUS, to some extent may be regarded as a surrogate of IVUS.</p><p>The final effect of PCI can be quantitatively measured with angiographic parameters, including minimal (in-stent) lumen diameter, reference lumen diameter and lumen diameter at the ostium of SB. More reliable assessment of the direct effect of stenting can be done using IVUS, by measuring in-stent lumen areas, reference lumen areas, residual plaque burden and possible acute complications such as stent malapposition, which may need optimization to ensure a good long-term outcome. Another method of assessment of stenosis severity is fractional flow reserve (FFR) [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], giving information on the physiological effect of the vessel narrowing. Fractional flow reserve measurement after stent deployment provides data on the residual functional vessel compromise [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Since there are no data on the role of CCTA in planning of bifurcation stenting and its impact on the direct effect of PCI, we designed a prospective randomized single-center pilot study to evaluate whether the assessment of CCTA together with angiography at the stage of planning PCI of bifurcations affects the technique and the direct effect of stenting.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Study design</title><p>Single-center, single-blinded, prospective, randomized clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>
