But after a single use, they may become contaminated by a wide array of microorganisms present both in the oral cavity and in the external environment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There is a need for disinfection methods, which are rapidly effective, cost-effective, nontoxic, and that can be easily implemented.</p><p>With the increasing incidence of drug resistance in the prevalent pathogens and an associated risk with chemotherapeutic agents, it is essential to find an alternative to existing drugs. The herbals, which have known pharmaceuticals properties could be the best source of these alternative drugs.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In recent years, antimicrobial properties of medicinal plants are being increasingly reported from different parts of the world.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The present investigation was designed to study the antimicrobial efficacy of 3% neem, garlic of concentration 4.15 mg/mL, and green tea of concentration 40 mg/mL on <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> and to compare with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash, which is considered as the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for oral hygiene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was a parallel <italic>in vitro</italic> comparative experimental trial. The toothbrushes were obtained from subjects aged 18&#x02013;21 years staying in the boys&#x02019; hostel of a private engineering college in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India. The study subjects, the microbiologist, and the statistician were blinded. The purpose of the study was explained to the subjects and the hostel warden and the informed consent was obtained.</p><p>After obtaining ethical clearance, a pilot study was conducted with 30 subjects to obtain the feasibility and acceptability and for the sample size. With the help of nMASTER software (developed by the Department of Biostatistics, CMC Vellore for sample size calculation) keeping the power of the study at 90% and alpha error at 5%, a sample size of 13 was obtained for each group. The final sample size was decided to be 15 in each group. As there were four antimicrobial solutions and distilled water being used as the control, the total number of subjects needed for the study was 75.</p><p>The subjects aged between 18 years and 21 years, having at least three single-rooted and two multirooted functional teeth per quadrant (third molars excluded) and with decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) score of &#x0003c;3 were included in the study. Subjects using antibiotics or antiseptic mouth washes for at least 3 months prior to the study, undergoing any dental treatment, with orthodontic or with extensive intraoral prosthesis, medically compromised (e.g., in diabetic patients) and subjects using neem, garlic, green tea, chlorhexidine, and fluoride in any form as an oral hygiene aid were excluded from the study.</p><p>Of the total 192 subjects of the age group of 18&#x02013;21 years residing in the hostel, 158 subjects were eligible for the study. Systematic random sampling was used to select 75 subjects. The preparations of test solutions were done with the help of the guidelines given in the literatures.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The 75 subjects were divided into five groups, namely, Group I, Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V. Each group had 15 subjects.</p><p>All the subjects were provided with dentifrices and toothbrushes during the entire study procedure. All of them were instructed to brush twice daily using a horizontal scrub method for 3 min and to rinse the toothbrushes under running tap water for 20 s after brushing. They were also instructed to keep their toothbrushes in the separately provided disposable glass containers in such a manner that the head of the brush with the bristles should face outside and be left open for drying.</p><p>The study was conducted in two stages. In the first stage, for baseline data, all 75 subjects were provided with a new set of precoded toothbrushes and nonfluoridated toothpastes. The toothbrushes were collected back after 14 days. The collected toothbrushes were transferred to the laboratory in separate sterilized pouches. These toothbrushes were aseptically introduced into test tubes containing thioglycolate medium for 4 h such that only the head of the brushes was immersed in the medium and subjected to microbial analysis. This was done to obtain the baseline analysis.</p><p>In the second stage, the 75 subjects were again provided with a new set of toothbrushes and nonfluoridated toothpastes. The toothbrushes were collected back after 14 days. The collected toothbrushes were transferred to the laboratory in separate sterilized pouches. The toothbrushes collected from Group I were aseptically introduced directly into test tubes containing 5 mL of distilled water (control) in which only the head of the toothbrush was immersed in the medium. Similarly, the toothbrushes collected from the subjects in Group II, Group III, Group IV, and Group V were immersed in the test tubes containing 3% neem, garlic of concentration 4.15 mg/mL, green tea of concentration 40 mg/mL solutions, and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash. After 12 h of immersion in the solution, the toothbrushes were subjected to microbial analysis.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Microbial analysis</title><p>The toothbrushes were introduced into test tubes containing thioglycolate medium and kept in these for 4 h. The samples were then vortexed for 15 s to dislodge the bacteria from the bristles to the media using a cyclomixer (Remi Elektrotechnik Limited). The solution was inoculated using a platinum inoculation loop. 10 &#x003bc;L of the vortexed sample was being streaked on mitis salivarius agar and incubated in an anaerobic jar with gas pack system (Remi Elektrotechnik Limited) for 48 h at 37&#x000b0;C in an incubator.

Toothbrush and toothpaste were used in the study as an oral hygiene aid, which is the most commonly used aid and is most effective, safest device to remove dental plaque.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Transmission of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> occurs even through dentifrices.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] To avoid any such factors confounding the result of this study, each subject was given an individual toothbrush and toothpaste. For sterility control, four new toothbrushes that were freshly removed from the packets were subjected to microbial analysis. None of the unused toothbrushes had the colonies of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, suggesting that the origin of these microorganisms is from the oral cavity.</p><p>In this study, the number of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> ranged 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;8.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> CFUs in the baseline. This shows that the toothbrush that disturbs or reduces the existing oral microflora may at the same time introduce other microorganisms such as <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> in the oral cavity. This disturbance of the existing flora may result in the removal of competitive organisms and thus, increases the possibility for <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> to colonize.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In this study, three herbal disinfectant media were compared with chlorhexidine (gold standard antimicrobial agent[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) to know the efficacy in reducing contamination of the toothbrush.</p><p>Various media are used to culture the microorganisms. Thioglycolate medium, peptone water, tryptone water, nitrate broth, etc., are some of the enriched culture media. In this study, thioglycolate medium was used for the growth of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> due to its availability and it is also a good transport medium.</p><p>The toothbrushes from the subjects were collected after 14 days. However, different study intervals such as 5 h, 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h and 3 days, 5 days, 14 days, 15 days, 24 days, and 28 days, and 3 months have been followed in other studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In this study, 14 days was selected because in a study conducted by Sogi <italic>et al</italic>., maximum microbial contamination was found in toothbrushes after 14 days and 28 days.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In the study, the toothbrushes were kept in antimicrobial solutions for 12 h. Various studies showed 5 min, 12 h, 20 h, 24 h, etc., as the soaking time.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] 12 h was selected for this study by considering the fact that in real-life scenario it is advisable to brush twice daily, i.e., once in every 12 h. Hence, the toothbrushes could be dipped in the disinfectant during the interval of tooth brushing.</p><p>Neem possesses various medicinal properties, and is widely available in most rural and urban areas of developing countries. In this study, 3% neem was found to be an effective antimicrobial solution against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> on toothbrush bristles (87% reduction). This was in line with the studies conducted by Balappanavar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Padma K Bhat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This could be due to the presence of polyphenolic tannins present in the extract, which could effectively bind to the surface-associated bacterial proteins, resulting in bacterial aggregation and loss of glucosyltransferase activity. This bacterial aggregate effectively reduces the count of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. A study conducted by Aarati <italic>et al</italic>. proved that both aqueous and alcoholic extracts of neem have significant antibacterial activity against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Garlic showed the maximum reduction (96%) in the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count in the present study. The antibacterial activity of garlic is due to the presence of allicin. Till now, not much studies have been reported as per the literature search, which have used garlic for decontaminating toothbrush. The result of this study is in concurrence with the study conducted by Amin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Prabhakar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Yu-Ying Chen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Nikolic <italic>et al</italic>. reported that allicin possesses strong anti-<italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> activity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Fani <italic>et al</italic>. reported that mouthwash containing garlic could be used for the prevention of dental caries.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Despite the antimicrobial effects of garlic extract, side effects such as unpleasant taste, halitosis, and nausea were reported.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Green tea polyphenols have demonstrated significant antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, thermogenic, probiotic, and antimicrobial properties in numerous human, animal, and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In the present investigation, green tea showed 84% reduction in the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count and has been proved to be effective in decontaminating toothbrushes. This anti-<italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> property of green tea is due to the presence of polyphenolic compounds in green tea. Not many studies have been reported as per the literature search, which have used green tea for decontaminating toothbrushes. Several studies have indicated that green tea inhibits growth, acid production, metabolism, and glucosyltransferase enzyme activity of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine is a cationic agent that exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial effect and is a benchmark control in various studies. In the present investigation, chlorhexidine showed 92% reduction in the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count. Chlorhexidine kills bacteria by disrupting the cell membrane.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In studies conducted by Bhat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and Nanjunda Swamy <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] chlorhexidine produced 100% reduction of the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count. The study conducted by Suma Sogi <italic>et al</italic>. found that chlorhexidine produces 88% bacterial reduction in toothbrushes after 14 days.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] But the result of the present study was not in concurrence with the study reported by Balappanavar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and Padma K Bhat <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] where the percentages of reduction in <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count were only 64% and 65%, respectively, which were less than the present study.</p><p>As per the present results, neem, garlic, and green tea have been proved to be as effective disinfectants as chlorhexidine for toothbrushes. Kudva <italic>et al</italic>. reported that garlic and chlorhexidine are effective against <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Fani <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the inhibitory activity of garlic on <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> was comparable with chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Groppo <italic>et al</italic>. also reported that the garlic and chlorhexidine had a similar effect on <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In contrast to the present result, Priya Subramaniam <italic>et al</italic>. reported that aqueous extract of green tea shows more reduction of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> than chlorhexidine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In the present investigation, garlic showed the maximum reduction in the <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> count. It produced 96% reduction followed by chlorhexidine (92%), neem (88%), and green tea (83%). Distilled water showed only a 2.2% reduction. When comparing the mean difference and also the mean percentage reduction obtained in <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> colony count between the groups, only the comparison with distilled water showed a statistically very high difference. But when comparing the mean difference or mean percentage reduction in CFUs of <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic> in garlic, neem, and green tea with chlorhexidine, the differences were not statistically significant from each other. So the present investigation showed that immersion of toothbrush for 12 h in 3% neem, garlic of concentration 4.15 mg/mL, and green tea of concentration 40 mg/mL were as efficacious as 0.2% chlorhexidine for disinfection. So neem, garlic, and green tea can be used at par with chlorhexidine as a disinfectant for toothbrush.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Based on the results of the study, it can be concluded that neem, garlic, and green tea are equally efficacious as chlorhexidine and these herbal products can be used as potent alternatives to chlorhexidine as disinfectants for toothbrushes.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>I would like to acknowledge the people who helped in accomplishing the study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saravia</surname><given-names>ME</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelson-Filho</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>da Silva</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Faria</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ito</surname><given-names>IY</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Viability of Streptococcus mutans toothbrush bristles</article-title><source>J Dent Child (Chic)</source><year>2008</year><volume>75</volume><fpage>29</fpage><lpage>32</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18505645</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pathak</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anti-candida activity of aqueous extracts of some herbals</article-title><source>Indian J Fund Appl Life Sci</source><year>2012</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>6</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Beg</surname><given-names>AZ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial and phytochemical studies on 45 Indian medicinal plants against multi-drug resistant human pathogens</article-title><source>J Ethnopharmacol</source><year>2001</year><volume>74</volume><fpage>113</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11167029</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Balappanavar</surname><given-names>AY</given-names></name><name><surname>Nagesh</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ankola</surname><given-names>AV</given-names></name><name><surname>Tangade</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Kakodkar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Varun</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Antimicrobial efficacy of various disinfecting solutions in reducing the contamination of the toothbrush -
