<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> The failure of infertility treatment leads to
individual, familial, and social problems. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of the nursing care program based on Watson&#x02019;s "Theory of Human Caring" on
anxiety and distress caused by coping when the treatment fails.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This study randomized controlled trial study was
conducted from April to November 2012, with 86 Turkish women with infertility
(intervention group: 45, control group: 41). Follow-up of 32 infertile women, who failed
infertility treatment from intervention group, and 35 infertile women, who failed
infertility treatment from control group, continued for another four weeks. Data were
collected through Spiel Berger&#x02019;s State/Trait Anxiety Inventory, Distress Scale, and Ways
of Coping Questionnaire. The analyses of data were conducted using SPSS ver 13.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> The intervention and control groups significantly
differed in terms of anxiety, distress, and coping levels. The intervention group&#x02019;s mean
anxiety score decreased by thirteen points and distress by fourteen points (in a positive
direction). The intervention group&#x02019;s mean positive coping style score increased. Whereas a
negative increase was observed in the control group&#x02019;s values depending on the failure of
the treatment.</p><p>
<bold><italic> Conclusion:</italic></bold> Watson&#x02019;s theory of human caring is recommended
as a guide to nursing patients with infertility treatment to decrease levels of anxiety
and distress, and to increase the positive coping style among infertile women.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Infertility</kwd><kwd>Anxiety</kwd><kwd>Nursing care</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="37"/><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p> Please cite this paper as: Durgun Ozan Y, Okumu&#x0015f; H.

birth, and 1 to 1.5 million couples are infertile.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> Infertility is a case of unexpected loss for the women, their husbands, and their
families. This situation requires adapting oneself to a life without children and coping
with difficulties.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> To avoid this stress
and life crisis, individuals start searching for treatment alternatives, and most of the
time, Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) is thought to be the solution. When they first
start the treatment, couples expect the treatment to be successful and hope they will become
pregnant.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In studies carried out with
infertile women, they reported that the most upsetting situation for them was the failure of
the treatment.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p> Anxiety is an unpleasant, fear-like feeling, and experience of worry or concern usually
accompanied by various physiological symptoms that everyone has experienced in certain
periods of their lives.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> It has been pointed out that based on the influence of infertility, anxiety increases in
the process of infertility treatment<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and
that failure of treatment increased the related influence as well.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Some researchers
demonstrated that anxiety did not have any significant influence on the success of IVF
treatment.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Some other researchers,
however, reported that women&#x02019;s levels of anxiety had significant influence on the success of
In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p> Distress is defined as an unpleasant situation that occurs when an individual is
confronted with expectations above their own characteristics and in which the individual
perceives environmental stimuli as threats within the process of an interaction between
themselves and the environment.</p><p> Coping with stress refers to an individual&#x02019;s resistance to a case they consider to be a
stressor.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Gourounti et al., argue
that the increasing level of anxiety and infertility distress during treatment has a
negative influence on pregnancy rates.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>It
has been reported that anxiety increases in the infertility treatment process<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and decreases with the use of effective coping
methods.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> According to Pasch, the
most important point to be taken into account to decrease anxiety in the infertility
treatment process and in case of failure of the treatment is not only to prepare patients
for the infertility treatment process and for the possible failure of the treatment, but
also to help them cope with this effectively.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>According to relevant literature, women whose infertility treatment fails
experience more problems in the rest of their lives; however, the follow-ups and nursing
care for these women are not continued; that is considered to be a gap in the medical field.
Infertile women need professional help and support, both in the treatment process and in the
case of treatment failure.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p> If the treatment fails after all the related difficult processes, or if pregnancy does not
occur, how will these women reform their lives? Will infertile women be able to cope with
such negative feelings as loss and hopelessness? Due to all these uncertainties and
questions that come to mind, the treatment on women is ceased for some time or forever.</p><p> The starting point for the present study was the need for continuing the nursing care of
women whose infertility treatment results in failure. When the ART for the infertile women
resulted in failure, maintaining the care in cases of lack of pregnancy requires nursing
knowledge and practices. To achieve this, it has been suggested that theories or models
specific to nursing should be used as a guide.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p> In the application process for the study, the difficulties and obstacles likely to be
encountered in relation to evaluating the infertile women, focusing on their problems, and
providing these women with holistic care could be dealt with the use of theories already
developed. Infertile women experience several traumas in both physical and emotional aspects
of their treatment processes. In addition, bear they do not bear a child, they feel social
pressure. The nursing care approaches applied to these women are mostly treatment based.</p><p> Jean Watson&#x02019;s human care theory aims at moving away from treatment-centeredness and
focuses on &#x0201c;caring&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The theory focuses
on both human and nursing paradigms.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> It
asserts that a human being cannot be healed like an object to be repaired. The conceptual
elements of the Watson&#x02019;s theory include the caritas process, the transpersonal caring
relationship, caring moments and caring occasions, and caring&#x02013;healing modalities.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Various studies have established that the
theory of human caring can make nursing care more efficient and aware, and improve care
outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p> With the belief that these features would provide a solution to the problems experienced
by infertile women, it was thought that planning nursing care based on this theory would be
appropriate. The present study evaluated the effectiveness of a nursing care program based
on Watson&#x02019;s theory of human caring for managing distress caused by infertility, the
accompanying anxiety, and also for assisting the patient to cope when the treatment
fails.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> The study was carried out with a single-blind, randomized controlled trial research
method. The women who participated in the study were blinded to their assignment to either
the intervention group or in the control</p><p> group. All phases of this study were designed based on the Consolidated Standards of
Reporting Trials (CONSORT).<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>
is a CONSORT diagram showing the flow through the study. The study was conducted in
Diyarbak&#x00131;r Veni-Vidi IVF Center in Turkey between April and November 2012. This center
conducts 400 IVF cycles per year. The research sample was made up of infertile women who
received treatment in an IVF Center.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="jcs-6-95-g001"/><statement><p>CONSORT diagram showing participant flow through the study</p></statement></fig><p> At the beginning of the treatment, the inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) primary
infertility; (ii) being over the age of 18; (iii) ability to speak, read and write in
Turkish; and (iv) application of assisted reproduction techniques such as (IVF-ET (Transfer
Embryo)) and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection&#x000a0;(ICSI). At the end of the treatment, the women
whose infertility treatment resulted in failure (who had a negative pregnancy test result)
were included in the study.</p><p> The exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) being diagnosed with a chronic disease.</p><p> The sample size was calculated with an error margin of 0.05 in the reliability range of
80% and 95% using NCSS-PASS software; it was based on the anxiety mean scores and standard
deviations 43.3 (5.70) obtained from studies carried out with women receiving infertility
treatment.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p> At the end of the study, based on the analysis conducted depending on the mean scores and
the standard deviations with the software of NCSS-PASS, the effect size was calculated and
found to be strong at 0.8.</p><p> In the present study, the block randomization method was used. In this method, to conceal
the information about randomization, the intervention and control groups in the study are
determined with the block randomization method by a person not involved in the study. The
group distribution is given to the researcher in numbered opaque envelopes previously
prepared. For each woman, separate files are formed, and closed opaque envelopes are put in
these files. After those women appropriate to the sampling criteria are selected and they
agree to participate in the study, the envelopes are opened and whether the woman is to be
assigned to the intervention group or to the control group is decided. The women included in
the research sample do not know which group they belong to. The staff working in the center
is not informed about the members of the intervention and control groups. To prevent the
women in the intervention and control groups from communicating with each other, the
appointments are set at different times.</p><p> In the study, the women whose infertility treatment resulted in failure were followed
starting from the beginning of the treatment. In this way, these follow-ups helped develop
confidence between the infertile women and the researcher in the treatment process.
Therefore, when the treatment resulted in failure, it was easier to do the follow-up of the
women. To maintain the care program, a semi-structured nursing care program was developed as
a guide. The program was designed in a way to be executed in six sessions in the infertility
treatment process, and in one session before and after the test on the pregnancy test day,
and in two sessions on the day following the failure of the infertility treatment. Each
session was organized in accordance with the improvement processes selected from the
theory.</p><p> Examining and internalizing Watson&#x02019;s theory of human caring before putting it into
practice and adapting the theory to the present study constituted the first phase of the
process. In the study, all the 10 Carative Factors were used. The 10 carative factors
included: (1) Humanistic&#x02013;altruistic system of values; (2) Enabling faith-hope; (3)
Cultivation of sensitivity to the self and others; (4) Helping-trusting, human care
relationship; (5) Expression of positive and negative feelings; (6) Creative problem-solving
caring process; (7) Transpersonal teaching-learning; (8) Supportive, protective, and/or
corrective mental, social, spiritual environment; (9) Human needs assistance; (10)
Existential-phenomenological-Spiritual forces.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Nurses working in an infertility center, nursing academic personnel
specialized in infertility, and Dr. Jean Watson were consulted.</p><p> On the first day of treatment (the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of cycle<bold>)</bold>, the women
were informed about the purpose of the study and included in the study after their approval.
Throughout the application process, the women were contacted with via e-mail or phone or
when they visited the IVF center. In addition, besides the follow-ups, the women in the care
group were informed about the fact that the researcher would do all the nursing cares in the
treatment process.</p><p> For the follow-ups of the women in the care group, a special room was prepared. A sofa was
put in the room for the women&#x02019;s comfort. The chair and the desk to be used by the researcher
were placed in the room in a way to avoid any interruption of the interviews. To avoid such
interruptions and to maintain silence, a warning sign was put on the door of the interview
room. Also, the phones in the room were switched off during the interviews. There was a pen
and a sheet of paper on the interview desk for the researcher&#x02019;s note-taking. In addition,
there was a napkin and a washbasin in the room. While expressing their feelings, most of the
women cried. Thus, it was suggested that they use the washbasin to relax. With the help of
the semi-structured care program based on the Theory of Human Caring, seven follow-ups were
done for the infertile women in the care group in the treatment process. Also, the
follow-ups of the women whose treatment resulted in failure were continued, and two more
follow-ups were done: in all, nine follow-ups were done. The duration of the interviews
during the follow-ups lasted about 20 to 40 minutes.</p><p> The themes were chosen for each interview in accordance with the improvement processes.
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> presents these themes and the interview
process. The women were not left alone before, during, and after the Oocyte Pick-up (OPU)
and Embryo Transfer (ET) processes. All participants&#x02019; caring and healing processes were done
by the researcher. From the end of the ET process to the pregnancy test, the follow-ups of
the women were continued. Also, before the pregnancy test, the women&#x02019;s feelings and thoughts
were shared. In addition, the women were not left alone when the doctor informed them about
the result of the pregnancy test, and their thoughts were shared in the following period.
The follow-ups for the women whose treatment resulted in failure were continued. With these
women, two more interviews were held, and related solutions were put forward to help these
women cope with this failure and to decrease their anxiety and the negative effects of
infertility.</p><p> The women in the control group received the standard nursing care given in the IVF center.
The first day of the treatment was the day when everyone was introduced, informed about the
study, and asked for their consent. After opening the envelope, the application was planned.
The study process for the control group included pre-treatment assessments (T1), assessments
made just after the ET (T2), and one month follow-up assessments (T3).</p><p> For the present study, the data were gathered from pre-treatment assessments (T1), the
assessments that were made just after the ET (T2), and the eighth week follow-up assessments
(T3). The data were collected by the researcher through face-to-face interviews in the
fertility clinic. The women completed the data collection tools in 10 to 15 minutes.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title> Sociodemographic data form</title><p> This form includes 17 questions developed by the researchers to collect research data

1970 and standardized and adapted into Turkish, then tested for its validity and
reliability by &#x000d6;ner and LeComte between 1974 and 1977.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p> The scale was made up of two scales with a total of 40 items. Among the items, 20 aim at
determining the state of anxiety level, and 20 of them help determine the trait anxiety
level (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.92 and 0.86, respectively). A higher score refers to a high
level of anxiety. In the present study, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.75 and 0.70</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title> Infertility Distress Scale</title><p> The Infertility Distress Scale developed by Aky&#x000fc;z and colleagues (2008) helps describe
individuals&#x02019; feelings and emotions regarding infertility. The scale includes of 21 items,
16 of which are direct and five are reverse. The scale produces scores ranging between 21
and 84, and it does not include a cutting point. Higher scores received from the scale
refer to a high level of infertility distress.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the original study, Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha: 0.93; in the present study,

Turkish, and then tested for its validity and reliability by &#x0015e;ahin and Durak in 1995. The
scale includes two dimensions: one relates to the ways of coping with the problem, and the
other relates to the ways of coping with emotions. These two dimensions include five
factors: &#x0201c;self-confident&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;optimistic&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;unconfident&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;submissive&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;seeking social
support&#x0201d;. The reliability coefficients of the sub-dimensions of the scale were calculated
as 0.80, 0.68, 0.73, 0.70 and 0.47, respectively. For the present study, the Cronbach
Alpha values were found to be 0.75, 0.76, 0.70, 0.60 and 0.42, respectively. In this
scale, which included 30 items and scored as 0 to 3, the 1<sup>st</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup>
items were calculated via reversed scoring for the factor of social-support seeking. The
lowest score to be received for each scale is 0, and the highest score is 3. The total
score is not calculated.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title> Caring and healing process in the intervention group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td style="border-style: solid none solid none; border-width: 1px" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

process, volunteerism in the study, and about the possibility to refuse participation in
the study at any time, those willing to take part in the study were given the Voluntary
Participation Form and asked for their oral and written consents. In addition, the
Noninvasive Studies Ethical Council of Dokuz Eylul University was also presented for their
consent (Date of the ethical council&#x02019;s approval of the study: 13.01.2011; protocol number:
04-GOA). Lastly, the center where the application would be carried out and developers of
the scale were asked for their consents as well.</p><p> The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for
Windows 15.0). The sample size and power analysis of the study were determined using
NCSS-PASS (Number Cruncher Statistical System-Power Analysis and Sample Size).</p><p> To determine the homogeneity of the intervention and control groups after randomization,
the chi-square test and t-test were conducted to determine whether there was a significant
difference between the mean scores. For the comparison of the pre-tests, after ET and one
month follow-up data for the intervention and control groups, the t-test was used. One-way
analysis of variance was used in the repetitive measurements to determine whether there
was a difference between the groups&#x02019; own measurements. Additionally, the t-test in
Bonferroni correction dependent groups was performed to find which measurement led to the
difference. Because there are three comparisons in the analysis, the p value was divided
by three and found to be 0.05.3=0.016. The significance level was determined as P &#x0003c;
0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> At the end of one-month follow-up, data were collected from 67 (77.9%) of the

and that those differences occur in the levels of state anxiety in all phases of the
treatment.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In the related literature, it is reported that the changes in anxiety
levels occur before the treatment, during OPU, ET, in the period of 12 days spent waiting
for the pregnancy test result, and in the case of failure of the treatment.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> In line with these results, to decrease the
women&#x02019;s levels of anxiety during and after the infertility treatment, the nursing cares were
planned based on these crucial periods.</p><p> This difference is likely to result from the caring process applied to the intervention
group. It was also found that planning the caring moments based on the critical periods in
the treatment process was influential not only on decreasing the anxiety level, but also on
developing the interpersonal caring relationship. It was found that theory of human caring
was influential on the decreasing anxiety scores, and that this influence continued after ET
and during the first-month measurements. In one study carried out on women whose first
infertility treatment resulted in failure, Verhaak and colleagues reported that women&#x02019;s
anxiety levels increased following the failure of the treatment; that they started their
second treatment attempt with a high level of anxiety; and that they were at risk of
depression. In sum, the researcher stated that cycles of anxiety and repeated failure
occurred.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, the fact that among the intervention group women who were followed
up until the beginning of the treatment, there was an increase in the anxiety levels of
those whose infertility treatment resulted in failure and whose pregnancy test results were
negative, was a natural result. To understand the difference caused by the nursing care
based on the theory of human caring, when compared with the control group, women whose
infertility treatment resulted in failure, a significant difference was found. When compared
with the standard nursing care, the fact that the theory causing a difference in the anxiety
level is not medicine-focused but is based on the human, improvement and love<bold>.</bold>
Because the theory was a guide for providing infertility nurses with individual-centered,
respectful, sensitive, honest, and accessible caring could be regarded as the source of the
decrease in anxiety.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title> Infertility Distress </title><p> The infertility treatment process is not a fixed process, but rather one involving
different treatment and interventional procedures.</p><p> Therefore, in the infertility treatment process, infertility distress
increases.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The cause of this decrease was that the caring moments were planned
in accordance with the critical periods in the treatment process. In addition, the caring
moments were also influential on the development of caring relationship between
individuals.</p><p> The reflection of the 10 Carative Factors in the theory into caring allowed the
intervention group women to express their positive and negative feelings and thoughts. In
addition, these feelings were not rejected, and the women could experience the treatment
process with the least influence thanks to the individual problem solving processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title> Ways of Coping with Stress </title><p> Lee and colleagues reported a relationship between the emotions of women whose
infertility treatment resulted in failure and the coping methods they applied. For this
reason, they claimed that the care given to women whose infertility treatment results in
failure should be continued.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Lancastle
and Boivin stated that the attempts to cope in the process of waiting for the pregnancy
test result allowed women to pass this duration of waiting more positively and in a
relaxed manner.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Related studies
revealed that use of effective coping methods in the infertility treatment process helped
decrease the influence of infertility and the level of anxiety.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>Pasch pointed out that the most important point to be taken
into consideration to decrease anxiety in the process of infertility treatment and in case
of failure of the treatment is not only to prepare patients for the infertility treatment
process and for the probability of failure of the treatment but also to help them cope
effectively with the treatment and its outcome.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p> In the present study, no difference was found between the groups in terms of positive
coping methods such as the self-confidence approach, optimistic approach, and social
support-seeking approach. No significant difference was found between the pre-treatment
mean scores of the women in the two groups, whereas there was a statistically significant
difference between the groups after ET and during the first-month follow-up. It was also
revealed that the care group used positive coping methods more. Expression of emotions,
problem solving, teaching-learning, and help&#x02013;confidence relationship found in the
improvement processes of the theory of human caring could be influential on women&#x02019;s
positive coping.</p><p> In this study, no difference was found between the groups with respect to such
ineffective coping methods applied by the women as unconfident and submissive approaches.
Although no significant difference was found between the pre-treatment mean scores of the
women in the two groups, there was a statistically significant difference between the
groups after ET and during the first-month follow-up.</p><p> It was also seen that the care group used effective coping methods more. The
help-confidence relationship in theory of human caring improvement processes, expression
of emotions, problem solving and teaching-learning could be said to be influential on
increasing women&#x02019;s use of effective coping methods.</p><p> In the relevant literature, it has been reported that the nursing crisis prevention
program based on cognitive behavioral hostility, relaxation exercises, and providing
information to infertile women had positive influence on women&#x02019;s psychosocial
responses.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> It has been reported
that before treatment of infertility, the psychological support given helps infertile
couples cope with depression.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Based on
the results of relevant studies, in the process of infertility treatment, infertile
women&#x02019;s needs for psychological support increase.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> It was found that attempts
made in line with this needs are effective for coping.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> In addition to interviews
planned in accordance with the needs of the women whose infertility treatment resulted in
failure, other interviews were also planned based on connection via phone or on visits to
the clinic.</p><p> During these interviews, the nursing approaches of teaching-learning, belief-hope
development, problem solving, expression of emotions, help-confidence relationship, and
human-needs assistance found in theory of human caring improvement processes were used.
The results of this study revealed that in cases of the failure of the treatment process,
which is one of the most important problems on the agenda of infertile nursing, it is
important to focus on attempts that will not only decrease women&#x02019;s anxiety levels and the
effects of infertility and also to increase women&#x02019;s use of positive coping methods. The
results obtained also demonstrated that nursing approaches applied based on the theory of
human caring are quite influential on women&#x02019;s levels of anxiety, negative feelings and
stress.</p><p> This study has several limitations. First, in the studies on infertility, using
suggestions put forward based on evidence, couples applying for treatment should be
evaluated together.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In this study,
because males do not regularly continue their treatment, the husbands were not included in
the research design. The second is the small number of infertile women within treatment
fails each group, which may hinder understanding the effects of the intervention in each
group. The third limitation, the key limitation of this study, is the nature of the
research. It was thought that women whose treatment would start a month later should be
involved in the study and that their follow-ups should be done a month later to avoid any
loss. The study was limited with respect to examination of the effects of the caring
results by maintaining longer-term follow-ups for the women for whom caring was continued
after treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> The intervention and control groups significantly differed in anxiety, distress and coping
levels. The intervention group&#x02019;s mean anxiety score decreased by thirteen points and
distress by fourteen points (in a positive direction). The intervention group&#x02019;s mean
positive coping style score increased. Whereas a negative increase was observed in the
control group&#x02019;s values depending on the failure of the treatment.</p><p> In this study, examining the influence of use of theory of human caring on infertile women
whose infertility treatment results in failure not only provides these women with high
quality nursing care, but also provides nurses working in IVF centers with good guidance.
The Watson theory of human caring provides a holistic viewpoint for the nursing care in
infertility treatment. The present study contributed to the development of theory of human
caring, to the application of the theory-based nursing care as well as to the science of
nursing.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> Many thanks to the staff in Diyarbak&#x00131;r Veni-Vidi IVF Center and to all the infertile women
