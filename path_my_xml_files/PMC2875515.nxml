Although conditions other than infections can trigger a state of hyperinflammation, sepsis requires special attention since even with current treatments it is often associated with very high mortality. Between the years 1979 and 2000, total sepsis-related mortality in the United States rose from 22 to 44 per 100,000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], accounting for 9% of the overall annual mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] with an enormous economic cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Septic patients receive the bulk of their nutrition by the parenteral route. Recently there has been increased interest in the lipid component of parenteral nutrition with the realisation that this not only supplies energy and essential building blocks, but may also provide molecules (that is, fatty acids) that are bioactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Traditionally used lipid emulsions are based solely upon soybean oil, which is rich in the n-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, or a 50:50 mix of vegetable oil rich in medium-chain saturated fatty acids and soybean oil (often termed MCT/LCT to indicate the mixture of medium chain and long chain triglycerides). More recently fish oil, which contains very long chain n-3 fatty acids, has been introduced into some lipid emulsions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The rationale is partly that n-3 fatty acids act to reduce inflammatory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which may be promoted by an excessive or unbalanced supply of n-6 fatty acids. Compared with n-6 fatty acid rich vegetable oil, fish oil reduces the metabolic signs of endotoxemia in experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and lowers plasma cytokine concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and improves survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Fish oil containing parenteral nutrition has been used in surgical patients demonstrating possible improvements in immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and reduced inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] which have been linked to a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However there are few studies of fish oil containing lipid emulsions in septic patients in the ICU. Tappy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] demonstrated that parenteral fish oil is well tolerated and has only limited metabolic effects in critically ill patients, while Antebi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] showed that the use of fish oil in ICU patients requiring total parenteral nutrition may be associated with better liver function and improved antioxidant status. In two studies, Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] reported diminished inflammation, including reduced TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 production by cultured monocytes, in septic patients receiving a soybean oil-fish oil mix compared to those receiving soybean oil alone. These two studies did not report any clinical outcomes. Heller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] reported a dose-response effect of parenteral fish oil on antibiotic demand, length of hospital stay and mortality in critically ill patients. However, this latter study was not controlled. Recently, Friesecke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that use of a mixed MCT/LCT/fish oil lipid emulsion in critically ill ICU patients had no effect on inflammatory markers, or on clinical outcomes including infections, ventilation requirement, or ICU or hospital stay compared with MCT/LCT. In contrast, use of fish oil in parenteral nutrition in severe pancreatitis patients resulted in a decreased inflammatory response, improved respiratory function and shortened Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, there is only limited, and contradictory, information on the influence of fish oil containing parenteral nutrition in septic ICU patients on markers of inflammation and on clinical endpoints. However, studies of enteral nutrition providing fish oil, in addition to other potentially active ingredients, have demonstrated reduced inflammation, improved gas exchange and improved clinical outcome in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and/or acute lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>This study was designed to investigate the potential benefits of using a parenteral lipid emulsion that includes fish oil in septic patients in the ICU. The outcomes were plasma phospholipid fatty acid profile, inflammatory mediators in plasma and produced by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated whole blood, routine biochemical and physiological markers, gas exchange and clinical outcomes. It was hypothesised that inclusion of fish oil would increase the n-3 fatty acid content of plasma phospholipids, would decrease circulating inflammatory cytokine concentrations and would reduce length of ICU and hospital stay.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, single blinded investigation of a parenteral lipid emulsion that contained fish oil in comparison with one that did not in patients admitted to a medical ICU with diagnosed sepsis. Patients were recruited from the ICU of Hospital Padre Am&#x000e9;rico, Penafiel, Portugal. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee <italic>Comiss&#x000e3;o de &#x000c9;tica para a Sa&#x000fa;de </italic>from Hospital Padre Am&#x000e9;rico and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient's closest relative.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Twenty-five patients with diagnosed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and who were predicted to need parenteral nutrition (severe pancreatitis, multiorgan failure, excisional surgery) were recruited at the time of admission to the ICU. Patients were recruited between March and December 2007. Sepsis was defined as suspected or proven infection plus SIRS (that is, presence of pyrexia, tachycardia, tachypnea and/or leukocytosis). Severe sepsis was defined as sepsis with organ dysfunction (hypotension, hypoxemia, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, and/or thrombocytopenia). Septic shock was defined as severe sepsis with hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Once identified as eligible to enter the study, patients were randomized by a sealed envelope to receive either a 50:50 (vol/vol) mixture of an oil rich in medium-chain fatty acids and soybean oil (termed MCT/LCT) (provided as a component of Nutriflex LipidSpecial<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, B. Braun, Barcarena, Portugal) or a 50:40:10 (vol/vol/vol) mixture of an oil rich in medium-chain fatty acids, soybean oil and fish oil (termed fish oil) (provided as Lipolus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, B. Braun, Portugal). The principal differences are the presence of the long chain n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) in the fish oil containing emulsion where they contribute about 3.6% of fatty acids (2.5% of fatty acids as EPA and 1.1% of fatty acids as DHA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Nutriflex LipidSpecial is the routine means for supplying parenteral nutrition in Hospital Padre Am&#x000e9;rico ICU. Nutriflex LipidSpecial provides lipid (MCT/LCT emulsion), glucose and amino acids via a 1.25 liter three chamber bag. Lipoplus (250 ml) was added into 1 liter Nutriflex Special<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(B. Braun, Portugal) two chamber bags that provided glucose and amino acids. Nutriflex LipidSpecial had a lower glucose content than Nutriflex Special containing Lipoplus (144 g/l vs. 195 g/l), while the amino acid content was similar (57.4 g/l vs. 56 g/l). The amount of lipid contained within the final mixture was the same in both groups (40 g/l). Dipeptiven<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(Fresenius-Kabi, Carnaxide, Portugal) (50 ml/1250 ml bag) was included in both regimens. Both groups received electrolytes and vitamins.</p><p>Two of the 25 patients recruited did not start on parenteral nutrition and so are excluded from the study. Characteristics of the 23 patients who started on parenteral nutrition in the two groups are summarised in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. From the 23 patients analysed, 13 received fish oil and 10 received MCT/LCT. Parenteral nutrition was administrated continuously over 24 hours, starting on the day after admission when the patient was hemodynamically stable, or if not, as soon as possible (Day 1 is defined as when parenteral nutrition was started). Blood samples were collected on admission, immediately prior to starting parenteral nutrition (that is, Day 1), 24 h after initiating parenteral nutrition (Day 2) and five days after initiating parenteral nutrition (Day 6). Blood was collected between 08:30 to 9:00 hours via an arterial line into ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or lithium heparin.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the patients in the two treatment groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td align="center"><bold>Fish oil group (n = 13)</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>MCT/LCT group (n = 10)</bold></td></tr><tr><td/><td colspan="2"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age range (years)</td><td align="center">54 to 80</td><td align="center">32 to 79</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Age (years)</td><td align="center">70 &#x000b1; 2*</td><td align="center">57 &#x000b1; 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex: male/female (n)</td><td align="center">5/8</td><td align="center">4/6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Height (m)</td><td align="center">1.59 &#x000b1; 0.1</td><td align="center">1.63 &#x000b1; 0.06</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center">73.3 &#x000b1; 18.01</td><td align="center">76.8 &#x000b1; 21.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center">28.9 &#x000b1; 1.7</td><td align="center">28.5 &#x000b1; 2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Admitted from: Operating theatre/Emergency/Ward (n)</td><td align="center">9/3/1</td><td align="center">6/3/1</td></tr><tr><td align="left">SAPS II</td><td align="center">47.5 &#x000b1; 5</td><td align="center">41.6 &#x000b1; 6.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sequential organ failure assessment score</td><td align="center">9.5 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td align="center">8.9 &#x000b1; 1.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Primary diagnosis: Sepsis/Severe sepsis/Septic shock (n)</td><td align="center">8/4/1</td><td align="center">5/2/3</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Secondary Diagnosis: Cardiovascular/Respiratory/Renal/Gastric/Mental/Metabolic (n)</td><td align="center">9/1/1/2/0/0</td><td align="center">7/0/2/2/2/1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are shown for patients who received parenteral nutrition (n = 23).</p><p>SAPS - Simplified Acute Physiology Score; *<italic>P </italic>= 0.019 vs. MCT/LCT</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Enteral nutrition was initiated as soon as possible, but for all patients this was beyond Day 6; enteral feeding was initiated as a mixed regimen with parenteral nutrition which used the same lipid emulsion as had been used for the study duration.

The control group received a 50:50 mix of MCT and soybean oil. This is the first study of this fish oil containing lipid emulsion (that is, Lipoplus) in septic patients in the ICU, although it has been used previously in post-surgery patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In these latter patients, Lipoplus was found to decrease production or concentration of inflammatory eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and to reduce length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A different fish oil containing lipid emulsion (Omegaven) has also been used in post-surgery patients where it decreased production or concentration of inflammatory eicosanoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], improved immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Omegaven has also been used in septic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], in critically ill ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and in patients with severe acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In some of these studies, use of Omegaven was associated with decreased inflammatory markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and improved respiratory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Heller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] used Omegaven in a heterogeneous group of patients including post-surgical, septic and trauma patients and identified a dose-dependent reduction in mortality predicted from SAPS II score at entry. However, a recent study reported no effect of parenteral nutrition including Omegaven on inflammatory markers, or on clinical outcomes including infections, ventilation requirement, or ICU or hospital stay in critically ill ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The current study found that five-day infusion of a MCT, soybean oil, fish oil mixture providing 6.4 g fish oil/day (equivalent to 2.3 g EPA plus DHA/d), increased EPA in the plasma phospholipid PC by an average of 3.8-fold, with no significant effect on DHA content and that this was associated with improved gas exchange and a tendency towards a shorter length of hospital stay. These are important findings since they indicate that the use of such an emulsion in this group of patients will improve clinical outcomes in comparison with what is seen with the more standard mix of MCT and soybean oil.</p><p>The increase in EPA content of PC is consistent with the recent report of a 2.4-fold increase in EPA in plasma phospholipids in healthy subjects receiving this same emulsion over a period of five days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Likewise the lack of a significant change in either in DHA or arachidonic acid in plasma PC seen in the current study is consistent with what is reported by Simoens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These observations would suggest that any clinical benefit seen from the emulsion is due to EPA rather than DHA.</p><p>The tendency towards a reduction in length of hospital stay seen here (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>) was not a result of shorter ICU stay, and is consistent with findings in post-surgery patients receiving parenteral fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A previous study using a different lipid emulsion in ICU patients reports reduced ICU stay with higher fish oil administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] but this study was not controlled and relied upon historical data for comparison. Thus, this is the first randomised, controlled study reporting reduced length of hospital stay in septic ICU patients as a result of use of a fish oil containing lipid emulsion. The average dose of fish oil administered in the current study (6.4 g/day or 0.09 g/kg/d) is consistent with the dose that Heller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] found to be clinically favourable (&#x0003e;0.1 g/kg/d).</p><p>The current study identified a benefit of parenteral fish oil on gas exchange (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). This is consistent with the recent report by Wang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] using parenteral fish oil in severe acute pancreatitis patients and with findings in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients receiving enteral fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The mechanism by which n-3 fatty acids improve respiratory function is not entirely clear, but recent work in the fat-1 mouse, which endogenously synthesizes n-3 fatty acids from dietary n-6 fatty acids, provides new information on this [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. When exposed to LPS intratracheally, fat-1 mice showed reduced leukocyte invasion, protein leakage and inflammatory mediator (thromboxane B2, macrophage inflammatory protein-2) levels in lavage fluid compared with wild type mice. Furthermore ventilator compliance was improved in the fat-1 mice. This study shows a close link between anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 fatty acids, in this case seen at the level of the lung, and improved respiratory function.</p><p>Patients receiving parenteral fish oil showed more of a marked reduction in plasma IL-6 concentration than those in the MCT/LCT group and they also showed a smaller reduction in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. These findings concur with observations in post-surgery patients where plasma IL-6 concentrations were lower with parenteral fish oil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. These changes in plasma inflammatory markers may be part of the mechanism that explains the clinical benefits seen in this study. Differences in plasma TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; concentrations between the two groups were small, although significant.</p><p>In contrast to the effects on some plasma cytokines, parenteral fish oil did not affect LPS-stimulated production of inflammatory mediators from whole blood cultures. This contrasts with the observation of Mayer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] in septic ICU patients that LPS-stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-8) by purified monocytes was lower in the fish oil group. However, the amount of fish oil and n-3 fatty acids used by Mayer et al. was much greater than the amount used in the current study (35 vs. 6.4 g fish oil/d; approximately 10 vs. 2.3 g EPA plus DHA/d). This may explain the difference in findings between the two studies.</p><p>In the current study the whole blood cultures responded well to LPS stimulation: the response to LPS increased with time in both groups. This is consistent with the recent observations of Kirchhoff et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] who showed increased numbers of cytokine-positive monocytes following LPS stimulation of whole blood taken from patients with severe multiple injuries over the period 24 to 72 hours post-admission. Likewise, Heidecke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] demonstrated that in sepsis survivors there is an increase in LPS-stimulated production of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10 by monocytes over time. This recovery in cellular response appears to be associated with improved clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The observation that a poor inflammatory response of cultured cells taken early in sepsis is associated with poor patient outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] seems to conflict with the many observations that a poor outcome is associated with higher concentrations of inflammatory cytokines in the circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus there seems to be a miss-match between circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations which are elevated early in sepsis and the ability of leukocytes to produce pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines which is impaired early in sepsis. Indeed, the current study indicates that, as plasma cytokine concentrations decline over time, the ability of leukocytes to produce those same cytokines when stimulated with LPS ex vivo increases. This seemingly paradoxical observation may be explained by considering the regulatory processes that occur to control inflammatory cytokine release. A strong inflammatory stimulus in vivo will lead to inflammatory cytokine production with an elevation in plasma cytokine concentrations. However, this will lead to negative feedback, for example inhibition of monocyte nuclear factor &#x003ba;B activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, upon restimulation ex vivo, the monocytes are less responsive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Hence monocytes isolated from blood at a time when there is a high concentration of cytokines may show a low cytokine response when stimulated and vice versa.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory properties of n-3 fatty acids have been described and discussed in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The mechanisms involved include effects at the membrane level, on signal transduction pathways leading to transcription factor activation and altered patterns of gene expression, and on the pattern of lipid mediator generation. The discovery of resolvins generated from both EPA and DHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] has focussed attention on resolution of inflammation as a mechanism of action of n-3 fatty acids and on the differential effects of EPA and DHA on inflammatory processes. In the current study status of EPA, but not DHA, was increased in plasma PC, suggesting that the effects seen are due to EPA. EPA has been shown to decrease production of inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines [see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]] and is the precursor of inflammation resolving resolvin E1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Thus EPA may exert effects on both the generation of inflammatory mediators and on the resolution of inflammatory processes.</p><p>Whatever the mechanism(s) involved, this study demonstrates that a parenteral nutrition regimen including fish oil at the level used here does not impair the recovery of the ex vivo response of monocytes, but enhances the reduction in plasma IL-6 and diminishes the reduction in plasma IL-10 concentrations seen in the control group. Given that poor outcome is associated both with high plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and with impaired ex vivo monocyte responses to LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], the overall effects of fish oil seen in the current study appear to be of benefit.</p><p>Limitations of this study are its relatively small sample size, the difference in age between the two treatment groups (the average age of patients in the fish oil group was higher than in the MCT/LCT group), and the higher glucose supply in the fish oil group. However, despite the small sample size, significant effects on plasma phospholipid EPA content, plasma cytokines, and gas exchange parameters were observed. In order to account for the differences in age and glucose supply between the two groups, these were controlled for in statistical analysis of cytokines, gas exchange parameters and clinical outcomes. Even after accounting for the differences in age and glucose supply between the groups, effects of lipid emulsion on plasma cytokines and on gas exchange parameters remained significant and the trend for an effect on length of hospital stay was not altered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Inclusion of fish oil in parenteral nutrition provided to septic ICU patients increases plasma EPA status and this is associated with more marked changes in some cytokines in plasma, improved gas exchange and a trend towards reduced length of hospital stay.</p></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><p>&#x02022; Including fish oil in the parenteral nutrition regimen received by septic ICU patients modified plasma IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations.</p><p>&#x02022; Parenteral fish oil improved gas exchange in septic ICU patients.</p><p>&#x02022; Parenteral fish oil decreased length of hospital stay in septic ICU patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ALT: Alanine transaminase; AST: Aspartate transaminase; CRP: C-reactive protein; DHA: docosahexaenoic acid; EPA: eicosapentaenoic acid; FiO<sub>2</sub>: fraction of inspired oxygen; GGT: &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase; ICU: intensive care unit; IL: interleukin; LCT: soybean oil; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LT: leukotriene; MCT: a triglyceride rich in medium-chain fatty acids; PC: phosphatidylcholine; PCO<sub>2</sub>: partial pressure of carbon dioxide; PEEP: positive end-expiratory pressure; PG: prostaglandin; PO<sub>2</sub>: partial pressure of oxygen; PO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>: ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen; SAPS: simplified acute physiology score; SIRS: systemic inflammatory response syndrome; TNF: tumor necrosis factor</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PCC has received speaking honoraria from B.
