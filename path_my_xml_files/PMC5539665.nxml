This disease affects 2%&#x02013;3% of the total population. The disease is common in the third and fourth decades of life and men are affected 3&#x02013;5 times more than women and 50% of the patients relapse within 5 years after treatment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Staghorn kidney stones are the ones which occupy a big portion of the urinary collective system, and it typically encompasses the pelvis and splits in all or some calyces. Awaiting treatment in these stones results in kidney damage. In addition, the kidney stones more than 2 cm are not suitable for extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PCNL) is the treatment of choice for these types of stones.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>First and foremost phase in PCNL is creating an access from skin to the kidney. Access dilation is done by different methods under C-arm guide.

During this stage, vascular, and parenchymal damage can cause severe bleeding during surgery or after operation. In addition, creating access is done under C-arm and exposure to X-ray is important both for patients and physicians.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The aim of this study is comparison the two methods for access dilation one shot and sequential method about the time of creating access and thus the time of radiation exposure and the decrease of hemoglobin (Hb) during the operation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This observational cross-sectional study was conducted from 2012 to 2013 in Isfahan Al Zahra Hospital.

PCNL in both groups was performed with general anesthesia. In both groups, after insertion a ureteral stent the patients were placed in prone position and with an injection of contrast media under C-arm the system was punctured with appropriate calyces and a guide wire was placed in the system. In the first group, the access was gradually dilated up to 28 Fr using metal telescopic dilators. In the second group, the access was dilated with an Amplatz dilator to 28 Fr in one shot. In both groups, after access dilation, an Amplatz sheath was inserted into the collecting system under the guide of C-arm. Then with a rigid nephroscope and pneumatic probe the stone was crushed and removed by forceps. At the end of the procedure, an 18 Fr nephrostomy tube was put in the system, and nephrostography was done under C-arm to ensure extravasations and collecting system injuries. After 48 h, nephrostomy tube was removed and if there was no problem the patient was discharged.</p><p>The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

The aim of this study was to compare the complication and efficacy of two methods which are used for access dilation in PCNL. Blood loss is one the most important and most prevalent complication in this surgery. The main etiology for hemorrhage is access dilation which can be done with different methods. In Faas <italic>et al</italic>. 4% of the patients whom underwent PCNL, required blood transfusion and blood transfusion during the operation were reported as almost 5%&#x02013;12%.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In Davis <italic>et al</italic>. blood transfusion has been almost 14% without complications. The decrease in Hb level was in average 2.8 g/dl in patients treated with one-shot method.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In Salonia <italic>et al</italic>. blood transfusion has been reduced up to 7% after PCNL.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] According to national and international surveys, the required amount of blood transfusion in PCNL has been reported 5%&#x02013;12%. Abbou <italic>et al</italic>. used metal telescopic dilatator and they reported no more blood loss with this technique in comparison to one shot.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In other study by Corbel <italic>et al</italic>., 9% of the patients required transfusion.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Also in Amjadi <italic>et al</italic>. the decrease in Hb concentration in two methods of one shot and telescoping had not significant difference.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In this study, the decrease in Hb level was similar in two groups, and therefore both methods for access dilation were safe, and there was not a difference in blood loss during PCNL in two groups. In addition, the other complications such as urinary extravasations because of collecting system injury, leak of urine after nephrostomy tube removal from the nephrostomy site were identical. One of the major concerns is radiation exposure during PCNL under fluoroscopic guide and fluoroscopy time should be as low as possible. Fluoroscopic screening time (FST) in PCNL is a critical factor in radiation exposure.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In this study, the amount of radiation received in telescoping method was significantly more than one-shot method. Thus, one-shot method is safer than telescoping method because of less exposure to X-ray for patient and surgeon. Features that can effect on FST are having a large stone and several accesses. The amount of radiation exposure will reduce with the use of protective such as lead drapes (lead coating), protective goggles, protective collars, thick lead gown (5 mm), and lead gloves.</p><p>According to the results of this study and comparison with other studies, PCNL with one-shot method is superior to metal telescoping method due to less time need for access dilation and less exposure to radiation, while this approach was not associated with more decrease in Hb level and other complication.</p><p>In this study, we focused on radiation exposure in one shot and telescoping dilation. It is a good idea to compare these methods in more details in future, but the limitations of our study can be possible laboratory errors or the differences between the patients&#x02019; body mass index, anatomy and the stone size that may effect on bleeding or radiation exposure. Although the mentioned factors may have not very important impacts, we have tried to eliminate their effects by the large sample size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both one shot and telescoping methods for access dilation in PCNL are eligible. However, we prefer one-shot method, when possible, because of less radiation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Isfahan University of Medical Sciences</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mani</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhalchondra</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>PC</given-names></name><name><surname>Retik</surname><given-names>AB</given-names></name><name><surname>Stamey</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Vaughan</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Urinary lithiasis</article-title><source>Campbell's Urology</source><year>1988</year><volume>3</volume><issue>Ch. 91</issue><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>W.B.
