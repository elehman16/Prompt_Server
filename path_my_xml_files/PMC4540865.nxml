a positive influence on upper extremity performance in stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups:
motor imagery (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 12). Over the
course of 4 weeks, the motor imagery group participated in 30 minutes of motor imagery
training on each of the 18 tasks (9 hours total) related to their daily living activities.
After the 4-week intervention period, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity outcomes
and Wolf Motor Function Test outcomes were compared. [Results] The post-test score of the
motor imagery group on the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity outcomes was
significantly higher than that of the control group. In particular, the shoulder and wrist
sub-items demonstrated improvement in the motor imagery group. [Conclusion] Motor imagery
training has a positive influence on upper extremity performance by improving functional
mobility during stroke rehabilitation. These results suggest that motor imagery training
is feasible and beneficial for improving upper extremity function in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Motor imagery training</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity performance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 85% of patients who experience a stroke have a residual upper extremity (UE)
disability, and 55&#x02013;75% experience UE deficits that directly affect their quality of life
that directly affects their quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients commonly use the unaffected UE for performing daily
living activities and avoid using the affected side; this leads to decreased UE muscle
strength and movement and increased stiffness and can greatly affect independence in daily
life<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recovery of UE function is
important for effective rehabilitation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>,
and the plasticity of neural networks is vital to recover damaged motor functions or acquire
new motor functions. The plasticity of networks in the brain is extremely important, as it
is the basis for recovery of cognitive function and motor learning<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Motor imagery (MI) is a conscious process that induces muscle activity related to an actual
motor output by creating a mental image of the action without the intent of performing
it<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a cognitive method, which
instead of forcing a patient to learn new techniques, causes neural changes in order to
re-obtain motor techniques learned before the stroke damage or imitate the actions of
others<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, in this study, chronic stroke patients were monitored and examined to test the
effect of MI on rehabilitation of UE function and brain activation. Motor imagery training
(MIT) was designed to maximally activate the mirror neuron network during 18 specific daily
activities. The study hypothesis was that MIT would provide sensory feedback and lead to
improvement of UE function in patients recovering from a stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-four first-time stroke survivors were included in this study. The inclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) 6&#x02013;12 months since stroke onset, (2) Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) score &#x0003e;24 points, and (3) able to sit independently for &#x0003e;30 minutes. Exclusion
criteria were as follows: (1) severe cognitive disability such as unilateral neglect,
dementia, depression, or seizure and (2) any musculoskeletal disorder including muscle
contracture or limitation of joint motion. Prior to study initiation, the objectives and
requirements were explained to all participants, who signed a written informed consent form.
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee (KyungHee University Medical Center
Institutional Review Board, KOMCIRB-2013-050).</p><p>All participants underwent an evaluation of UE function at the start of the study.
Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to either the MI or the control group. The
following clinical measures were used for assessing UE performance: Fugl-Meyer
Assessment-Upper Extremity component (FMA-UE) and Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT).</p><p>Participants in both groups completed their training in 30-minute sessions, 3 times per
week, for 4 weeks. In addition, both groups received conventional physical therapy in
30-minute sessions, 5 times per week, for 4 weeks. The MI group was comprised 4 males and 8
females; of these 4 were right hemiplegic and 8 were left hemiplegic. The mean patient age
was 64.2&#x02005;years, mean height was 160.2&#x02005;cm, and mean weight was 57.3&#x02005;kg. The mean duration
after stroke onset was 8.1 months, and the average MMSE score was 28.0. The control group
was comprised 5 males and 7 females; of these 6 were right hemiplegic and 6 were left
hemiplegic. The mean patient age was 59.4&#x02005;years, mean height was 162.8&#x02005;cm, and mean weight
was 62.9&#x02005;kg. The mean duration after stroke onset was 8.5 months, and the average MMSE score
was 28.3. There were no significant differences between the groups at the onset of the
study.</p><p>Each participant in the MI group was asked to sit comfortably in a chair and imagine a task
by following an MI program that was played using computer monitor and speakers. The
participants performed 18 different tasks related to daily living; the tasks involved
imagining the sequence of movements that should be performed using their hands. The tasks
included drinking water from a cup, setting a seal, turning pages of a book, plugging a cord
into an outlet, brushing their teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste using both hands,
sorting chopsticks and spoons and putting them in a box, folding a towel, tearing off and
folding a piece of toilet paper, making a phone call, placing a card in their wallet,
changing batteries, opening and closing a zipper wallet, using scissors, spraying water with
a spray bottle, turning a faucet on and off, opening and closing a square airtight
container, opening a bottle top, and tightening shoelaces. To complete the MI exercise used
in this study, participants were asked to imagine the normal motion of their non-paralyzed
UE from an external perspective in order to mobilize visual imagery of their own motion to
call upon internal sensory information and kinematic imagery and various other sensory
details during the imagined motion of their non-paralyzed side. In order to confirm that the
subject was concentrating during the MI exercise, he or she was asked corresponding
questions every 5 minutes during the exercise. During each 30-minute session, MI was
conducted for 20 minutes following which the participants underwent physical training for
the final 10 minutes<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The UE performance of each participant was evaluated using the FMA-UE and WMFT<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FMA is used to measure voluntary limb
movement. It includes a UE subscale (33 items; score range 0&#x02013;66) and a lower extremity (LE)
subscale (17 items; score range 0&#x02013;34) for a total score of 100<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study,
the shoulder, wrist, hand, and coordination sub-items were used.</p><p>The WMFT is a quantitative index of UE motor ability and is measured using timed and
functional tasks. The WMFT has been posited as being useful for assessing the motor status
of higher-functioning chronic patients with stroke and traumatic brain injury in terms of
severity and UE motor deficiency. The inter-test and inter-rater reliability, internal
consistency, and stability of the test are excellent for both the performance time and
functional ability rating scale measures (ranging from 0.88 to 0.98, with most values close
to 0.95)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPSS 18.0 program (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the distribution of general participant
characteristics and outcome measures. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed rank tests were
used for comparison of pre-test and post-test UE performance changes within each group, and
an independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to compare the two groups. A
p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the MI group, the average FMA-UE score changed from 27.92 to 36.08 between pre- and

sensations from a psychological representation of action without the intent to perform that
action<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known to induce
activation in brain areas and muscles similar to those involved in actual task performance.
In addition, it mediates and accelerates learning of physical activities and changes in
motor function; many studies have demonstrated the neurophysiological basis of MI exercises.
Stippich<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> observed localized
stimulation of the precentral gyrus along the known somatotopic map when participants
imagined moving different body parts such as the foot, hand, or tongue. Ehrsson<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> observed the activation of corresponding
areas within the primary motor cortex along the somatotopic map when participants imagined
the movement of fingers, toes, and tongue. In the current study, a significant increase in
FMA-UE score from 27.92 to 36.08 (8.17 points) was observed after MIT, during which the
patients were asked to imagine 18 different daily living activities.</p><p>The shoulder, wrist, and hand scores of the FMA-UE were notably increased after the
training. Thus, activities of daily living such as folding a towel, using scissors, opening
and closing a square airtight container, using a wallet, plugging a cord into an outlet, and
sorting chopsticks and spoons and putting them in a box appear to improve strength in the
muscles surrounding the shoulder, wrist, and hand. WMFT scores for the MI group also changed
significantly, from 44.75 to 51.00 (an increase of 6.25 points). Franceschini et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that a focused and repetitive
task-oriented approach can restore UE function.</p><p>The MIT exercise used in this study involved repeatedly imagining a familiar motion and
then imitating the motion with a therapist, leading to an improvement in UE performance and
improvement in activities of daily living. Celnik et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that the daily task performance ability of 15 brain-injured
patients increased as a result of conducting imitation exercises after watching a clip of a
kitchen task such as opening and closing a refrigerator. The present study used an imagery
exercise instead of an action-observation training exercise, and the effectiveness was found
to be similar to results from the pilot study. The MIT used in the current study involved
actions frequently used in daily living activities; thus, when coupled with the use of
familiar objects to help trigger motivation through environmental cues relevant to the
patient&#x02019;s life, MIT can help to advance UE rehabilitation. Furthermore, MIT can improve the
degree of UE motor performance in daily life as well as the patient&#x02019;s functional abilities.
It has been shown that the motor system of the brain becomes more active with increased
similarity between an observed and performed motion<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, when performing goal-oriented rather than simple motions<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
and when observing motion rather than a static image<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that rehabilitation with MIT combined with physical
training improves recovery in stroke patients. The FMA-UE improvement was significantly
higher in the MI group compared to the control group. In particular, the FMA-UE shoulder and
wrist sub-items improved in the motor imagery group. Thus, MIT has a positive influence on
UE performance by improving functional mobility in patients who have experienced a stroke.
These results suggest that MIT is feasible and beneficial for improving UE function in
stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Winstein</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>EXCITE Investigators: <article-title>Effect of constraint-induced movement
