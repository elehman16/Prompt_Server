Following significant improvements in the treatment of CRC as a result of advances in systemic chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], use of agents targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) now also have an established role in patients with metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the EGFR. Its clinical efficacy in metastatic CRC (mCRC) was confirmed in an open-label, phase 3 trial, in which patients receiving panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) had significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with those receiving BSC alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 0.66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] in patients with chemotherapy-refractory mCRC. Mutations in <italic>KRAS</italic>&#x02014;a gene encoding a GTPase that mediates downstream intracellular EGFR signaling&#x02014;are found in approximately 35&#x02013;45% of CRC tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and have been associated with a lack of response to EGFR inhibitors when used for mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Evaluation of the predictive role of <italic>KRAS</italic> mutational status in the response to panitumumab in this phase 3 monotherapy study identified that its beneficial effect was restricted to patients whose tumors had wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic>. In patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC, panitumumab plus BSC was associated with a statistically significant improvement in median PFS compared with BSC alone (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34&#x02013;0.59 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). In mCRC, the clinical use of panitumumab (like cetuximab) is therefore now restricted to patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> tumors. Despite recent advances in the treatment of mCRC provided by targeted agents, most patients will eventually die of the disease. The goal of therapy in this setting is, therefore, to delay disease progression, control symptoms, and maintain health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for as long as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. As such, patient-reported outcomes are particularly important to patients with metastatic disease, and the potential for benefit related to these outcomes is a key consideration in the choice of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>During the phase 3 trial of panitumumab monotherapy, HRQoL and CRC symptom data were collected. Patient-reported outcomes from the trial were briefly reported in the primary efficacy paper but only for the overall patient population and not by <italic>KRAS</italic> tumor status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] (online appendix only). Since panitumumab is only indicated for patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> tumor status, the available patient-reported outcomes data do not, therefore, reflect the findings for the population for whom treatment with panitumumab is appropriate. In addition, there was a large amount of missing patient-reported outcome data that was unlikely to be missing at random: as expected for patients with advanced refractory disease, more than 50% of patients in the BSC alone arm and <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant patients in panitumumab plus BSC arm had progressed by week 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and thus missing data are likely to have been related to declining health. The last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) method used in the previous overall population analysis of HRQoL data is therefore a less-than-optimal approach to evaluate the true impact of panitumumab on patient-reported outcomes.</p><p>Using data from this phase 3 trial, we therefore sought to evaluate the impact of panitumumab on patient-reported outcomes according to <italic>KRAS</italic> tumor status and including statistical analyses aimed at properly accounting for the missing data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>The patient population and design for this phase 3, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;463) have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Briefly, patients with EGFR-detectable mCRC and documented evidence of disease progression after failure of fluoropyrimidines and prespecified exposure to oxaliplatin and irinotecan were randomly assigned to receive panitumumab 6&#x000a0;mg/kg plus BSC every 2&#x000a0;weeks or BSC alone. The primary endpoint of the study was PFS, with progression assessed by central radiologic review at specified time points from weeks 8 to 48, then every 3&#x000a0;months thereafter. The <italic>KRAS</italic> tumor status was evaluated in a prospectively defined, retrospective analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor sections in a blinded fashion, using a validated <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation kit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The study protocol was approved by the ethics board at each research center, and patients provided written informed consent, including that for research into the paraffin-embedded tumor samples provided at baseline. An independent clinical research organization (working on behalf of the study sponsor) monitored study centers in Central and Eastern Europe, and representatives of the study sponsor monitored study centers in the rest of world. Monitors were responsible for reviewing adherence to the protocol, compliance with Good Clinical Practice, and the completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patient-reported outcome instruments and data collection</title><p>Colorectal cancer symptoms were assessed using the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Colorectal Symptom Index (FCSI). The FCSI is a validated, nine-item questionnaire that addresses the most important symptoms associated with CRC, including fatigue, pain, weight loss, diarrhea, nausea, stomach swelling/cramps and appetite, and more general aspects of HRQoL such as ability to enjoy life and contentedness in quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Patients responded to each item of this questionnaire using a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Raw FCSI scores, which range from 0 to 36, were converted to total scores ranging from 0 (severely symptomatic in all symptoms assessed) to 100 (symptom-free for all symptoms assessed) using published scoring methodology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) was defined as a change in score of 3 points or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This instrument was administered at baseline and then every 2&#x000a0;weeks until disease progression.</p><p>Overall HRQoL was measured at baseline and monthly until disease progression using the EuroQol 5-Dimensions (EQ-5D) Index. The EQ-5D Index is a generic preference-based measure of overall QoL, as assessed across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain or discomfort, and anxiety or depression. Each dimension has three possible responses (no problems, moderate problems, or extreme problems). The EQ-5D Index score is calculated by combining scores from the five dimensions using population-based preference weights and ranges from &#x02212;0.594 to 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The MCID for the EQ-5D Index in patients with mCRC has been estimated as a change in score of 0.08 points or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary objective of this analysis was to estimate the average difference in effect of panitumumab plus BSC treatment compared with BSC alone on the FCSI and EQ-5D Index, both overall and for the wild-type and mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> subgroups. <italic>KRAS</italic> tumor status was ascertained in 92% of patients enrolled in the phase 3 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The analysis set was defined as all patients in the intent-to-treat population (all subjects who gave consent and were randomized) who had at least one post-baseline FCSI or EQ-5D Index assessment and an assessed <italic>KRAS</italic> status (&#x0201c;<italic>KRAS</italic> patient-reported outcome (PRO) analysis set&#x0201d;). Only outcomes obtained through week 17 of the study were used due to small sample sizes after week 17. Change in score from baseline was analyzed over time using linear mixed models for repeated measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The models included explanatory variables for study treatment arm, study week, and the interaction between treatment arm and study week. Each repeated measures model also included adjustments for baseline outcome score, baseline collection medium, baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, and geographic region. Treatment-specific estimates of the average change in each outcome score from baseline, along with 95% CI, were calculated for the overall cohort and for each <italic>KRAS</italic> subgroup using least-squares mean (LSM) differences.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of study attrition on the estimates of treatment differences, a sensitivity analysis was performed using pattern-mixture models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], which are linear models that incorporate information about missing data. For each endpoint, patients were first categorized according to the last week for which outcome data were collected up to week 17. These categories were then collapsed into larger groups of patients representing two general patterns of missing response data: those who dropped out of the study early (&#x0201c;early dropout&#x0201d;) and those who either dropped out later or completed all assessments up to week 17 (&#x0201c;late dropout/completer&#x0201d;). For the EQ-5D Index, we defined the &#x0201c;early dropout&#x0201d; group as those who dropped out on or before week 9 and the &#x0201c;late dropout/completer&#x0201d; group as those who dropped out after week 9 or did not drop out of the study early. To account for the more frequent assessments, FCSI &#x0201c;early dropout&#x0201d; group was defined as those who dropped out before week 9 and the &#x0201c;late dropout/completer&#x0201d; group as those who dropped out on or after week 9 or did not drop out.</p><p>Dropout status was incorporated into pattern-mixture models of change in score from baseline for each outcome. These models included fixed effects for treatment arm, study week, dropout pattern group, and interactions between these effects. The model included random effects to account for variability in outcome scores at baseline and over time among patients. Within each dropout group, treatment-specific LSM estimates of average change in each outcome score from baseline, along with 95% CI, were calculated for each <italic>KRAS</italic> subgroup and overall. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS for Linux, Version 9.1 (SAS Institute).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 463 patients randomly assigned to treatment in the main study, information on tumor <italic>KRAS</italic> status together with post-baseline patient-reported outcome data was available for 363 patients (<italic>KRAS</italic> PRO analysis set, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;188 panitumumab plus BSC; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;175 BSC alone), representing 78% of the overall study population.

For the FCSI scores, an average LSM difference between treatment groups across all weeks favored panitumumab by 3.60 (95% CI, 0.90 to 6.30) overall and 5.62 (95% CI, 2.38 to 8.86) for patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>).

In this analysis, patients treated with panitumumab showed significantly better control of CRC symptoms and maintenance of HRQoL compared with those who received BSC alone: this benefit was most evident among the subgroup of patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC and was not seen in patients with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC, or in those dropping out of the study early. This therefore illustrates, for the first time, the beneficial effects of panitumumab on HRQoL in patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC, the population for whom panitumumab treatment is indicated in clinical practice. Indeed, in those patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC treated with panitumumab who did not drop out of the study early, a decrease in CRC-related symptoms and an increase in HRQoL was observed by week 3 of the study. This is consistent with the finding that the beneficial effects of panitumumab on PFS are limited to patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and with previous analyses indicating that a lack of disease progression at week 8 provided by panitumumab was associated with better HRQoL and symptom control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For HRQoL and CRC symptoms, the benefits of panitumumab compared with BSC alone in patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC exceeded the established MCID levels, indicating that statistical differences were also clinically relevant. To our knowledge, our analyses are the first to illustrate the beneficial effects of an EGFR inhibitor on CRC-specific symptomatology, which is particularly important given that treatment of patients with mCRC is primarily given with palliative intent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The HRQoL of patients with advanced CRC treated with the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab, overall and by <italic>KRAS</italic> status, has also been published recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The findings were generally consistent with ours in that HRQoL benefits of cetuximab were observed and were most apparent in the subgroup of patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC. However, the results cannot be more closely compared, as the cetuximab analysis used data from the EORTC QLQ-C30, which includes cancer-related (but not CRC-specific) symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], whereas we chose to evaluate HRQoL and CRC-specific symptoms separately. In addition, in the study of Au et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], HRQoL data continued to be collected after disease progression. Inclusion of such data was not possible in our analysis since the study was designed to allow cross-over from BSC to panitumumab at this point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Taken together with those of the cetuximab analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], these HRQoL results may, however, contribute to a more accurate evaluation of the balance between the positive effects of EGFR inhibitors and the side effects associated with their use, such as skin toxicity, which are generally perceived to have a detrimental effect on HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the main study population of the phase 3 trial, skin toxicity occurred in 90% of patients in the panitumumab group compared with 9% of patients in the BSC group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and was more likely to develop in patients remaining on the study because of treatment benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Despite the association of skin toxicity with prolonged treatment, the benefits of panitumumab in terms of HRQoL and symptomatology were most apparent in the group of patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC who did not drop out of the study early in our analysis. Indeed, more severe skin toxicity in association with panitumumab has been associated with higher rather than lower HRQoL scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similar findings in relation to skin toxicity and HRQoL have also been observed with cetuximab and have been suggested to reflect an understanding by patients that skin rash is indicative of a response to therapy, which helps them cope with this side effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. As noted by Au et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], the presence of skin rash also introduces the potential for bias in the HRQoL results, since those patients experiencing it may have been more likely to report improvements if they were aware that the rash was a known predictor of benefit. However, this suggestion would be at odds with the fact that the benefits of panitumumab in terms of HRQoL were most prominent in patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC who were more likely to experience objective tumor control than those with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutant tumors, and these HRQoL benefits were not seen in patients with mutant <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC despite the fact that the vast majority of this subpopulation also developed skin rash.</p><p>Our results differ from the original protocol-specified analysis of HRQoL and CRC symptom control, which did not take into account <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status and which used the LOCF imputation method. This showed a numerical trend favoring panitumumab that did not reach statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The differences in outcome highlight both the importance of tumor <italic>KRAS</italic> status and the need to properly account for missing HRQoL data in trials of late-stage disease in which the reasons for missing observations are often related to deterioration in a patient&#x02019;s clinical status and so, cannot be classified as missing at random [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For a patient who has rapid disease progression and drops out of the study early, LOCF analysis is likely to impute values indicating better health than the true value, potentially biasing the comparison in favor of less effective or less well-tolerated treatment. An advantage to using the repeated-measures models (as in our analysis) is that imputation is not required. Pattern-mixture models provide even greater flexibility since the methodology provides a way to incorporate information about patient dropout into the longitudinal model.</p><p>Our sensitivity analyses showed that there were significantly fewer early dropouts for both the HRQoL and CRC symptom scales among the group receiving panitumumab than among the group receiving BSC alone. This disproportionate percentage of data by treatment group likely resulted from the higher rate of discontinuation due to death or disease progression in the BSC only treatment arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and it was important to account for these non-random missing data. Of note is that similar findings regarding disproportionate missing data were observed in the cetuximab analysis of Au et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] (although not to the same extent as there was an attempt to collect HRQoL data beyond disease progression), and similar approaches to account for missing data were included in their sensitivity analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the apparent lack of effect of panitumumab, in those patients (even with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC) who dropped out of the study early. Patients treated with panitumumab plus BSC who left the study early due to tolerability concerns or other reasons unrelated to disease progression may not have received enough treatment to yield an improvement in HRQoL or CRC symptoms. Alternatively, the treatment may not have been effective among a subgroup of patients, leading to relatively rapid progression of disease and early dropout.</p><p>A potential limitation of this study is that <italic>KRAS</italic> mutation status was determined retrospectively and therefore was not a stratification factor in the randomization. However, 92% of patients randomized had <italic>KRAS</italic> status available, and patients with <italic>KRAS</italic> mutations were well distributed between the two treatment groups. Although the <italic>post hoc</italic> nature of our exploratory analysis by <italic>KRAS</italic> status is a theoretical limitation, the comparison of baseline demographics suggests that, within the <italic>KRAS</italic> subgroups, patient characteristics were similar between the two treatment arms. Another potential limitation is the imperfect sensitivity and specificity of patient-reported outcome measures. However, our analysis used validated instruments, and our findings are supported by their consistency with the results of the primary study endpoint, PFS.</p><p>In conclusion, our analyses illustrate the clinically significant beneficial effects of panitumumab in terms of CRC-specific symptom control and maintenance of HRQoL in patients with wild-type <italic>KRAS</italic> mCRC, and these findings extend our understanding of the benefits of panitumumab treatment beyond improvements in PFS. These benefits were apparent despite skin toxicity associated with panitumumab treatment and provide important additional information for both patients and physicians when making treatment decisions for mCRC, particularly when the treatment intent is palliative.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the patients who participated in this trial and their families.
