Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage mainly due to tissue trauma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Post-operative pain is not avoidable in surgery. The treatment of post-operative pain results in real benefits to the patients and surgical units. Although pain has a purpose in the wider evolutionary sense, it is a largely inappropriate maladaptive response in the post-operative period, which is associated with stress and systemic complications that include pulmonary, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal ones.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Uncontrolled pain may cause struggling, crying, and restlessness and may result in hematoma formation and thereby delay wound healing. Adequate pain control leads to decreased manipulation of the surgical site and thus reduces swelling, hematoma formation, and infection.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Some of the analgesics are tested to pacify surgical pain namely anaesthetics and analgesic. Whereas others, to pacify post-operative pain and its complications. All these drugs are categorised under opioids, NSAIDs and other synthetic and semi synthetic groups. Most of them produce a potent analgesic action but none of them are devoid of their known systemic untoward effects and hence are used with certain limitations.</p><p>In the texts of Ayurveda a large number of drugs are mentioned under the heading <italic>vedanasth&#x00101;pana</italic> (~ analgesic), <italic>&#x0015b;othahara</italic> (anti inflammatory), <italic>v&#x00101;ta&#x0015b;&#x00101;maka</italic> (controlling of <italic>v&#x00101;ta</italic>) and <italic>&#x0015b;&#x0016b;lapra&#x0015b;amana</italic> (pain reliever) groups and at different places with their specific analgesic actions.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] According to Ayurveda, vitiation of <italic>v&#x00101;ta</italic> is the prime factor producing pain perception along with other systemic consequences such as palpitation, depression, insomnia, vomiting, irritation, alerted sensorium, hypertension, excitement etc.</p><p>Analgesia is a component of anaesthesia. Ayurveda drugs which relieve pain could be used to supplement anaesthesia as well as get rid of adverse effects of modern drugs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Some Ayurvedic physicians use herbal preparations for analgesia. One such preparation is <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> which is a combination of <italic>j&#x00101;ti</italic> (<italic>Jasminum officinilas Linn</italic>.), <italic>karamarda</italic> (<italic>Carissa carandas Linn</italic>.) and <italic>k&#x00101;&#x000f1;ji</italic> (sour gruel). According to Ayurvedic literature, <italic>j&#x00101;ti</italic> is <italic>trido&#x01e63;ahara</italic> and indicated in <italic>&#x0015b;iras</italic> (head), <italic>mukha</italic> (mouth) and <italic>danta</italic> (dental) diseases. <italic>Karamarda</italic> is <italic>v&#x00101;tahara</italic>[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and <italic>k&#x00101;&#x000f1;ji</italic> is also <italic>v&#x00101;tahara</italic> and <italic>kaphahara</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Chemically <italic>j&#x00101;ti</italic> and <italic>karamarda</italic> contain salicylic acid. <italic>K&#x00101;&#x000f1;ji</italic> which is one of <italic>sandh&#x00101;na kalpan&#x00101;s</italic> i.e., fermented preparation whose contents are similar to vinegar (mainly acetic acid).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] By combining salicylic acid and acetic anhydride one can get acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin) which is one of the NSAIDs.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, on the basis of Ayurveda references indicating <italic>v&#x00101;tahara</italic> properties of these drugs and reverse pharmacology of these drugs, this study has been taken up to provide clinical evidence of analgesic property fof <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di yoga</italic> comparing it with Diclofenac sodium. In the present study, <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di yoga</italic> is prepared in the form of a capsule combination of <italic>j&#x00101;ti</italic> and <italic>karamarda c&#x0016b;r&#x01e47;a</italic> which has been treated with a <italic>bh&#x00101;van&#x00101;</italic> of <italic>k&#x00101;&#x000f1;ji</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>60 patients who were to undergo haemorrhoidectomy operation under local anaesthesia were randomly selected using a random number table.

Mode of actions of these drugs are mainly based on <italic>rasa</italic>, <italic>v&#x0012b;rya</italic>, <italic>vip&#x00101;ka</italic> and <italic>prabh&#x00101;va</italic>. Vaidyas use different herbal drugs in combinations for the purpose of analgesia. In the present study, a combination of <italic>J&#x00101;ti</italic> and <italic>Karamarda</italic> was selected which is used for analgesia by vaidyas. Capsule containing <italic>J&#x00101;tipa&#x000f1;c&#x00101;&#x01e45;ga c&#x0016b;r&#x01e47;a</italic> and the <italic>c&#x0016b;r&#x01e47;a</italic> of <italic>Karamarda</italic> unripe fruit which is given <italic>bh&#x00101;van&#x00101;</italic> in <italic>k&#x00101;&#x000f1;ji</italic> is used to evaluate post-operative pain relief in haemorrhoidectomy operation under local anaesthesia.</p><p>Diclofenac Sodium, one of the widely used NSAIDs agent, is an insoluble compound in acidic solution (pKa = 4.0), but dissolves in intestinal fluid and water. In order to eliminate the gastrointestinal adverse effects of this drug, several swellable controlled-release pharmaceutical dosage forms have been developed.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In Control group, altered mean blood pressure intra-operatively returned to basal sooner than study group. Therefore it can be said that both drugs decrease pain and stress response preoperatively with the control drug being more effective. On the basis of these findings it can be concluded that the study drug <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> has no serious ill effects on cardio vascular system and it does not alter Mean Blood Pressure (MBP).</p><p>Mean pulse rate during the course of the observations before premedication and after recovery from anaesthesia within the group is significant in group B and insignificant in group A. In In Group A, there is no change of pulse rate at the time of observation before premedication and post operatively. Hence the altered mean pulse rate during operation is treated to be basal for post operative readings. In Group B postoperative mean pulse rate decreased compared to preoperative but still it was more than the basal pulse rate. Hence, in the Control group altered mean heart rate intra-operatively reverts to basal sooner than the study group.</p><p>Mean respiratory rate/min within both groups before premedication versus after premedication, before premedication versus intra-operative and before premedication versus after recovery from anaesthesia were identical. The observations prove that there is no untoward effect of either the study or control drugs on the respiratory rate.</p><p>The response of analgesic premedication plays a definite role during post operative period with regard to duration of surgery. Observations recorded suggest [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] that total surgical duration was identical in both groups and statistically insignificant when compared between the groups. The sustained release ability of Diclofenac sodium was demonstrated in an in-vivo study, showing the presence of the drug in plasma for about 14 h.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Mean VAS Scale (subjective) between the groups at corresponding times i.e. First (VAS 1), second (VAS 2) and third (VAS 3) reading at every 8 hrs of third post operative day were observed. The results seem to suggest VAS 1 to be statistically insignificant and VAS 2, VAS 3 to be significant between the group A (Control) and Group B (study). Pain has decreased from VAS 1 up to VAS 3 in both groups. But the reduction in the control group is more than that in the study group. Difference in VAS 1 and VAS 3 between both groups statistically insignificant and equal. Difference of VAS 1 of first post operative day with VAS 1 of third post operative day and VAS 3 of first post operative day with VAS3 of third post operative day between groups is equal and statistically insignificant. All the above proves the analgesic property of <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> compared to Diclofenac sodium. As VAS scale decreased on all three days between control group and study group equally, a statistically insignificant result is obtained. Except last day where VAS Scale decrease in control group is earlier than in the study group. This goes to prove the analgesic property of <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> and it being lesser than that of Diclofenac sodium.</p><p>Statistical comparison of difference in mean VAS Scale (Objective) between the groups at corresponding time i.e., first (VAS 1), second (VAS 2) and third (VAS 3) reading at every 8 hr interval of first post-operative day was observed. VAS 1, VAS 2 is equal and insignificant in both groups but VAS3 is significant statistically. VAS 3 is more in Study group and that means that the patients experience discomfort. In control group, VAS 3 is zero and hence the patients experience no discomfort are completely at ease. This shows that Control drug is associated with lesser pain than the study drug. No major difference is observed between the groups was observed on second and third day respectively and it is zero for all results in both groups. Both group patients was having no discomfort and patient completely at ease on second and third day. The above proves the analgesic property of both drugs. Difference of VAS1 of first post operative day with VAS1 of third post-operative day which is statistically insignificant and difference of VAS 3 of first post operative day with VAS 3 of third post operative day between groups, both of which are statistically significant results, are obtained.</p><p>Rescue analgesic required was 27% in Study group which almost 3 times than in control group. This also shows that the study group patients felt more pain than control group in spite of the drug. This proves that <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> has less analgesic property than study group and it alone is not sufficient to control post operative pain [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p><italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> has analgesic property but it's analgesic property and pain threshold capacity is lesser than control drug. <italic>Karamard&#x00101;di Yoga</italic> does not show any toxic effect in animals and neither does it show undesirable effects in humans.
