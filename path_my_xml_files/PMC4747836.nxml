We noted, first, that leptin activated cellular signaling pathways and increased adiponectin mRNA in adipose tissue from normal-weight participants, but did not do so in adipose tissue from obese participants; and second, that obese subjects had increased caveolin-1 expression, which attenuates leptin-dependent increases in adiponectin.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P3">Modest weight gain in healthy individuals is associated with increases in adiponectin, which correlate positively with changes in leptin. <italic>In-vitro</italic>, leptin induces adiponectin expression which is attenuated by increased caveolin-1 expression. Additionally, adipose tissue from obese subjects shows increased caveolin-1 expression, and impaired leptin signaling. This leptin signal impairment may prevent concordant increases in adiponectin in obese subjects despite their high levels of leptin. Therefore, impaired leptin signaling may contribute to low adiponectin expression in obesity and may provide a target for increasing adiponectin expression, hence improving insulin sensitivity and cardio-metabolic profile in obesity.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S4"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P4">Adiponectin is an adipokine with profound anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, and insulin-sensitizing properties.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Paradoxically, it is the only adipokine which is decreased in obesity.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> This negative association between obesity and adiponectin raises the possibility that weight gain decreases adiponectin expression.

The effect of leptin treatment on adiponectin secretion was determined in conditioned media from 24 h leptin-treated cells using total and high molecular weight adiponectin ELISA kits as per manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction (RnD systems, Minneapolis, MN).

This threshold effect would therefore contribute to reduced adiponectin in the obese population.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Furthermore, changes in the adipose tissue microenvironment, including increases in inflammation along with molecular and cellular changes during excessive weight gain and establishment of obesity, may together play a key role in decreasing adiponectin expression.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Notably, similar studies examining the effect of modest weight gain in humans did not show any changes in adipose tissue inflammation.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">The longitudinal weight gain study was conducted in free-living conditions; as a result not all subjects gained weight or maintained weight as designed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1A</xref>). Additionally, inter-individual variability in response to weight gain in the variables measured, including adiponectin and leptin was observed. The broad range of changes in leptin and adiponectin in response to similar amounts of weight gain highlights the multifactorial nature of leptin and adiponectin regulation, including genetic and epigenetic differences.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> In spite of this variability, we observed a positive correlation between changes in adiponectin and changes in leptin in our study population. This was intriguing, especially since clinical studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between the two adipokines.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, these prior clinical studies were limited by the cross-sectional study design and may thus reflect an outcome of established obesity. Also, changes in adiponectin did not correlate with any other measures that were obtained in our study population including insulin.</p><p id="P25">We have confirmed leptin-dependent up-regulation of adiponectin expression using cultured differentiated HWPs. Complementary to these data, we also found that treatment of differentiated HWPs with a leptin-antagonist decreased adiponectin expression, suggesting that leptin may contribute importantly to tonic adiponectin production in basal physiologic conditions. However, in the in-vitro studies, leptin-dependent increases in intracellular-adiponectin did not mirror increases in total and high molecular weight adiponectin secretion. The lack of increase in adiponectin secretion may be secondary to increases in caveolin-1 expression.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Interestingly, caveolin-1 knock-out mice have decreased total and high molecular weight adiponectin despite normal intracellular levels of adiponectin.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Nevertheless, the physiological relevance of leptin-dependent up-regulation of adiponectin in healthy humans is highlighted by positive associations observed between leptin and adiponectin at baseline and after 8 weeks follow-up, as well as the changes in each during modest weight gain in our study.</p><p id="P26">We also undertook studies to examine the specific cellular signaling pathways through which leptin mediates increases in adiponectin mRNA and establish that 1) SHLA attenuates leptin-mediated activation of these pathways; and 2) leptin-dependent activation of these pathways is impaired in adipose tissue from obese individuals. We observed that in the presence of inhibitors of ERK1/2 and STAT3 pathways, leptin did not increase adiponectin mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3A</xref>) which suggested that activation of both these pathways may be important for leptin-dependent increases in adiponectin expression. Importantly, ERK-dependent or ERK-independent pathways may contribute to STAT3 mediated increase in adiponectin mRNA.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Indeed, several studies have shown that leptin may activate STAT3 via both ERK-dependent and ERK-independent pathways.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> Furthermore, we also show that in the presence of SHLA, leptin-dependent activation of ERK1/2 was impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3b</xref>) but SHLA did not alter leptin-dependent activation of the STAT3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">fig 3c</xref>). This observation was surprising as previous animal studies have shown that LA prevents leptin-dependent activation of STAT3 in the hypothalamus.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Taken together, our results suggest that leptin may regulate adiponectin mRNA via ERK-dependent activation of STAT3. However, further detailed studies examining the signaling cascade through which leptin regulates adiponectin mRNA transcripts are warranted. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that leptin does not activate ERK and STAT3 pathways or increases adiponectin expression in adipose tissue from obese individuals.</p><p id="P27">Leptin plays a vital role in energy homeostasis by modulating food intake and energy expenditure. Therefore, increased leptin expression in obesity suggests impaired leptin signaling at the central level. However, in obesity, the role of hyperleptinemia versus impaired leptin signaling in peripheral tissues is not completely understood.<sup><xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> We previously reported that increases in leptin induced by modest weight gain result in up-regulation of adipose tissue caveolin-1 expression, which in-turn may impair leptin-dependent cellular signaling in adipose tissue.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> This study suggested the presence of a &#x0201c;threshold effect&#x0201d; of leptin action, whereby leptin-dependent increases in caveolin-1 cause impairment of leptin signaling after a certain amount of body fat has been accumulated. Therefore, modest fat gain in normal-weight healthy individuals cause increases in leptin, and hence leptin-mediated increases in adiponectin. However further substantial increases in weight to the point of obesity are likely to trigger impairment of leptin-cellular actions and blunt concordant increases in adiponectin. Although our prior study<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> suggested that adipose tissue in an obese individual is likely leptin resistant, to our knowledge, whether adipose tissue remains leptin sensitive or becomes leptin resistant in obesity is unknown. In the present study, we demonstrate that leptin-dependent activation of cellular signaling pathways and adiponectin mRNA transcription is impaired in adipose tissue from obese individuals. Moreover, we explored the mechanisms that may underlie impaired adipose tissue leptin signaling in obese individuals. Of the several mechanisms that have been proposed to attenuate leptin cellular signaling, we observed a markedly increased caveolin-1 expression in our obese study population. We demonstrate that increased caveolin-1 expression in differentiated HWPs, to levels seen in adipose tissue from obese subjects, prevents leptin-dependent increases in adiponectin expression. These studies suggest that in obesity, the discordant decrease in adiponectin with increases in leptin may be a result of impaired leptin signaling in the adipose tissue of obese individuals. Thus, targeting therapeutics aimed at improving leptin sensitivity via modulation of caveolin-1 expression may be an important strategy to increase adiponectin in obesity.</p><p id="P28">Some studies including that of Labruna <italic>et al</italic> have shown that high leptin/adiponectin ratio may be useful as a marker to identify populations at-risk of developing metabolic disorders including insulin-resistance.<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Therefore, we examined the changes in leptin/adiponectin (L/A) ratio with weight gain. We show that modest weight gain is associated with increases in L/A ratio (P&#x0003c;0.001) but the baseline L/A ratio did not correlate with changes in any variables measured including adiponectin and insulin. However, the relative changes in L/A ratio correlate with increases in insulin (P=0.0165, r=0.3638). In view of our findings that leptin regulates adiponectin expression, increases in leptin without concordant increases in adiponectin may suggest the presence of impaired leptin signaling. In other words, increases in leptin/adiponectin ratio may suggest decreased leptin sensitivity. Interestingly, several studies have suggested use of the leptin/adiponectin ratio as a surrogate marker for the presence of insulin-resistance as well.<sup><xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The similarities between leptin resistance and insulin resistance are concordant with studies showing that the molecules underlie impaired leptin and impaired insulin signaling and that there is cross-talk between the cellular signaling pathways for leptin and insulin.<sup><xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> Therefore, the leptin/adiponectin ratio could be a marker for both altered leptin and altered insulin sensitivity.</p><p id="P29">The strengths of our study include the comprehensive, translational approach ranging from a longitudinal weight gain model in well characterized normal weight healthy humans, and <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies demonstrating for the first time that leptin increases adiponectin expression in human adipocytes. These are complemented by <italic>ex-vivo</italic> studies using adipose tissue explants from a cross-sectional study population of varying levels of BMI showing differential effects of leptin in weight gain versus obesity. Our study also has some limitations. While we addressed the physiologic relationships between leptin and adiponectin during weight gain, and its implications in obesity, adiponectin regulation is multifactorial. Our study was not designed to comprehensively address factors other than leptin which would contribute to the low adiponectin expression in obesity. Furthermore, some subjects included in the longitudinal weight gain study had a high baseline total body fat mass; this may have contributed to the variability in response to weight gain. However, baseline fat mass did not show any relationship with either changes in leptin or in adiponectin. Also, subjects included in the cross-sectional population were not well characterized as we did not have data on body composition as well as systemic measures of leptin and adiponectin, and the obese group was significantly older than the normal weight subjects. Age difference may affect caveolin-1, adiponectin, and leptin sensitivity.</p><p id="P30">The increasing prevalence of obesity, along with associated diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease, highlight the compelling need for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at either reducing obesity, or attenuating its association with cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Increasing adiponectin expression is being targeted as a mechanism to decrease cardiometabolic risk.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Extrinsic adiponectin administration has significant limitations and would require administration of adiponectin at very high concentrations. Therefore, activating endogenous adiponectin expression would be an important potential approach, and requires an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that lead to low adiponectin expression in human obesity. Our study suggests a strategy of targeting leptin resistance so as to reduce obesity-associated metabolic and cardiac disorders, by increasing adiponectin expression. This is especially important as leptin is being explored as a therapeutic agent in treatment of other metabolic disorders including lipodystrophy and diabetes.<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS718023-supplement-1.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e666" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><label>2</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS718023-supplement-2.xlsx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d37e670" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="conflict"><p id="P31"><bold>Conflict of Interest</bold>: The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S15"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p id="P32">This work was supported by American Heart Association Scientist Development Grant 11SDG7260046 (to PS); a grant from the European Regional Development Fund - Project FNUSA-ICRC (No. CZ.1.05/1.1.00/02.0123) (to PS, FLJ, TK and VKS), NIH grant [DK81014; HL73211; HL65176] (to VKS) and DK45343 (to MDJ)]; the National Center for Research Resources (grant 1UL1 TR000135), which is a component of the NIH; and the NIH Roadmap for Medical Research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fogliano</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Baldini</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Lodish</surname><given-names>HF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A novel serum protein similar to C1q, produced exclusively in adipocytes</article-title><source>The Journal of biological chemistry</source><year>1995</year><volume>270</volume><issue>45</issue><fpage>26746</fpage><lpage>26749</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7592907</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="R2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fruhbeck</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Sir David Cuthbertson Medal Lecture.
