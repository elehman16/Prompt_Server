lumbar stabilization exercise and Nintendo Wii<sup>TM</sup> Sports in elderly at risk for
falls. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-four elderly women with at risk for falls were
randomly divided into the control, lumbar stabilization exercise, and Nintendo Wii Sports
groups. Static balance was measured by the Berg Balance Scale and functional reach test,
dynamic balance by the timed up-and-go test, and obstacle negotiation function by crossing
velocity and maximum vertical heel clearance. [Results] Both the lumbar stabilization
exercise and Nintendo Wii Sports groups showed significant improvements in obstacle
negotiation function after the exercise compared to the control group. Berg Balance Scale
and functional reach test scores were greater in the lumbar stabilization exercise group,
while the timed up-and-go test time was significantly better in the Nintendo Wii Sports
groups. [Conclusion] Lumbar stabilization exercises and Nintendo Wii Sports improve
falling related balance and obstacle negotiation function in elderly women at risk for
falls.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly women</kwd><kwd>Falls</kwd><kwd>Nintendo Wii Sports</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately 28&#x02013;35% and 32&#x02013;42% of people more than 60 and 70&#x02005;years old, respectively,
experience falls every year worldwide<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>; 30% of those experiencing falls require
medical attention to treat resultant abrasions and sprains, and approximately 10% require
hospitalization for fractures<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For elderly women in particular, aging-related organ degeneration is enhanced by a
significant reduction of bone mass due to menopause; therefore, they are more vulnerable to
serious fractures caused by falls, which can lead to secondary illnesses<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As people age, their abilities to maintain balance and ambulate degrade which increases
falling risk during walking<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
particular, falling caused by obstacle such as thresholds, bath sills, and speed bumps in
parking lots occur frequently<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among various intervention methods for fall prevention and obstacle negotiation, exercise
improves muscular strength, flexibility, and balance, aiding the maintenance of body
balance; therefore, it is widely used in programs to prevent falls<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, existing exercise methods to prevent falls largely depend on physical therapists.
Therefore, patients tend to become bored performing passive exercises with simple
repetitions; together with cost, time, and location constraints this results in decreased
desire for treatment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, an in-home exercise method that is interesting with fewer time and spatial
limitations, and enables continuous exercise is desirable.</p><p>Nintendo Wii<sup>TM</sup> Sports is a virtual reality-based exercise game. It is relatively
inexpensive and small enabling exercise in a small space. In addition, it offers immediate
visual and audio feedback from exercise, generating interest and improving the effect of
motor learing<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies using
Nintendo Wii Sports involved basic balance assessment for patients and elderly<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, but few have focused on the negotiation
of obstacles that frequently cause falls.</p><p>Hence, this study evaluated the changes in balance ability and obstacle gait after lumbar
stabilization exercise and Nintendo Wii Sports in elderly at risk for falls. Furthermore, we
whether Nintendo Wii Sports are appropriate and effective as self-help exercises to prevent
falls when performed at home by elderly women at risk of falls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study participants were selected by convenience sampling from 3 senior citizen centers;

the participants, who signed an informed consent that outlined all details of the study
protocol, which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kangwon National University (No.
2014-05-002-001).</p><p>The participants were randomly divided into the control, lumbar stabilization exercise
(LSE), and Nintendo Wii Sports (NWS) groups. Participants in the LSE and NWS groups, but not
the control group performed an exercise program. Participants performed exercises twice
weekly for 8 weeks. Each session lasted 30 minutes. LSE included 7 positions based on the
back bridge, hands and knees, and side bridge as follows<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>: (1) standard back bridge, (2) back bridge with alternate leg
straight, (3) back bridge with one leg, (4) standard hands and knees, (5) hands and knees
with alternate arm straight forward, (6) hands and knees with alternate leg straight
backward, and (7) side bridge. LSE group participants were instructed to maintain each
position for 15 seconds for 3 sets. The Nintendo Wii Sports program including the wakeboard,
Frisbee dog, jet ski, and canoe games was used for the NWS group. NWS group participants
controlled a virtual character on the screen by swinging, rowing, or tilting remote
controllers with motion sensors. Participants chose their 3 favorite games and took a
2-minute break every 10 minutes.</p><p>Before and after 8 weeks of intervention, the participants of each group were evaluated for
static balance ability, dynamic balance ability, and obstacle gait by using the following
instruments: Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and functional reach test (FRT) for static balance
ability; the timed up-and-go (TUG) test for dynamic balance ability; and crossing velocity
(CV) and maximum vertical heel clearance (MVHC) for obstacle gait. CV was calculated by
dividing the horizontal distance from where the leading limb takes off the ground to where
the heel of the leading limb touches the ground after obstacle negotiation by time spent.
MVHC was calculated by measuring the vertical distance between the height of an obstacle and
the ball of the leading limb before obstacle negotiation<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>; the obstacle&#x02019;s dimensions were 60 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 15.2&#x02005;cm (width &#x000d7; length &#x000d7;
height). The participants were instructed to start walking 5&#x02005;m behind the obstacle,
negotiate the obstacle, and then walk 3 more meters. Obstacle gait-related factors were
recorded by a camcorder and stored on a computer. CV and MVHC were calculated using Dartfish
software (Dartfish, Switzerland).</p><p>The data were analyzed by SPSS version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The independent
samples t-test was used to compare the two groups at the baseline. Two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA was used to compare the differences among groups, and post hoc analysis was conducted
using the Tukey least significant difference test. The significance level was set at p &#x0003c;

might be useful fall prevention interventions for improving fall-related balance and
obstacle negotiation function in elderly women at risk of falls.</p><p>When elderly people perform gait to overcome an obstacle, their trailing limbs is far more
behind the obstacle than that of normal adults; meanwhile, their leading limb makes the
distance between the peak of the obstacle and their foot too long, thus reducing the
crossing velocity and increasing MVHC<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elderly people place their leading limb
too high when negotiating the obstacle, which elevates their center of mass and consequently
reduces balance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, CV and MVHC are
important factors in their obstacle gait and basic balance ability, which are required to
negotiate obstacles in a natural way and thus prevent falls.</p><p>The Nintendo Wii Sports program involves exercise games and offers various visual and audio
feedback. It can be developed into a program that both spurs interest and improve motor
learning; it is especially useful for balance-related exercise effects in connection with
various virtual sports programs. Thus, it enables elderly people to improve their obstacle
gait and manage their health with respect to falls in a continuous and active manner.</p><p>This study used, the BBS and FRT as static balance ability assessments, the TUG test as a
dynamic balance ability assessment, and measurement of CV and the MVHC for kinematic changes
related to obstacle gait to investigate the effects of the Nintendo Wii Sports program and
lumbar stabilization exercise on elderly womens&#x02019; balance ability with respect to falls and
kinematic changes related to obstacle gait.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that the BBS, the FRT, the TUG test, CV, and MVHC
were significantly improved. Consistent with the present study, Rose and Clark<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, report that elderly people who experience
falls exhibited significant improvements in their BBS scores and TUG test results after
visual feedback balance exercise. Meanwhile, Chen et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and Madureira et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> report that FRT and TUG test results improved significantly in
elderly participants as a result of lower-limb power rehabilitation using interactive video
games; this is also consistent with the present results in that balance training for elderly
women significantly increased BBS score by 5.5 points in the experimental group and reduced
the TUG test time by 3.65 s. In addition, Park and Lee<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> report that elderly people were significantly slower in obstacle
negotiation than young adults. Choi and Yoon<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> report that elderly women tend to progressively increase the speed
at which they negotiate obstacles 0%, 30%, and 50% of the length of their lower limbs after
12 weeks of aquatic exercise. Meanwhile, Kim and Yu<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> report that MVHC decreased in elderly women after aquatic exercise.
These 3 studies are somewhat consistent with the present results.</p><p>The LSE group performed their exercise on a stable floor, which increased their trunk
muscle strength, improving their static balance ability. Meanwhile, the NWS group performed
their exercise on a relatively unstable floor under various virtual conditions according to
their reaction to visual and audio feedback, increasing their mobility and thus improving
dynamic balance ability. In addition, the improved static balance ability due to increased
trunk muscle strength in the LSE group and improved balance ability by stimulus reception
from their vestibular system through various stimuli from virtual environments and
proprioception improved their obstacle negotiation ability in various environments.</p><p>In summary, the 8-week NWS program improved the physical balance and obstacle negotiation
abilities of elderly women to the same extent as LSE. Therefore, Nintendo Wii Sports is an
effective home support exercise programs to prevent obstacle-related falls in the
elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by 2014 Research Grant from Kangwon National University (No.
