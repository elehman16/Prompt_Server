In 2009, four observational studies were published, of which three suggested that use of insulin glargine (GLA) was associated with an increased risk of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Since it was shown that GLA had an increased affinity for the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), mitogenic effects of GLA were believed to occur through increased stimulation of the IGF-IR. However, we recently observed that serum from type 2 diabetic patients, who were treated for 36 weeks with metformin and GLA, induced similar IGF-IR activation compared with that of patients treated with metformin and NPH insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>After subcutaneous injection, GLA is metabolized into two metabolites, M1 and M2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). GLA undergoes sequential cleavage of the COOH terminus of the B-chain, forming metabolites M1 and M2 that lack the di-arginine (M1 after removal of the two arginines, M2 with additional deamination of threonine at position B30). M1 and M2 have the same metabolic properties as human insulin and do not differ from human insulin in affinity for the IGF-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Our previous observation of a lack of increase in IGF-IR activation by serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) could have been the result of GLA not reaching in vivo concentrations needed to stimulate the IGF-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). However, it may also be the result of metabolism of GLA to M1 or M2 before it enters the circulation. Pharmacodynamic studies have shown that in type 1 diabetes mellitus, after a subcutaneous injection, GLA is rapidly and dose-independently metabolized almost completely into M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Moreover, in type 2 diabetic patients, after a subcutaneous injection of a therapeutic dose, GLA was minimally detectable in blood, and M2 was undetectable in blood, whereas M1 accounted for most (&#x02248;90%) of the plasma insulin concentration up to 31 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Yet, whether GLA accumulates during long-term GLA therapy is still unknown.</p><p>Mitogenic effects of insulin may also occur via increased stimulation of the insulin receptor (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). IRs are usually expressed at high levels in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Moreover, cells can express two IR isoforms (IR-A and IR-B), generated by alternative splicing of the IR gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The two IR isoforms have slightly different biological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). IR-B is the classical form of the IR, which is primarily expressed in liver, muscle, and adipose tissues and predominantly mediates metabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). IR-A is expressed ubiquitously but is predominantly expressed in central nervous system, hematopoietic cells, and cancer tissues and has predominantly mitogenic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>The aims of the current study were to measure <italic>1</italic>) the ability of purified GLA, M1, M2, IGF-I, and NPH insulin to activate IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR in vitro; <italic>2</italic>) plasma concentrations of GLA and M1 and M2 during long-term insulin therapy in type 2 diabetic patients; and <italic>3</italic>) IR-A and IR-B activation in vitro induced by serum from patients treated with GLA or NPH insulin.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>In vitro effects of GLA, M1, M2, NPH insulin, and IGF-I on IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR autophosphorylation (activation).</title><p>Equimolar concentrations of GLA (Lantus; Sanofi, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), M1 (provided by Sanofi), M2 (provided by Sanofi), NPH insulin (Insulatard; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), and IGF-I (Austral Biologicals, San Ramon, CA) were tested in a range of 0.1&#x02013;100 nmol/L.

Serum samples tested were samples obtained from the previously reported LANMET study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) in which extra serum samples had been collected as part of the original protocol (104 of 110 LANMET participants). The LANMET study was a multicentre, open, randomized, parallel-group study. Briefly, in the LANMET study, the efficacy and safety of bedtime GLA and metformin was compared with NPH insulin and metformin treatment in insulin-naive, poorly controlled type 2 diabetic patients (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;8.0%). The study consisted of a 4-week run-in phase and a 36-week treatment phase. It was performed at six sites in Finland and one in the U.K. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice as described by Note for Guidance CPMP/ICH/135/95. Approval by institutional ethics committees, including permission to obtain extra serum samples at 0 and 36 weeks, was obtained for each participating site. All patients provided written informed consent before entry into the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR KIRA assays using pure hormone, metabolites, or serum.</title><p>The IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR KIRA assays have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). All three assays use human embryonic kidney cells stably transfected with either cDNA of the human IR-A or human IR-B gene (HEK IR-A or IR-B) or with cDNA of the human IGF-IR gene (HEK IGF-IR). The principle of all three KIRA bioassays is based on quantification of tyrosine residue phosphorylation of the IR or IGF-IR. For the in vitro experiments, after 48 h of culture, cells were stimulated for 10 (for IR KIRA assays) or 15 min (for the IGF-IR KIRA assay) at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were stimulated with equimolar concentrations of GLA, M1, M2, NPH insulin, or human recombinant IGF-I diluted in 0.5% human serum albumin (Octalbine; Octopharma, Lachen, Switzerland).</p><p>For serum experiments, after 48 h of culture, cells were stimulated for 10 min (for IR KIRA assays) at 37&#x000b0;C. Cells were stimulated with in serum or increasing amounts of human recombinant insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk) in a range of 0.06&#x02013;1.0 nmol/L. In addition, two control serum samples were tested on every plate to ensure optimal performance. Standards and serum samples were diluted in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer adjusted to pH 7.4 by CO<sub>2</sub> and supplemented human serum albumin diluted to 0.5 and 0.1%, respectively. Serum samples were diluted 1:10.</p><p>After stimulation, cells were lysed. Crude lysates were transferred to a sandwich assay.

In the IGF-IR KIRA assay, wells were coated with a monoclonal capture antibody directed against the IGF-IR in a concentration of 5.0 &#x003bc;g/mL. A biotinylated antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (BAM 1676; R&#x00026;D Systems Europe Ltd, Abingdon, U.K.) was used in a concentration of 0.2 &#x000b5;g/mL together with streptavidin-labeled europium (DELFIA Eu-N1; PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Groningen, the Netherlands) in a concentration of 50 pmol/L as detection antibody.

Of the metabolites of GLA, only M1 could be detected in the circulation of patients treated with GLA. Circulating M1 concentrations correlated closely with the GLA dose and with the ability of serum (from the same patients) to induce IR-A activation. In contrast to purified GLA, purified M1 did not activate IGF-IR in vitro, even at high concentrations and activated IR-A and IR-B similar to NPH insulin.</p><p>Sommerfeld et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) found that GLA had a higher affinity for the IGF-IR and was also more potent than human insulin to stimulate thymidine incorporation in Saos-2 cells. In contrast, M1 and M2 were significantly less active than human insulin in binding to and activating the IGF-IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Their mitogenicity in Saos-2 cells was equal to that of human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In another study, IGF-I and GLA more efficiently stimulated phosphatidyl-inositol 3 phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) production in breast cancer&#x02013;derived MCF-7 cells as compared with human insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In contrast, as compared with insulin, M1 and M2 showed lower potency in stimulating hybrid receptors (IR/IGF-IR), they induced less phosphatidyl-inositol 3 phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) production, less Akt and extracellular signal&#x02013;related kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, and less DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells. These experimental results are in keeping with our findings of slightly greater IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR activation at high (supraphysiologic) concentrations by GLA compared with human insulin and with data showing that GLA metabolites M1 and M2 do not share these properties of GLA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>These findings may thus explain why the ability of serum from type 2 diabetic patients to induce IR-A and IR-B activation in the GLA-treated group was comparable to that of patients treated with NPH insulin. Moreover, they may also explain why we previously were not able to detect differences in serum-induced IGF-IR activation between patients treated with GLA or NPH insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study, circulating concentrations of GLA, M1, and M2 were determined in type 1 diabetic subjects after a single subcutaneous dose of 0.3, 0.6, or 1.2 IU/kg GLA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The authors concluded that GLA was rapidly and nearly completely processed into M1. In another study, nine type 2 diabetic subjects were investigated after 1 week of GLA treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). GLA was detected at low concentrations in five of the nine subjects and at only a few time points. In contrast, M1 was detected in all subjects and accounted for most of the plasma insulin and metabolic action of the injected GLA, while M2 was undetectable. In contrast to our study, these studies did not include measurements of the ability of pure hormones or serum from the patients to activate the IR-A, IR-B, and IGF-IR. Moreover, these studies did not address long-term effects of high-dose GLA treatment on GLA and its metabolites. Nevertheless, our findings are in line and consistent with conclusions of these latter studies.</p><p>The data in the present and our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) do not give support to the idea that treatment with GLA in type 2 diabetes leads to a stronger stimulation of the IRs or IGF-IR than NPH insulin. In spite of that, we did find a positive relationship between insulin dose and serum-induced IR-A activation for both treatment groups. This suggests that, irrespective of insulin type, there may be an enhanced IR-A signaling in subjects who are treated with relatively high insulin doses. Whether these results have any clinical consequences is still uncertain. In a recent study, in which an animal model of type 2 diabetes was studied, no differences could be demonstrated in the degree of colonic epithelial proliferation between animals treated with GLA or NPH insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, insulin treatment as such did result in a higher degree of colonic epithelial proliferation, suggesting that potential insulin-mediated mitogenic properties are irrespective of the type of insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>Finally, a few limitations of our study need to be addressed. The LANMET study was not primarily designed and performed to study the effects of insulin therapy on IR-A&#x02013;, IR-B&#x02013;, or IGF-IR&#x02013;stimulating activities. Therefore, the current study is inevitably a post hoc analysis. Secondly, as for all in vitro systems, the IR-A and IR-B KIRA assays do not mimic the exact in vivo conditions. The autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues at the &#x003b2;-subunits of the IGF-IR and IRs does not necessarily give insights into whether activation of the IGF-IR or IR by an insulin analog results in a normal (i.e., balanced metabolic and mitogenic) activity at cellular level in vivo. Thus, it would be important also to study downstream signaling pathways of the IGF-IR and IRs. However, lack of detectable GLA in plasma after long-term insulin therapy precludes any direct role of GLA in mediating metabolic or mitogenic effects during insulin therapy. Another limitation of the current study is that metabolite measurements were performed at 0 and 36 weeks, but not at other time points.</p><p>In conclusion, M1 induced similar IGF-IR, IR-A, and IR-B activation as human insulin. After long-term, high-dose GLA therapy, only M1, but not GLA nor M2, could be detected in the circulation of type 2 diabetic patients. The concentration of plasma M1 correlated with insulin dose and also with IR-A&#x02013;stimulating activity. Serum from type 2 diabetic patients treated with GLA or NPH insulin induced similar IR-A and IR-B activation. Taken together, these data show that long-term high-dose GLA therapy does not increase IGF-IR signaling.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The LANMET study was sponsored by Sanofi, but the current study was investigator-initiated.
