The study population included all the preterm infants admitted in these centers. The number of the samples calculated based on the mean difference of 0.9 in the Chang's study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> and 0.95 test power. Sampling was done using simple convenient method among the infants who had inclusion criteria from 20 April to 19 August 2008. In this study, each infant was considered as his/her own control (cross over design).</p><p>Gestational age less than 37 weeks, chronologic age of less than 7 days, undergoing at least 4 hours of mechanical ventilation, using SIMV mode for ventilation, having a relatively stable physiological condition (no need for frequent change of ventilator settings), no respiratory disorder due to congenital heart disease, pulmonary emphysema, active bleeding, neuromuscular disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension were the inclusion criteria. In cases in which infant needed exchange transfusion or its products, it was required to change ventilator settings or was suffering from hypothermia, the infant would be excluded from the study.</p><p>Moreover, those infants who experienced SPO<sub>2</sub> level &#x02264; 80%, during the study and had no appropriate response to interventional measures (increasing FIO<sub>2</sub>) were excluded from the study. . Furthermore, provided that any infant needed intensive emergency care during the study, the necessary process had been done for them and after ensuring about stability status, the study started over from the beginning.</p><p>Prior to conduct the intervention, the infants&#x02019; parents were informed about the study and a written consent form was received from them. Data collection tool was a data recording form and pulse oximeter and finger probe. The infants&#x02019; demographic data (infant's post natal age, gestational age and gender) were extracted from their files. For reliability of the data collection tool, in the both hospitals the SPO<sub>2</sub> was measured by pulse oximeter (Sood-Afarinesh&#x000ae; Model) and finger probe was measured by Dolphin Model special for infants and all the data were displayed by the monitor and were recorded only by one partner.</p><p>Pulse oximeter was used to evaluate oxygenation of infants because it is a simple and non-invasive technique that could show the hypoxic attacks.</p><p>At the time of changing the infants&#x02019; position and also during the intervention, the incharged nurse for the infant was responsible for protecting the catheters. Position changing and recording the observations were all done by one individual all the time.</p><p>When infants were placed in each position, no data was recorded for the first 10 minutes( washout period) due to the potential physiological respiratory instability and thereafter, when the infant was in a stable physiologic status, the SPO<sub>2</sub> displayed by the pulse oximeter was recorded every one minute (a total of 120 minutes for each position). To make sure about non-hypothermic status, the infants&#x02019; temperature was monitored every one hour by a rectal mercury thermometer.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intervention Technique</title><p>First, supine position and then prone position were tried for the infants. For the supine position, the infants were laid on back and their head was a little to the sides to adjust with the ventilator tubes. For the prone position, two small towels were rolled and placed under infants&#x02019; knees and abdomen to prevent from pressure to knees and chest. In this position, elbows were bent and arms were placed at the two sides of the body, while hands were placed at the two sides of the head and the head was placed towards ventilator tubes.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using Software SPSS<sub>15</sub>. The oxygen saturation rate in various positions from 0 to 120 minutes were shown as mean &#x000b1; SD and the changes rate during the two hours in each position (supine or prone) were calculated by intra-group ANOVA. The comparison between oxygen saturation percentage in different times in the two positions was done by post-hoc test. P value less than 0.05 was considered as significant level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>The mean of SpO<sub>2</sub> in prone and supine positions from minutes 0 to 120 are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison the mean of SPO2 in supine and prone positions during the intervention</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-15-229-g001"/></table-wrap><p>In supine position, the mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> in minute 0 was 95.6 &#x000b1; 2.4 percent and in minute 120 it was 95 &#x000b1; 5.5 percent. Intra-group ANOVA with repeated measures showed that during 120 minutes of supine position, changes in mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> were not significant (p = 0.93).</p><p>In the prone position, the mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> in minute 0 was 96.2 &#x000b1; 3.3% and in minutes 120 it was 98.3 &#x000b1; 6.1%. Intra-group ANOVA with repeated measures showed that during 120 minutes of prone position, mean of changes in SPO<sub>2</sub> in different times had a significant difference (p = 0.003).</p><p>To compare the means of SPO<sub>2</sub> in the two positions in various times, post hoc test was used. The results showed that from minutes 0 to 10, mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> in the two positions of supine and prone had no significant difference, but from minute 15 to 120, the mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> in the prone position significantly was higher than in supine position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results showed that placing neonates in prone position for duration of 120 minutes increased the mean of SPO<sub>2</sub>. Balaguer et al in a systematic review study about the effect of positioning on amount of SPO<sub>2</sub>, showed that in several studies SPO<sub>2</sub> in the prone position increased between 1.18 to 4.36% during the intervention (prone position).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> In the present study also, the difference between SPO<sub>2</sub> in minutes 0 and 120 was 1.2% in prone position, which was in accordance with the above studies.</p><p>Ravindra et al showed that premature infants, who were oxygen dependent and prepare for discharge from neonatal unit, had higher SPO<sub>2</sub> and FRC in prone position than in supine position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Yao et al showed that preterm infants 1 and 6 hours after weaning from mechanical ventilation had a higher PaO<sub>2</sub> in prone position compared with supine position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> In the present study the results showed that in prone position the mean of SPO<sub>2</sub> was significantly higher than in supine position. However, in this study, unlike Yao's study, assessing the tissue oxygenation was conducted using pulse oxymeter and the infants underwent mechanical ventilation at the time of intervention and at their first week of post natal. The present study was in accordance with study of Chang et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> regarding to the study population and method of infants&#x02019; evaluation and also results. In the present study we did not investigate for exploring the cause of increasing SPO<sub>2</sub> in prone position, but the reason for better oxygenation in this position can be due to this fact that in prone position, the connection of hand-mouth and semi-embryonic flexion occur better than other position and this can lead to better sleep as well as less consumption of oxygen compared to other position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>In this study, no complication occurred during the short term duration that the infant was positioned in prone position. The longer the infants remained in this position, the more complications likely could be observed. According to our knowledge, no study has ever been conducted in Iran on the complications of prone positioning for a long time, but in a study by Curley, some of the infants, who were in prone position for a long time, suffered from bed sores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>In general, the present study showed that infant positioning in prone position was a simple, non-invasive and inexpensive method that would lead to better oxygenation of infants undergoing mechanical ventilation.</p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study financially was sponsored by Research Deputy of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Research Project No. 387041).
