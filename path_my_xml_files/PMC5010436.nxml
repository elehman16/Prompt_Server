Nasal and ocular symptoms were evaluated weekly by using a four-point categoric scale. The efficacy of the study drug was assessed based on the mean change from baseline of the total daytime nasal symptom scores, total nighttime nasal symptom scores, and the composite symptom scores.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>The combined therapy (FF with antioxidants) resulted in marked improvements (p &#x02264; 0.05) in the mean total daytime nasal symptom scores, total nighttime nasal symptom scores, and composite symptom scores of subjects compared with ones treated with intranasal steroid (FF) alone, which highlighted the therapeutic effect of antioxidants in allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Significant improvement in clinical outcome was observed in subjects who received antioxidants along with FF. However, because this was an open-label study, the results must be interpreted with caution, and further double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trials supplemented with different antioxidants together with intranasal steroids are suggested.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rhinitis</kwd><kwd>antioxidants</kwd><kwd>intra nasal steroids</kwd><kwd>oxidative stress</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) represents an enormous global health burden, which affects between 10% and 20% of the world population, with an increasing prevalence over the past decade.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> AR is a common disorder that affects people of all ages and is associated with significant impairments in quality of life, sleep, and work performance.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> AR has been classified as seasonal and perennial; the former occurs seasonally due to outdoor allergens, such as mold spores and pollens of trees, grasses, and weeds during cross-pollination through wind; and the latter is associated with indoor allergens, <italic>viz.,</italic> cockroaches, dust-mite fecal particles, animal dander, and occupational exposure throughout the year.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, these definitions are a poor reflection of real life,<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> with some pollens occurring perennially and some symptoms of perennial allergies not being present continuously.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>According to the Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma guidelines, AR is reclassified into intermittent and persistent, which is based on the duration of the symptoms.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The types can be further subdivided based on the severity of patient symptoms, into mild or moderate to severe. The traditional nomenclatures of seasonal and perennial AR (PAR) are retained herein to allow a direct discussion of published data.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>AR involves inflammation of mucous membranes of the nose and eyes, and is characterized by a complex interaction of inflammatory mediators but ultimately is triggered by an immunoglobulin E&#x02013;mediated response to an extrinsic antigen,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> with symptoms that include rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal congestion, itching of the nose and palate, and ocular symptoms (itching, tearing, and congestion). Clinical examinations revealed pale nasal mucosa, with swollen, edematous turbinates, and clear nasal secretions.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Pharmacotherapies are composed of oral and intranasal antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, leukotriene inhibitors, decongestants, intranasal anticholinergics, and intranasal steroids (INS).<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> INS are recommended as first-line treatment for patients with moderate-to-severe symptoms of allergic rhinitis (AR)<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and has been proven to improve all nasal symptoms and patients' quality of life.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> INS are more effective compared with oral or intranasal antihistamines and the antileukotrienes; however, they are comparable with or equivalent to the combination of antihistamine plus antileukotriene.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The mode of action of steroids attributes to anti-inflammatory potential; steroids work by penetrating the plasma membrane and binding to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor (GR). After glucocorticoid receptor binding, the steroid&#x02013;glucocorticoid receptor complex translocates into the nucleus and binds the DNA at the glucocorticoid response elements in the 5&#x02032;-upstream region of the steroid responsive genes. The transcriptional activation of the anti-inflammatory genes or the repression of the proinflammatory transcription factors lead to the inhibition of the transcription of the inflammatory genes.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> A study demonstrated that despite of the efficacy of INS, only 60% of the subjects showed improved symptoms and relief, thereby clearly indicating the need for improved treatment modalities. Henceforth, ancillary treatments to improve the efficacy of INS have become the main focus of research.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play an important role in biologic function. Initially, the generation of ROS was viewed as indiscriminate and random and their targets as primary determinants of disease and aging. However, there is research that demonstrated that ROS generation is a normal physiologic phenomenon, particularly for proper immunocompetence and in coordination and activation of numerous signal transduction pathways.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Under controlled conditions, when produced in the correct amounts, at the right place and time, these ROS are highly beneficial for the organism and are critical for cell homeostasis.</p><p>There are studies that report that the cells that line the nasal mucosa in patients with AR produce a variety of ROS that disturb the equilibrium between oxidants and antioxidants, and thus weaken one's antioxidant defense system leading to the pathogenesis of asthma and AR<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> The association between chronic inflammation and oxidative stress is well documented. Elevated levels of ROS, such as hydroxyl radicals, peroxides, and superoxides, may induce a variety of pathologic changes that are highly relevant in nasal and airway mucosa. These changes include lipid peroxidation, increased airway reactivity, enhanced nasal mucosal sensitivity and secretions, production of chemoattractant molecules, and increased vascular permeability.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The role of oxidative stress in AR is not well studied but is likely to be similar to that in asthma.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Because several oxidants and antioxidants are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory process in AR, the present study was planned to evaluate the role of antioxidants along with INS (fluticasone furoate [FF]) on the clinical outcome of patients with PAR.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This prospective, randomized, open, parallel group study was conducted between April 2013 and March 2015 at the outpatient department of Gian Sagar Medical College and Hospital, Patiala, Punjab, India.

The severity of PAR symptoms was rated on a scale that ranged from 0 (none) to 3 (severe) for both the daytime (the diary card was completed in the evening) and the nighttime (the diary card was completed on awakening). The ratings of the symptoms were as follows: 0, not noticeable; 1, mild symptoms; 2, moderate symptoms; and 3, severe symptoms.

This is one of the major paradoxes of aerobic life. The detrimental effect of oxygen is not due to its own reactivity, which is rather feeble, but due to its reduction to form water that proceeds by a series of a single electron transfer down the mitochondrial respiratory chain and generate reactive species. Therefore, the cells under an aerobic environment are always threatened with the insult of ROS. These species are produced at low concentrations under normal physiologic conditions, and the damage that they cause to cells is constantly repaired. However, under pathologic conditions, there may be increased production of free radicals coupled with increased consumption or decreased production of the endogenous antioxidant defense system, which results in an imbalance between prooxidant and antioxidant factors, and results in &#x0201c;oxidative stress.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> The body adapts to the slight imbalance and induces the production of extra endogenous antioxidant defense enzymes. However, a severe imbalance results in excess production of ROS and free radicals, which thus weakens the system further.</p><p>AR is an inflammatory disorder of the upper airways. ROS contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic disorders.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> The presence of chronic inflammation in the epithelium of the upper airways in AR could contribute to the development of the considerable persistent oxidative stress. Airway inflammatory cells are the source of increased ROS production.<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Antioxidants generally found in the epithelial lining cells and fluids of the airways include superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, thioredoxin, the iron-binding proteins lactoferrin and transferrin, the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin, and the low-molecular-weight antioxidants (<italic>e.g.,</italic> glutathione, urate, vitamin E, and vitamin C).<sup><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>Ascorbic acid is physiologically available in the respiratory tract and may cause a reduction of negative effects caused by oxidative attack on tissues during inflammation. It prevents the secretion of histamine by white blood cells and increases its detoxification.<sup><xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A study reported an exponential increase in histamine levels with a concomitant decrease in plasma ascorbic acid levels,<sup><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> which thus confirmed an inverse relationship with histamine levels, henceforth, decreasing the symptoms of AR. Furthermore, vitamin C stimulates the immune system by enhancing T-cell proliferation in response to infections. These cells are capable of lysing infected targets by producing large quantities of cytokines and by helping B cells to synthesize immunoglobulins to control the inflammation reaction. Moreover, vitamin C plays an important role in lipid peroxidation. Studies have reported that plasma devoid of vitamin C has an increased rate of lipid peroxidation, which indicated therapeutic potential against free radical&#x02013;mediated diseases.<sup><xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>Vitamin E is a major lipid soluble antioxidant present in all cellular membranes and can act directly against a variety of oxygen free radicals, including peroxy radicals, superoxide radicals, and singlet oxygen, and which thereby protects against lipid peroxidation. Selenium, an essential component of glutathione peroxidase, is a part of the body's antioxidant defense system and plays an important role in the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxides.<sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Selenium acts synergistically with vitamin E to protect cell membranes from damage caused by dangerous naturally occurring substances known as free radicals. Vitamin A designates a group of retinoid compounds with the biologic activity of all <italic>trans-</italic>retinol. Retinoids usually consist of four isoprenoid units with five conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds. One study reported that vitamin A consumption increases the repair of mucosal epithelium that is damaged by inflammation and prevents the oxidative damage in AR.<sup><xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p><p>There are a number of pharmacotherapies available for AR that are composed of oral and intranasal H<sub>1</sub> antihistamines, decongestants, intranasal corticosteroids, anticholinergics, cromolyn, and leukotriene receptor antagonists.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> The INS have been the focus of research for a long time and have been effective against moderate-to-severe disease because all the major symptoms of AR are relieved with their usage<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, a study has indicated that &#x0223c;60% of subjects achieve relief from INS, which indicates the need for additional treatment to improve its efficacy.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>A diet rich in antioxidants has been associated with a low prevalence of allergic diseases.<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>A strategy for designing well-balanced antioxidant therapies based on both reducing endogenous ROS production and increasing the total antioxidant capacity of human cells may prove useful in the prevention of AR. Thus, a comprehensive study was planned to find the efficacy of antioxidants along with FF on the clinical outcome of patients with PAR.</p><p>The study demonstrated that treatment with FF, along with antioxidants, is effective in alleviating the nasal symptoms and providing relief from ocular symptoms in the subjects with PAR. The response to treatment was comparatively gradual initially but continued at a consistent rate over the course of the study. The observed effects of FF on nasal symptoms result from topical action through its absorption into the nasal mucosa. Kaiser <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> reported that fluticasone furoate therapy for 2 weeks results in clinical improvement in overall quality of life by reducing symptom severity. The antioxidants, however, strengthen the defense system and prevent oxidative stress, the prime etiologic factor for PAR. A study concluded that high plasma carotenoid concentration, which reflects a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, has a protective effect on AR.<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Similar results demonstrated in another study, which revealed elevated plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) and total oxidative status (TOS) in children with AR.<sup><xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Similarly Nagel <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> reported a decreased risk of adult-onset hay fever with increasing intake of vitamin E. Sequeria <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> demonstrated a significant decrease in vitamin C and total antioxidant levels in patients with AR.</p><p>In the present study, a combination of antioxidants and FF was effective in improving the PDTS, PNTS, and PCS mean scores in patients with PAR. The combined therapy with antioxidants and FF significantly improved the PAR symptoms compared with FF administered alone. Similar results were obtained in a previous study that demonstrated the efficacy of addition of antioxidants to INS (FF) in the treatment of AR.<sup><xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Overall, no safety and tolerability issues of clinical importance were identified. A few adverse symptoms (sneezing, burning, stinging sensation) associated with treatment were mild and were similar to those reported in earlier studies.<sup><xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup></p><p>In sum, we showed that the combination of FF and antioxidants has beneficial effects beyond those of FF alone. We speculated that antioxidants may have a therapeutic role in limiting the damage caused by excess free radical generation and, consequently, oxidative stress built up within the nasal mucosa in AR. The study had limitations, due to subjective evaluation of outcome, but the results are noteworthy. Furthermore, this was an open label study owing to a paucity of funds. To evaluate the efficacy, a double-blind study with placebo control and a larger group would have been ideal. Further studies could use different antioxidants in different doses. The development of such a combination should be pursued at a larger level with increased numbers of responders and an increased duration of study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect of adding antioxidants to standard steroid therapy for AR. Analysis of the results indicated that antioxidants resulted in a improved clinical outcome; thus, antioxidants may play a major role in the prevention and treatment of AR. However, more comprehensive clinical studies are needed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>No external funding sources reported</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare pertaining to this article</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
