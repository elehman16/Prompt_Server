All NEPA doses provided superior prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting compared with PALO, with NEPA<sub>300</sub> (300mg NETU + 0.50 mg PALO) being the best dose studied.</p></abstract><abstract><sec><title>Background</title><p>NEPA is a novel oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant (NETU), a new highly selective neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) receptor antagonist (RA) and palonosetron (PALO), a pharmacologically and clinically distinct 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) RA. This study was designed to determine the appropriate clinical dose of NETU to combine with PALO for evaluation in the phase 3 NEPA program.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, parallel group study in 694 chemotherapy na&#x000ef;ve patients undergoing cisplatin-based chemotherapy for solid tumors compared three different oral doses of NETU (100, 200, and 300 mg) + PALO 0.50 mg with oral PALO 0.50 mg, all given on day 1. A standard 3-day aprepitant (APR) + IV ondansetron (OND) 32 mg regimen was included as an exploratory arm. All patients received oral dexamethasone on days 1&#x02013;4.

Antiemetic regimens have consequently evolved from the use of dopamine antagonists alone to combination regimens such as a corticosteroid plus a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 receptor antagonist (5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA) with or without a neurokinin-1 (NK<sub>1</sub>) RA. Such combination regimens have become the standard of care for the prevention of CINV and are currently reflected in international antiemetic guidelines [<xref rid="MDU110C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, despite the availability of more effective prophylactic regimens, many patients are undertreated and still experience CINV [<xref rid="MDU110C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], particularly nausea, during the delayed phase after chemotherapy.</p><p>NEPA is an oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant (NETU), a new highly selective NK<sub>1</sub> RA and palonosetron (PALO), a pharmacologically distinct [<xref rid="MDU110C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and clinically superior [<xref rid="MDU110C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDU110C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA. It targets two critical pathways associated with acute and delayed CINV, the serotonin and substance P<italic>-</italic>mediated pathways. The binding of PALO to the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor is distinctly different from older 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RAs; recent <italic>in vitro</italic> data have shown that PALO not only independently inhibits the substance P response, but also enhances this inhibition when combined with NETU [<xref rid="MDU110C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This <italic>in vitro</italic> synergy combined with PALO's clinical superiority to the older 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RAs drove the decision to formulate a fixed-dose combination with NETU, recognizing that this also conveniently offers guideline-based prophylaxis in a single oral dose. A positron emission tomography (PET) study demonstrated that the 300 mg dose of NETU was the minimal dose among those tested (100, 300, and 450 mg), leading to a receptor occupancy in the striatum of &#x0003e;90% [<xref rid="MDU110C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This led to the selection of the doses in the current trial.</p><p>This phase 2, pivotal study was designed to evaluate three different oral doses of NETU (100, 200, and 300 mg) co-administered with PALO 0.50 mg to determine the most appropriate clinical dose for the fixed-dose NEPA combination for evaluation in the phase 3 clinical program. The 0.50 mg oral PALO dose was selected based on an efficacy trial which evaluated the non-inferiority of three oral PALO doses, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 mg, compared with IV PALO 0.25 mg [<xref rid="MDU110C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="MDU110C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and served as the basis for FDA approval of the 0.50 mg oral dose. As cisplatin is viewed as the most emetogenic chemotherapeutic agent, it was thought to be the most useful setting in initially assessing the antiemetic efficacy of the NETU plus PALO combination (referred to as NEPA throughout). An exploratory 3-day standard aprepitant (APR)/ondansetron arm was also included to assess the relative activity of an approved NK<sub>1</sub>/5-HT<sub>3</sub> RA combination within the context of this trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="mdu110_s2"><title>patients and methods</title><sec id="mdu110_s2a"><title>study design</title><p>This was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group study conducted at 29 sites in Russia and 15 sites in Ukraine in 2008. The protocol was approved by ethical review committees for each center, all patients provided written informed consent, and all investigators and site personnel were required to follow Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonization, and Declaration of Helsinki principles, local laws, and regulations.</p></sec><sec id="mdu110_s2b"><title>patients</title><p>Eligible patients were &#x02265;18 years diagnosed with histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant solid tumors, na&#x000ef;ve to chemotherapy, and scheduled to receive their first course of cisplatin-based chemotherapy at a dose of &#x02265;50 mg/m<sup>2</sup> either alone or in combination with other chemotherapy agents. Patients were required to have a Karnofsky Performance Scale score of &#x02265;70%, be able to follow study procedures and complete the patient diary. Patients were not eligible if they were scheduled to receive: (i) moderately (MEC) or highly (HEC) emetogenic chemotherapy from day 2 to 5 following chemotherapy, (ii) moderately or highly emetogenic radiotherapy either within 1 week before day 1 or from day 2 to 5, or (iii) a bone marrow or stem cell transplant. Patients were not allowed to receive any drug with potential antiemetic efficacy within 24 h or systemic corticosteroids within 72 h before day 1. They were excluded if they experienced any vomiting, retching, or more than mild nausea within 24 h before day 1. Patients were not to have had any serious cardiovascular disease history or predisposition to cardiac conduction abnormalities, with the exception of incomplete right bundle branch block. Because NETU is a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4, chronic use of any CYP3A4 substrates/inhibitors/inducers or intake within 1 week (substrates/inhibitors) or 4 weeks (inducers) before day 1 was prohibited.</p></sec><sec id="mdu110_s2c"><title>treatment</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned, stratified by gender, to one of the five treatment groups shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="MDU110F1">1</xref>.<fig id="MDU110F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Treatment schema.

The diary captured information pertaining to the timing and duration of each emetic episode, severity of nausea, concomitant medications taken including rescue, and the patient's overall satisfaction. An emetic episode was defined as a single vomiting occurrence, a single retching, or any retching combined with vomiting. Severity of nausea was evaluated by the patient on a daily basis (for the preceding 24 h) using a 100-mm horizontal visual analog scale (VAS). The left end (0 mm) was labeled as &#x02018;no nausea&#x02019;, and the right end (100 mm) was labeled as &#x02018;nausea as bad as it could be&#x02019;.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was complete response (CR: no emesis, no rescue medication) during the overall (0&#x02013;120 h) phase post-chemotherapy.

The safety analysis population consisted of all patients who received at least one study treatment and had at least one safety assessment after treatment administration.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis was carried out using a logistic regression adjusted for gender, where each dose of NEPA was compared with PALO alone. The Holm&#x02013;Bonferroni method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. The same logistic regression analysis adjusting for gender was utilized for the secondary efficacy endpoints with no adjustments for multiplicity. A post hoc logistic regression analysis comparing the exploratory APR arm with PALO was also carried out for the efficacy endpoints.

All NEPA dose groups also showed superior CR rates during the delayed phase; however, only NEPA<sub>300</sub> was superior to PALO during the acute phase.</p><p>While the NEPA<sub>100</sub> group may be the minimally effective dose based on the primary CR results, NEPA<sub>300</sub> consistently showed an incremental clinical benefit over the lower NEPA doses for all secondary efficacy endpoints. Although these endpoints were not adjusted for multiple comparisons, NEPA<sub>300</sub> was superior to PALO for no emesis, no significant nausea, and complete protection rates during all phases.</p><p>The CR rate in the PALO control arm was higher than the rates of CR noted in the control arm of earlier trials in HEC evaluating older 5-HT<sub>3</sub> RAs with or without the addition of APR [<xref rid="MDU110C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Despite the excellent control rates observed for the PALO control group, the magnitude of benefit associated with the NEPA regimens would still be considered to be clinically relevant (i.e. at least 10 absolute percentage points) during the acute/delayed/overall phases.</p><p>An exploratory APR-containing arm was included in this trial. The APR arm showed higher CR and no emesis rates compared with PALO during the delayed/overall phases. However, APR was not superior to PALO for CR during the acute phase, nor for no significant nausea and complete protection during any time post-chemotherapy.</p><p>NEPA arms showed a comparable safety profile to PALO and APR with a similar incidence of adverse events and ECG changes. The adverse event profile was consistent with that for an oncology patient population receiving HEC. All doses of NEPA were very well tolerated with no evidence of a dose response for adverse events, a very low incidence of serious events, and one unrelated death.</p><p>Despite the gratifying progress made over the past two decades in developing more effective means to prevent CINV, a number of significant challenges remain. As nausea remains a key issue in CINV control with all currently available agents [<xref rid="MDU110C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it is noted that NEPA<sub>300</sub> was superior to PALO for the prevention of significant nausea. These results should encourage further studies with NEPA in which the control of nausea is the primary endpoint. In addition, certain higher risk groups (e.g. women, younger patients, and non-ethanol consumers) remain susceptible to CINV. While the CR rates were generally lower for females than males, the superiority of NEPA over PALO existed for both genders. While it is well established that implementation of antiemetic guidelines improves CINV control for patients, unfortunately, adherence to guidelines remains unacceptably low [<xref rid="MDU110C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. NEPA may improve guideline adherence by providing an all oral single pill of the guideline-recommended antiemetic drug combination for patients at higher risk for CINV. In doing so, NEPA offers the potential to improve effectiveness of antiemetic control without compromising efficacy or safety.</p><p>In conclusion, the NEPA antiemetic regimens significantly improved prevention of CINV in patients receiving cisplatin-based HEC. While all NEPA doses were highly effective and well tolerated, when considering all endpoints and time intervals, NEPA<sub>300</sub> was the most effective dose combination. Based on these findings, the NEPA<sub>300</sub> (NETU/PALO) fixed-dose combination was selected for continued development in the phase 3 program.</p></sec><sec id="mdu110_s5"><title>funding</title><p>This work was supported by Helsinn Healthcare, SA, who provided the study drugs and the funding for this study.</p></sec><sec id="mdu110_s6"><title>disclosure</title><p>The authors have the following conflicts of interest to disclose: PH: non-compensated consultant for Helsinn Healthcare.
