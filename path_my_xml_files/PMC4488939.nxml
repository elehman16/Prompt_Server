Organ dysfunction including sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia is prevalent among sepsis patients, resulting in increasing mortality rates. Considering the clinical role of platelets, thrombocytopenia in sepsis has led to a large spend in research activity and clinical trials in this area, yet there is no consensus upon which treatment should be administered. As a result, platelet transfusion is often indicated to resolve low platelet counts, leading to an increasing risk of the multiple risks transfusion brings, such as infectious or immune system complications. Given the role of thrombopoietin in stimulating proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, our previous study investigated the potential benefits of recombinant human thrombopoietin in severe sepsis patients with thrombocytopenia. However, there are several limitations in the study, which may have led to bias in our conclusion. Thus, we are conducting this study in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human thrombopoietin in a large, varied population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is designed as a randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in tertiary academic centers for evaluating the safety and efficacy of recombinant human thrombopoietin over placebo. An established total of 708 patients with sepsis and thrombocytopenia will undergo prospective random assignment to recombinant human thrombopoietin or placebo (a 1:1 ratio). The primary endpoint is 7-day all-cause mortality and 28-day all-cause mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of recombinant human thrombopoietin among severe sepsis patients with thrombocytopenia in a varied population. With our study, the level of evidence for the treatment of these patients will be significantly raised.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02094248?term=NCT02094248&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02094248</ext-link>.

It is characterized by the cardinal signs of inflammation, including vasodilation, increased microvascular permeability and cell dysfunctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite their small size and anucleate status, platelets have diverse roles in vascular biology during sepsis. Not only are platelets the cellular mediator of thrombosis, but platelets are also immune cells that initiate and accelerate many vascular inflammatory conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Due to a response to a systemic bacterial infection, continued platelet activation in sepsis patients is prevalent, leading to sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Researches have suggested that the declining platelet counts (PCs) are associated with mortalities among sepsis patients caused by various diseases, indicating the importance of recovering from thrombocytopenia during sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>To date, evidence-based treatment strategies for sepsis-associated thrombocytopenia have not yet reached consensus for clinical practice. The management of thrombocytopenia remains a challenge. In the guidelines of surviving sepsis, platelet transfusion is advised to be administered when PCs are below 10 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L in the absence of apparent bleeding or below 20 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L if the patient has a significant risk of bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies have reported that early recovery from thrombocytopenia helps to prevent coagulopathy and decreases the mortality rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Taking all of the above into account, more aggressive approaches to reverse the pathophysiological process of thrombocytopenia in severe sepsis are indeed required.</p><p>Several growth factors are involved in the process of platelet generation. Among them, thrombopoietin, which has been identified for its ability to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes, has been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recent study has demonstrated the role of thrombopoietin as an effective stimulus for promoting hematopoietic stem cells when administered before radiotherapy to minimize hematopoietic stem cell injury and mutagenesis in mice, indicating the varied potentials of this factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Our previous study demonstrated that administration of recombinant human thrombopoietin (rhTPO) with conventional medical therapies could significantly improve the PCs in severe sepsis patients with thrombocytopenia and effectively reduce the platelet transfusion possibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We also observed significantly different mortality rates between the intervention group and the control group. This previous study is a single-center non-randomized prospective study. There are several limitations in the study, which may have led to bias in our conclusion. Thus, we have designed a clinical study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of rhTPO in a large, varied population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of this study is to determine the safety profile and efficacy profile of rhTPO in a large, varied severe sepsis population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is designed as a randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled, multi-center study in 17 tertiary academic medical centers. The sites that are participating in this study are medical, surgical or emergency ICUs. Patient enrollment is expected to last up to 18 months. The end of the study is defined by the last follow-up of the last enrolled patient. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02094248).</p><p>Qualified patients will be randomized into either of the two groups: the intervention group and the control group. Both groups receive standard care and will receive appropriate medical support based on guidelines issued by the surviving sepsis campaign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The intervention group will receive administration of rhTPO (TPIAO&#x02122;, Shenyang Sunshine Pharmaceutical Company Limited (SUNSHINE), Shenyang, China). The rhTPO will be subcutaneously injected in the intervention group after randomization. The dose is 15,000 U per day. The subcutaneous injection will be terminated when PCs are increased by 50 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L for 2 consecutive days compared with PCs at baseline. The duration of rhTPO will be 7 days. Time from randomization to administration of rhTPO will be within 24 hours.</p><p>Patients in the control group will receive the equal amount of normal saline, which will be subcutaneously injected as a placebo. The normal amount of saline is 1 ml per day for the initial stage and the maintenance stage. The subcutaneous injection will be terminated after 7 days. Time from randomization to administration of placebo will also be within 24 h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>A principle investigator, assisted by a well-trained study coordinator in each participating center, will identify potentially eligible patients based on the eligibility criteria. And they, in collaboration with the treating physician, will confirm patient eligibility for the trial. The study coordinator will then obtain written informed consent from the patient. Patients will be consecutively enrolled at each of the participating centers whenever a study coordinator is available for enrollment. Consent will be obtained from participating clinicians before or at the time of patient consent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Eligibility and exclusion criteria</title><p>The detailed eligibility and exclusion criteria are listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Eligible, non-randomized patients</title><p>Eligible, non-randomized patients will be those who meet all inclusion criteria but are not included in the trial because of refusal of consent or inability to obtain consent within 12 h of the patient meeting the eligibility criteria.

Assessments are made at the screening period, inclusion (D0) and on days 1 to 7. Assessments include sepsis-related organ failure assessment, monitoring (catheter, tubes and drains, mechanical ventilation procedures), laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, pregnancy test at inclusion only), and microbiology (blood cultures, mycology). Data on adverse events, compliance and concomitant treatments are collected at each visit. We will determine vital status among survivors at 28 days following randomization through chart review and direct contact with patients if necessary. Participants will be evaluated every day till the seventh day after randomization. Physicians and research nurses who are not involved in the patients&#x02019; care will assess the outcome.</p><p>All documents collected in this study will be stored safely in confidential conditions. On all study-specific documents, other than the signed consent, the participant will be referred to by the study participant number/code, not by name. Study documentation will be archived for a period of 5 years after the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Adverse events</title><p>All adverse events will be recorded and closely monitored until resolution or stabilization or until it has been shown that the study treatment is not the cause of the event. The chief investigator will be informed immediately of any serious adverse events and will determine (in cooperation with the treating medical practitioners) the seriousness and causality of these events.</p><p>All treatment-related serious adverse events will be recorded and reported to the research Ethics Committee as part of the report. Unexpected serious adverse events will be reported to the research Ethics Committee within the relevant time frames. The chief investigator will be responsible for all adverse event reporting. All site staff will be appropriately trained in the procedures to follow and the forms to use during the study protocol prior to study initiation. Regular central monitoring for all studies and site monitoring, as determined by the trial-specific risk assessment, will be used to ensure that all adverse events are identified and acted on appropriately.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>The all-cause mortality of sepsis varies in different patient populations. The mortality of 28-day ranges from 20.8% to 61% but no reliable 7-day mortality has been reported to our knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Using the 28-day mortality in our center, we assumed that the 7-day mortality is 40%. Our sample size was calculated to detect a 10% difference in mortality at day 7 between the two groups with a two-tailed test, a significance level (alpha) of 5% and a power of 80%. We plan to include a total of 708 subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Type of analysis</title><p>We will utilize an intention-to-treat approach to examine differences in the mortality in the two groups in the primary analysis by the Pearson &#x003c7;2 test. Safety parameters and secondary efficacy parameters will be analyzed using the Pearson &#x003c7;2 test and logistic regression (if necessary). Cox proportional hazards models and the Kaplan-Meier method will also be applied.

There is a possibility that the positive effect of rhTPO just lies among the surgical patients. For medical septic patients (for example pneumonia-derived sepsis), the role of rhTPO might be different. Thus, a placebo group in which physiological serum is administered could provide baseline data for the whole population. Also, the placebo group could be used to conduct a patient stratification analysis at the end of the study. So this study is designed as an open-label study and physiological serum is used as a placebo.
