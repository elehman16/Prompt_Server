This trial assesses (a) the impact of financial incentives on uptake and completion of an HPV vaccination program, and (b) whether impacts are moderated by participants&#x02019; deprivation level. It also assesses the impact of incentives on decision quality to get vaccinated, as measured by attitudes toward the vaccination and knowledge of its consequences. <bold><italic>Method:</italic></bold> One thousand 16- to 18-year-old girls were invited to participate in an HPV vaccination program: 500 previously uninvited, and 500 unresponsive to previous invitations. Girls randomly received either a standard invitation letter or a letter including the offer of vouchers worth &#x000a3;45 (&#x020ac;56; $73) for undergoing 3 vaccinations. Girls attending their first vaccination appointment completed a questionnaire assessing decision quality to be vaccinated. Outcomes were uptake of the first and third vaccinations and decision quality. <bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> The intervention increased uptake of the first (first-time invitees: 28.4% vs. 19.6%, odds ratio [<italic>OR</italic>] = 1.63, 95% confidence interval [CI; 1.08, 2.47]; previous nonattenders: 23.6% vs. 10.4%, <italic>OR</italic> = 2.65, 95% CI [1.61, 4.38]) and third (first-time invitees: 22.4% vs. 12%, <italic>OR</italic> = 2.15, 95% CI [1.32, 3.50]; previous nonattenders: 12.4% vs. 3%, <italic>OR</italic> = 4.28, 95% CI [1.92, 9.55]) vaccinations. Impacts were not moderated by deprivation level. Decision quality was unaffected by the intervention. <bold><italic>Conclusions:</italic></bold> Although the intervention increased completion of HPV vaccinations, uptake remained lower than the national target, which, in addition to cost effectiveness and acceptability issues, necessitates consideration of other ways of achieving it.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>financial incentives</kwd><kwd>vouchers</kwd><kwd>HPV vaccination</kwd><kwd>human papillomavirus</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a ubiquitous sexually transmitted virus that could lead to cervical cancer (<xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" id="cr5-1">Brabin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c44" ref-type="bibr" id="cr44-1">Moscicki et al., 1998</xref>), the second most common cancer in women worldwide (<xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" id="cr17-1">Ferlay et al., 2010</xref>).

The degree of protection afforded by incomplete immunization is currently unknown (<xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" id="cr69-1">Widdice, Bernstein, Leonard, Marsolo, &#x00026; Kahn, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Since September 2008, a national program has been implemented in England and Wales, United Kingdom, aiming to vaccinate girls aged 12 to 13 years against HPV. A 2-year &#x0201c;catch-up&#x0201d; campaign targeting 17- to 18-year-old girls has also been initiated. The objective of these vaccination programs is to provide three doses of the HPV vaccine to females before they become sexually active, when the risk of HPV infection and subsequent cervical cancer development increases. It is estimated that if this objective is met and vaccination coverage is sufficiently high (80% of the target population), up to 400 deaths per year in England could be prevented (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-1">Sheridan, White, Barlow, &#x00026; Soldan, 2010</xref>). Although the national program targeting 12- to 13-year-olds has met the 80% uptake target set by the National Health Service (NHS),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> with 88.1% of girls receiving the first vaccination, and 80.1% receiving the third, the catch-up campaign targeting 17- to 18-year-olds has resulted in below-target uptake, with 62.2% of girls receiving the first vaccination and only 31.8% receiving the third (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-2">Sheridan et al., 2010</xref>). Apart from these cohort differences, uptake of the HPV vaccine in England is also marked by social inequalities, with girls living in deprived areas and from ethnic minority backgrounds being less likely to get vaccinated (<xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr" id="cr52-1">Roberts et al., 2011</xref>). Women from these populations are also more likely to develop cervical cancer (<xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr" id="cr60-1">Shack, Jordan, Thomson, Mak, &#x00026; M&#x000f8;ller, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Offering girls financial incentives to undergo the HPV vaccination could increase uptake rates. Financial incentives are increasingly being considered and used in health care policies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in an attempt to improve health (<xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" id="cr30-1">Lagarde, Haines, &#x00026; Palmer, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" id="cr31-1">Le Grand, 2008</xref>). They are most effective in promoting &#x0201c;one-off&#x0201d; behaviors, such as getting vaccinated (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-1">Achat, Mcintyre, &#x00026; Burgess, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-1">Seal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-1">Sutherland, Christianson, &#x00026; Leatherman, 2008</xref>). Indeed, findings from systematic reviews suggest that financial incentives can increase uptake of recommended vaccinations by both adults and children (<xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-1">Briss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" id="cr20-1">Giuffrida &#x00026; Torgerson, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" id="cr28-1">Kane, Johnson, Town, &#x00026; Butler, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr" id="cr45-1">Ndiaye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr" id="cr63-1">Stone et al., 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-2">Sutherland et al., 2008</xref>). Their effectiveness is predicted to depend on recipients&#x02019; level of social and material deprivation. Consequently, one potential advantage of using financial incentives to promote health is that they may be more effective in motivating behavior change in the most socially deprived (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-3">Sutherland et al., 2008</xref>). When applied to HPV-vaccination programs, incentives therefore have the potential not only to improve the below-target uptake rates but also to reduce social inequalities. Most of the calls to use incentives in HPV-vaccination programs in the United Kingdom, however, have focused on incentivizing vaccination providers (e.g., general practitioners) rather than vaccination recipients (<xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr" id="cr65-1">Tanday, 2008</xref>). The effectiveness of financial incentives in this latter context is therefore currently unknown. Furthermore, no studies have assessed the role of social deprivation in the moderation of the impact of financial incentives on vaccination uptake.</p><p>The exact mechanisms by which financial incentives operate to influence behavior, including vaccination uptake, are currently unknown. In theory, they are likely to work via learning-theory principles, by linking the target behavior to a positively evaluated stimulus (e.g., a reward with monetary value), thus strengthening the value associated with it (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-1">Marteau, 2010</xref>). From an economics perspective, this increases the utility gained from performing the target behavior, thus providing an impetus for individuals to act (<xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" id="cr7-1">Camerer &#x00026; Hogarth, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" id="cr11-1">Dawes, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" id="cr21-1">Hertwig &#x00026; Ortmann, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" id="cr32-1">Lopes, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr" id="cr71-1">Zwick, Erev, &#x00026; Budescu, 1999</xref>). At the same time, financial incentives might work by shifting people&#x02019;s expectations of the likely consequences of the target behavior in a positive direction, or by facilitating allocation of limited cognitive capacity, in such a way as to achieve the now more highly valued target behavior (<xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" id="cr36-2">Marteau, 2010</xref>). These possibilities suggest that financial incentives may enable people to overcome the costs and barriers associated with initiating the target behavior and/or shift their perception of the related cost&#x02013;benefit ratio, such that the benefits of performing the related behavior outweigh the costs. Certain theories, such as motivation crowding theory (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-1">Frey &#x00026; Jegen, 2001</xref>) and cognitive evaluation theory (<xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" id="cr13-1">Deci &#x00026; Ryan, 1985</xref>), predict that the offer of incentives might sometimes have the opposite effect to the one intended. However, the extent to which this can occur in the context of health-related behaviors has been questioned (<xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" id="cr50-1">Promberger &#x00026; Marteau, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Even if effective in increasing uptake of HPV vaccinations, the use of financial incentives in HPV-vaccination programs will need to be considered in the context of their possible negative consequences. Unlike most interventions designed to change behavior, the use of financial incentives raises particular concerns regarding their potentially adverse effects on the quality of people&#x02019;s decisions to engage in incentivized behaviors. For example, it has been argued that the prospect of receiving a financial reward could result in the risks associated with the incentivized behavior being overlooked (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-1">Marteau, Ashcroft, &#x00026; Oliver, 2009</xref>). This is particularly relevant to behaviors associated with physical and/or psychological side effects, such as getting vaccinated. To date, no known studies have assessed the impact of financial incentives on the quality of decisions to engage in incentivized behaviors.</p><p>Assessing the quality of health-related decisions is important, as it allows predictions to be made regarding the psychological and physiological adjustment of patients (<xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" id="cr26-1">Johnston &#x00026; V&#x000f6;gele, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-1">Marteau, Dormandy, &#x00026; Michie, 2001</xref>). One way to judge the quality of a decision to engage in a behavior is to assess whether it represents an informed choice. An informed choice has been operationally defined as one that is based on knowledge of the relevant information, is consistent with the decision-maker&#x02019;s values, and is behaviorally implemented (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-2">Marteau et al., 2001</xref>). These three dimensions of informed choice are also echoed in definitions of informed decision making (<xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" id="cr4-1">Bekker, Hewison, &#x00026; Thornton, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" id="cr16-1">Dowie, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" id="cr22-1">Irwig, McCaffery, Salkeld, &#x00026; Bossuyt, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" id="cr25-1">Jepson, Hewison, Thompson, &#x00026; Weller, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" id="cr51-1">Rimer, Briss, Zeller, Chan, &#x00026; Woolf, 2004</xref>) and clinical decision quality (<xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" id="cr59-1">Sepucha, Fowler, &#x00026; Mulley, 2004</xref>). Using this operationalization a multidimensional measure of informed choice has been developed (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-3">Marteau et al., 2001</xref>), validated (<xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" id="cr42-1">Michie, Dormandy, &#x00026; Marteau, 2002</xref>), and used to assess the quality of decisions in the context of screening (e.g., <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" id="cr14-1">Dormandy, Michie, Hooper, &#x00026; Marteau, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" id="cr15-1">Dormandy, Tsui, &#x00026; Marteau, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" id="cr24-1">Jaques, Sheffield, &#x00026; Halliday, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" id="cr29-1">Kellar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" id="cr41-1">Mathieu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr" id="cr43-1">Michie, Dormandy, &#x00026; Marteau, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="c62" ref-type="bibr" id="cr62-1">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). Given that both screening and vaccination uptake involve preventative behaviors with potential side effects, this measure can readily be used to assess decision quality in the context of HPV vaccination uptake.</p><p>The present study is the first trial that addresses the aforementioned uncertainties with regard to the use of financial incentives in HPV vaccination programs. The specific aims of this trial are (a) to assess the impact of financial incentives on initial uptake and completion of an HPV-vaccination program, and (b) to examine whether the impact of financial incentives on uptake and completion of an HPV-vaccination program is moderated by recipients&#x02019; level of social deprivation. The trial further aims to assess the impact of financial incentives on the quality of decisions to be vaccinated, as measured by participants&#x02019; attitudes toward the vaccination and their knowledge of its health consequences. It was hypothesized that girls who were offered financial incentives to get vaccinated against HPV would be more likely to receive the first and third HPV vaccinations. Participants&#x02019; level of social deprivation was hypothesized to moderate the effects of financial incentives on uptake of the first and third HPV vaccinations, with larger effects of the incentives being predicted for the most socially deprived. In line with existing concerns, it was further hypothesized that compared with nonincentivized girls, those offered financial incentives would have less positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccination and would be less knowledgeable about its health consequences.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s3"><title>Trial Design</title><p>The present study is is a parallel-group randomized controlled trial.

These are combined into a single deprivation score for each small area in England.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Quality of decisions to undergo vaccinations</title><p>To assess the impact of financial incentives on the quality of decisions to undertake the HPV vaccinations, a short modified version of a validated measure of informed choice was used (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-4">Marteau et al., 2001</xref>), consisting of the following:

Their importance in comparison with the other information presented in the leaflet was judged and determined by a panel of experts. In order to reduce response burden, only three knowledge items were included (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = .64). Similarly, only two out of the four original attitude items were chosen for inclusion&#x02014;one assessing affective attitudes, requesting participants to indicate how good they think the HPV vaccination is and one assessing instrumental attitudes, requesting participants to indicate how harmful they think the HPV vaccination is.

The use of vaccination invitation letters, information leaflets, and reminder text messages were part of the latter&#x02019;s standard health services. Also part of the Primary Care Trust&#x02019;s standard practice is the use of records reflecting attendance in vaccination programs of all eligible patients registered within the Trust. These records are routinely used to create reports. The offer of financial incentives was introduced as part of the Primary Care Trust&#x02019;s innovation in health service development and delivery. Permission to implement the incentive scheme was granted by the Primary Care Trust, which was responsible for all related insurance and indemnity arrangements. Participants&#x02019; anonymity and privacy were protected by the Data Protection Act (<xref rid="c72" ref-type="bibr" id="cr72-1">United Kingdom Parliament, 1998</xref>). The design that Healthy Incentives used was a Zelen design, which involves randomization before consent from participants has been sought. This is used particularly when evaluating the full, unbiased impact of screening interventions, in which knowledge of the trial by control groups may affect outcomes (<xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr" id="cr56-1">Schellings et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="c66" ref-type="bibr" id="cr66-1">Torgerson &#x00026; Roland, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr" id="cr70-1">Zelen, 1979</xref>), such as in the present study. Ethical approval was sought for researchers at King&#x02019;s College London to access data from the BEN Primary Care Trust in order to evaluate the financial incentives scheme and publish relevant findings. This was granted by the BEN Research Ethics Committee (reference 11/WM/0073, April 8, 2011).

To test whether there was a difference in the effect size of the intervention in the two samples, data sets were combined and another logistic regression was conducted, in which sample (i.e., first-time invitees vs. previous nonattenders) was added as a predictor of the model, along with the intervention. The chi-square test was used to test for differences in attrition rates from the first to the third vaccination between the intervention and control groups. Differences in knowledge of the HPV vaccination between intervention and control groups were tested using the chi-square test, and differences in attitudes toward the HPV vaccination were examined using one-way analysis of variance.

Contrary to predictions, these effects did not vary with level of social deprivation. Also contrary to predictions, there was no evidence to suggest that girls&#x02019; attitudes toward the HPV vaccination and their knowledge of its health consequences were affected by the offer of financial incentives.</p><sec id="s26"><title>Meaning of the Results</title><p>Findings from the current study are consistent with previous research demonstrating the effectiveness of financial incentives in promoting immunizations (<xref rid="c1" ref-type="bibr" id="cr1-2">Achat et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" id="cr6-2">Briss et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-3">Seal et al., 2003</xref>). Incentives may have operated by increasing the anticipated benefits of attending vaccination appointments sufficiently to overcome any perceived barriers. One of the barriers most strongly predicting uptake of the HPV vaccination is cost (<xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" id="cr9-1">Conroy et al., 2009</xref>). Although HPV vaccinations are free as part of normal care in the United Kingdom, getting vaccinated entails expenses, such as transport costs for attending clinics. Incentives may have operated by removing such financial barriers. Indeed, it has been shown that patients often use their rewards to cover expenses related to engaging in the target health behavior (<xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" id="cr48-1">Post, Cruz, &#x00026; Harman, 2006</xref>). Girls in the current study could not use their incentives to directly pay for their transportation costs, as the incentives were offered in the form of vouchers. However, anecdotal evidence from a voucher-based incentive scheme targeting smoking cessation during pregnancy (<xref rid="c33" ref-type="bibr" id="cr33-1">Mantzari, Vogt, &#x00026; Marteau, 2012a</xref>) suggests that incentivized individuals often engage in mental accounting, according to which transportation costs are deducted from the value of the vouchers in order to determine net gains.</p><p>The incentives increased uptake of the vaccination by 10%, a surplus that the intervention maintained throughout completion of the program, without reducing attrition between the first and third vaccinations. This finding could be taken as an indication of the superior effectiveness of the initial incentive, which may have been sufficient in maintaining the higher uptake rates without the subsequent incentives. It is not possible, however, to infer exactly how removal of the additional incentives would have affected the results. The relative effectiveness of the incentives for each HPV vaccination should be examined in future research.</p><p>One potential advantage of financial incentives is that they may be more effective in motivating behavior change in the most socially deprived (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-4">Sutherland et al., 2008</xref>). Contrary to such predictions, however, social deprivation did not moderate the effect of incentives in the present study. Perhaps the role of social deprivation depends on the type of behavior being targeted, and might therefore be limited in modifying the impact of incentives on uptake of the HPV vaccinations. It is also possible, however, that this finding is related to the measure of social deprivation used in this study. Although IMD scores have been previously used to assess participants&#x02019; level of deprivation (<xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" id="cr39-1">Marteau et al., 2010</xref>), current findings may have resulted from the use of a proxy rather than a direct measure of social deprivation. Alternatively, it is possible that the range of social deprivation in the current study was too limited to allow for an effect to be detected. Future studies should aim to include participants to reflect a wider range of socioeconomic statuses.</p><p>Although the intervention in the present study was effective in promoting the HPV vaccination, the highest uptake rates observed were 28.4% for the first vaccination and 22.4% for the third (by first-time invitees in the intervention group). These figures are well below the 80% uptake target set by the NHS. They are also considerably lower than the attendance rates for the catch-up program in the BEN Primary Care Trust, where this trial was run (72.2% for the first vaccination, and 34.2% for the third; <xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-5">Sheridan et al., 2010</xref>), as reported by the U.K. Department of Health (DH). The reasons underlying these differences in rates of uptake are unknown. A number of explanations are possible: First, they may reflect cohort differences. For example, the DH report refers to the attendance rates of 17- and 18-year-olds, whereas participants in the present study were aged 16 to 18 years (additional analyses revealed no effect of age on uptake). Second, they may reflect differences in the methods of patient recruitment and delivery of the HPV-vaccination programs. For example, delivery of HPV vaccinations through general practitioners is less effective compared with delivery through schools (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-6">Sheridan et al., 2010</xref>). Third, they may reflect issues with the reliability of the data reported in the DH report or the Primary Care Trust&#x02019;s records. Anecdotal reports suggest that the latter&#x02019;s records were not up-to-date, with girls who had already received the HPV vaccination through schools being invited for the present scheme; similar errors might have occurred when feeding figures into the DH report.</p></sec><sec id="s27"><title>Strengths</title><p>The main strength of this study is its novelty. It is the first study to assess the effectiveness of financial incentives for increasing uptake of the HPV vaccinations. It is also the first study, to our knowledge, that assesses deprivation level as a moderator of a financial incentive scheme. The incentive scheme used was designed to maximize retention: Unlike other studies that have offered fixed-value rewards for each vaccination (<xref rid="c58" ref-type="bibr" id="cr58-4">Seal et al., 2003</xref>), larger incentives (&#x000a3;20) were offered at the beginning and end of the program, to motivate participants to initiate and complete the vaccinations.</p></sec><sec id="s28"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although the results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of financial incentives in increasing initial uptake of the HPV vaccination, they do not allow conclusive inferences to be made regarding the absolute impact of incentives on completion of the program. Girls in the intervention groups received reminder text messages prior to their second and third vaccination appointments. Due to an error made by the administration team, these reminder messages were not delivered to girls in the control groups. Vaccine recall and reminder systems are known to increase vaccination rates (<xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" id="cr23-1">Jacobson Vann &#x00026; Szilagyi, 2005</xref>). It is therefore possible that the higher uptake rates of the third vaccination by the intervention groups are attributable to the reminder text messages, with incentives having no additional effect. This seems unlikely, given that incentives work best in combination with reminder systems and standing orders (<xref rid="c64" ref-type="bibr" id="cr64-5">Sutherland et al., 2008</xref>). Future research should examine the contribution of these interventions separately.</p><p>Our findings provide no evidence to suggest that financial incentives compromise the quality of decisions to engage in an incentivized behavior, with incentivized and nonincentivized girls&#x02019; attitudes toward the vaccination being similarly positive and their knowledge of its consequences similarly high. Perhaps the total amount girls could receive (&#x000a3;45) was not large enough to unduly influence their decision to get vaccinated had they held strong views against doing so. However, some limitations associated with the measurement of informed choice in this study reduce the certainty of the conclusions that can be drawn. First, as mentioned previously, we used a simplified version of a measure of informed choice originally developed and validated for use in the context of screening. The resulting measure may not have been sensitive enough to adequately assess informed choice in relation to HPV vaccination uptake. Further research is needed to validate the measure for use in this specific context. Second, the reliability of the measure was relatively low (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; = 0.63). Although related concerns might be partially alleviated by the questionable stability and appropriateness of the alpha coefficient for two-item scales (<xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" id="cr10-1">Cramer, Atwood, &#x00026; Stoner, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" id="cr46-1">O&#x02019;Brien, Buikstra, &#x00026; Hegney, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" id="cr55-1">Sainfort &#x00026; Booske, 2000</xref>; <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr" id="cr67-1">Verhoef, 2003</xref>), interpretation of the relevant findings nonetheless requires caution. Third, the measure relied on assessment of attitudes as a proxy of values, which, according to the operational definition of informed choice, need to be congruent with choices (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-6">Marteau et al., 2001</xref>). Although attitudes have been argued to reflect values (<xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-7">Marteau et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr" id="cr53-1">Rokeach, 1968</xref>), the extent to which their measurement captures core values as traditionally conceptualized and measured (e.g., <xref rid="c54" ref-type="bibr" id="cr54-1">Rokeach, 1973</xref>; <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr" id="cr57-1">Schwartz, 1992</xref>) is unknown (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-1">Marteau, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the measurement of attitudes alone provides little understanding of the potentially conflicting values individuals may hold when considering health-related decisions and how these affect their ability to make informed choices (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-2">Marteau, 2009</xref>). Further research is needed that will lead to the development of measures that better capture the values that underlie human health-related decisions (<xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" id="cr35-3">Marteau, 2009</xref>), which will, in turn, lead to more valid assessments of decision quality. Fourth, girls&#x02019; knowledge of the vaccination&#x02019;s side effects was not assessed in this study. Consequently, no inferences can be made about whether the offer of a financial reward results in the risks associated with the incentivized behavior being overlooked (<xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" id="cr37-2">Marteau et al., 2009</xref>). Another limitation is related to the timing of assessment. Girls were requested to complete the measure of informed choice once they had decided to get vaccinated. It is therefore possible that their attitudes toward the vaccination might have been influenced by their decision to receive it, rather than being a predictor of that decision. Furthermore, assessing related attitudes and knowledge after the offer of financial incentives does not allow inferences to be made regarding the mechanisms by which incentives might have influenced the decision-making process. For example, it remains uncertain whether incentives facilitated girls with positive attitudes toward the vaccination to act in line with their values or whether the incentives changed the girls&#x02019; attitudes to make them more positive. Furthermore, by not having measures of attitudes by nonattenders, the insights afforded by such a comparison with attenders were not possible. Future research should aim to assess individuals&#x02019; knowledge and values related to an incentivized behavior before incentives are offered. Including subsequent behavior in the assessment, as proposed by <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" id="cr38-8">Marteau et al. (2001)</xref>, will allow for a more valid assessment of informed choice and will help elucidate the mechanisms by which incentives influence health-related decisions. Finally, our findings do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the possibility of incentives to negatively influence autonomy and people&#x02019;s ability to voluntarily make decisions, and thus coerce them, as the measure of informed choice did not directly tap into these concepts. Further research should aim to complement the assessment of informed choice with measures that allow for a more direct and precise assessment of whether incentives are coercive and undermine autonomous choices, such as the Decisional Conflict Scale (<xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" id="cr47-1">O&#x02019;Connor, 1995</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s29"><title>Implications</title><p>While the incentive scheme increased uptake of HPV vaccinations, it is unknown whether such effects can be achieved in more cost-effective and acceptable ways. Other HPV-vaccination programs, such as those rolled out in schools (<xref rid="c61" ref-type="bibr" id="cr61-7">Sheridan et al., 2010</xref>), have achieved higher uptake rates than those achieved in this trial, without the expense of vouchers. Before the use of incentives is considered for wider implementation, research is needed to determine the optimal incentive value and delivery schedule for achieving maximum vaccination rates, supplemented with a formal cost-effectiveness analysis. Such cost-effectiveness analyses will need to take into account the extent to which the use of incentives might result in unintended consequences. These include (a) the potentially adverse effect of incentives on intrinsic motivation (<xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" id="cr12-1">Deci, Koestner, &#x00026; Ryan, 1999</xref>), which might reduce the likelihood of individuals engaging in future health-related behaviors without the offer of rewards, and (b) the possibility for the offer of incentives to result in people refusing to adopt the incentivized behavior due to arousal of suspicion (<xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr" id="cr19-2">Frey &#x00026; Jegen, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Even if cost effective, the use of incentives for increasing HPV vaccinations will depend on their acceptability to policymakers, health professionals, and the public.
