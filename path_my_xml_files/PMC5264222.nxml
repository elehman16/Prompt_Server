Etanercept is well established and has been widely used in clinical practice for about 15&#x02005;years, with a well-characterised pharmacological, efficacy and safety profile.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref> Originally licensed for use in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the therapeutic indications have been stepwise extended and comprise treatment of patients with polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and also paediatric psoriasis. Recently, etanercept has been also approved for use in non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product that contains a version of the active substance of an already authorised original biological medicinal product (reference medicinal product).

SB4 is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary mammalian cell expression system. Similar structural, physicochemical and biological activities of SB4 and ETN have been shown using state-of-the-art analytical methods including peptide mapping, TNF-&#x003b1; binding assay and TNF-&#x003b1; neutralisation cell-based assay. Equivalence in the pharmacokinetics (PK) between SB4 and ETN was demonstrated in a phase I study conducted in healthy male subjects.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity of SB4 and ETN in patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;75&#x02005;years who have been diagnosed with RA according to the revised 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for &#x02265;6&#x02005;months and &#x02264;15&#x02005;years prior to screening were eligible for the study. Patients had to have active disease defined as &#x02265;6 swollen and &#x02265;6 tender joints and either erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &#x02265;28&#x02005;mm/h or serum C reactive protein (CRP) &#x02265;1.0&#x02005;mg/dL despite methotrexate (MTX) treatment for &#x02265;6&#x02005;months (stable dose of 10&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week for &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks prior to screening). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and oral glucocorticoids (equivalent to &#x02264;10&#x02005;mg prednisolone) were permitted if received at a stable dose for &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks prior to randomisation.</p><p>Major exclusion criteria consisted of previous treatment with any biological agents, history of lymphoproliferative disease, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III/IV) or demyelinating disorders, diagnosis of active tuberculosis (TB) and pregnancy or breast feeding at screening.</p><p>Additional eligibility criteria are listed in online supplementary appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This phase III, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 73 centres across 10 countries in Europe, Latin America and Asia. Patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive 50&#x02005;mg of either SB4 or ETN (see online supplementary appendix 2). Patients self-administered SB4 or ETN once weekly for up to 52&#x02005;weeks via subcutaneous injection. All patients had to take MTX (10&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week) and folic acid (5&#x02013;10&#x02005;mg/week) during the study. This study is currently ongoing, and this report represents efficacy data up to 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment and safety data up to the 24-week interim report data cut-off point (21 July 2014).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was the ACR20 response rate at week 24. Other efficacy endpoints were the ACR50 and ACR70 responses, the numeric index of the ACR response (ACR-N), change in the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28) based on ESR, the area under the curve (AUC) of the ACR-N, AUC of the change in DAS28 and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. Safety endpoints included incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).</p><p>PK analyses were performed in the PK population, which included a subset of patients from pre-designated study sites. Key PK endpoints included serum trough concentration (C<sub>trough</sub>) and area under the concentration&#x02013;time curve during the dosing interval (AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>) at steady state. Serum concentrations were determined using a validated ELISA, and PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analyses (WinNonlin V.5.2 or higher, Pharsight, Mountain View, California, USA).</p><p>Immunogenicity was measured in all patients. The immunogenicity endpoints were incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) and neutralising antibodies (NAbs). A single-assay approach with SB4 tag was used to assess immunogenicity. ADAs were measured using validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, and NAbs were measured using a competitive ligand-binding assay.</p><p>Details on the serum measurement and ADA detection assay can be found in online supplementary appendix 3.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size was determined using the historical data for the equivalence test.

Assuming 20% loss of patients from the PPS, the study required a minimum of 548 randomised patients.</p><p>The primary efficacy analysis for ACR20 response at week 24 was performed on the PPS in which patients completed week 24 visit, received 80&#x02013;120% of both the expected number of study drug administrations and the expected sum of MTX doses, and did not have any major protocol deviations affecting the efficacy assessment. To declare the equivalence between the two treatment groups, the 95% CI of the adjusted treatment difference had to be entirely contained within the equivalence margin of &#x02212;15% to 15%. The 95% CI of the difference of ACR20 response rates was estimated non-parametrically using the Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel weights for region while adjusting for the baseline CRP. As a sensitivity analysis, the same analysis was repeated for the full analysis set (FAS) with missing data at week 24 considered as non-responses to explore the robustness of the results. Similar analyses were performed for ACR50 and ACR70 responses at week 24. Other secondary endpoints are summarised descriptively.</p><p>In addition, the exponential time&#x02013;response model for ACR20 response rate was used to investigate the treatment difference during the time course of the study up to week 24.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Details on the time&#x02013;response model are provided in online supplementary appendix 4.</p><p>Safety and immunogenicity endpoints were analysed descriptively on the safety set that included all patients who received at least one dose of study drug.

The ACR20 response rate, ACR-N and DAS28 were measured at several different time points early in the treatment period. The time&#x02013;response curves of SB4 and ETN up to week 24 showing the ACR20 response over time were estimated to be equivalent, and the AUC of ACR-N up to week 24 and AUC of the change in DAS28 (ESR) from baseline up to week 24 were comparable between SB4 and ETN, indicating that the efficacy of SB4 over time was similar to ETN.</p><p>Overall, the safety profile of SB4 was comparable with that of ETN and was similar to those observed in the pivotal trials with ETN. There were no cases of active TB and only one patient in SB4 and four patients in ETN reported serious infection, which is lower than 6.3% shown in ETN product information.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Malignancies were reported in three (1.0%) patients in SB4 and one (0.3%) patient in ETN.

<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Interestingly, ISRs were reported in fewer patients from SB4 compared with ETN (3.7% vs 17.2%).

<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Although it is unclear why the incidence of ISR was lower in SB4 compared with ETN, the difference in drug product formulation and container closure system may have contributed to the lower ISR. The only difference in drug composition between SB4 and ETN is the absence of L-arginine in SB4. It has not been shown that L-arginine is associated with increased risk of ISR; however, we cannot preclude the sole difference in formulation (absence of L-arginine) as the cause of ISR. In addition, natural rubber latex known to cause hypersensitivity reactions has not been used in the needle shield of SB4. There appears to be no correlation between ISR and ADA development, which is consistent with previously conducted studies.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In this study, C<sub>trough</sub> and steady state PK was investigated in a subset of population to provide supporting evidence to the phase I comparative PK study in healthy subjects, which demonstrated similar PK behaviour. In the phase III study, the C<sub>trough</sub> values were comparable between SB4 and ETN at each time point and AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> at steady state was relatively higher in SB4 compared with ETN; however, the numerical difference is likely due to an inherent high inter-subject variability (37.7% vs 50.1%).</p><p>The incidence of ADA shown in the ETN group of this study (13.1%) is seemingly higher compared with what has been reported in the previous studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this study, the assay used to detect immunogenicity was more sensitive and immunogenicity was measured more frequently; most of the ADAs were detected at week 4 in this study while immunogenicity was not measured at these time points in the previous studies and could have resulted in higher overall incidence of ADA in this study.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Since SB4 tagged single-assay approach was used to detect immunogenicity, the assay method does not seem to have caused the lower incidence of ADA observed in SB4 compared with ETN (0.7% vs 13.1%).
