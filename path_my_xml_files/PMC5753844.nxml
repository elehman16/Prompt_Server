This article describes the preparatory simulation study for a Bayesian response-adaptive dose-finding trial design. Dexamethasone for Excessive Menstruation aims to assess the efficacy of Dexamethasone in reducing excessive menstrual bleeding and to determine the best dose for further study. To maximise learning about the dose response, patients receive placebo or an active dose with randomisation probabilities adapting based on evidence from patients already recruited. The dose-response relationship is estimated using a flexible Bayesian Normal Dynamic Linear Model. Several competing design options were considered including: number of doses, proportion assigned to placebo, adaptation criterion, and number and timing of adaptations. We performed a fractional factorial study using SAS software to simulate virtual trial data for candidate adaptive designs under a variety of scenarios and to invoke WinBUGS for Bayesian model estimation. We analysed the simulated trial results using Normal linear models to estimate the effects of each design feature on empirical type I error and statistical power. Our readily-implemented approach using widely available statistical software identified a final design which performed robustly across a range of potential trial scenarios.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dose-finding</kwd><kwd>normal dynamic linear model</kwd><kwd>adaptive design</kwd><kwd>trial design development</kwd><kwd>simulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-0962280215606155"><title>1 Introduction</title><p>Adaptive designs generally offer added flexibility and efficiency over conventional trial designs. However, it is difficult to select the design options that provide an effective adaptive design which is also feasible to implement. Before deciding on a particular design, it is generally advisable to carry out a simulation study.</p><p>The methodology of Bayesian adaptive designs has grown steadily in recent years; alongside this, publications providing guidance on simulation studies for the development of Bayesian response-adaptive designs<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> are a valuable resource. Characterising the properties of competing adaptive designs and choosing a &#x02018;best design&#x02019; to take forward is not a trivial task. In this paper, we describe our experiences from a simulation study which was conducted to develop the response-adaptive dose-finding study design for the MRC-funded Dexamethasone for Excessive Menstruation trial (DexFEM; MRC reference: MR/J003611/1).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-0962280215606155"><title>2 Outline</title><p>A brief account of the background and motivation for the DexFEM study is provided in section 3 along with a description of the methods planned for the analysis of this adaptive trial. The design development study is introduced in section 4 which gives an account of the design options and scenarios that are investigated in the trial simulations. Sections 5 and 6 give details of the simulation engine and the methods used to summarise the simulated trial results. The findings from the design development study are presented in section 7. Section 8 explains the subsequent choice of the adaptive design for DexFEM followed by more general discussion of our approach in a wider context in section 9.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-0962280215606155"><title>3 The DexFEM study</title><p>Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (HMB) is a common problem, yet existing medical treatments are often ineffective. Surgical treatments such as hysterectomy, are unacceptable to many, particularly those who wish to preserve their fertility. DexFEM aims to establish if Dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) taken orally is effective in reducing menstrual blood loss (MBL) in women with heavy menstrual bleeding.</p><p>Women with HMB may have glucocorticoid deficiency in the lining of the womb (endometrium) and as a consequence impaired blood vessel function and increased menstrual blood loss.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> We propose &#x0201c;rescue&#x0201d; of such a deficiency could reduce excessive menstrual bleeding. The published DexFEM protocol provides further details of the trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>The optimal dose for achieving efficacy and few adverse effects is unknown but is likely to be between 0.4&#x02009;mg and 1.8&#x02009;mg per day. The aims of the DexFEM trial are: (1) to establish whether Dexamethasone in this dose range is efficacious in reducing menstrual blood loss and (2) to identify which is the best dose for further study in a later trial.</p><p>To estimate the dose-response curve we aim to enrol up to 108 women with HMB to achieve 100 completers in a response-adaptive, multi-arm, parallel-group dose-finding trial. Participants are randomised to receive either placebo or one of several active doses in the range 0.4&#x02009;mg to 1.8&#x02009;mg. Allocation probabilities are equal across the active doses at the start of recruitment but will be updated for subsequent trial participants as outcome data begin to accrue and information is gathered about the likely shape of the dose-response curve. This strategy has the advantage that more information is obtained in the critical region of the underlying dose-response curve and fewer women are randomised to less effective doses. To limit potential bias in the randomised comparisons at the end of the study due to a drift in participant characteristics across time, the placebo allocation rate will remain constant throughout the study. Thus, the allocation rate to placebo is the only one that is not subject to adaptation.</p><p>Two characteristics of menstrual bleeding research are relevant to DexFEM. (1) <italic>Cycle.</italic> The symptoms of HMB occur only cyclically according to the pattern of menstruation (most usually 5 to 8 days menstruation starting every 26 to 29 days, but variable even within women). In DexFEM, we wish to trial three cycles of treatment. (2) <italic>Outcome</italic>. Following collection of sanitary protection by the patient, laboratory estimation of menstrual blood loss volume for the period can be achieved within a few days of the end of the period making it a suitable outcome for use in an adaptive design. In DexFEM only the second and third treated cycles involve menstrual blood volume measurement.</p><sec id="sec4-0962280215606155"><title>3.1 Modelling the dose-response</title><p>The dose-response curve is estimated using Bayesian methods in a second order Normal Dynamic Linear Model<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (NDLM).

NDLMs also lead to efficiency gains since the treatment effect estimate at a given dose is also informed by that of neighbouring doses.</p><p>The NDLM is specified in terms of an observation equation and an evolution equation.

With our adaptive design we will, while recruitment is still ongoing, apply the NDLM to the available outcome data already accrued to obtain intermediate estimates of the dose-response curve. Evidence of emerging trends can then inform adaptation of randomisation probabilities to the active doses for future trial participants in a way that optimises estimation of the dose-response curve according to some pre-defined criterion. Typically as the trial progresses, more participants are randomised to doses which are emerging as more effective so that the dose-response curve in the range containing these doses may be estimated with greater precision than would have been the case in a conventional design.</p><p>The criterion on which adaptation is based might be a simple rule, for example to allocate future participants using probabilities that are proportional to current effect estimates at each dose level. It might also be a more complex function of the predicted utility of future randomisations at each dose level, for example using a measure of the precision with which the optimal dose level is estimated, or alternatively, a measure of the precision with which efficacy is estimated at the optimal dose level. The criterion should reflect the trial objectives and is likely to differ depending on whether the primary interest is to obtain a robust estimate of the dose-response curve across the entire dose range or just around the optimum dose level. As our second aim is to identify the best dose for further study, we applied a commonly used definition of the optimal dose: the ED95, the smallest dose which achieves at least 95% of the maximum treatment effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6-0962280215606155"><title>4 The design development study</title><p>We aimed to develop a feasible adaptive design: that is, one with a limited number of scheduled adaptations and a specified number of possible doses (to allow the pharmacy to prepare capsules in advance). A balance was therefore needed between satisfying these feasibility criteria and obtaining effective adaptation. To this end, we considered several different designs and assessed the suitability of each for DexFEM in a comprehensive pre-trial simulation study. The aim of the design development study was to generate simulated trial results to characterise the properties of candidate designs in terms of type I error and statistical power and ultimately to identify one design which would perform well across a broad range of scenarios.</p><sec id="sec7-0962280215606155"><title>4.1 Design options</title><sec id="sec8-0962280215606155"><title>4.1.1 Dose levels</title><p>A daily Dexamethasone dose of 1.5&#x02009;mg was used in two small pilot trials, the dose being selected based on experience with the drug in other indications and its planned use for 5-day treatment across repeated menstrual cycles. No safety concerns emerged. The adaptive trial provides an opportunity to estimate the dose-response curve over as wide a dose range as possible. Clinical judgment was that 1.8&#x02009;mg was the maximum dose that should be tested, so the daily dose levels selected for study were 0.4&#x02009;mg, 0.8&#x02009;mg, 1.0&#x02009;mg, 1.2&#x02009;mg, 1.5&#x02009;mg and 1.8&#x02009;mg.</p><p>It was not clear how many doses we could reliably study in the trial.

In practice, a fully sequential design of this sort would be unnecessarily challenging and work-intensive and with little efficiency gain over a simpler design with fewer adaptations (based on what we learned from initial exploratory simulation work). We assessed the performance of designs with one, three and five adaptations over the course of recruitment as well as non-adaptive designs (zero adaptations) for comparison. Within each design, adaptations were scheduled at pre-defined points during the recruitment phase. An example of a design with one adaptation [see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280215606155">Table 1</xref>, section 1.2(b)] is a trial where the first 50 participants are allocated with equal probability to any of the dose levels (including placebo). An interim analysis is then carried out after the 50th participant has been randomised, following which allocation probabilities for subsequent participants are adapted to increase the potential for a successful trial outcome in light of the evidence collected so far. In this example the adaptation was scheduled exactly half-way through the 100 planned randomisations but would adaptations scheduled earlier or later in the recruitment phase perform better, or should they instead be spaced evenly between randomisations throughout recruitment? We assessed the performance of ten adaptation schedules [<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0962280215606155">Table 1</xref>, section 1.2 (a)&#x02013;(j)].</p></sec><sec id="sec10-0962280215606155"><title>4.1.3 Placebo allocation rate</title><p>The placebo allocation probability remained fixed throughout the trial.

The choice of scenarios to be assessed was informed both by empirical data from previous studies and through careful elicitation of expert opinion from the clinical team guided by the Sheffield Elicitation Framework (SHELF<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>).</p><p>The variance of repeated intra-participant MBL measurements, <italic>&#x003c3;<sub>e</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>, was likely to have a large effect on the probability of a successful trial. Data from an observational study<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> suggested normally distributed within-participant errors with a variance of <italic>&#x003c3;<sub>e</sub></italic><sup>2</sup><italic><sup>&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;</italic>17.9&#x02009;mL.

There was also some evidence from this source of increasing variance with greater MBL measurements. Design options were therefore investigated under both homo- and heteroscedastic errors. Heteroscedasticity was induced in the simulated within-participant errors through a simple parametric function of the baseline MBL (Appendix 1) based on empirical data.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>The likely mechanism of a treatment effect on participants' MBL was also considered. Treatment effects in medical research are often modelled as an absolute change independent of baseline levels of the outcome variable. In practice, the health improvement which results from a medical treatment is often dependent on the initial severity of the problem. Generally, treatment of a bigger problem results in greater improvements in absolute terms. Our investigation of candidate designs was therefore extended to include simulated scenarios where the treatment effect was 10% or 20% of the baseline MBL measurement at the most effective dose, for small and large simulated treatment effect magnitudes respectively.</p><p>We did not incorporate the modelling of heteroscedasticity and interactions between treatment effects and baseline MBL levels in the NDLM, yet these were included as plausible scenarios essentially to assess the robustness of the design for these scenarios where the model is misspecified.</p><p>We also included a number of scenarios for the shape of the true dose-response curve and the magnitude of the treatment effect at the maximum-effective dose level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-0962280215606155">Figure 2</xref>). The trial enrolment rate was also believed to be of importance since participants randomised during the follow-up phase of other participants and during the time taken to carry out model re-estimation and adaptation, would not benefit from adaptation. Typically, a fast enrolment rate relative to the length of follow-up will reduce the benefits of using an adaptive design.

Each such trial simulation was repeated 200 times to ensure good precision in the performance characterisation of the design under the particular scenario. Independent data were generated for each simulated trial and design-scenario combination. Using a single control program we conducted the entire simulation exercise from within SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) which in turn invoked WinBUGS<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> for Bayesian model estimation and empirical estimates of posterior distributions.

Successive increases in the number of adaptations led to corresponding increases in statistical power. While there was no marked advantage of five adaptations over three, a 5-adaptation design with adaptations evenly spaced throughout recruitment was considered feasible. As well as giving fractionally the highest statistical power in simulations, the design is straightforward to communicate to collaborators. We selected the utility function providing slightly greater statistical power. The improved power of a 4-dose design over a 6-dose design is somewhat counter-intuitive. This may be because in our simulated example, the subset of four doses by chance included points on the dose response curve with greatest efficacy. We nevertheless selected the 6-dose design, because we aimed to study the largest possible number of doses while retaining acceptable statistical power. Finally, we opted to randomise 2/7 of patients to placebo as this provided much greater power than the alternative.</p><p>The statistical power of such a design estimated from the normal linear model is 93.8% (95% confidence interval 91.9% to 95.8%) for simulations on all shapes of dose response curve with a mean benefit over placebo of 16.4&#x02009;mL and a within patient MBL standard deviation of 17.9&#x02009;mL, averaged across heteroscedasticity (present/absent) and interaction with baseline MBL (present/absent), for a trial randomising four patients per month. For comparison, a conventional non-adaptive design studying all six doses under similar scenarios would have 82.5% power.</p></sec><sec id="sec18-0962280215606155"><title>9 Discussion</title><sec id="sec19-0962280215606155"><title>9.1 Summary of results</title><p>We identified a Bayesian adaptive dose-finding design which had high statistical power compared with a standard parallel group design and which performed consistently regardless of trial recruitment rate, shape of dose-response curve and deviations from the model assumptions. A notable finding was the substantial gain in power from allocating a greater proportion of participants to placebo: this is consistent with what would be expected from optimal design theory and with what has been found in other parallel group designs evaluating multiple treatments.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Our simulation studies confirmed that the use of an adaptive design conferred efficiency gains over a conventional parallel group design. The statistical power of our chosen adaptive design is substantially greater than that of a design which did not incorporate adaptations (93.6% versus 82.5%). This increase in efficiency is consistent with that found in the context of adaptive seamless phase 2/3 designs<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> where a similar level of improvement in statistical power equated to a 25&#x02013;40% saving in sample size.</p><p>The modelling of dose-response using the NDLM, coupled with the efficiency gains of our adaptive design enables a greater number of doses to be studied; otherwise one is required to select a subset of all available doses without prior knowledge of the dose response.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> This necessary pre-selection of doses may lead to further loss of statistical power if, by chance, the subset of doses selected does not include any of the more efficacious doses.</p></sec><sec id="sec20-0962280215606155"><title>9.2 Influences on design choice</title><p>The elicitation of expert clinician opinion described in section 4 indicated that from a mechanistic perspective a monotone increasing dose response curve for Dexamethasone could not be guaranteed. This required us to consider more sophisticated modelling of dose response, rather than simply evaluating the highest feasible dose in a two-arm comparison versus placebo.</p><p>The upper limit of six on the number of doses being evaluated was dictated by practical considerations: it enables the doses under study to be reasonably closely spaced, while simplifying the drug packaging process and minimising wastage of drug for doses whose allocation probabilities are down-weighted following an adaptation.</p><p>Our simulations evaluated only two of the possible utility functions. We selected these on the basis of ease of interpretation (the &#x0201c;play the winner&#x0201d; approach) and efficiency of adaptation demonstrated in previous studies (quantifying the gain in information about the response at the current estimate of the ED95).<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Although the fractional factorial simulation study design led to confounding of main effects with higher-order interaction terms, this was not a substantial constraint as we were still able to explore two-way interactions between design options.</p><p>Given the volumetric nature of the MBL outcome, we might have expected there to be some deviations from the normality assumptions in the NDLM. However, these did not prove problematic, perhaps in part because our model studied the change from baseline and also adjusted for the baseline measurement. Had we identified evidence of non-normal errors, an alternative option would have been to model the log-transformed MBL instead.</p></sec><sec id="sec21-0962280215606155"><title>9.3 Practical aspects</title><p>Although the importance sampling approach assisted with the computational efficiency of the simulations, nevertheless a period of 10 months was required to develop and conduct the simulation study. Much of this time involved preparing the suite of statistical programs and collaborating with experts in the therapeutic area to ensure that a credible set of design options and assumptions were considered in the simulation study; the actual simulations required approximately two months of processing time on a desktop PC. In part this was because a &#x0201c;belt and braces&#x0201d; approach to the importance sampling was taken, with m&#x02009;=&#x02009;100 observations being simulated for each dose at each adaptation and 10,000 MCMC runs being performed on each. This is consistent with other work<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> which suggested that at the stage when only a low number of patients have been randomised to a trial, larger numbers of simulated observations and MCMC runs are preferable. In a larger trial than DexFEM, or in the later stages of DexFEM itself, a smaller value of m and fewer MCMC runs should also be adequate.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>We implemented our simulations and adaptive design without the development of bespoke software packages, as use of SAS and WinBUGS would maximise the generalisability of our findings and the reuse of our programming code in other applications. The overall scope of our simulations (200 trials per scenario; 150 scenarios; 10,000 MCMC runs following a 5000 iteration burn-in for each model estimation step) was therefore influenced by this use of generic rather than tailor-made software which will have had an impact on computational efficiency and simulation run times. In addition to making use of readily available software, we linked programs in SAS and WinBUGS to form a single integrated package through which to deliver the entire design development study.</p></sec><sec id="sec22-0962280215606155"><title>9.4 Technical considerations</title><p>The nature of the adaptive design means that not all of the placebo comparator patients are being studied contemporaneously with those randomised to a Dexamethasone dose. This is particularly notable for the doses given increased randomisation probabilities in the later stages of the adaptive design. In order to account for this, the final analysis of the trial should be stratified by adaptation stage to ensure that within each stage a contemporaneous randomised comparison is being considered.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This accounts for so-called &#x0201c;cohort effects&#x0201d; that would be induced by trends in participant characteristics or protocol changes during the trial and ensures that the study retains the perspective of concurrent control.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This consideration applies to a broad range of adaptive designs, including adaptive seamless designs, and is not restricted to the specific design implemented in DexFEM.</p><p>The optimal spacing of adaptations will depend on the rate at which participants are randomised to the trial<sup><xref rid="bibr25-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> as well as the length of follow up time between randomisation and assessment of outcome. Our result showing that five adaptations equally spaced throughout recruitment had marginally the greatest statistical power is consistent with the findings in adaptive seamless phase II/III designs<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> which gave greatest adaptive seamless design efficiency when equal numbers of patients were included in phase II and phase III, rather than in the ratio 1:2 or 1:3. As our MBL primary outcome measure is available soon after treatment relative to the length of the period of recruitment to the trial, there was no requirement to seek an intermediate outcome on which to base adaptations, as recommended in situations where the primary outcome is measured following a lengthy follow-up period.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> An optimal group sequential testing framework is available in such a scenario.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p><p>Our proposed design adapts on efficacy only, which is justifiable as Dexamethasone is already licenced and its safety profile well-established for much higher acute doses than the repeated doses for longer-term use that mimic physiological glucocorticoid secretion which are studied in DexFEM. In other situations, there would be the scope to adapt simultaneously on both efficacy and toxicity data, for example using the &#x0201c;trinary&#x0201d; ordinal outcome approach<sup><xref rid="bibr28-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> which combines these outcomes as 0: no efficacy and no toxicity, 1: efficacy and no toxicity and 2: toxicity. Thall and Cook <sup><xref rid="bibr29-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> develop these approaches further by considering a bivariate binary outcome which incorporates both efficacy and safety information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec23-0962280215606155"><title>10 Conclusion</title><p>This simulation study has enabled us to develop a Bayesian response-adaptive design which maximises what can be learned about the Dexamethasone dose-response relationship from this clinical trial in heavy menstrual bleeding, substantially gaining efficiency over a standard parallel group design.

Consequently the function was also restricted to not produce values above Var(<italic>E</italic>)&#x02009;=&#x02009;(70.7)<sup>2&#x02009;</sup>=&#x02009;5000, which was about twice the largest observed variance in the Fraser study<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0962280215606155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>.</p></sec></app></app-group></back></article>
