a conventional rehabilitation program on upper extremity motor and functional recovery in
stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-one hemiplegic patients were included. The
patients were randomly assigned to a mirror (n=16) or conventional group (n=15). The
patients in both groups underwent conventional therapy for 4 weeks (60&#x02013;120 minutes/day, 5
days/week). The mirror group received mirror therapy, consisting of periodic flexion and
extension movements of the wrist and fingers on the non-paralyzed side. The patients in
the conventional group performed the same exercises against the non-reflecting face of the
mirror. The patients were evaluated at the beginning and end of the treatment by a blinded
assessor using the Brunnstrom stage, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper extremity score,
and the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) self-care score. [Results] There was an
improvement in Brunnstrom stage and the FIM self-care score in both groups, but the
post-treatment FMA score was significantly higher in the mirror therapy group than in the
conventional treatment group. [Conclusion] Mirror therapy in addition to a conventional
rehabilitation program was found to provide additional benefit in motor recovery of the
upper extremity in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Mirror therapy</kwd><kwd>Upper extremity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is an important health problem with a high incidence and mortality that affects a
large proportion of the population and causes disability in the survivors. Hemiplegia has
been reported to develop in 85% of stroke survivors and 69% experience upper extremity
functional limitations<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Functional loss
in the upper extremity causes difficulty in performing daily living activities, and causes
to become dependent. The target in stroke rehabilitation is to enable the highest functional
independence level possible for the individual and to increase the quality of life despite
the current limitations. However, conventional treatment methods used for this purpose are
insufficient in enabling upper extremity functional recovery.</p><p>Mirror therapy is a simple, inexpensive, and patient-oriented treatment. Functional brain
imaging studies conducted on healthy individuals have shown that the ipsilateral primary
cortex excitability increases when observing the mirror image of the hand during unilateral
hand movements<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mirror therapy involves
the superimposition of the reflections of healthy extremity movements on the affected
extremity for the patient to observe them as if their extremity is moving<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A mirror is placed at the midsagittal plane
of the patient so that the healthy side image will be superimposed on the projection of the
affected extremity<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, there is a
visual illusion of increased movement ability of the paretic extremity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are several studies on the effectiveness of mirror therapy in post-stroke upper
extremity rehabilitation. While an improvement in the motor functions of patients who
underwent mirror therapy was reported in some of these studies<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, no difference was found
between patients who had received mirror therapy and those receiving conventional
rehabilitation in other studies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim
of the current study was to evaluate the effect of mirror therapy together with a standard
rehabilitation program on upper extremity motor functions in a hemiplegic patient group and
to investigate whether it provides additional benefit.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>An assessor-blinded, randomized, controlled study design was used. The trial included 31
patients who developed hemiparesis after stroke and were hospitalized for rehabilitation at
the Ba&#x0015f;kent University Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinic between July 2013 and
July 2014. Stroke was defined as an acute event of cerebrovascular origin that continued for
more than 24 hours, lead to focal or global neurologic dysfunction, was diagnosed by a
neurologist, and was verified by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Study inclusion criteria were as follows:
patients who were diagnosed with hemiplegia due to stroke that was unilateral and began
within the past 6 months, a Brunnstrom stage for the upper extremity between I and IV,
scores of &#x02265;24 points on the Mini-Mental State, lack of excessive spasticity in the joints of
the affected upper extremity (stage &#x02264;2 according to the Modified Ashworth Scale), and no
past history of stroke. Patients with joint movement limitations in the healthy upper
extremity, a visual field defect or neglect syndrome, and those who had previously undergone
a rehabilitation program were excluded from the study. All the potential participants were
independently evaluated by a physician in terms considering the study inclusion
criteria.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University with decision KA13/108
dated July 16, 2013. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>The study had 90% power with 5% type 1 error when a difference of 2.7 units between the
Fugl-Meyer upper extremity scores of the groups was accepted as clinically significant.</p><p>The patients were evaluated before and after the treatment by a physician who had no
information about the treatment groups or group assignments.</p><p>Upper extremity motor recovery was evaluated using Brunnstrom stages. Brunnstrom stage
evaluates the motor development of hemiplegic patients. In this test, the recovery process
is divided into 6 stages. The upper extremity, lower extremity, and the hand are evaluated
separately. The lowest stage is identified as stage I (flaccid, no voluntary movement) and
the highest stage as stage VI (isolated joint movement)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) upper extremity score was used to evaluate the various
dimensions of motor weakness<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. FMA is a
quantitative assessment tool that measures motor recovery after stroke in the shoulder,
elbow, forearm, wrist, and hand. Points from 0 to 2 are given to each item according to the
performance on the motor function evaluation (0: Unable to perform, 1: Performs partially,
2: Performs completely). The maximum motor performance score for the upper extremity is 66
points<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The scale has high
intra-rater reliability (r=0.99), inter-rater reliability (r=0.94), and construct
validity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The functional disability level was evaluated with the Functional Independence Measure
(FIM) self-care subscale. FIM measures physical and cognitive dysfunction and the need for
help, and consists of 18 items. These items are grouped in 6 subscales measuring self-care,
sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in performance of activities are
measured objectively through observation of the performance. Each item is evaluated with a
7-point Likert scale that specifies the amount of help needed (1=complete dependence,
7=complete independence). The maximum total score is 126 and the maximum self-care score is
42<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The validity and reliability of
the Turkish version have been established<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>After their basal evaluations were performed, the patients were randomly assigned to the
mirror group (n=16) or the conventional group (n=15) by using a random number table. The
randomization of the patients was conducted by a physician who was blinded to the study
protocol and was not involved in the actual study.</p><p>The patients in both groups underwent 60&#x02013;120 minutes of a conventional upper extremity
rehabilitation program 5 times a week for 4 weeks. This program consists of
neurodevelopmental facilitation techniques organized specifically for each patient, range of
motion exercises, strengthening exercises, and occupational therapy. During the same period,
in addition to the conventional treatment, the mirror group underwent 20 minutes of a mirror
therapy program 5 times a week under the supervision of a therapist. Mirror therapy included
flexion and extension movements of the non-paretic upper extremity wrists and fingers. The
patients were seated on a chair with a table in front of them. The mirror was placed between
the extremities and vertical to the table in front of them so that the non-paretic hand was
reflected. The patients were asked to perform periodic flexion and extension movements of
the wrist and fingers on the non-paretic side and to observe the reflection of these
movements in the mirror under supervision. Patients could see only the non-paretic hand in
the mirror. These movements were performed at the speed the patients desired. The patients
in the conventional group performed the same exercises against the non-reflecting face of
the mirror for an equal length of time. The same therapist delivered the mirror or sham
therapy to the patients.</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS 22.0 software. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
used to evaluate whether the numerical variables had a normal distribution. Descriptive
statistics were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for numerical variables with a normal
distribution, as median and interquartile range for numerical variables without a normal
distribution, and as numbers and percentages for categorical variables. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and
Fisher&#x02019;s tests were used to determine differences between the groups regarding frequencies.
For the comparisons between the independent groups, the independent samples t-test
(Student&#x02019;s t-test) was used when parametric test assumptions were met and the Mann-Whitney U
test was used when they were not met. We used the Wilcoxon test for within-group comparisons
because the parametric test assumptions were not met. A p-value less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Demographic data of the groups are presented in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

we did not see any superiority over conventional treatments in the FIM self-care score that
evaluates the daily living activities of a person.</p><p>Stroke can cause many disabilities in the life of a person despite the new advances in
acute stroke treatment that have increased life expectancy<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of stroke rehabilitation should be to improve the
patient&#x02019;s physical, cognitive, emotional, and social quality of life. Upper extremity
paralysis, a common occurrence following stroke, is one of the most limiting problems for
the patient<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim in new approaches
and treatment methods is to reactivate the plasticity characteristics of the brain to regain
the lost brain functions or maintain what is left. The motor cortex can be modified with
repeated muscle activity, supporting the neural plasticity concept. Mirror therapy is one of
the new approaches. The movements in front of a mirror are thought to trigger neuronal
connections in the relevant motor cortex and functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI)
have supported this hypothesis<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ramachandran was the first to suggest that mirror therapy could increase movements of the
paretic extremity after stroke<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Altschuler et al. suggested that mirror therapy provides a visual input regarding the normal
movement of the affected arm and this may compensate for decreased or lost proprioceptive
input<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stevens and Stoykov have defined
mirror therapy as some type of visually managed motor illusion where the movement is
performed mentally without a clear application<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Dohle et al. conducted a randomized controlled study on 36 patients who had experienced
acute ischemic stroke due to middle cerebral artery involvement. Mirror therapy (5 days a
week, 30 minutes a day) was added to the standard treatment for 6 weeks. Mirror therapy was
reported to result in a significant improvement only in the finger motor score of FMA with
no difference between the groups in daily living activities. They also found a significant
improvement in superficial touch sensation in the mirror group compared to the control
group. They suggested that mirror therapy not only activated the motor cortex but also
changed cortical somatosensorial representation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, a total of 60 acute stroke patients with severe
upper extremity paralysis were divided into 3 groups: individual mirror therapy, group
mirror therapy, and controls. The patients received mirror therapy or sham therapy for 30
minutes/day for a total of 20 sessions. While a moderate improvement in FMA scores was seen
in all patients after the treatment, no difference was found among the groups<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Yavuzer et al. studied the effect of
mirror therapy (5 days a week, 2&#x02013;5 hours/day) in 36 patients with subacute stroke. The
post-treatment evaluation of the patients revealed significant improvement in the hand and
upper extremity Brunnstrom stages and the FIM self-care scores compared to the control
group. This significant difference was still evident at the 6-month follow-up<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Song et al. reported that mirror
therapy improved upper extremity functions and daily living activities of patients with
chronic stroke<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Michielsen et al. used a rehabilitation program 60 minutes a day, 5 days a week at home and
1 day a week at the hospital for 6 weeks in both groups in a randomized controlled study on
patients with chronic stroke. The patients were evaluated before and after the treatment,
and at the 6-month follow-up. FMA upper extremity scores of the patients were found to be
significantly high in the mirror group, but this difference was not maintained at the
6-month follow-up. There was no significant difference in any other outcome measure.
However, changes in the primary motor cortex in the affected hemisphere were detected on
fMRI in the mirror group<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A Cochrane review that included 14 randomized controlled studies of 567 patients reported
that mirror therapy is markedly useful in the development of motor functions, with the
available evidence indicating a beneficial effect on daily living activity performance and
pain, with the development of motor functions continuing through 6 months
post-treatment<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the effects
on the motor functions were also found to change according to the type of treatment used in
the control group. The small sample size, different rehabilitation programs used in the
control groups, and certain methodological limitations in most of these studies were
recognized as limitations of the reviewed articles. Motor function was used as the primary
outcome in the included studies. The most commonly used measures for the evaluation of motor
function were the FMA scale<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and Brunnstrom stage<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FMA upper extremity score and Brunnstrom stage were used in the
current study. Similar to other studies, a significant improvement was found in FMA
following mirror therapy when compared to the control group. However, there was no
significant improvement in the Brunnstrom stage compared to the control group. Improvement
following a stroke is most striking in the first 12 months<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients enrolled in this study were in the first 6 month period
following their strokes. Therefore, motor improvement was found in both groups.</p><p>The FIM self-care subscore was used to evaluate daily living activities. The FIM self-care
subscore showed a significant improvement in both groups, but there was no difference
between groups. This may be due to the relative inadequacy of the sample size, the short
treatment duration, or the fact that the vast majority of the patients were Brunnstrom stage
I or II. Dohle et al. found no difference between the groups regarding FIM motor subscores,
similar to this study, but there was a significant improvement in the mirror group regarding
FMA upper extremity scores<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The lack of
long-term follow-up may also lead to misinterpretation of treatment results. Plasticity
dependent on repeated muscle activity may take days, months, or years to appear and may
contribute to improved function through cortico-motor reorganization<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although a borderline significant improvement was found in the FMA upper extremity scores
of the patients in the mirror group compared to the conventional group, the lack of a
difference between the groups for Brunnstrom stages may be because the patients did not
perform an exercise program for the proximal part of the arm in front of a mirror. The
patients were instructed to perform only joint range of motion movements with the wrist and
fingers. This may explain why we did not see a significant improvement in Brunnstrom stage,
where synergy patterns are evaluated. All isolated muscle movements are evaluated with the
FMA, so motor improvement may be reflected more rapidly in the scale results.</p><p>Mirror therapy is a simple, easy to use, and low-cost rehabilitation method for patients
and staff, and it can be integrated into the home environment. Studies on the effectiveness
of mirror therapy have mostly focused on upper extremity function. However, the number and
content of published studies is inadequate to support any robust conclusions.</p><p>The limitations of this study are the low number of subjects, the lack of an imaging
technique that shows post-treatment brain reorganization, and a short follow-up. Larger and
well-designed randomized controlled studies are required to investigate the effectiveness of
post-stroke mirror therapy. Future studies should compare mirror therapy with conventional
rehabilitation and newly developed treatment methods, and should try to determine the
optimum frequency and duration of mirror therapy while also focusing on daily living
activities. Studies evaluating the effectiveness of mirror therapy at different periods
after stroke will also be useful in the identification of the period when the most benefit
will be observed.</p><p>In conclusion, mirror therapy used in addition to conventional rehabilitation methods was
found to be effective in the development of upper extremity motor functions in stroke
patients. Mirror therapy was not superior to the conventional treatment group in increases
in the FIM self-care scores that we used for the evaluation of daily living activities but
longer follow-up of the patients may change these results. Larger randomized controlled
trials are needed to evaluate mirror therapy. The new treatment methods that are already
used or will be developed with a better understanding of neural plasticity and use of
functional brain imaging methods will enable us to reach the next level in stroke
rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of virtual reality games on stroke patients&#x02019;
