Polypharmacy is also highly prevalent, with a recent systematic review demonstrating that up to three-quarters of all residents take nine or more medications on a regular basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. While polypharmacy is an important contributor to medication regimen complexity, other factors, such as multiple administration times, use of non-oral formulations, and specific administration instructions relating to crushing or administering medications with food all increase the overall complexity of a medication regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Residents of aged care facilities have more complex medication regimens than their community-dwelling counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because the majority of residents are dependent on facility staff for medication administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], complex medication regimens are costly for aged care providers in terms of nursing time. A time&#x02013;motion observational study of 12 morning medication rounds within one Australian residential aged care facility (RACF), involving seven nurses across two high care units, reported that nursing staff spent an average of three&#x000a0;hours administering medications to 35 residents during the morning medication round [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Complex medication regimens can also be burdensome for residents, particularly for residents with dementia. Strategies to reduce unnecessary medication regimen complexity are therefore likely to be important for both residents and aged care providers, particularly as increasing medication regimen complexity has been associated with a greater risk of hospitalisation among residents of aged care facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Recent studies have focused on deprescribing as a strategy to reduce unnecessary medication regimen complexity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Several randomised controlled trials have incorporated deprescribing interventions in RACFs with the aim of reducing polypharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An alternative approach that has received considerably less attention is to consolidate the number of medication administration times through such strategies as administering medications at the same time, standardising routes of administration, using long-acting formulations in preference to shorter-acting agents, and switching from multiple single-ingredient preparations to a combination formulation, where possible. Interventions to reduce medication regimen complexity have been successfully implemented in the hospital setting. In one controlled trial involving patients taking at least five medications on admission to a hospital in the United States (USA), delivery of a visual medication grid to physicians caring for patients in the intervention arm led to a significant reduction in both the number of medications and number of doses per day in comparison with controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Similarly, results of a pre&#x02013;post study conducted in one Australian hospital showed that after clinical pharmacists received training to minimise medication regimen complexity, inpatients receiving a medication review had a smaller increase in regimen complexity at discharge than patients reviewed before the educational session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Simplification of medication regimens in RACFs may offer such benefits as improved quality of life, particularly for residents with dementia or swallowing difficulties, those who regularly refuse to take medications, or residents who wish to participate in activities during the day or outside the aged care facility. One study involving two RACFs in the USA estimated that switching from a medication administered three times per day to a medication administered once daily for one resident, resulting in only one administration time per day, could save 63&#x000a0;min of nursing time per resident every month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This suggests that medication regimen simplification may reduce the time needed for RACF staff to administer medications, thus freeing them to undertake other clinical duties. The primary aim of our study is to investigate application of a structured process to simplify medication administration for residents of aged care facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p id="Par19">SImplification of Medications Prescribed to Long-tErm care Residents (SIMPLER) is a non-blinded, matched-pair, cluster randomised controlled trial of a single multidisciplinary intervention to simplify medication regimens using a structured tool. The cluster design was chosen to minimise the potential for contamination associated with nurses and general medical practitioners providing care for a number of residents in the same facility.</p><p id="Par20">Residents will be recruited from eight RACFs between April 2017 and October 2017. Details of participating RACFs can be obtained from the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry website. Recognising that the average length of stay for permanent residents of aged care facilities in Australia is 35&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], participants will be followed for up to 3&#x000a0;years after study entry. In Australia, RACFs (synonymous with long-term care facilities or nursing homes in other countries) provide supported accommodation for people with care needs that cannot be met in their own homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The RACFs participating in the SIMPLER study predominately cater for residents with high care needs, and are located in metropolitan and rural regions of South Australia.

This includes four metropolitan RACFs with 90&#x02013;110 beds, a larger metropolitan RACF with 155 beds, two rural RACFs with 40&#x02013;50 beds each and a rural RACF with 100 beds (all bed numbers are approximate). The RACFs will be paired by the study investigators based on location (i.e. metropolitan or rural) and number of beds. The two smaller rural RACFs will be matched and the larger rural RACF will be matched with the closest metropolitan RACF of similar size. There will be approximately 10% difference in the total number of beds within each pair for two pairs, 20% difference for one pair and 40% difference in the total number of beds for the final pair, owing to the larger size of one metropolitan facility.</p><p id="Par26">One RACF within each pair will be randomised to the intervention group and the other to the comparison (usual care) group. An independent pharmacoepidemiologist will perform the randomisation using the computerised random number generator within SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Study nurses, residents and staff at each RACF will be blinded to the allocation at the time of resident recruitment; however, owing to the nature of the intervention, it will not be possible to conceal allocation to the intervention or comparison group throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par27">The Medication Regimen Simplification Guide for Residential Aged CarE (MRS GRACE) will be used to identify opportunities for simplifying medication regimens for SIMPLER participants in the intervention facilities. MRS GRACE was developed in consultation with a multidisciplinary expert panel and validated by two clinical pharmacists who independently applied the tool to de-identified medication charts for 50 residents. This implicit tool directs the user to consider the following five questions when considering whether a resident&#x02019;s medication regimen may be simplified:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par28">Is there a resident-related factor that precludes simplification?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par29">Is there a regulatory or safety imperative that precludes simplification?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par30">Is simplification likely to result in any clinically significant drug&#x02013;drug, drug&#x02013;food or drug&#x02013;time interactions?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par31">Is there no alternative formulation available that can support less complex dosing?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par32">Is simplification likely to result in any unintended consequences?</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par33">The intervention will be implemented by an experienced clinical pharmacist who is accredited to perform residential medication management reviews (RMMRs). The intervention will be delivered after recruitment and baseline data collection. The study pharmacist will review medication charts, medical diagnoses and other relevant details obtained from the medical record, and use MRS GRACE to identify opportunities to simplify the medication regimen for study participants in the intervention facilities. The study pharmacist will forward a structured one-page report outlining recommendations for medication regimen simplification to the residential services manager and clinical nurse consultant at the aged care facility, and to the resident&#x02019;s general medical practitioner&#x000a0;(GP). The study pharmacist will record the amount of time spent reviewing medications, generating recommendations and communicating with key stakeholders (e.g. the resident, the resident&#x02019;s guardian, next of kin or significant other, facility staff and GP).</p><p id="Par34">Recommendations related to changes in medication administration times will require approval by the residential services manager, clinical nurse consultant or GP prior to implementation. All other recommendations (e.g. changes in medication strength, formulation or active ingredient) will require approval of the GP prior to implementation. Whether or not these recommendations are actioned will be at the discretion of the residential services manager or clinical nurse consultant and the resident&#x02019;s GP, respectively. It will be the responsibility of the residential services manager or clinical nurse consultant and the resident&#x02019;s GP to ensure that the resident or the resident&#x02019;s guardian, next of kin or significant other are involved in the decision making process at all steps. This process was supported by the aged care provider organisation&#x02019;s research ethics review panel and metropolitan medication advisory committee.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Usual care</title><p id="Par35">Residents in the comparison RACFs will continue to receive routine care.</p><p id="Par36">All residents in the intervention and comparison RACFs will continue to be eligible to receive Australian Government-remunerated Quality Use of Medicines services and RMMRs during the study period. The Quality Use of Medicines service is provided by registered pharmacists; activities may include staff education, drug utilisation audits, contribution to medication advisory committee meetings and reviewing medication-related policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The RMMR process involves an accredited pharmacist providing a clinical medication review for residents of aged care facilities following a referral from the resident&#x02019;s GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Although RMMRs and Quality Use of Medicines services may result in recommendations to cease or simplify medications, these services are not delivered with the specific aim of reducing regimen complexity.

Validation of the MRS GRACE tool by two clinical pharmacists using de-identified medication charts for 50 residents who were administered medications at least twice per day showed that the number of administration times could be reduced for 23 (46%) residents. As not all recommendations may be implemented by the residential services manager, clinical nurse consultant or GP, we anticipate that the number of administration times could be reduced for 25% of SIMPLER participants receiving the intervention. Allowing for a reduction in administration times for 5% of residents in the comparison group, and assuming 80% power, 5% significance and an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], 22 residents would be required from each facility (i.e. 176 residents). Allowing for a 10% attrition of participants over 4&#x000a0;months, as residents estimated to have less than 3&#x000a0;months to live are not eligible to participate, the SIMPLER study will need to recruit a minimum of 194 residents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Quantitative analyses</title><p id="Par63">Individual-level analyses that account for clustering will be undertaken to determine the relationship between the intervention and study outcomes. Analyses will be undertaken using an intention-to-treat principle; however, sensitivity analyses will be undertaken among residents prescribed medications at least twice per day on a regular basis at baseline, and on a per-protocol basis, in which the intervention group will be restricted to residents for whom at least one medication simplification recommendation was implemented. Mixed models with RACF as a random effect will be utilised to analyse the association between intervention and outcomes. Models will be adjusted for resident characteristics at baseline (including number of medication administration times). Multiple imputation will be used to impute missing covariate values where necessary. Data will be analysed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Economic analysis</title><p id="Par64">A within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted alongside the clinical trial to synthesis the costs and outcomes of SIMPLER. The primary outcome measure will be quality of life, measured using the QoL-AD instrument. The total cost associated with medication use and administration for participants in the intervention and comparison groups will be estimated at baseline and follow-up (at 4 and 8&#x000a0;months after study entry). Medication incidents, falls and hospitalisations will be incorporated in the economic analysis. Appropriate adjustment for the cluster design of the trial will be undertaken using multilevel models. The multilevel models approach can incorporate cluster level random effects by explicitly recognising clustering in parameter estimations while adjusting for cluster and individual covariates that may vary between groups and clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Additionally, multilevel models can accommodate non-normal distribution of the error terms (e.g., gamma distribution) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and do not require strict asymptotic assumptions to be met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], which provides more precise estimates than alternative approaches.

The study is underpinned by extensive stakeholder engagement. This has assisted study investigators to identify barriers to participation and uptake of the recommendations for medication regimen simplification, and address these factors. The process of medication regimen simplification will involve the application of a structured tool (MRS GRACE), which has been validated in the residential aged care setting. The use of a cluster randomised controlled trial to randomise at the facility level, rather than the resident level, will reduce the risk that residential services managers, clinical nurse consultants and GPs will simplify medication regimens for all residents under their care, regardless of treatment group allocation.</p><p id="Par68">Study participants will be recruited from a single aged care provider organisation, which means that study findings may not be generalisable to all older people. It is recognised that there may be differences in health status, cognitive function or involvement with medications between participating residents and those who decline to participate. The SIMPLER study nurses, residents and staff at each RACF will be blinded to treatment allocation at the time of recruitment to minimise the risk of selection bias. However, ascertainment bias is possible as some of the secondary outcomes are derived from assessments completed by residents (resident satisfaction) and staff informants (quality of life), who may be aware of the treatment allocation when the assessments are undertaken at the 4&#x000a0;month follow-up.</p><p id="Par69">Considerable time is spent administering medications in RACFs and complex medication regimens have been linked to poor health outcomes for residents. It is recognised that some medication regimen complexity is unnecessary and could be reduced by consolidating dosing times. The SIMPLER study will use a structured approach to target unnecessary medication regimen complexity in RACFs, and generate evidence to inform clinical practice and policy decisions in this setting.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par70">This manuscript presents version 1.4 (1 March 2017) of the SIMPLER protocol.
