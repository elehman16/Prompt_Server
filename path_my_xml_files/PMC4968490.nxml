stockings (CS) on symptoms and QoL in patients with Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI).
[Subjects and Methods] Based on the CEAP classification C2 and C3, 117 patients with CVI
were enrolled in this study. The participants were divided into two groups. The control
group refused to use CS, however, was advised to do exercises and take skin care whereas
the CS group used CS and performed exercise. The data were collected by using Nottingham
Health Profile (NHP), Venous Insufficiency Epidemiological and Economic Study
(VEINES-QoL/Sym) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at baseline and after four weeks of
treatment and compared within and in between groups. [Results] The comparison of pre- and
post-treatment differences between groups was statistically significant for all
parameters. In the study group, pre- and post-treatment scores for each parameter were
significantly different. However, elevated scores in the control group suggested worsening
of the illness. [Conclusion] This study established that short-term use of CS in patients
with CVI significantly improved disease specific and general QoL by reducing venous
symptoms. Further studies with larger sample size are necessary to confirm these
findings.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Venous insufficiency</kwd><kwd>Compression stocking</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) is characterised by the retrograde flow of blood in the
lower extremity. CVI and its sequel of varicose veins and venous hypertension are among the
most common disorders that affect daily life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of CVI ranges between 10&#x02013;40% and it mostly affects
lower limb. The annual incidence of CVI is 2&#x02013;6% and 1.9% in women and men, respectively<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The main risk factors for CVI include family history, prolonged standing, history of deep
venous thrombosis, age, obesity, and pregnancy<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The venous hypertension of CVI usually begins with oedema and
varicose veins and progresses to stasis cellulitis and pigmentation of skin leading into
lipodermatosclerosis and ulceration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since established venous insufficiency cannot be cured by pharmacological interventions
alone, it is most commonly treated by non-invasive methods<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The compression therapy
relieves CVI symptoms by improving venous function and hence is preferred among other
physical therapies to treat venous and lymphatic insufficiency of lower limbs. The
compression stockings (CS) and calf muscle pump exercises increase venous return and are
mainstay of conservative treatment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CT exerts the highest compression at the ankle which gradually decreases towards knee,
thereby ensuring the upward flow of blood in the direction of heart and preventing reflux
towards foot or in lateral superficial veins. The compression pressure gradient of CS, by
reducing diameter of major veins, increases velocity and volume of blood flow and decreases
the venous hypertension and symptoms<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>CVI considerably affects patient&#x02019;s health-related quality of life (HRQoL). In many
patients, the pain and discomfort of CVI affects physical mobility, working capacity and
social life<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The International Society
for Vascular Surgery recommended to expand outcome measures for venous disease studies to
include patient-reported measures of functioning and HRQoL. It noted that comprehensive
evaluation of venous disease should include assessment of clinical outcomes and HRQoL<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. For chronic conditions like CVI, the
assessment of HRQoL can provide important information on disease burden that may not be
adequately captured with traditional physician-based measures of morbidity or mortality<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Due to chronic nature of CVI, the long term usage of the CS may be rough considering the
compliance of the patient. Therefore, the present study was aimed to analyse the effect of
short term use of CS on symptoms of CVI and HRQoL in CVI patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The patients visiting outpatient clinic, at Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Abant
Izzet Baysal University Hospital Bolu, Turkey were enrolled in this study. The study was
approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Abant Izzet Baysal University Faculty
of Medicine (IB.30.2.AB&#x000dc;.0.20.05.04&#x02013;050.01.04&#x02013;60).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were patients without prior treatment for CVI or varicose vein surgery
and for those the disease was categorised as C2 and C3 according to CEAP classification.
Exclusion criteria included presence of deep vein thrombosis, congestive heart failure,
malignancy, patients having more advanced skin changes such as lipodermatosclerosis skin
ulcers or other dermatological disease with pruritus, and patients who had ongoing use of
CS.</p><p>All patients enrolled were given detailed explanation of the study following which informed
consent was obtained from them. A questionnaire including demographic information,
occupational details, and relevant medical history were distributed to them. The generic,
disease specific HRQoL, and depression-related questionnaire was requested from 126
patients.</p><p>The Turkish version of Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) was used to measure a generic HRQoL.
It contains 38 questions with assigned individual score from six different categories such
as energy level (EL; n=3), pain (P; n=8), emotional reaction (ER; n=8), sleep (S; n=5),
social isolation (SI; n=5), and physical abilities (PA; n=8). The sum of maximum scores for
all categories was 100. For calculation of final score in each category, variation in number
of items per category was rationalised by computing percentage score (i.e., each sum was
multiplied by 100 and divided by the number of items in the category). Possible scores
ranged from 0 (indicating all &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; answers in that category or absence of distress) to 100
(all &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; answers indicating maximal distress). Therefore, the highest score indicated
worse outcomes. The reliability and validity of Turkish NHP has been demonstrated
earlier<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The questionnaire on 26 items from 2 categories of VEINES-QoL/Sym measured severity of
symptoms of CVI and its impact on HRQoL from patient&#x02019;s perspective. The five different
frequencies (always, a few times a week, once a week, once in a few weeks, and never) for
symptoms fullness of lower extremities, pain, swelling, night cramps, heat/burning
sensation, restless legs, itching, tingling/stinging sensation, and throbbing under 10
different items were assessed. Limitations in daily activities (9 items), greatest intensity
during the day (1 item), change over the past year (1 item), and psychological impact (5
items) were covered by the HRQOL scale of 2 to 7 points for response on intensity,
frequency, or agreement. Venous symptoms that are part of VEINES QoL/Sym were assessed. The
score for each item ranged between 0&#x02013;6. The highest score indicated better outcomes in
VEINES-QoL and on VEINES-Sym scale. VEINES-QoL/Sym; Turkish validity and reliability were
established by study of Kutlu et al<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) consists of 21 items; it is a self-report rating
inventory that measures characteristic of attitude and symptoms of depression. The score for
each item ranges between 0&#x02013;3. The higher scores indicate worsened condition. Turkish
validity and reliability were established by Ulusoy et al<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The 126 patients were divided into study group and control group. The study group included
44 patients who regularly used CS and remaining 82 patients who did not use CS were included
in control group.</p><p>The patients were trained for how to use and maintain CS. The class 2 CS (JOBST brand) of
height below knee and pressure gradient of 23&#x02013;32 mmHg were used. The patients were asked to
wear CS as soon as they wake up in the morning and take it off before going to bed. They
were asked to use CS for a period of four weeks, exercise regularly and apply skin care
moisturiser (pH 5.5). The exercises prescribed were ankle pumping and heel lifts (3 sets of
10 repeats) and daily walk of 30&#x02013;45 minutes. The patients were warned that they should not
wear CS while sleeping due to high resting pressure.</p><p>The patients (without use of CS) in the control group were also prescribed same exercises
and skin care. All assessments were repeated after a four-week treatment.</p><p>The Statistical Program for Social Sciences (SPSS 18.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was
used for statistical analysis. Quantitative data were presented as mean and standard
deviation and qualitative data as percentage (%) and frequency (n). An independent t-test
was used to compare the differences in venous symptoms, depression and HRQoL scores between
groups. P value of &#x02264;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 203 patients with CVI interviewed for this study, 77 were excluded due to habitants
of town or village (n=33), absence of inclusion criteria (n=27), and rejection to
participate into study (n=17). The remaining 126 patients were enrolled into the study:
Study group (n=44) and Control group (n=82). Nine patients (2 from study group and 7 from
control group) did not undergo last evaluation. Thus, the study was completed with 117
patients (73 females and 44 males): Study group (n=42) and Control group (n=75). The average
age of patients was 60.9 &#x000b1; 9.4&#x02005;years in study group and 63.1 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;years for patients in
control group. The height (cm), bodyweight (kg) and body mass index (BMI) (kg/m) for
patients in both groups were comparable (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

and significantly improved quality of life in these patients.</p><p>The compression treatment for venous insufficiency in lower extremity has been used for
hundreds of years since Hippocrates. The compression treatment that applies external
pressure is a gold standard for CVI treatment<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most prevalent among the compression treatments is CS<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The reduction in venous reflux due to application of compression below knee is well
known<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In 112 CVI patients, the use
of CS (pressure 30&#x02013;40 mmHg) for one month significantly improved lower extremity pain,
oedema, activity tolerance, depression, sleep disorders and QoL<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, CS of below knee length was preferred due to
its comfort, improvement in CS calf muscle pump, and low cost.</p><p>CS decreases venous symptoms such as pain, oedema, stasis, and skin changes<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The venous symptoms were improved by the
use of class 2 (30&#x02013;40 mmHg) and class 3 (40&#x02013;50 mmHg) CS for six weeks<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, a significant decrease in symptom severity
(pain, depression, swelling, sleep) and increase in activity tolerances were observed in CVI
patients after use of CS for one month<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The use of CS improved pain and symptoms in 90% patients with CVI<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In line with this, significant improvement in all venous
symptoms was observed in CVI patients using CS. The decrease in venous symptom scores
suggests importance of short-term CS usage.</p><p>The difficulty in wearing CS, financial burden, discomfort of heat and tightness of
stocking are responsible for low compliance of CS use in CVI patients. Suehiro et al.
indicated that 20% of CVI patients in all age groups refused compression treatment<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Raju et al. reported that 63% of the
patients failed to adapt to CS<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Similarly, 64% CVI patients enrolled in this study refused to wear CS. Based on review of
patients&#x02019; self-report, the Mediterranean climate characteristics of hot weather, high cost
of compression stockings, and difficulty to wear were the possible reasons. Moreover, in 82%
patients with elementary education graduates refused to use CS.</p><p>There is no consensus on the duration of usage of CS<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is known that venous
hypertension increases after removing stockings. In a study comparing the duration of CS
usage, the use of CS for entire day is more beneficial than for only half day<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In order to decrease ambulatory venous
hypertension and to obtain maximum benefits, patients were asked to wear CS all day long.
The CS usage in patients was regularly checked via telephone interviews.</p><p>Although venous diseases are highly prevalent, its effect on daily activities and quality
of life are not investigated thoroughly. Both general and disease-specific QoL are accepted
as a standard to determine changes in QoL. The QoL measurement enables better understanding
of impact of the disease while evaluating specific problem<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, disease-specific QoL was assessed along with VEINES-QoL whereas general QoL
was assessed with NHP. At the end of one month, significant improvement was observed in
venous symptoms, VEINES-QoL scores and NHP parameters in group that used CS than that did
not use CS. Thus CS usage improved overall QoL suggested by improvement in both
disease-specific and general QoL scores.</p><p>In earlier study, the use of two different CS for a two-week duration was found to be
beneficial for QoL in both groups<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
use of class 1 (10&#x02013;15 mmHg) CS for four weeks significantly increased QoL compared with and
placebo pressure (3&#x02013;6 mmHg) stockings<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
In a similar study, it was observed that a four-week use of CS increases QoL and improves
symptoms of CVI<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The decrease of QoL in CVI is based on physical function and mobility in addition to
depression and social isolation. Depression limits performance in physical, social, and
personal activities leading to disability<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was reported that 68% of the patients with venous ulceration
suffer fear, depression, social isolation, anger, anxiety, and negative self-image<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is inadequate research on
evaluation of depression level in venous diseases and use of scales in directly evaluating
depression. In earlier study in patients with venous ulcers and BDI, the scale is used to
determine presence of various levels of depression<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, depression was assessed by BDI and short-term use
of CS decreased venous symptoms in CVI patients, improved daily activities, independence
levels and thus significantly decreased depression levels when baseline and final BDI
results were compared in the study group. Therefore, regular and long-term use of CS will
improve well being of CVI patients.</p><p>This study was aimed to assess short-term effects of CS use in CVI patients. Although these
patients should have been followed up for longer term, long-term monitoring was not possible
due to transportation difficulties, family reasons, and financial problems. Nevertheless, we
contacted the patients from control group and educated them about the short-term benefits of
CS use.</p><p>Due to risk of development of venous ulcers in the advanced stages of CVI, the regular use
of stocking starting from the early stages is recommended to prevent occurrence of CVI
symptoms. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of CS use by CVI patients in
Turkish economy and financial burden on CVI individuals in Turkey. Based on the findings of
this study, if the patients could be convinced to use CS for short-term duration, the
favourable effects will promote long-term use.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>JV</given-names></name><name><surname>Ryjewski</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Chronic venous insufficiency</article-title>.
