Compared with subjects on multiple daily injections (MDI), those on SAP experienced greater reductions in A1C levels by 3 months, and this advantage persisted for the entire study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). An optional continuation phase allowed MDI subjects to switch to SAP therapy for 6 months (the crossover group) and allowed SAP subjects to remain on uninterrupted SAP therapy (the SAP group) for a total of 18 months. We examined the effectiveness of SAP therapy in subjects transitioning from previously optimized MDI therapy and the durability of glycemic benefits in the SAP group over 18 months.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>STAR 3 eligibility criteria included type 1 diabetes, age 7&#x02013;70 years, use of MDI with a long-acting insulin analog, A1C between 7.4 and 9.5%, and less than two severe hypoglycemic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) in the previous year. Subjects were randomized to receive SAP (Paradigm REAL-Time System, Medtronic MiniMed, Inc., Northridge, CA) with insulin aspart or to MDI using insulins aspart and glargine. Therapy was optimized individually, and A1C was obtained at quarterly visits. Subjects beginning SAP therapy received training for pumps, CGM sensors, and therapy management software. All subjects in the continuation phase were supplied with sensors and encouraged to wear them regularly. The primary efficacy measure was the change in A1C from 12 to 18 months in both treatment groups; the primary safety measure was the difference in the rates of severe hypoglycemia.

In the SAP group, the improvement in A1C levels seen during the study phase was maintained during the continuation phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).

In contrast, patients in the crossover group realized a significant decrease in A1C from 12 months (8.0 &#x000b1; 0.1%) to 15 or 18 months (7.6 &#x000b1; 0.1%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>).

In the study phase, A1C levels were lowered by &#x0223c;0.5 to 0.6% more with SAP treatment than with MDI. The current data show that a similar degree of improvement in A1C levels was achieved when subjects switched from MDI to SAP after a 12-month period of optimized MDI therapy. Maximal lowering of A1C levels was associated with CGM sensor wear times of &#x0003e;60% in the crossover group; this was similar to wear times associated with maximal A1C lowering in the SAP group during the randomized study phase.</p><p>The improved A1C levels achieved by the SAP group during the first 12 months of the study were maintained at 15 and 18 months. Sensor wear times of &#x0003e;40% were required during the continuation phase for experienced SAP users to maintain the A1C benefits achieved during the study phase.</p><p>Age-dependent patterns of response in crossover adult and pediatric subjects during the continuation phase were similar to those observed during the study phase. Pediatric patients used their sensors less frequently than adults, and lower wear times were associated with a smaller reduction in A1C levels. A separate analysis of STAR 3 data comparing children and adolescents showed additional age-dependent differences in outcomes and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Participants were fully aware of the devices they were using and may have been motivated to use the SAP system appropriately. Because the study only enrolled subjects with type 1 diabetes with initial A1C values of 7.4&#x02013;9.5% and only included 2 treatment arms, its generalizability may be limited. The benefits of pump therapy with or without real-time CGM have been recently compared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Work continues toward the integration of SAP platforms and controller algorithms that can safely reduce hypoglycemic exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and may someday provide fully closed-loop insulin delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p></sec>
