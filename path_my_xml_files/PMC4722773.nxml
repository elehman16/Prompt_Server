Herbal medicine is one of these CAM treatments. <italic>Cheongsangbangpoong-tang</italic> (CBT) is a common herbal formula used in patients with acne vulgaris in the clinical practice of Korean Medicine (KM). However, despite the common use of CBT in clinical practice, the current level of evidence is insufficient to support an inhibitory effect of CBT on inflammatory acne lesions and facial heat. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the inhibitory effect of CBT on both inflammatory acne lesions and facial heat.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled trial will be conducted. Fifty-six participants with acne vulgaris will be randomized into one of two groups: the CBT or placebo groups. After randomization, participants will be prescribed either CBT or placebo three times a day at a dose of 5&#x000a0;g after meals for 8&#x000a0;weeks. The following outcome measurements will be used in the examination of subjects: the mean percentage change and the count change of the inflammatory and non-inflammatory acne lesions, the temperature of facial points on digital infrared thermal imaging (DITI), serum cortisol, serum dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S), visual analogue scale (VAS), investigator global assessment (IGA), and severity score on the Korean Acne Grading System (KAGS) from baseline to the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial will provide evidence regarding the inhibitory effect of CBT on inflammatory acne lesions and facial heat.

Safety tests (AST, ALT and creatinine) will be analyzed using the independent <italic>T</italic> test at screening and at the end of the trial (at week 8) between the CBT treatment and placebo control groups. A repeated measured analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) test will be used to examine the percentage change of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, differences in the temperatures of the DITI points on the face, VAS, and IGA at weeks 0, 4, and 8 when controlling for baseline and other covariates. The correlation between inflammatory lesion count and the facial skin superficial temperature points at baseline, 4&#x000a0;weeks, and 8&#x000a0;weeks will be examined using the Pearson correlation test. Additionally, we will analyze the correlation between the temperatures of the DITI points and the severity of the KAGS using the Pearson correlation test. The change of KAGS from baseline to week 8 will be assessed using a Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. All adverse events reported during the study will be included in the case report forms; the incidence of adverse events will be calculated. The percentage of subjects with adverse events in each group will be calculated and compared using a Chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

Moreover, there has been only limited research on its efficacy for inflammatory acne lesions or facial heat sensitivity. Thus, this clinical research trial was designed to provide evidence of the inhibitory effect of CBT on inflammatory acne lesions or facial heat sensitivity in patients with acne.</p><p>Our research was designed to be precise, in that we will use the placebo to maintain the double blinding of all assessors and practitioners, and have provided prior education to all practitioners. Blinding is an important scientific method in randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Most RCT intend to include a double-blind design to exclude the potential influence of the natural course of the disease or any expectations of the participants and investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In reality, because of the unique sensory and macroscopic characteristics, such as the appearance, taste and smell of herbal preparations, it is extremely difficult to prepare a placebo that is perceived to be identical to the real herbal formula while lacking any pharmacological or toxic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consequently, we will perform an evaluation of blinding success.</p><p>The trial duration of 8&#x000a0;weeks was determined after considering the following issues: the lasting effectiveness time of the intervention and its tolerability by and compliance of the participants. This protocol was developed according to the guidelines for randomized controlled trials investigating Chinese herbal medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and follows the nine CONSORT checklist items for RCTs of herbal medicines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. We considered the main elements for conducting a high-quality RCT, such as randomization, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding methods, proper sample size, compliance with the protocol, and adequate outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This research will provide important evidence regarding the more widespread use of CBT for the treatment of acne vulgaris.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment will commence on October 19, 2015.
