One thousand patients (500 per arm) will be enrolled at 39 clinical sites in Italy. Eligible patients will be randomized to the intensive structured monitoring (ISM) group or the active control (AC) group, with a glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) target of &#x0003c;7.0%. Intervention will comprise (1) structured SMBG (4-point daily glucose profiles on 3 days per week [ISM]; discretionary, unstructured SMBG [AC]); (2) comprehensive patient education (both groups); and (3) clinician&#x02019;s adjustment of diabetes medications using an algorithm targeting SMBG levels, HbA1c and hypoglycemia (ISM) or HbA1c and hypoglycemia (AC). The intervention and trial design build upon previous research by emphasizing appropriate and collaborative use of SMBG by both patients and physicians. Utilization of per protocol and intent-to-treat analyses facilitates assessment of the intervention.

Large randomized, controlled clinical trials, such as the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), have demonstrated that tight glycemic control reduces the risk of microvascular diabetic complications in both type 1 diabetes (T1DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of the DCCT and UKPDS cohorts has shown the so-called legacy effect (i.e., a long-lasting positive effect of tight glucose control on diabetes complication), even if glucose control tends to deteriorate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, in patients with a high cardiovascular risk, an intensive management of diabetes targeting normal glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with the use of multiple diabetes medications is associated with higher mortality than is a standard approach targeting higher HbA1c levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>While elevated HbA1c levels are clearly linked with the development and progression of diabetic complications, a growing body of evidence suggests that excessive post-prandial glycemic excursions may also be a significant risk factor for both microvascular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and macrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In patients with impaired glucose tolerance or T2DM post-challenge glucose and glycemic spikes are more strongly associated with carotid intima-media thickening than fasting glucose and HbA1c [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Conversely, diabetes medications that limit post-prandial glucose excursions have been shown to reduce the risk of macrovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, in poorly controlled, non-insulin-treated T2DM patients, Monnier and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] found a correlation between the production of 8-iso prostaglandin F2 (8-iso PGF<sub>2a</sub>), a marker of oxidative stress, and the magnitude of glucose fluctuations, calculated as the mean amplitude of glucose excursion (MAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This finding is important, given the possible role of post-prandial hyperglycemia in the pathogenesis atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes.</p><p>Unlike HbA1c measurement, which only presents an assessment of mean glucose over a 2&#x02013;3 month period, SMBG detects intra-day glycemic variability, thus, providing valuable feedback on the impact of behavioral and pharmacological interventions on blood glucose levels. This information can assist clinicians in their therapeutic decision making when adjustments are needed, and it can increase patients&#x02019; understanding of their disease, reinforce self-management practices, and enhance patient empowerment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>SMBG is only useful, however, when the glucose data are collected in a structured manner, accurately interpreted, and utilized to take appropriate therapeutic actions. New guidelines from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) recommend that structured SMBG be performed over short periods of time, initially and periodically, in order to obtain glucose profiles that are representative of daily glucose excursions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The aforementioned studies regarding glycemic variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] suggest that SMBG should be performed with increased frequency to monitor glycemic excursions in T2DM patients even if the effect on HbA1c may be minimal. They also suggest that the various therapeutic strategies now in use should be evaluated for their potential to minimize glucose excursion, as well as for their ability to reduce HbA1c.</p><p>Although the value and utility of SMBG has been demonstrated in T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and insulin-treated T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], SMBG use in non-insulin-treated diabetes remains somewhat controversial. Some studies have shown little or no glycemic benefit associated when SMBG was unstructured and/or clinicians underutilized results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; however, inherent limitations in the design of these studies has resulted in some questioning of the related findings in terms of external validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In essence, these studies were not designed to make use of SMBG to guide patient&#x02019;s self-management and medical care with the aim of improving metabolic control. Of note, more recent studies, which utilized structured glucose monitoring regimens as an integral component of comprehensive treatment interventions, have demonstrated that appropriate use of SMBG facilitates therapy optimization and desired behavioral changes, leading to improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>With the aim of further addressing this issue, we designed a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open, parallel group, randomized, and controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of structured SMBG on glycemic control in non-insulin-treated T2DM patients. In this study, the SMBG was used to generate information on glucose levels at specific times during the day and to make use of this information in order to prompt appropriate therapeutic actions by patients and clinicians.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Prospective, Randomized Trial on Intensive SMBG Management Added Value in Non-insulin-Treated T2DM Patients (PRISMA) is a 12-month, prospective, multicenter, open, parallel group, randomized, and controlled clinical trial that was designed to evaluate the added value of an intensive, structured SMBG regimen in T2DM patients treated with oral agents and/or diet alone (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Diagram of the PRISMA study protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="592_2011_357_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Patients randomized to the experimental group (intensive structured monitoring [ISM]) will be compared with patients who perform discretionary, unstructured SMBG (active control [AC]).

One hundred microliters of a 0.005% butylhydroxytoluene solution in ethanol will be added to 10 milliliter of urine for each 24-h urine collection. Samples will be stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0; C until shipment in dry ice to the central laboratory. Urinary 8-iso PGF2&#x003b1; will be measured using an enzymatic immunoassay (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size</title><p>Five hundred participants in each group (1,000 total) will be required to have an approximate 90% probability of detecting as significant (at the two-sided 5% level) a 0.3% difference between the ISM and AC group in the mean HbA1c change at visit 5 compared to baseline, with an assumed standard deviation of 1.25% and a loss to follow-up of 25%. This sample size will also provide 85% power to show an 11% difference between the two groups in percentage of subjects reaching or maintaining the risk target (LBGI &#x02264;2.5 and HBGI &#x02264;5), considering 50% of subjects arriving to target in the standard group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study procedures</title><p>The duration of the intervention is 12&#x000a0;months, with patient visits occurring during the assessment period at baseline (visit 1) and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12 (visit 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively). The study will be managed by a certified clinical research organization (CROM, Verona, Italy).</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Assessment period</title><p>During the assessment period&#x02014;less than 15&#x000a0;days prior to the baseline visit&#x02014;clinicians will describe the study in details to prospective participants, obtain written informed consent, record demographics, collect relevant medical history/lifestyle information, document all current medications, perform physical examinations, measure and record weight, height, blood pressure, heart rate, compute body mass index (BMI), and collect laboratory samples to measure lipid levels and serum creatinine. Urine for the measurement of 8-iso PGF2&#x003b1; will be collected in patients from the six clinical sites that agreed to participate in this ancillary study.</p><p>All eligible patients will be asked to complete the diabetes-specific quality of life questionnaire and the diabetes-specific locus of control questionnaire. They will receive a blood glucose meter (Accu-Chek<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Aviva, Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and 12 test strips to obtain a 4-point daily glucose profile 3 times in 1&#x000a0;week, two during working days and one during the weekend, and they will be scheduled to attend the basic session of the comprehensive educational program.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>First visit</title><p>At the first visit, investigators will download SMBG data from the blood glucose meters using an automated downloading device. All serious and non-serious adverse events will be recorded. Eligible patients will then be randomized to the ISM or AC group. A computer generated randomization list prepared by a statistician and unknown to the investigators at the clinical sites will be used. The randomization code was developed by a statistician of the clinical research organization managing the study and will be unknown to the investigators at the clinical sites. A computer random number generator was used to select random permuted blocks of size 4. Randomization will be stratified by the diabetes treatment regimens of participants at the time of enrollment (diet only, or diet plus diabetes medications). Each clinical site will receive two sets of sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes containing the allocation information that were prepared by the personnel of the clinical research organization managing the trial. The investigators will be trained to write the name of the patient to be randomized on the envelope with the lowest sequence number of the appropriate set (diet only or diet plus diabetes medications) and then open the envelope and discuss treatment allocation with the patient. Investigators and study participants will not be blinded to group assignment. Statisticians analyzing the data and personnel at the central laboratory measuring HbA1c will be blinded to group assignment.</p><p>ISM patients will receive 150 test strips to obtain the requested glucose profiles and an additional 50 test strips for discretionary use (in case of hypoglycemia and/or at any time, they feel the need to monitor their blood glucose levels). They will also receive additional instructions on how to interpret SMBG data and a dedicated diary listing the assigned glycemic targets: &#x0003c;110&#x000a0;mg/dL for fasting and before-lunch values and &#x0003c;50 mg/dL difference between post-prandial and pre-prandial glucose levels) and suggestions on how to reach them. Suggestions will be in the form of &#x0201c;cheat lists&#x0201d; with appropriate lifestyle changes in response to real life situations (e.g., too high post-prandial glycemic excursion or a low pre-prandial glucose value, etc.).</p><p>AC patients will receive 24 test strips to obtain the requested glucose profiles and an additional 26 test strips for discretionary use. No instruction will be provided to AC patients regarding timing and frequency of testing.</p><p>Blood samples for the measurement of HbA1c by the central laboratory will be collected, frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C, and stored until shipment in dry ice. All participants will be made aware of their risk of hypoglycemia, based on the diabetes medications they have been prescribed. After resolving any hypoglycemic event, patients will be asked to record the glucose value in an ad hoc diary and contact the center of case of additional hypoglycemic episodes close in time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Follow-up visits</title><p>At each follow-up visit (months 3, 6, 9, and 12), investigators will perform physical examinations; measure and record BMI, blood pressure, and heart rate; collect blood samples for HbA1c measurements; and record changes in diabetes treatment. With patients randomized to the ISM group, investigators will review and discuss the patient&#x02019;s diary, record changes in diet and physical activity, and review structured SMBG measurements. For patients in the ISM group, investigators will have the option to use the defined algorithm for adjusting diabetes medications based on the downloaded SMBG data; however, they will be allowed to make adjustments according to their clinical judgment. In the AC group, SMBG data will not be used to make adjustments of diabetes medications, which will be based exclusively on HbA1c and hypoglycemic events (either self-reported or documented).</p><p>ISM patients will receive 200 test strips at each follow-up visit for the requested glucose profiles (150 strips) and additional testing (50 strips). AC patients will receive &#x0201c;memo cards&#x0201d; at month 3 and 9 visits, reminding them to complete their 3-day, 4-point glucose profiles prior to month 6 and 12 visits, when data collected in the meters will be downloaded. All patients will be offered additional education sessions from the standardized education program throughout the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Primary and secondary endpoints will be analyzed for the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which consists of all randomized patients who have a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. Only the primary endpoint will be analyzed for the per protocol (PP) population, which consists of all randomized patients from the ITT population who complete the study without major protocol violations and who are compliant with the SMBG regimen (i.e., for participant in the ISM group at least 80% of the expected structured capillary glucose measurements; for the AC group &#x0003c;200 unstructured discretionary capillary glucose measurements).</p><p>All statistical analyses and data processing will be performed using SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Software (version 9.02, TS level 02M0) on a Windows 2000/XP Pro operating system. Descriptive statistics will be provided in summary tables by group according to the type of variable summarized. Standard quantitative statistics (N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be presented for quantitative criteria. Frequency distribution (number of non-missing observations [N] and percentages [%]) will be presented for qualitative criteria.</p><p>The analysis of the first co-primary endpoint (i.e., the mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to visit 5) will be analyzed using the SAS PROC MIXED procedure and will be based on a mixed linear model with randomized group, center, visit, and the randomized-group-by-visit interaction as fixed effects and baseline as covariate. An unstructured variance&#x02013;covariance matrix will be used to model the correlation within each patient and between the four repeated measurements (i.e., over the post-baseline visits). Maximum likelihood estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the mean difference between randomized groups at 12&#x000a0;months will be calculated using the Newton&#x02013;Raphson algorithm implemented in the SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Proc Mixed Procedure. A two-sided test with a <italic>P</italic> value &#x02264;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p><p>The interaction between randomized group and center will be assessed. A two-sided <italic>p</italic> value &#x02264;0.10 will be considered statistically significant for the test of interaction between randomized group and center. If a statistically significant interaction is observed, efforts will be made to determine whether and how the interaction may affect the comparisons between randomized groups. Taking into account that maximum likelihood estimates have less bias than single imputation methods (e.g., LOCF) for missing informative and are, by definition, unbiased under a missing completely at random (MCAR) and a missing at random (MAR) mechanism of &#x0201c;missingness,&#x0201d; the mixed linear model described above represents an ideal choice for handling missing data and correcting for the bias potentially caused by drop-out participants in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>The analysis of the second co-primary endpoint (i.e., the percentage of subjects reaching or maintaining the risk target at visit 5 compared to baseline) will be analyzed using the SAS PROC FREQ procedure and will be based on the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel test controlling for clinical site effects.</p><p>Secondary endpoints will be analyzed according to the type of variable. Summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for mean changes (continuous variables) and for risk differences (categorical variables).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Diabetes is a growing, worldwide epidemic with significant associated clinical, social, and economic costs. It is critical that healthcare resources committed to diabetes management are applied both effectively and efficiently.</p><p>The benefits of SMBG have been demonstrated in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and insulin-treated type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, findings from studies in non-insulin-treated T2DM have been inconsistent. In studies that utilized random or low-intensity blood glucose monitoring regimens and/or where the data generated were not used to make treatment decisions, SMBG showed little or no benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. More recent studies, however, have shown a significant benefit when SMBG is structured in a manner that yields easily discernable blood glucose patterns, and when those data are used to make appropriate therapeutic changes in lifestyle or diabetes medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Our study was designed to test the optimal use of SMBG to improve HbA1c and minimize glycemic excursions. With the inclusion criteria of an HbA1c from 7 to 9% we expect to capture participants who are representative of the Italian patient population attending a diabetes clinic and not meeting the target of good glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. It is important to note that our intervention emphasizes appropriate utilization of SMBG data by both patients and clinicians, focusing on the value of SMBG as a tool that enhances patients&#x02019; understanding of their disease, supports the modification of patient behavior toward a healthier lifestyle, and guides and supports therapeutic changes by both clinicians and patients. Utilization of PP analyses in conjunction with ITT will enable us to both identify obstacles to adherence and more fully assess the efficacy of the intervention. Inclusion of multiple dependent variables will allow us to assess the broader impact of the intervention, including changes in patient and physician attitudes and behaviors. Patient recruitment for the PRISMA study started in April 2008 and was completed in May 2010; results will be available in 2012.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The PRISMA Study is funded by
