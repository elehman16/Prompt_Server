During the 8-week study, half of the participants ingested the standardized rose hip product, while the other half ingested astaxanthin. Objective measurements of facial wrinkles, skin moisture, and elasticity were made by using Visioscan, Corneometer, and Cutometer at the beginning of the study, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks. Evaluation of participant satisfaction of both supplements was assessed using questionnaires. In addition, the effect of the rose hip preparation on cell longevity was measured in terms of leakage of hemoglobin through red cell membranes (hemolytic index) in blood samples kept in a blood bank for 5 weeks. Significance of all values was attained with <italic>P</italic>&#x02264;0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the double-blinded study, the rose hip group showed statistically significant improvements in crow&#x02019;s-feet wrinkles (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), skin moisture (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and elasticity (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) after 8 weeks of treatment. A similar improvement was observed for astaxanthin, with <italic>P</italic>-values 0.05, 0.001, and 0.05. Likewise, both groups expressed equal satisfaction with the results obtained in their self-assessment. The rose hip powder further resulted in increased cell longevity of erythrocyte cells during storage for 5 weeks in a blood bank.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Results suggest that intake of the standardized rose hip powder (Hyben Vital<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) improves aging-induced skin conditions. The apparent stabilizing effects of the rose hip product on cell membranes of stored erythrocyte cells observed in this study may contribute to improve the cell longevity and obstructing skin aging.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

This also includes aging of the skin. In this context, genetics, nutrition, and the environment are important. Another important factor is exposure to UV radiation. Exposure of the skin to UV induces the generation of reactive oxygen species, causing chronic inflammation and the breakdown of cell membranes in a process referred to as photoaging of the skin. Photoaging damages collagen, elastin, and the skin&#x02019;s moisture barrier, leading to wrinkles, sagging, toughening, and dry skin texture.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Rose hips, the red fleshy berries of the dog rose (<italic>Rosa canina</italic>), have been known to have medicinal properties since the time of Pliny the Elder (23&#x02013;79 BC).

Major exclusion criteria were smoking, being pregnant or breastfeeding, or having history of taking derivatives of vitamin A within 3 months before study. Volunteers on botulinum toxin, collagen, or fillers injection within 12 months before the study were also excluded. Furthermore, volunteers using facial products containing hydroquinone, steroids, or other creams to reduce wrinkles on the face or who took vitamin supplements of various kinds within the period of &#x0003c;4 weeks prior to the study were also excluded from the study.</p><p>For the study of the effect of rose hip on red blood cell longevity, 18 healthy volunteers represented by both sexes, mean age 47 years, range: 30&#x02013;59 years, were included in the study as the test group, after local announcements. A group of six volunteers not receiving any rose hip, astaxanthin, vitamins, or food additionals were included as a control group. All volunteers were free from any known diseases and were not on vitamin or food supplementations for at least 3 months before entering the study. They were also asked to refrain from taking any other vitamin supplementation during the entire study period that was 28 days of treatment, followed by 5 weeks of follow-up.

As both remedies are strong antioxidants, this may help to protect collagen and elastin from free radicals such as reactive oxygen species formed by the process of UV-induced oxidative metabolism responsible for skin aging.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> This may to some extent explain the impact on the skin, observed in the present study, as collagen, known as a main component of cartilage in joints also is very central in the skin, and because antioxidants can protect cell membranes also from the damage caused by UV radiation also named photoaging.<xref rid="b16-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Another aspect of rose hip impact on the skin is GOPO and its anti-inflammatory properties,<xref rid="b7-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> indicating an inhibition of human neutrophil chemotaxis and interleukin (IL) production.<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b21-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This anti-inflammatory theory can be of particular interest, as UV radiation is known to cause cell damage that induces inflammation and suppress the immune system of the skin.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is also of interest to note that seeds and seed oil from rose hip for centuries have been used as protection of the skin and also to restore scars after burn injury, especially in South America.<xref rid="b4-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As mentioned earlier, seeds and the oil from rose hip seeds contain high concentrations of PUFA, among them linoleic acid (C18:2<italic>n</italic>-6) and alpha linolenic acid (C18:3<italic>n</italic>-3)<xref rid="b5-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> which are major elements of the PUFA content of the epidermis.<xref rid="b6-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The <italic>n</italic>-6 PUFA have a particular role in structural integrity and barrier function of the skin, and both <italic>n-6 and n-3</italic> PUFA are essential and give rise to potent signal molecules called eicosanoids, which influences the inflammatory response of the skin and can reduce photoaging. The seeds and shells also contain high amounts of carotenoids, which are precursors of vitamin A and high amount of vitamin E. These fat-soluble vitamins are essential in supporting and maintaining the skin.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b22-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Vitamin A stimulates the cells of the skin and has been suggested to restore damaged skin cells and is also reported to be an antiaging ingredient.<xref rid="b24-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In addition, vitamin E is also reported to support the skin from burns and DNA damage.<xref rid="b25-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Finally, rose hip is also rich in water-soluble vitamin C, polyphenolic compounds, and flavonoids substances, which are reported to have cell supporting properties.<xref rid="b26-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There are strong indications for the role of vitamin C in supporting the skin and collagen formation.<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> There are also indications that vitamin C in combination with vitamin E is superior than being used alone.<xref rid="b25-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> An integrative action of different substances in rose hip seeds and shells may, therefore, explain the effect of the present rose hip powder supplementation on the skin.</p><p>Cell longevity, when determined as red cell membrane permeability of hemoglobin supported by the measurement of hemolytic index, indicates that the intake of the present rose hip powder reduces the flux of hemoglobin through cell membranes, when exposed to 1 day of stress after 10 days of storage in a blood bank (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-10-1849">Table 1</xref>). The same came through, when red cells were tested close to the limit of their life length, the time point where cell membranes start to disintegrate &#x02013; get old, which in our setup was after 5 weeks in the blood bank (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-10-1849">Table 2</xref>). It is encouraging to note that 2&#x02013;3 weeks of treatment with a certain food additional can reduce the disintegration of cell membranes, when estimated as the leak of hemoglobin from the interior of the cell into the medium outside the cells, at least when the cells are stored in a blood bank. If cells leak cytosol to their exterior surroundings, it is also likely that external contaminants may leak into the cells interior. If this happens in the epidermis, infection and breakdown of surfaces can occur. Antioxidants, however, has been shown to benefit membranes of red cells, as it was earlier shown that antioxidants can inhibit the damage of red cell membranes in stored blood.<xref rid="b13-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This combined with the fact that rose hip was rated as the strongest antioxidant of all berries<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> makes it likely that the antioxidant theory can play a role in keeping cell membranes intact. It was also shown in an animal model, that the content of PUFA, C18:2, linoleic acid was improved in red cell membranes after animals were fed high amounts of vegetarian oil with high content of linoleic acid for 15 days and that the red cell membrane stability had improved after the treatment.<xref rid="b30-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This is of particular interest as the present rose hip species has very high seed content of linoleic and also alpha-linolenic acids. It seems likely, therefore, that the present rose hip powder can modify and to some extend diminish the disintegration of red cell membranes and possibly add to red cell membrane longevity by adding to the amount of cell membrane PUFA. The time scale of our cell membrane data, 2&#x02013;3 weeks treatment before any impact, correlates well with the 15 days mentioned in the above discussed animal study.<xref rid="b30-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A certain galactolipid, GOPO, was recently isolated from the present rose hip species.<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The present powdered rose hip as well as the galactolipid GOPO, when isolated, was shown to reduce MMP-1 gene expression. This is interesting as MMP-1 is an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of cell structures such as collagen. Moreover, GOPO and rose hip upregulate genes that are responsible for the synthesis of collagen.<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In the same study, it was demonstrated that the present rose hip powder had strong anti-inflammatory properties. This notion is supported by clinical studies on patients with joint disease who were given 5 g of seed and shell containing rose hip powder daily.<xref rid="b10-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b12-cia-10-1849" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Different mechanisms may so far explain the observed changes in cell longevity and the supportive impact on the skin.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>It is interesting to note that rose hip powder, containing shells and seeds, seems to modify structures of the skin when given orally and a further improvement of the skin from rose hip might even be available if the intake of the oral preparation was combined with oil from seeds directly added to the surface of the skin. It is also encouraging that there are several explanations for the present findings, as PUFA, especially linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid are essential to the skin and very abundant in the present subspecies of rose hip, and in addition, it was shown that certain elements of rose hip including the galactolipid (GOPO) protects collagen from breakdown and may improve its growth. Finally, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory property of the given powder can protect the skin. The same mechanism may also explain the improved longevity of red cells. Further, it should be noted that although the standardized rose hip powder does indeed contain trace amounts of alkaloids, astaxanthin has not been identified in the pseudo fruits of <italic>R</italic>. <italic>canina</italic>, to the best of our knowledge. An evaluation of the potential additive effect between pure astaxanthin, a well-known remedy against wrinkles, and the standardized rose hip product (Hyben Vital<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was not pursued in the current study. This should be investigated in future studies.</p><p>With regard to the current study, certain reservations should be taken. A well-powered, large-scale, placebo-controlled follow-up trial on the actual skin conditions is strongly warranted for supporting the present pilot study. The present study on cell longevity should also be repeated and in large-scale placebo-controlled settings. Moreover, future studies should aim to define the more active components of the standardized rose hip product, which may turn out to be GOPO, antioxidants (including the natural xanthines), various small molecules, possibly in concert with PUFA, or other yet unidentified components.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is concluded that the present rose hip powder may support the skin and cell longevity by mechanisms involving PUFA, support of collagen, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory properties.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Hyben Vital is greatly acknowledged for supplying their standardized rose hip powder, Ove Aaskoven, Tolstrup Data, for supporting the statistical analysis of the data collected in this study, and Farinaz Raziani for preparing figures.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>K Wongsuphasawat is a board director for NutraMedica, K Winther has been a consultant to Hyben Vital on veterinarian products.
