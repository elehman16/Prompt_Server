The working environment, as well as lifestyle and socioeconomic status contribute to the disparity and variation in prevalence of these risk factors. High physical work demands have been shown to increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and mortality, contrary to leisure time physical activity. High physical work demands in combination with a low cardiorespiratory fitness infer a high relative workload and an excessive risk for cardiovascular mortality. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine whether a worksite aerobic exercise intervention will reduce the relative workload and cardiovascular risk factors by an increased cardiorespiratory fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A cluster-randomized controlled trial is performed to evaluate the effect of the worksite aerobic exercise intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness and cardiovascular risk factors among cleaners. Cleaners are eligible if they are employed&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20&#x02009;hours/week, at one of the enrolled companies. In the randomization, strata are formed according to the manager the participant reports to. The clusters will be balanced on the following criteria: Geographical work location, gender, age and seniority. Cleaners are randomized to either I) a reference group, receiving lectures concerning healthy living, or II) an intervention group, performing worksite aerobic exercise &#x0201c;60 min per week&#x0201d;. Data collection will be conducted at baseline, four months and 12&#x02009;months after baseline, at the worksite during working hours. The data collection will consist of a questionnaire-based interview, physiological testing of health and capacity-related measures, and objective diurnal measures of heart rate, physical activity and blood pressure. Primary outcome is cardiorespiratory fitness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Information is lacking about whether an improved cardiorespiratory fitness will affect the cardiovascular health, and additionally decrease the objectively measured relative workload, in a population with high physical work demands. Previous intervention studies have lacked robust objective measurements of the relative workload and physical work demands. This study will monitor the relative workload and general physical activity before, during after the intervention, and contribute to the understanding of the previously observed opposing effects on cardiovascular health and mortality from occupational and leisure time physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The study is registered as ISRCTN86682076.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Worksite intervention</kwd><kwd>Cleaners</kwd><kwd>Aerobic exercise</kwd><kwd>Work demands</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Ambulatory blood pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The prevalence of precursors of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and obesity is unevenly distributed across occupational groups and ethnicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This distribution in prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors reflects variation in lifestyle behaviour and socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Factors within the working environment, as well as lifestyle behaviour and socioeconomic status contribute to the disparity and variation in the prevalence of these diseases between occupational groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Factors in the working environment receiving most attention in relation to cardiovascular diseases are psychosocial stressors, shift work and occupational noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. More recently, high physical work demands have been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This may be explained by upper limb activity increases heart rate and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] at the same absolute intensity as during lower limb activity. Additionally will the relatively higher aerobic workload for performing an absolute work task with low, compared to high, cardiorespiratory fitness, Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] will contribute to an excessive stress on the arterial wall and thereby it could constitute a cardiovascular risk. One potential explanation of this is the inflammation and cholesterol deposition in arterial endothelia, decreasing the lumen-diameter and the level of contractility of arterial layer of smooth muscle, giving rise eventually to arteriosclerosis and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conception of the relative workload.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-12-645-1"/></fig><p>This proposed physiological mechanism is supported by the finding that a combination of high physical work demands and low cardiorespiratory fitness confers excessive risk for cardiovascular disease mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], hypothetically by the increased relative aerobic workload, Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. This may be explained by the higher relative aerobic workload and excessive wall-stress on arterial endothelia, experienced by an employee with low, compared to an employee with high, cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In line with this, the international recommendations for aerobic workload are based on the physical work demands relative to the cardiorespiratory fitness of the employee [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The present international recommendation for aerobic workload is a maximum average intensity of 30&#x02009;% of maximal oxygen consumption during an 8&#x02009;hour working day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in occupational groups with high physical work demands have among others included implementation of ergonomic adjustments for reducing the aerobic workload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, these adjustments have not been successful in reducing the aerobic workload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Another strategy for reducing the relative aerobic workload is to implement initiatives aiming at improved cardiorespiratory fitness, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In theory, an increased cardiorespiratory fitness will reduce the relative aerobic workload, Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, high quality studies evaluating the effects on aerobic workload of intensive aerobic exercise and increased cardiorespiratory fitness are lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. </p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Randomization procedure, multilevel design.</bold> The clusters are randomised into either reference (R) or intervention group (I).

Each stratum is formed according to which manager the participant reports to. The clusters will be balanced on geographical work location, gender, age and seniority. Within each stratum, the clusters will be paired to minimize imbalance across several strata. Clusters will be paired according to number of participants, gender, age and seniority. Strata will be named alphabetically, and clusters will be named consecutively within each stratum. The randomization will be carried out by researchers blinded to the identity of the strata and clusters. All paired clusters assigned to the specific stratum will be drawn from an opaque, tossed bag and will be alternately allocated to either reference or intervention group, depending of the flip of a coin.

Therefore, the main aim of this study is to examine whether a worksite aerobic exercise intervention will reduce the relative aerobic workload and cardiovascular risk factors by an increased cardiorespiratory fitness among cleaners.</p><p>It is well known that aerobic exercise is highly effective in increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and reducing cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, this study will focus on the implementation of physical activity and the effect in terms of reduction in relative aerobic workload and cardiovascular risk factors in a working population with high physical work demands. Earlier intervention studies in this field have lacked robust, objective measurements of the relative aerobic workload, occupational physical activity and physical work demands in general. This study will provide objective data on the relative aerobic workload and general physical activity before, during and after the worksite aerobic exercise intervention. In addition, cardiovascular risk factors such as diurnal blood pressure will be monitored and evaluated.</p><sec><title>Impact of results</title><p>Information from effect and implementation of the intervention may be beneficial for future reduction and prevention of cardiovascular risk factors in blue collar workers. Blue collar workers are well known to have an increased prevalence of health issues like cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], obesity, hypertension and musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Knowledge about implementation of health initiatives like physical activity for this work group is therefore particularly important.</p><p>Moreover, existing knowledge about effects of physical activity on cardiovascular risk is mainly based on male populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. The cleaning sector in Denmark primarily employs women, and this study will therefore enhance the scientific knowledge about effects of physical activity on cardiovascular risk factors among women.</p><p>The impact of enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness on the relative aerobic workload will be measured with the objectively recording systems, providing objective diurnal information over several days regarding percentage of HRR and diurnal blood pressure. Diurnal objective measures of physical activity, such as body position, will be measured by triaxial accelerometry. Occupational workload has previously been objectively measured among cleaners, public administrators and other occupational groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>], but none of these studies have simultaneously measured body position, physical activity and the aerobic workload. Simultaneous, objective collection of heart rate, blood pressure, body position and physical activity will enable more detailed information about the occupational workload and the related cardiovascular responses among cleaners to be included in the activity profile. To our knowledge, such a detailed analysis has not previously been conducted during free living subjects for several days.</p><p>The impact of the intervention will also be analyzed including several factors known to increase the cardiovascular risk, i.e. the metabolic factors HDL and hsCRP. Measurement of metabolic factors offers the possibility of a comprehensive in depth analysis not previous seen for a field intervention study among cleaners and other blue collar populations.</p><p>Besides the physiological effects on relative aerobic workload and cardiovascular health, the intervention may also have a positive impact on the subjective feeling of strain and physical work exhaustion during [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and after work as well as need for recovery, previously shown to be related to cardiorespiratory fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>In addition, as this study combines diurnal objective measurements of physical activity over several days, with an physical exercise intervention, it will contribute to our understanding of previously observed contradictory effects on cardiovascular risk factors and mortality of work and leisure time physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>A strength of the study is the diurnal objective measurement of physical activity, body positions, heart rate and blood pressure over several days, which will decrease the risk of subjective recall bias, and bias from factors such as individual physical capacity and symptoms. The cluster-randomized controlled trial design is a methodological strength, since it minimizes the risk of contamination between the intervention and reference group, and reduces the risk for bias.</p><p>The systematic intervention mapping approach is a strong feature as the experience and information obtained in the process of implementing an exercise initiative in a cleaning company will be captured and benefit the project and future studies. Another strength of the study is that the project takes place at several companies, with reference and intervention groups within each company, reducing the risk of uneven distribution of participants in the project as a whole, should a company withdraw from the project, this greatly enhance the external validity.</p><p>A limitation is the restriction of recruitment to companies in the area of Copenhagen. The companies and participants may therefore not be representative of cleaning companies and cleaners in Denmark as a whole, and therefore limit the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>In summary, this study will investigate the effect of a worksite intervention aiming to enhance the cardiorespiratory fitness, and reduce aerobic workload and cardiovascular risk factors, in an occupational group with a high physical work demands and generally poor cardiovascular health. The intervention will be evaluated on the basis of objective diurnal measurements of, amongst other factors, heart rate, body position and blood pressure. Additionally, the impact of the intervention on established cardiovascular risk factors will be evaluated. The intervention will be developed in collaboration with the participating companies, and will contribute information about the effects of introducing an aerobic exercise intervention in an occupational group greatly in need of health promoting initiatives.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index; HbA1c: Glycated haemoglobin; HDL: High density lipoprotein; HRmax: Maximal heart rate; HRR: Heart rate reserve; hsCRP: High sensitive C-reactive protein; RPE: Rate of perceived extersion; SHR: Sleeping heart rate; VO<sub>2</sub>max: Maximal oxygen consumption; WHR: Waist to hip ratio.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MK, PK, MBJ, KS and AH participated in the discussion of the conceptual design of the study and wrote the initial protocol as well as the design of the intervention.
