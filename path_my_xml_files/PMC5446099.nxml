Returning to work after childbirth is associated with depression; however, it is unclear if this finding applies to women who are at high risk for postpartum depression. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between employment status and depression symptomatology among women at risk for postpartum depression (defined as personal or maternal history of depression). This study was a post hoc analysis from a previously conducted randomized controlled trial. Participants (n = 124; ages 18&#x02013;42) were 7 months postpartum and had participated in a randomized trial examining the efficacy of an exercise intervention for the prevention of postpartum depression (study was conducted from January 2010 through November 2011). Participants completed questionnaires examining demographic characteristics and psychosocial variables at 6 weeks and 7 months postpartum. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale was administered at 7 months postpartum to assess depression symptomatology. Sixty-eight percent of the participants reported that they were employed at 7 months postpartum. Employment at 7 months postpartum was associated with lower depression symptomatology (as measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) after controlling for condition assignment, marital status, and having other children. Among women who worked outside of the home, there were no differences between those who worked full-time versus part-time on depression symptomatology. Employment may be a protective factor for postpartum depression symptomatology; however, we cannot infer causation given this study&#x02019;s cross-sectional design. Postpartum women at risk for depression who are contemplating employment should consider the possible protective effect of employment on depression.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>employment status</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd><kwd>postpartum depression</kwd><kwd>women&#x02019;s health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1745505717708475"><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 13%&#x02013;19% of new mothers report depression during the postpartum period.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Negative consequences associated with postpartum depression include poor bonding with the infant,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> high weight retention for the mother,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> difficulty taking care of the newborn,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and a higher risk of future depression for both parents.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Therefore, it is important to examine protective factors related to the onset of postpartum depression.</p><p>Research indicates that working outside of the home may be a protective factor for postpartum depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> A cross-sectional study among 198 first-time mothers found that having a low income, being unmarried, having less than a college education, and being unemployed were related to clinically high depression scores at 3 months postpartum.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> One limitation of this study is that this study only included first-time mothers, and it is unclear how the findings would generalize to mothers who have multiple children.</p><p>A similar study examined employment status and depression among 700 women who had given birth on average 7 months prior to the assessment.

One problem with this study is that depression was assessed using only a two item questionnaire (the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2)). Another study among 1,359 mothers found that being employed was a protective factor for depression during the first 2 years following childbirth.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>Research also indicates that among women who return to work after giving birth, returning to work later (i.e. 13&#x02013;24 weeks) relates to improved postpartum mental health.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, there may be a limit to the protective effects of returning to work.

Our sample consisted of women at risk for depression (defined as having a personal or maternal history of depression), which is a population that has not been specifically examined in previous studies. We controlled for potential confounding variables in the analysis, including race/ethnicity, body mass index, education level, income level, marital status, age, antidepressant medication use, breastfeeding status, and having other children.

One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests examined the relationship between the continuous demographic/psychosocial variables and employment status. Logistic regression was first utilized to evaluate the relationship between employment status and postpartum depression symptomatology after controlling for several demographic/psychosocial variables (i.e. race/ethnicity, body mass index, education level, income level, marital status, age, antidepressant medication use, ever breastfed, and having other children) and condition assignment (exercise vs. wellness/support contact control condition). Previous literature guided the identification of potential confounders. We excluded potential confounders from the final analysis that were above a p-value of .15. We used r<sup>2</sup> as the index for goodness of it. The above analyses were post hoc and were not included in the original study protocol. The post hoc power analysis indicated that with a sample size of 124 and an odds ratio of 3.92, we would have 91% power to detect an effect of employment status on depression symptomatology.

Our study adds to the literature by finding that the protective effect of employment on postpartum depression also occurs in women who are at an increased risk for depression. This is important given women who have a history of depression are almost three times more likely (31% risk) to develop postpartum depression than women who do not have a history of depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>The rate of employment was higher in our study (68%) compared to previous studies (19%&#x02013;36%).<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Our findings are somewhat consistent with another study, which found that 80% of women employed during pregnancy returned to work by 1 year postpartum.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> However, it is difficult to compare employment rates with previous studies given differences in race, ethnicity, income level, education, and assessment time points between studies. Among participants who worked outside of the home, there were no significant differences between part-time versus full-time employees on depression symptomatology. This study did not have sufficient power to detect differences between part-time and full-time participants, and therefore, we cannot make definitive conclusions about this result. However, it is important to note that the correlation observed for the association between full versus part-time work and depression symptomatology was very low (r = &#x02212;.022). Consequently, it is unlikely that a larger sample size would have yielded a significant relationship.</p><p>Previous research has shown that even though postpartum employment appears to relate to better mental health, certain work characteristics might detract from this favorable relationship. For example, declines in postpartum mental health relate to the following: (1) Work characteristics such as total workload;<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> (2) higher psychological demands, lower schedule autonomy, and lower perceived control over work and family;<sup><xref rid="bibr30-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> and (3) reductions in favorable job characteristics such as job control, perceived job security, flexible start and finishing times, and provision of family-related leave including paid maternity leave.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Future research should address specific employment characteristics that promote postpartum mental health.</p><sec id="section12-1745505717708475"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, the results are correlational, and therefore, we cannot infer causation. It is possible that participants with depression were more likely to choose not to return to work. However, none of the participants were depressed at baseline, and therefore, this seems unlikely. Another limitation is that we retrospectively assessed employment status at approximately 7 months postpartum. Third, personal and family history of depression was not clinically verified and relied only on participant self-report. Fourth, our sample consisted of mostly Caucasian, high-income, and highly educated women and it is unclear how these findings would generalize to a more diverse sample. Given the high education and income level of this sample, many of the participants may have returned to higher paying jobs, which may not generalize to socioeconomically diverse women. Additionally, our exclusion criteria were extensive, which may also limit generalizability. However, it is important to note that a majority of women were excluded due to not having a personal or maternal history of depression or engaging in over 90 min of physical activity at baseline. Also related to generalizability, all participants received some form of intervention, and therefore, it is unclear if these results would generalize to women who do not receive extra support. A final limitation is that we only assessed depression at 7 months postpartum. This is problematic given depressive symptoms may have fluctuated throughout the postpartum period.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1745505717708475"><title>Future directions</title><p>There is a need for additional research that examines the relationship between employment and postpartum depression. Specifically, future studies should include longitudinal designs that examine number of hours worked, working from home, and work-related stress. It will be important for researchers to examine depression at multiple time points during the postpartum period and with a diverse sample of women. Future research should also examine the effect of type of work on depression. For example, a recent study found that women who worked from home reported a decrease in depression scores compared to those who worked outside of the home between 6 and 24 months after childbirth.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-1745505717708475" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Also, in this study, participants who reported higher job concerns reported increased depression over time. Future studies should examine various work factors and how they influence depression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section14-1745505717708475"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our study indicates that employment after childbirth among a sample of women at risk for postpartum depression may be a protective factor for depression, even after controlling for multiple factors related to depression. Women may want to consider this possibility, especially those with a history of depression, when deciding whether or not to return to work after childbirth. Unlike previous studies, there was no relationship between working full-time vs. part-time and depression. Our findings are correlational and therefore, should be interpreted with caution. There is a need for long-term longitudinal studies that examine work-related factors that may be associated with depression among diverse women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Amanda Bonikowske, Laura Polikowsky, and Silke Moeller for their significant contribution to conducting this study.
