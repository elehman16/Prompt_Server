The estimated prevalence of ADHD in adults is 4.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is well-recognized that ADHD manifests not only as impairments in the core ADHD symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity), but is also correlated with executive function deficits (EFD; impairment in cognitive self-regulatory processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] that impact goal-directed behavior and control emotional functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Executive function (EF) domains include verbal and nonverbal working memory, emotional self-regulation, shifting of attention or focus, and planning and problem solving among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Deficits in EF remain stable even in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], although presentation of core ADHD symptoms may change with age. EFD affects outcomes in education, work, social relationships, and psychosocial functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Validated rating scales of behaviors thought to be associated with EF include the self-reported Brown Attention-Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], Barkley Deficits in Executive Functioning Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The BRIEF-A scoring employs T-scores, where the normative population mean is set at 50, with a SD of 10. A T-score &#x02265;65 indicates clinically significant EF impairments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] of complex behavioral tasks in daily real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Compared with neuropsychological tests of EF, behavioral assessments may be better predictors of impairment in major life activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Such impairments may be reflected in quality of life (QOL), a subjective perception of well-being in various functional life domains including physical, psychological, cognitive, and social [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since deficits in EF domains may impact QOL across various life domains, concurrent assessments of EF and QOL may more fully quantify patient improvement on ADHD treatment.</p><p>Adults with symptoms of ADHD may display impairments in executive functioning and in QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Moreover, improvements in ADHD symptoms may coincide with improvements in both EF and QOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Instruments assessing QOL may be disease-specific or nonspecific. In either case, these may enable the physician to assess clinical treatment outcomes that may be perceived as important from a patient perspective and, hence, perceived as an appropriate means to monitor treatment progress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The self-reported Adult ADHD Impact Module (AIM-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] multi-item scale is a validated QOL measure that has demonstrated treatment sensitivity in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a long-acting psychostimulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Another validated QOL measure, the 29-item self-reported Adult ADHD QoL (AAQoL) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], exhibited responsiveness to ADHD treatment in an 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of the nonstimulant atomoxetine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The long-acting prodrug psychostimulant lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) is indicated in the United States for ADHD in children (6 to 12 years), adolescents (13 to 17 years), and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. LDX has demonstrated efficacy in reducing core ADHD symptoms in a randomized, controlled trial in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], using the ADHD Rating Scale IV (ADHD-RS-IV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; and was associated with improvements from baseline in EF, using the validated, self-reported BADDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], during the open-label phase of a modified analog classroom study (4-week) of adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the modified analog classroom study, LDX treatment demonstrated efficacy in adults with ADHD who had significant impairments in ADHD core symptoms and EF. Moreover, LDX demonstrated efficacy in QOL as assessed by AIM-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Further randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies may be useful to confirm the impact of psychostimulant treatment on QOL domains in adults with ADHD and EFD, and provide clinicians with information on the types of assessment tools available as well as their use in making patient-relevant assessments. A randomized, controlled trial using LDX in adult participants with both ADHD and EFD reported improvement in EFD with BRIEF-A Global Executive Composite (GEC) LS mean (SE) change from baseline of -11.1 (1.72) for placebo and -22.3 (1.67) for LDX, respectively (primary efficacy measure, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.0001; effect size of 0.74) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. During the course of the study, 2 separate QOL instruments were used as secondary outcomes. With these data, we may be able to explore ADHD treatment effects, not only on core symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity), but also on EFD and self-reported QOL during the course of that treatment.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>This report focuses on the secondary study outcomes reported including the effects of LDX treatment on participant-perceived QOL measures, the AIM-A, and the AAQoL. The AAQoL was added to the study as a protocol amendment and was not used on all participants. Also reported in this study is a post hoc subgroup analysis of those participants with both AIM-A and AAQoL scores at baseline. The primary objective of the present study was to demonstrate the efficacy of LDX versus placebo in improving EF in participants with ADHD and coexisting EFD.

The study was conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice E6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Following detailed explanation of the study, all adult participants and adult informants provided written informed consent.</p><p>Key inclusion criteria were adults with a reported baseline ADHD-RS-IV total score of &#x02265;28 and significant EFD, assessed using a self-reported BRIEF-A GEC T-score of &#x02265;65 at baseline. Participants were required to be in a close domicile relationship for at least 6 months prior to screening with an individual capable of participating as an informant on the participant&#x02019;s symptoms and behaviors in multiple social settings. Key exclusion criteria included adults who exhibited comorbid psychiatric conditions, controlled or uncontrolled, including severe axis I or II disorders, cardiovascular disease, a history of moderate to severe hypertension, current ADHD therapy, and a history of failure to respond to amphetamine therapy. After screening and washout for up to 4 weeks, eligible participants meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio at baseline (week 0) to placebo (n=81) or optimized LDX 30, 50, or 70 mg/d (n=80) during a 10-week, double-blind treatment period. Randomization was stratified by cohabitation status (married/cohabitating, not married/cohabitating); within-strata participants were randomized to placebo or LDX groups based on a 4-digit randomization code assigned once eligibility was established. Blinded assignment of treatment groups was accomplished through an interactive voice/web response system. During the 4-week dose-optimization period, treatment (morning; 7 <sc>am</sc> &#x000b1;2 hours) was initiated at 30 mg/d and titrated in 20-mg/week increments to an optimal dose (30, 50 or 70 mg/d, as tolerated). The optimal dose was based on a baseline ADHD-RS&#x02013;IV with adult prompts total score reduction of &#x02265;30% and a CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] scale rating of very much improved or much improved. Participants were continued at their optimal dose with no further dose adjustments (increase or decrease) permitted during the 6-week dose-maintenance period. The final dose-maintenance period visit was at week 10, with participants who did not complete the study assessed at an early termination (ET) visit.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy measures</title><sec><title><bold><italic>BRIEF-A</italic></bold></title><p>The self-reported BRIEF-A consists of 75 items that are scored as occurring never, sometimes, or often based on behavior in the 3 weeks prior to assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

The AIM-A consists of 6 multi-item global domain scales. For this study, 4 were considered key secondary efficacy measures: Performance and Daily Functioning, Impact of Symptoms: Daily Interference, Impact of Symptoms: Bother/Concern, and Relationships/Communication. The other 2 were additional, but not key, secondary efficacy measures: living with ADHD, and general well-being. The recall period for the multi-item scales is over 1 week and responses are based on a Likert scale that ranges from 1 to 5. Raw scores were transformed to a 0 to 100 scale with higher scores indicating a better QOL. The AIM-A also contains overall QOL questions 1 to 4:</p><p>1. &#x0201c;On a scale of 1&#x02013;10 how would you rate the overall quality of your life right now?&#x0201d; (higher scores representing more positive ratings).</p><p>2. &#x0201c;Has ADHD and its symptoms limited your ability to achieve what you want in life?&#x0201d; was rated by participants on a scale of 1 (yes, a lot) to 4 (no, not at all) with lower scores representing more limitation.</p><p>3. &#x0201c;Do you feel you are on the right track with your life?&#x0201d; was participant-rated on a scale of 1 (yes, definitely) to 3 (no, not at all).</p><p>4. &#x0201c;How much do you agree with the statement: Over the past few weeks, I&#x02019;ve had more good days than bad days&#x0201d; was scored on a scale of 1 (strong agreement) to 5 (strong disagreement).</p><p>The AIM-A was assessed at baseline (dose-optimization phase) and at week 4 and week 10/ET (dose-maintenance phase).</p></sec><sec><title><bold><italic>AAQoL</italic></bold></title><p>The self-reported AAQoL is a validated 29-item scale consisting of a total score and 4 subscales (life productivity, psychological health, life outlook, and relationships) designed to assess health-related QOL in adults with ADHD.

Moreover, self-reported responses to AIM-A questions 1 to 4 suggested that participants perceived better overall improvement in QOL with LDX treatment versus placebo. These data indicate that with LDX treatment, adults who have ADHD and EFD showed significant improvement on the self-reported AIM-A QOL. Numerical improvements over placebo were also seen with LDX treatment on the self-reported AAQoL total and subscale scores, although the prespecified testing hierarchy precludes inferential statistical analysis of the AAQoL. The self-reported QOL data in this analysis suggest comparable findings using either QOL measure (AIM-A or AAQoL).</p><p>The ability to be productive in the workplace is an important issue for adults with ADHD in an increasingly competitive work environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The study by Kupper et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], which reviewed published literature reporting on the impact of ADHD on work productivity and occupational health, suggested that adults with ADHD exhibited decreased work performance and productivity, increased behavioral issues (irritability and frustration), absenteeism, increased workplace accidents or injury, as well as increased indirect effects (eg, substance use and criminality) on occupational health. Real-life outcomes, such as productivity, can be assessed using these validated QOL scales and can be important for clinicians to determine ADHD treatment response. Adults with ADHD in this study reported significantly improved QOL with LDX treatment compared to placebo on the AIM-A Performance and Daily Functioning subscale and numerical improvement on the AAQoL Life Productivity domain.</p><p>The AIM-A QOL data from the present study were consistent with a 7-week, randomized controlled ADHD study of an extended-release mixed amphetamine salts formulation that also demonstrated significantly improved QOL at study endpoint relative to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. These study data suggest that significant improvement in QOL in those with ADHD may become apparent in as early as 7 weeks after initiating psychostimulant treatment.</p><p>Another 14-week randomized controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] demonstrated that the AAQoL total score was significantly improved from baseline versus placebo with atomoxetine (a nonstimulant), with an effect size of 0.24. In that study, however, significant improvement with atomoxetine versus placebo was only demonstrated on 1 of the 4 subscales, Psychological Health. Another 6-month, double-blind study, using the AAQoL scale, showed greater numerical improvement with atomoxetine than placebo in adult participants with ADHD of at least moderate severity, with the Life Outlook subscale score showing significant improvement versus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, QOL measures improved along with improvements in self-reported EF, using the BRIEF-A, and investigator-reported symptom improvement, using the ADHD-RS-IV with adult prompts. As described in the primary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], LDX treatment versus placebo significantly improved deficits in EF (BRIEF-A GEC T-scores of &#x02265;65) bringing scores well within the normative range. Likewise, significant improvements in ADHD symptoms with LDX treatment compared to placebo were also demonstrated with ADHD-RS-IV and CGI-I scores. Overall, these findings suggest that LDX treatment might result in improvements in multiple functional areas affected by ADHD, and that researchers as well as clinicians have available tools and resources to monitor such improvements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Since adults with comorbid psychiatric disease and significant cardiovascular disease were excluded from the current study population, caution should be taken when generalizing results to the overall population. In addition, study participants were required to meet a prespecified level of EFD, and this further limits generalization. The subjective, participant-reporting nature of such rating scales should also be considered because it is not possible to account for variability in rating scores among individual participants. Also, the short duration of the trial limits the ability to specify the long-term effects of LDX on assessments of QOL. The predefined hierarchical statistical testing program precludes statistical inferences on some of the measures, and no statistical inferences were made based on the post hoc analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adults with ADHD and clinically significant real-life EFD exhibited self-reported improvement on all QOL subscales and the majority of domains, using the self-reported AIM-A and AAQoL scales, respectively. The effects on QOL paralleled improvements in self-reported EF ratings and ADHD symptoms, as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Effect sizes were mostly medium to large in magnitude, with the exception of the AIM-A relationships/communication global domain. The results for this domain may have been impacted or skewed by eligibility criteria requiring stable relationships at study enrollment (all participants were required to have a reliable informant or significant other). Also, the relatively short study duration may have impacted the change scores and hence the effect size for the AIM-A relationships/communication global domain. For the AIM-A, all 6 domains were above the prespecified cut-off threshold for hierarchical testing; changes were all statistically significant, with effect sizes ranging from 0.31 to 0.93. The safety profile of LDX was consistent with long-acting psychostimulant use and other LDX studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AAQoL: Adult ADHD QoL; ADHD: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; ADHD-RS-IV: ADHD Rating scale version IV; AIM-A: Adult ADHD Impact module; ANCOVA: Analysis of covariance; BADDS: Brown attention-deficit disorder scale; BRIEF-A: Behavior rating inventory of EF-Adult; CGI-I: Clinical global impressions-improvement; CGI-S: Clinical global impressions-severity; DBP: Diastolic blood pressure; DSM-IV-TR: Diagnostic and statistical manual, fourth edition, text revision; ECG: Electrocardiogram; EF: Executive function; EFD: Executive function deficits; ES: Effect size; ET: Early termination; FAS: Full analysis set; GEC: Global executive composite; LDX: Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate; LS: Least squares; QOL: Quality of life; SBP: Systolic blood pressure; SD: Standard deviation; SE: Standard error; TEAEs: Treatment-emergent adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p><bold>Lenard A</bold>. <bold>Adler</bold>, <bold>MD</bold>, has been a consultant to AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly, Epi-Q, i3 Research, INC Research, Mindsite, Organon/Schering-Plough/Merck, Ortho-McNeil/Janssen/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Otsuka, Shire, United Biosource, Major League Baseball, Major League Baseball Players Association, the National Football League, Alcobra Pharmaceuticals and Theravance; he has received research support from Bristol-Myers Squibb, Chelsea Therapeutics, Eli Lilly, Organon/Schering-Plough/Merck, Ortho-McNeil/Janssen/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson and the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA); he has been on the advisory boards of Eli Lilly, i3 Research, INC Research, Mindsite, Organon/Schering-Plough/Merck, Ortho-McNeil/Janssen/Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Theravance and Alcobra Pharmaceuticals.
