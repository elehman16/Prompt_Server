Although outcomes for children have generally improved by early intervention services, the specific interventions that most benefit children with cerebral palsy are uncertain, and also, therapeutic interventions change over time.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Regarding to established neuroprotective properties of citicoline, the present study was planned to evaluate the efficacy of citicoline in combination with physiotherapy, cerebral palsy. Results of the present study showed that the difference in the frequency of GMFCS levels between groups was not statistically significant after treatment. But citicoline in combination with physiotherapy significantly improved the gross motor performance than physiotherapy alone in cerebral palsy, and the best positive effects were observed in patients with higher levels of GMFCS level 2 and 3. No therapeutic effects were observed in patients with the most severe form of cerebral palsy (GMFCS level 5).</p><p>Clinical trials about effect of citicoline in cerebral palsy are limited, and other studies evaluated this effect in other problems. In patients with head trauma, citicoline has shown its efficacy for recovery from posttraumatic coma, improvement of memory and cognitive function, and improvement of functional outcome.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In patients with ischemic stroke and ischemic cerebrovascular disease, citicoline accelerated improvement of cognitive function and motor performance.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In several well-organized trials in patients with vascular dementia and age-related dementia, citicoline has shown its efficacy in improvement of cognitive function.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although our study was different with reported studies in target population, but similar to these results, our findings showed improvement of cognitive function and motor performance.</p><p>Several mechanisms of action can be proposed for neuroprotective effects of citicoline in cerebral palsy. Although it may enhance neuroplasticity, the most probable mechanism of action for its neuroprotective effects in cerebral palsy is through its effects on neuronal membrane repaired and better functioning of neurotransmitter system in central nervous system. It seems that citicoline helps to better functioning of existing neurons.</p><p>Due to deficiency of clinical research in evaluation of the effect of citicoline in combination with physiotherapy in cerebral palsy, results of the present study can be noted as basement for more researches to finding possible effects. Furthermore, the main Limitation of our study may be is its small sample size. We believed that larger randomized studies with more sample size are necessary to assess the efficacy of citicoline in combination with physiotherapy in cerebral palsy, and it is suggested that important issues such as different dosage and duration of treatment are notable in further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Results of the present study demonstrated that the citicoline is effective and safe in the treatment of gross motor function combination with physiotherapy in patients with spastic cerebral palsy, although, these effects were particularly more pronounced in a milder form of cerebral palsy (patients with GMFCS level 2 and 3).</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Financial support was provided by
