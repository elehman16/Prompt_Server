Physical therapists play a key role in helping people with knee OA to increase appropriate physical activity. However, health care access issues, financial constraints, and other factors impede some patients from receiving physical therapy (PT) for knee OA. A need exists to develop and evaluate other methods to provide physical activity instruction and support to people with knee OA. This study is examining the effectiveness of an internet-based exercise training (IBET) program designed for knee OA, designed by physical therapists and other clinicians.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial of 350 participants with symptomatic knee OA, allocated to three groups: IBET, standard PT, and a wait list (WL) control group (in a 2:2:1 ratio, respectively). The study was funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which conducted a peer review of the proposal. The IBET program provides patients with a tailored exercise program (based on functional level, symptoms, and current activity), video demonstrations of exercises, and guidance for appropriate exercise progression. The PT group receives up to 8 individual visits with a physical therapist, mirroring standard practice for knee OA and with an emphasis on a home exercise program. Outcomes are assessed at baseline, 4&#x000a0;months (primary time point) and 12&#x000a0;months (to assess maintenance of treatment effects). The primary outcome is the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index, and secondary outcomes include objective physical function, satisfaction with physical function, physical activity, depressive symptoms and global assessment of change. Linear mixed models will be used to compare both the IBET and standard PT groups to the WL control group, examine whether IBET is non-inferior to PT (a treatment that has an established evidence base for knee OA), and explore whether participant characteristics are associated with differential effects of IBET and/or standard PT. This research is in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The IBET program could be disseminated widely at relatively low cost and could be an important resource for helping patients with knee OA to adopt and maintain appropriate physical activity. This trial will provide an important evaluation of the effectiveness of this IBET program for knee OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02312713?term=path-in&#x00026;rank=2">NCT02312713</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Knee</kwd><kwd>Physical Therapy</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Physical Activity</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common chronic health conditions and a leading cause of pain and disability among adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Knee OA is particularly common, with recent data indicating that 45&#x000a0;% of people may develop symptomatic knee OA in their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because of the forecasted growth in the U.S. older adult population, the prevalence of knee OA is expected to rise dramatically over the next several decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, research indicates that knee OA is occurring earlier in life, affecting younger adults more often than in previous years, likely due to increased rates of obesity and joint injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The rising prevalence and earlier occurrence of knee OA highlight the need for effective disease management strategies.</p><p>Many studies have confirmed that physical activity improves pain, function, and other key outcomes among patients with knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Based on this evidence, exercise is considered a cornerstone of managing knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, the majority of adults with OA are physically inactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and efforts are needed to promote physical activity in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Physical therapists can play a key role in helping patients with OA improve their physical activity and related outcomes. Physical therapy (PT) is also consistently recommended as component of knee OA treatment in professional guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, health care access-related issues can impede some patients with OA from receiving this important component of care. In medically underserved areas, PT services can be limited or lacking entirely. Some patients with OA lack insurance coverage, and for many others copayments make receipt of PT cost-prohibitive. These issues are particularly salient for individuals with low socioeconomic status, who also bear a greater burden of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These issues highlight a need for additional methods to provide instruction in and support for physical activity and self-management for patients with knee OA.</p><p>The internet has been increasingly used to deliver physical activity and other behavioral programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. While face-to-face PT visits and other physical activity programs clearly have value, several important opportunities are associated with internet-based delivery, including the capacity for widespread dissemination at relatively low cost and convenience for users. To date little research exists on internet-based physical activity programs for individuals with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and few studies of this kind have focused on older adults who comprise a large proportion of this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This manuscript describes the protocol of a randomized clinical trial examining the effectiveness of an internet-based exercise training program (IBET) and standard PT for patients with knee OA, both compared to a wait list control group. The study will also examine whether the novel IBET program is as effective as PT, which already has an established evidence base for knee OA. Another aim of this study is to examine whether patient characteristics are associated with differential improvement IBET and/or standard PT groups. This information can help guide patients toward the treatment option that may be most beneficial for them.

Participants are stratified by enrollment source (described below) to ensure groups are balanced in this respect. The three measurement time points are at baseline, 4&#x000a0;month follow-up, and 12&#x000a0;month follow-up. A 4&#x000a0;month duration for the initial intervention period was chosen because this is an adequate time period to observe meaningful changes in pain and function in the context of OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The 12&#x000a0;month assessment will evaluate whether there are sustained effects beyond the initial intervention period. The IBET group will continue to have access to the website between the 4&#x000a0;month and 12&#x000a0;month assessment points. Following completion of the 12&#x000a0;month assessments, participants assigned to the WL control group will receive two PT visits plus access to the IBET program. No study data will collected from WL participants after they have received these interventions. Rather, provision of these interventions is for ethical considerations, providing these participants with access to the study OA therapies. Participants in all study groups will continue with their usual medical care for OA during the full study period.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Demonstration of Exercises from Internet-Based Program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_725_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Study participants are being enrolled though active recruitment methods and advertisements for self-referral from two geographic regions and settings, to enhance generalizability. First, patients are being identified from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC) and surrounding area. UNC has a large non-profit healthcare system that provides both primary and specialty care. Over 800,000 people receive outpatient care at UNC clinics annually. Second, individuals with symptomatic knee OA are being identified from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (JoCo OA), an ongoing study in rural North Carolina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. African Americans and individuals 60&#x000a0;years of age and older comprise about 20&#x000a0;% and 17&#x000a0;% of the county&#x02019;s population, respectively. Households with limited education and lower income are common in Johnston County, with 35&#x000a0;% of individuals over age 25 having less than a high school diploma and 30&#x000a0;% of jobs involving manufacturing, service or farming.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Participant eligibility criteria</title><p>Participants must meet the following criteria for at least one knee:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Diagnosis of Knee OA.

First, flyers and brochures and other forms of advertisement are being posted within UNC and the surrounding community, as well as in Johnston County. UNC health care providers may also give brochures to their patients. Second, patients are actively being recruited based on UNC medical records and JoCo OA data. Individuals who meet initial eligibility criteria from these two sources are mailed introductory letters. All potential participants, regardless of recruitment source, are screened for additional eligibility criteria via telephone. Individuals who meet eligibility criteria and are interested in participating are asked to meet a study team member to complete consent, HIPAA authorization, and baseline assessments. Following baseline assessments, participants are given their randomization assignment by the project coordinator via telephone. Randomization is based on a computer generated sequence maintained by the project statistician and programmer. Following randomization, participants assigned to the standard PT group are scheduled for their initial visit, and participants assigned to the IBET group are given instructions and an individual code to access the website, along with ankle weights and resistance bands to facilitate the exercises. Participants randomized to the WL group are informed they will be provided with two PT visits and access to the IBET website after their follow-up assessments are complete.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Study interventions</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Internet-based exercise training program</title><p>The IBET program used in this study was developed by Visual Health Information and a multidisciplinary team, including physical therapists, physicians and patients; details of the program have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Visual Health Information did not provide any financial support for this study. A pilot study of this program showed that after eight weeks of use, participants with knee OA experienced significant and clinically meaningful improvements in pain, stiffness and function. The following describes general features of the IBET program:</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Tailoring of exercises</title><p>When participants first log into the IBET site, they complete a brief set of measures regarding their pain, function, and current activity. This includes the modified Short Form of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (mSF-WOMAC). Based on these data, an algorithm is used to assign participants to one of 7 different exercise levels that range in difficulty. Each exercise level includes stretching and strengthening exercises that were judged appropriate for a given functional level by a multidisciplinary group of clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Exercise routines are randomly generated from the participant&#x02019;s assigned level and always include both stretching and strengthening exercises that target multiple muscle groups, with a focus on the lower extremity and knee function. The initial assigned exercise routine also includes recommendations for amount and intensity of aerobic exercise.</p><p>In addition to tailoring the initial exercise routine, the IBET program collects participant information on an ongoing basis to facilitate appropriate progression. At the end of each session participants are given the option to move to a harder or easier exercise level at the next session.</p><p>When patients opt for exercise progression, they are prompted to complete the mSF-WOMAC. If their score is worse than the previous administration of the scale, they are not yet advanced to the next exercise level but are instead given a new exercise routine at their current level. If their mSF-WOMAC score is equal to or better than the previous administration, they are allowed to progress along the exercise continuum. As patients progress to more difficult levels, their exercise routine may contain more difficult exercises, previously assigned exercises with increased weight, more sets or repetitions, or an increase in the number of exercises. If patients request an easier exercise routine at any point, they are first advised that slight increases in pain or discomfort are common when beginning an exercise program, and they may want to try icing and rest and then resume their current exercise program but consider reducing the frequency initially. However, participants may still choose to receive a new exercise program immediately at an easier level. In addition, if patients have difficulty with any particular exercises (e.g., it is painful or they cannot get into the required position), the system provides an option to exchange that exercise for another within the same level. Participants may also opt to change their entire exercise routine within the same level.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Video display of exercises</title><p>In addition to static photos and instructions for each exercise, the IBET includes videos that demonstrate correct performance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This is important for maximizing benefits and reducing injury risk. Participants can select the gender and race of the animated model that shows correct exercise performance.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Pain monitoring</title><p>After each session, participants are asked to report whether their pain increased following their exercises. If participants report increased pain for three consecutive sessions without requesting a lower exercise level, they are sent an email suggesting they consider trying an easier exercise level. If patients do not record having increased pain for two weeks and have not requested an increase in exercise level in that interval, they are sent an email suggesting they consider trying a more difficult level.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Automated reminders</title><p>If participants do not interact with the IBET website for seven days, they receive an email encouraging them to access the website, and, most importantly, to remain physically active.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Tracking progress</title><p>The IBET website provides participants with graphs of their pain, physical function, and exercise over time, so they can visualize their progress (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Tracking of Self-Reported Physical function from Internet-Based Program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2015_725_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Other features</title><p>The IBET website also includes general tips for exercise with knee OA, as well as other suggestions for self-management strategies.</p><p>Participants in this study are asked to access the IBET site as soon as they are randomized and to continue through the 12-month follow-up assessment. In accordance with current Department of Health and Human Services and other guidelines for physical activity among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], participants are encouraged to complete strengthening and stretching exercises, guided by the IBET website, at least 3 times per week. Also in accordance with physical activity guidelines, participants are informed that it is safe and appropriate to perform aerobic exercises daily, or as often as possible, guided by the recommendations on the IBET website for their current exercise level.

Based on a typical range of outpatient PT visits for knee OA, study participants can receive up to 8 one-hour sessions. At the first visit, physical therapists complete a standardized, electronic evaluation form, along with documentation of any treatment provided during that visit.

The general steps in this secondary analysis will be to add each of the patient characteristic main effects, as well as the corresponding interaction terms, to separate GLMMs, as defined above. The 3-way interactions (treatment*time*patient characteristic) will be tested to determine whether there is evidence of HTE for that characteristic.

Because of the nature of the IBET intervention, all study participants must have regular internet access. This limits generalizability of findings to patients with OA who do not have access. Internet and mobile device use is increasing rapidly, including among older adults. However, other types of home-based interventions should be considered for patients with OA who are not regular internet users. Another potential limitation is that study participants in each group may receive other OA treatments during the study period. This design was chosen for ethical considerations. Receipt of other OA treatments is being rigorously evaluated and will be considered in study analyses.</p><p>This project has several novel and important features. First, to our knowledge it is the first randomized clinical trial of an internet-based exercise program among patients with knee OA, across the spectrum of disease duration and severity. Pilot study results of this study were very promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], but a rigorous clinical trial is needed to further examine its effectiveness. Second, this study compares the IBET program not only to a wait list control group but also to standard PT, a treatment that has an established evidence base for knee OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The IBET program and standard PT differ in many aspects, but they share common goals of improving physical activity and function among patients with knee OA. By comparing the IBET program directly to PT, this study will help patients with OA and health care providers understand whether IBET can provide similar benefits to patients in terms of pain and functional outcomes. If benefits are similar, IBET could be an alternative management strategy to consider when patients with knee OA do not have access to or cannot afford PT. This type of internet-based exercise program could serve as a prototype for other musculoskeletal conditions. In addition, the study will evaluate whether some patient characteristics predict differential benefit from IBET or PT, providing guidance for referring patients to a treatment option that may be most appropriate for them. Third, this study takes a pragmatic approach, including participants who experience the spectrum of OA symptom severity and incorporating minimal exclusion criteria (e.g., those that may make exercise unsafe or confound study outcomes). This is important for generalizing findings to real-world clinical settings. A fourth important aspect of this study is the involvement of a diverse Stakeholder Panel, comprised of patients with knee OA, primary care and specialty physicians who treat patients with knee OA, physical therapists, and representatives of national organizations seeking to improve outcomes for people with OA. This group has made key contributions to the development of the study and its ongoing activities, with a view toward ensuring that study results will be of high relevance to patients with OA and their health care providers.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Appendix</title><sec id="Sec32"><title>Guidance for structure and content of physical therapy visits</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Programs, both in the clinic and at home, should be comprehensive and functional, focusing on core and lower body function, but can be tailored to meet the functional abilities, needs and deficits of each participant.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Each visit should emphasize therapeutic exercise and include muscle strengthening, stretching/flexibility/range of motion, and aerobic exercise.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Education on activity pacing, joint protection and pain management</p></list-item><list-item><p>A home program should be recommended during the 1<sup>st</sup> visit and should be progressed over the course of treatment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Home programs should emphasize the following:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Strengthening Exercises<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>Recommend performing strengthening exercises 2-3 times per week</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p>Include functional exercises, such as gait or stair training and neuromuscular education</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Stretching/flexibility/range of motion Exercises<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>Recommend performing range of motion exercises daily</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Aerobic Exercises<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i.</label><p>Promote &#x0201c;lifestyle&#x0201d; physical activity</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii.</label><p>Encourage moderate intensity exercise</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii.</label><p>Episodes of activity should last at least 10 minutes, if the participant is able</p></list-item><list-item><label>iv.</label><p>Episodes should be spread out throughout the week with a long-term goal of working up to a total of 150 minutes of activity per week</p></list-item><list-item><label>v.</label><p>Aerobic exercise can be weight-bearing, reduced weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Modalities for pain management can be included during the clinic visit and as part of the home program.
