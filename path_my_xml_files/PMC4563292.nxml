inserts affects the pain and gait of sacroiliac joint dysfunction patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Thirty subjects were randomly selected and assigned to be either the experimental
group (gait training with shoe insert group) or control group. Each group consisted of 15
patients. Pain was measured by Visual Analogue Scale, and foot pressure in a standing
position and during gait was measured with a Gateview AFA-50 system (Alpus, Seoul,
Republic of Korea). A paired sample t-test was used to compare the pain and gait of the
sacroiliac joint before and after the intervention. Correlation between pain and walking
after gait training with shoe inserts was examined by Pearson test. The level of
significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05. [Results] It was found that application of the
intervention to the experimental group resulted in a significant decrease in sacroiliac
joint pain. It was also found that there was a significant correlation between Visual
Analogue Scale score and dynamic asymmetric index (r= 0.796) and that there was a negative
correlation between Visual Analogue Scale score and forefoot/rear foot peak pressure ratio
(r=-0.728). [Conclusion] The results of our analysis lead us to conclude that the
intervention with shoe inserts had a significant influence on the pain and gait of
sacroiliac joint patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Sacroiliac joint</kwd><kwd>Shoe inserts</kwd><kwd>Gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The sacroiliac joint, or SI joint (SIJ) is considered one of the crucial sources of low
back pain, and many patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction (SIJD) suffer from an
unbalanced muscle structure<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In manual
medicine, SIJD is a potential cause of low back pain, and the prevalence rate of SIJD is
reportedly 13.8% to 47.9% in the general population<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stability is attained through the self-locking mechanisms of form
closure and force closure: the former is a special structural characteristic, and the latter
refers to compression of muscles and ligaments<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The anterior side of the sacrum is larger than the posterior side. Thus, any movement of
the innominate to the anterior of the sacrum would lead the ilium to rotate to the anterior
of the sacrum and move backward and the SIJ to be fixed like a wedge between the joints,
which would cause anterior dysfunction<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such a decrease in the stability mechanism
could bring about pain or dysfunction in weight shifting through the SIJ<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Any dysfunction of the SIJ might have a serious influence on the function of vertebrae
above the sacrum. Dontigny reported that 80% of patients with low back pain caused by the
SIJD were found to have malalignment of the pelvis owing to unilateral pelvic anterior
tilt<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pelvic anterior tilt could cause
disability in the pattern of pelvic movement and pain or dysbasia as well. The tilt would
increase when standing and during the stance phase of the gait cycle and, as a consequence,
lead to flexion of the hip joint and extension of the knee joint. Equinovarus can be found
at the ankle joint<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The pelvis should be placed in a neutral position for a proper posture and balanced
movement of the upper and lower body in activities of daily living. Therefore, sacroiliac
joint exercise is required to improve ambulatory ability in patients with SIJD, since SIJD
is closely related to leg length discrepancy<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Identification of the mechanical effect of the pelvis and damage to anatomical structures
would help us better understand low back pain (LBP)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Foot mechanical features are considered important, and foot
orthotics are used as a form of treatment to modify the movement of abnormal lower
extremities associated with LBP. Shoes or foot orthotics often cause LBP, but at the same
time, they can be used as clinical intervention tools<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, a shoe&#x02019;s
heel height is a crucial factor in treatment of LBP, and it has been reported that slightly
raising the heels by wearing shoe inserts might provide positive therapeutic effects for
LBP<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous researches have reported that slightly raised heels enhance the muscle activity of
the erector spinae and make it fire faster<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, since raised heels might influence the
central nervous system in order to control increased lumbar flexion, which eventually
increases lumbar lordosis<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise,
shoe inserts might be used as a clinical intervention tool to treat low back pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, not many clinical studies on the effect of using shoe inserts have been presented
yet. In particular, the effect of shoe inserts on the change in pain and gait has not been
investigated much. Thus, the current study attempted to identify how gait training with shoe
inserts affects the pain and gait of sacroiliac joint pain patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty subjects (7 males, 23 females) were randomly selected and assigned to their
respective groups randomly. The 15-patient experimental group (gait training with shoe
insert group) consisted of 3 malese and 12 females. The 15-patient control group consisted
of 4 males and 11 females. The ages of the subjects were 45.40&#x000b1;11.65 (mean&#x000b1;SD) for the
experimental group and 43.00&#x000b1;14.84 for the control group. Their heights were 159.40&#x000b1;6.59&#x02005;cm
and 158.33&#x000b1;5.96&#x02005;cm, whereas their weights were 59.46&#x000b1;6.8&#x02005;kg, 54.33&#x000b1;6.30&#x02005;kg, respectively.
Patients with chronic low back pain along with SIJ pain were selected as subjects. Their leg
length discrepancies, measured from X-ray images, ranged from 3 to 25&#x02005;mm, and those who had
had a surgery within the past year were excluded. Before participating in this research, all
subjects were given an explanation about the content and procedures of the experiment. The
subjects voluntarily participated in this research and signed an informed consent form. This
study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Namseoul University.</p><p>The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess each patient&#x02019;s degree of back pain. The
VAS is a simple, highly sensitive method representing the pain of a patient. Based on a
scale of 0&#x02013;100&#x02005;mm, each patient&#x02019;s VAS was recorded, with 0&#x02005;mm indicating no pain and 100&#x02005;mm
indicating an extreme degree of pain. The test-retest reliability (r = 0.99) and inter-rater
reliability (r = 1.00) for the VAS appear to be very high<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, shoe inserts made of polypropylene material (Alpus, Seoul, Republic of
Korea) were used. The software of a Gateview AFA-50 system (Alpus, Seoul, Republic of Korea)
was employed to measure foot pressure in a standing position and during gait, whereas the
Gaitview Pro 1.0 software was used to measure the forefoot/rear foot peak pressure ratio
(F/R ratio), asymmetric index (AI), and the laterality of gait. For each subject, the
distance from the heel to the tip of the second toe was measured. The Gaitview Pro 1.0
software automatically divided the rear foot and forefoot by bisecting the distance from the
front to the rear of each foot.</p><p>The subjects were asked to stand still after taking a few steps on the foothold of the
Gaitview system in order to measure the foot pressure in the standing position. The foot
pressure during gait was measured as follows: the subjects were asked to take their shoes
off, walk as they normally do, step on Gateway with a leg, take a turn after a few more
steps, and step on Gateway with another leg<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the purpose of obtaining a natural gait, each patient was
allowed 5 practice sessions before measurement.</p><p>The F/R ratio was obtained by dividing the forefoot pressure ratio by the rear foot
pressure ratio by applying Pmax F/R ratio (Fore foot/Rear foot peak pressure ratio), which
has been conventionally used to analyze the distribution of foot pressure in neuropathy
patients with diabetes and Parkinson patients.</p><p>The balance (or imbalance) between the right and left leg was identified by calculating the
right-left AI, that is, the right foot pressure vs. the left foot pressure when standing and
during gait.</p><p>All the measured data were processed by the program of IBM SPSS Statistics version 19.0.
The K-S test was conducted in order to analyze the normal distribution of the measured data.
A paired sample t-test was used to compare the pain and gait of the subjects before and
after the intervention. Correlation between pain and walking after gait training with shoe
inserts was measured by Pearson test. The level of significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>It was found that application of the intervention to the experimental group produced a

sides, an individual might walk with slower speed and shorter strides, whereas pain on one
side would cause slight forward flexion of the body toward the other side without pain in
order to reduce pelvic movement<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The current study attempted to identify how experimental intervention through gait training
would change the patients&#x02019; gait patterns after correction of a functional leg length
discrepancy with shoe inserts in chronic low back pain patients with pain in the SIJ.</p><p>Leg length discrepancy was measured in an upright position. The heights of the right and
left femoral heads on X-ray images was compared to obtain the leg length discrepancy. The
average error for this measurement tool in previous studies was 0.6&#x02005;mm, and the maximum
error was no greater than 2&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The height of the shoe inserts that the experimental group wore was determined depending on
the leg length discrepancy measured from X-ray images; most of them were 3 to 9&#x02005;mm, and some
subjects wore more than one insert if the discrepancy was greater than 10&#x02005;mm<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The types of shoe inserts include insoles
for foot correction in children and adolescents, insoles for diabetic foot care, and insoles
for patients with musculoskeletal pain and for sports injury prevention, as well as insoles
made of a variety of materials. In this study, shoe inserts made of a polypropylene material
were used (Alpus, Seoul, Republic of Korea).</p><p>An advantage of the foot scan is that it is rather simple to perform and can determine
various kinds of measurements: it measures plantar pressure and analyzes gait through
pressure sensors. The current study utilized a Gaitview AFA-50 pressure sensor system to
identify the characteristics of the gait patterns of chronic low back patients with SIJ pain
by measuring and analyzing the laterality of plantar pressure and gait.</p><p>A significant decrease in SIJ pain was recognized after the intervention in the
experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.01). Wolf<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that shoe inserts may also contribute to a more stable pelvis in patients with an
abnormal alignment because they reduce mechanical stress. It is possible that the decrease
in pain found in the current study was also attributable to compensation by shoe inserts for
a functional leg length discrepancy, consequently enabling the patients to walk with reduced
mechanical stress on the SIJ.</p><p>The post-intervention analysis of the correlation between variables found that there was a
significant correlation between the VAS and dynamic AI (r=0.796, p&#x0003c;0.01), which perhaps
indicates that the difference between the left and right foot pressures owing to the SIJ
pain decreased thanks to the intervention and consequently decreased pain.</p><p>A high negative correlation between the VAS and F/R ratio was found in this study (r=
&#x02212;0.728, p &#x0003c;0.01). This is consistent with previous studies that the more a function of
the spine better F/R ratio is high tend to appear and the pressure is concentrated in the
front portion of the foot during walking than patients with compromised function of the
spine<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, gait
training with shoe inserts decreased the SIJ pain significantly, improved the function of
the spine, and concentrated the weight at the front part of the foot during gait, which is
suggested to increase propulsion.</p><p>In conclusion, the present research found scientific evidence indicating that gait training
with shoe inserts would be greatly helpful for the pain and gait of SIJ pain patients. Such
gait training with shoe inserts would contribute to stabilization of the pelvis and spine,
which is crucial for a comfortable and adequate gait. The results of the current study shed
light on the importance of gait with shoe inserts in SIJ pain patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this paper was provided by Namseoul University.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Arab</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Nourbakhsh</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammadifar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The relationship between hamstring length and gluteal
