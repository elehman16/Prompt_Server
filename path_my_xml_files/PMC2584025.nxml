APC is generated by limited proteolysis of its zymogen protein C by thrombin bound to its cofactor thrombomodulin on the surface of intact endothelium. APC effectively down-regulates the coagulation processes by selectively degrading the activated coagulation cofactors factor V (FVa) and factor VIII (FVIIIa). Protein S (PS) is a cofactor to APC in the regulation of FVa and FVIIIa. The importance of protein S as a cofactor in the anticoagulant protein C system is illustrated by the increased risk of venous thrombosis in individuals with a hereditary deficiency of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The molecular mechanisms involved in the enhancement by PS in the APC-reactions are incompletely understood. PS has been suggested to increase the affinity of APC to phospholipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] but also to alter the orientation of the active site of APC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Because of its powerful anticoagulant features and selective action, APC is interesting to evaluate for therapeutic intervention and APC has been shown to have antithrombotic features in different animal thrombosis models. Thus, human APC (hAPC) is highly effective in non-human primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Bovine APC (bAPC) is also highly antithrombotic in arterial thrombosis models in rabbits and rats, but only when co-administered with bovine protein S (bPS), demonstrating the importance of PS as a cofactor to bAPC and the species specificity in the APC-PS interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The results using hAPC in rat models are more divergent. Earlier work showed antithrombotic effects of even low doses of hAPC in different models of thrombosis in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, we have been unable to demonstrate any antithrombotic effects of hAPC in an arterial thrombosis model in rats[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This model is dependent on both primary hemostasis and on activation of blood coagulation, as indicated by the antithrombotic effects of active-site inhibited FVIIa, heparin and the combination of bovine APC and bovine protein S[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>Recently, we have created recombinant human APC (hAPC) variants that have enhanced anticoagulant effects. Selective mutagenesis of the phospholipid-binding Gla domain generated the mutant QGNSEDY-hAPC, which has increased affinity for negatively charged phospholipids membranes and enhanced anticoagulant activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The protease domain has also been subjected to mutagenesis aiming at improving the anticoagulant activity of APC. By replacing the so-called 148 loop in hAPC with the shorter bovine loop (the variant denoted hAPC: B148), the catalytic and anticoagulant activity was found to be enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. By combining the mutations above, a new mutant QGNSEDY-hAPC: B148 was constructed that due to the combination of increased binding of the Gla-domain to phospholipid membranes and with increased catalytic and anticoagulant effect was highly anticoagulant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Clotting experiments in rat plasma showed distinct dose dependent anticoagulant effect, especially with the mutant QGNSEDY-hAPC: B148 while WT hAPC showed almost no anticoagulant effect. The antithrombotic effect of the different variants of hAPC was then tested in a rat model of deep arterial injury. None of the APC variants had significant antithrombotic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, human PS was not combined with the APC in the experiments, which could explain the poor effects. This hypothesis gained support from additional evaluation of the anticoagulant effect of the hAPC variants <italic>in vitro </italic>using rat plasma, which demonstrated hPS to potentiate the anticoagulant activity of the two hAPC variants. This observation formed the basis for the present study, in which we explore the antithrombotic and anticoagulant effects of co-administration of hAPC and hPS using our arterial thrombosis model in the rat.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasma Purified Proteins</title><p>Human APC was obtained from Chromogenix (M&#x000f6;lndal, Sweden).

The Research Ethics Committee at Lund University approved the experiments. The experimental model of deep arterial injury was performed exactly as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In summary, the right femoral vein was cannulated for infusion of randomized substances and blood sampling. After clamping the left common carotid artery, a longitudinal incision exposed the inner vessel layer. A five millimeter endarterectomy was performed by microsurgical technique and deep vessel layers were exposed. The arteriotomy was closed with micro sutures. The clamps were removed and the vessel was reperfused. All blood emerging from the suture line was collected by preweighed cylindrical swabs to calculate the total blood loss from the arteriotomy. Vessel patency was evaluated 31 minutes after reperfusion with the standard microvascular empty-refill test and the vessel was classed as open or occluded. One surgeon (K.M.) performed all operations. The mean total time for the experiments was 92 minutes (range 84&#x02013;103).</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Protocol</title><p>In a blind randomized study, 60 rats were divided into 5 groups that were treated either with recombinant hPS 0.6 mg/kg (n = 10), WT hAPC 0.8 mg/kg + hPS 0.6 mg/kg (n = 10), QGNSEDY-hAPC 0.8 mg/kg + hPS 0.6 mg/kg (n = 10), QGNSEDY-hAPC: B148 0.8 mg/kg + hPS 0.6 mg/kg (n = 10) or vehicle only (n = 20). The randomized substances were stored in 1.5 ml coded Eppendorf plastic tubes (Sarstedt, Numbrecht, Germany) at -78&#x000b0;C and thawed to room temperature immediately before use. The substances were delivered as intravenous weight-adjusted bolus injections after completing the vascular injury, one minute before reperfusion. The infusion volume was 0.21 ml per 100-gram animal weight in all groups. The vehicle was 20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% BSA.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Ex vivo </italic>coagulation analyses</title><p>Blood samples (0.9 ml) were drawn from the femoral vein of the rats 1 minute before injection of the substance, then 2 and 30 minutes after reperfusion. Before each sample was collected, 0.5 ml of blood was drawn into a separate syringe and wasted. After every 0.9-ml sample was collected, 0.5 ml of saline was injected with another syringe to clear the catheter from blood. The samples were collected with a 2-ml plastic syringe (Plastipak; Becton Dickinson AB, H&#x000e4;gersten, Stockholm, Sweden) prefilled with 0.1 ml of 3.8% 0.13 M sodium citrate. The samples were immediately transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf plastic tubes and centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 3 minutes (Mikro 12/24; Hettich Zentrifugen, Tuttlingen, Germany). The plasma was separated with a pipette and put in two Eppendorf tubes with 300 &#x003bc;l of plasma in each. The tubes were put in a box containing pellets of carbon acid ice. After completion of the daily experiments, the plasma samples were transferred to a freezer maintaining a temperature of -78&#x000b0;C. The APTT and PT assays were done as described above with the exception that the Platelin LS was diluted 1:2 in TBS+ 0.1% BSA.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Patency rates were compared using Fisher's exact test and bleeding weights with the Mann-Whitney test.

Similar results were obtained with recombinant WT APC and PS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In contrast, in the presence of hPS, both QGNSEDY-hAPC and QGNSEDY-hAPC:B148 plus hPS approximately doubled the clotting time in the whole dose range tested (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In Vitro </italic>anticoagulant response in rat plasma produced by plasma purified proteins</bold>.

This is in contrast to results obtained in other thrombosis models in the rat, where hAPC has been reported to have antithrombotic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The discrepancy may be due to differences in the type of vascular trauma. Our model includes a crude vascular trauma producing occlusive thrombi, and is quite resistant to antithrombotic intervention. It was developed to mimic conditions encountered in clinical vascular surgery. However, despite being arterial and involving primary hemostasis events, the model is also dependent on activation of blood coagulation and sensitive to anticoagulant substances[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>The interaction between APC and PS is species-specific, which makes cross-species studies more difficult. However, it can also be an advantage and help clarify the importance of the cofactor function of PS. Thus, we have found bAPC to be a highly efficient antithrombotic agent in arterial thrombosis models with patency rates reaching 90&#x02013;100% in both rat and rabbit, but only when bovine PS was given together with the bAPC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This agrees with results of clotting assays, in which bAPC is highly anticoagulant in human, rabbit, and rat plasmas in the presence of bovine PS, but not in its absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Human APC has shown anticoagulant effects in bovine, baboon and rabbit plasmas, suggesting that hAPC is able to interact with PS from different origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, we now find almost no hAPC cofactor effect of hPS in rat plasma.</p><p>As hAPC was inactive in our thrombosis model, we were interested in evaluating the antithrombotic effects of two hAPC variants (QGNSEDY-hAPC and QGNSEDY-hAPC: B148) having enhanced anticoagulant activity. These mutants, despite giving an anticoagulant response in rat plasma, did not give a significant antithrombotic effect when given alone in our arterial thrombosis model, i.e. no co-administration of hPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We have now investigated the possible beneficial effects of co-infusion of the hAPC variants with hPS. The results show that neither form of hAPC produced significant antithrombotic effects and although QGNSEDY-hAPC: B148 increased the vessel patency rate compared to the controls, the difference did not reach significance.</p><p>The discrepant findings in the thrombosis model between human and bovine APC are interesting. In coagulation tests performed both in vitro and ex vivo, bAPC plus bPS yielded stronger anticoagulant response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] than the combination of hAPC variants plus hPS (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which should contribute to the lower anti-thrombotic effects of the hAPC variants. Another factor is the difference in elimination kinetics between the bovine and human APC, the half-life of bAPC in rat plasma being almost twice as long as those of the hAPC variants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). APC is inhibited in plasma mainly by two serpins, &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-antitrypsin (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AT) and protein C inhibitor (PCI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Bovine APC has been shown to be resistant to inhibition by &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-AT <italic>in vitro </italic>and the structural requirements for this has been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The low anticoagulant effect of hAPC in rat plasma may also suggest that rat FVa and FVIIIa are poor substrates for hAPC. In this context it is interesting that more than ten-fold higher concentration of hAPC was needed to inactivate rat FVa as compared to human FVa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, in an arterial thrombosis model in the rat we find no significant antithrombotic effects of neither WT-hAPC nor hAPC variants with enhanced anticoagulant activity even when the human APC cofactor PS was co-injected. Our results underline the difficulties in using reagents across the species borders and calls for the creation of corresponding APC variants with the same species background as the animals that are used in the thrombosis model.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>WT: wild type; APC: activated protein C; PS: protein S; APTT: activated partial thromboplastin time; PT: prothrombin time; TBS: tris-buffered saline; BSA: bovine serum albumin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>KM and BA report no competing interest.
