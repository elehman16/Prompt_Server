Low back pain can originate from the lumbar facet joints, the sacroiliac joint, the intervertebral discs (discogenic low back pain), and the coccyx. Chronic low back pain is typically defined as pain in the low back that persists for &#x02265;3 months. Of the population with acute low back pain, approximately 2&#x02013;34% will eventually experience chronic low back pain.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Conservative treatment options for chronic low back pain may include pharmacotherapy, massage, physiotherapy, spinal cord stimulation, and educational or psychological therapies (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, support groups, educational sessions).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] If conservative treatments are ineffective, more invasive methods, such as steroid injections, nerve blocks, cryoablation, radiofrequency ablation (RFA), or surgery can be attempted.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>RFA may be continuous RF (CRF) or pulsed RF (PRF). CRF uses high-frequency alternating current to induce coagulative necrosis in the target tissue. Tissue destruction occurs with probe temperatures between 60&#x000b0;C and 80&#x000b0;C. Because tissue heating decreases rapidly with distance from the electrode tip, CRF lesions are well-circumscribed, thus offering an advantage over chemical neurolysis. With CRF, the magnitude of tissue destruction is related to the temperature of the tissue, as well as the size of the electrode and duration of the procedure. In contrast, PRF uses RF current in short (20 ms), high-voltage bursts; the &#x0201c;silent&#x0201d; phase (480 ms) of PRF allows time for heat elimination, generally keeping the target tissue below 42&#x000b0;C. The mechanism by which PRF controls pain is unclear, but it may involve a temperature-independent pathway mediated by a rapidly changing electrical field.</p><p>Review of previous literature showed that different modes of RF were compared but none of the studies compared along with steroid. We hypothesized that combining intradiscal steroid along with RF may improve pain relief.</p><p>Hence, we plan this study to compare different mode of RF (CRF vs. PRF) along with intradiscal steroid in the management of low back pain of discogenic in origin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After Institutional Ethical approval and written informed consent, forty patients aged 18&#x02013;60 years, of either sex, of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I or II, presenting with low back pain secondary to discogenic in origin as evidenced by clinical and radiological examination (X-ray spine and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), were included in this prospective, randomized controlled, double-blind study from May 2011 to April 2013. Patient included in this study were having acute radicular pain (visual analog scale [VAS] &#x0003e;4) resistant to conservative management for at least 3 months, with MRI contained disc herniation correlating with patient symptoms. Patient with history of local site infection, tumor, fracture, spondylolisthesis more than 2 levels, severe motor deficit, sphincter disturbances, spinal stenosis on MRI, history of open disc surgery at suspected level and history of any uncontrolled medical disease were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were randomly (computer generated randomization and concealment via sealed opaque envelope technique) assigned to two equal groups: Group 1 to receive CRF plus intradiscal triamcinolone 40 mg and Group 2 to receive PRF plus intradiscal triamcinolone 40 mg.</p><p>The patient was admitted on morning day of procedure with 4 h fasting. On arrival to the operating theater, standard monitors were placed and baseline parameters recorded. The procedure was performed under strict asepsis, mild sedation with midazolam 1&#x02013;2 mg or fentanyl 25&#x02013;50 mcg as and when required with local anesthesia. All procedures were done by two specialist pain physicians with a backup anesthesiologist for any type of emergency.</p><p>Group 1 in prone position, 20-gauge, 15 cm RF cannula (BMC, Montreal, QC, Canada) with 10 mm active tip for CRF ablation is placed inside disc under image in posterior-lateral-oblique view. The needle placement in the center of disc was confirmed using anteroposterior and lateral fluoroscopic views. Confirmation of correct position of RF needle was accomplished by stimulation at 2 and 50 Hz for motor and sensory respectively, which is not expected to give a response at &#x0003c;2 V. Thereafter, discography was performed with 0.5 ml nonionic contrast to evaluate annular integrity and to know about provocative discogenic test. A positive provocative discogenic test is diagnostic of definitive disc pathology. Patients having an annular tear with contrast spreading into epidural space were terminated from the study. After discography, 2 ml of 2% lignocaine was injected, and RF probe was introduced and CRF ablation was done at 80 degree for 3.5 min. After the RFA 40 mg triamcinolone was given into the disc [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Radiofrequency generator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-602-g001"/></fig><p>In Group 2 procedure was done like Group 1 except after discography and injection of 2 ml of 2% lignocaine, RF generator was operated in PRF mode for 15 min followed by 40 mg triamcinolone was given into the disc.</p><p>Outcome measured includes immediate as well as long-term pain relief using VAS 0&#x02013;10 cm 0 = no pain and 10 worst imaginable pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) before and after treatment and improvements in neurological status - straight leg raising test (SLR), spinal tenderness, improvements in sensory symptoms, and motor power.

However, Er&#x000e7;elen <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that the increasing in the duration of RF from 180 to 360 s does not affect pain relief which contradicts observations made in the present study. However, in this study, there is significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) pain relief using CRF for 210 s at 1 month as well as 6 months interval.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It appears that optimal increase in duration of RF lesion in the present study from 180 to 210 s results in better relief of pain. In addition to increase in duration of RF, the use of steroid may be responsible for better relief, however, further exploration into this matter is required.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Earlier study by Gautam <italic>et al</italic>. prospective randomized controlled study with 91 patients suffering from low back pain using PRF with ozone reported significant pain relief for 1 year.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The better results seen in this study could be attributed to the combination of ozone with PRF, which may be a synergistic effect.</p><p>In PRF group, there was no significant in fall in VAS score from baseline at any time from day 1 to 6 months. The patients receiving PRF reported unsatisfactory pain relief in 70% cases at day 1 and 80% cases at 2 weeks interval similar to observations made by Curatolo and Reiszworkers.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>There was significant fall in ODI from baseline value in Group 1 from day 1 to 6 months while in Group 2 improvements in ODI occurs up to 4 weeks after that no improvement occurs.</p><p>The comparison of ODI of two groups at various time intervals was significant (&#x0003c;0.05) from day 1 onward till 6 months. Bogduk and Mikeladze <italic>et al</italic>. observations was similar to our finding, which found CRF to be better than PRF based on decrease in ODI.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The change in SLR different study groups at different time intervals revealed patients in Group 1 had significant (&#x0003c;0.05) improvement from day 1 onward and an insignificant (&#x0003e;0.05) change in SLR observed in Group 2. From these observations, it is clearly evident that the pain relief and improvement in SLR was definitely better in Group 1 in comparison to Group 2. Teixeira and Sluijter support our observation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Preoperative spinal tenderness was found in four cases in Group 1 (20%) and two cases in Group 2 (5%). However, no cases were having postoperative spinal tenderness.
