We analysed pooled data from two replicate, double-blind studies of olodaterol (5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g QD via Respimat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) compared to formoterol (12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g twice daily [BID]) or placebo over 48 weeks (1222.13, NCT00793624; 1222.14, NCT00796653). Patients could continue their background treatment. The analysis considered adverse events (AEs) typically associated with &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists, including cardiovascular events, as well as administration-related events. Descriptive statistics were provided for the incidence of AEs and aggregated AEs. The analysis included 1379 patients: 460 placebo, 459 olodaterol and 460 formoterol; AEs were reported by 70.9, 71.7 and 69.1% of patients, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of cardiac AEs (arrhythmia and myocardial ischaemia) and cough were numerically lower in the olodaterol group than the formoterol group, while nasopharyngitis, throat irritation, metabolism and psychiatric disorders were numerically higher in the olodaterol group. The most frequent event in the olodaterol group was nasopharyngitis (placebo 8.0%; olodaterol 12.9%; formoterol 10.0%). Except for cough (incidence rate ratio of 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.24, 0.89] in favour of olodaterol), there were no significant differences between active groups. In conclusion, olodaterol 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g QD was well tolerated over 48 weeks with a typical &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist safety profile comparable to formoterol 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g BID.</p></abstract><abstract id="Abs2" abstract-type="LongSummary"><title>Chronic lung disease: Drug safety confirmed</title><p id="Par2">The long-term safety of a recently-certified inhaled drug for the treatment of chronic lung disease is verified by scientists in Germany. The management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease involves inhaled drugs called long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonists (LABAs). The most recently-certified LABA is called olodaterol. Andrea Koch at the Klinikum der Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&#x000e4;t in Munich, Germany, and co-workers have clarified the long-term safety of olodaterol during two trials that compared it with formoterol, an existing LABA. The trials lasted 48 weeks and involved 1379 patients&#x02014;460 were given a placebo, 459 received 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g olodaterol via a Respimat device, and 460 received formoterol. Side effects from olodaterol were no more severe or persistent than those associated with formoterol. Reassuringly, the new drug also displayed similar or slightly lower incidence of cardiovascular side effects such as heart palpitations compared with formoterol.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Bronchodilators, including long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs), are central to the symptom management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup> The twice-daily (BID) inhaled LABAs formoterol and salmeterol have been available for the treatment of COPD since the late 1990s and effectively improve lung function, symptoms of breathlessness and quality of life.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup> Of the two agents, formoterol (12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g BID) also has the benefit of a faster onset of action.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Owing to the extensive experience with these established agents, they have well-defined safety and tolerability profiles that have been used as reference for &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist class effects when evaluating other LABAs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>

This analysis goes beyond a standard safety review by considering specific adverse events (AEs) associated with the class, as well as those included in the label for formoterol and olodaterol, to provide clinicians with a clear understanding of its safety profile and place olodaterol into context with other LABAs.

The data originate from randomised controlled studies in which study medication was added on to existing background treatment across all groups, allowing the effect of the maintenance treatment LABA to be tested on top of a realistic COPD background therapy. The fact that there was no substantial difference with olodaterol and placebo in the incidence of AEs supports the acceptable general safety profile of this medication. The lack of any substantial difference between active treatments and placebo may have been influenced, however, by rescue medication usage; throughout the course of the study, the use of rescue medication (salbutamol) was higher in the placebo group than the active treatment arms, increasing patient exposure to the inherent &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist risks.</p><p id="Par17">The direct comparison of exposure-adjusted AE incidences between the olodaterol and formoterol groups indicated that both drugs have a similar safety profile overall.

Therefore, it is difficult to establish a causal drug relationship to specific AEs when the population is at high risk of such events merely from their pre-existing diseases. Consequently, this analysis included all reported AEs irrespective of the study investigators&#x02019; assessment of causality. For information, the incidence of drug-related AEs as detailed by the study investigators was low and not substantially different for olodaterol, placebo and formoterol (6.1, 9.1 and 11.1%, respectively).</p><p id="Par19">Patient selection and treatment exposure in these studies were close to real-world data. Given the fact that large, long-term, blinded, randomised controlled trials are extremely difficult and expensive to conduct in COPD, a 1-year observation may not be long enough to detect very rare AEs. This is, however, usually the domain of post-marketing pharmacovigilance and not in scope of an everyday safety profile comparison. Overall, the nature and frequency of events reported in our studies were consistent with the disease under study and thus confirmed that olodaterol 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g QD has an acceptable safety and tolerability profile in patients with moderate to severe COPD, similar to that of the well-established LABA formoterol 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g BID.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p id="Par20">These safety profiling data add support to the previously published data with olodaterol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup> However, as olodaterol is relatively new to the market (as with other once-daily LABAs), continued assessment will be required to ensure that its safety profile remains clearly defined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par21">Olodaterol 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g QD via Respimat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was well tolerated over 48 weeks, with a typical &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist safety profile comparable to formoterol 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g BID dry powder inhalation. The tolerability is also supported by the lowest discontinuation rate for olodaterol among all treatments. Based on blinded, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled and formoterol-controlled, long-term clinical data, the incidence of AEs was similar with olodaterol 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;g QD for serious AEs and cardiovascular AEs compared with formoterol 12&#x02009;&#x000b5;g BID. Mortality was low and similar across all treatment groups (approximately 2.2%, which is a usual mortality rate over 1 year in a COPD population). These data give reassuring information about the safety of olodaterol as a LABA option in moderate to severe COPD maintenance treatment.

AE incidences are described with their crude incidence (percentage of patients with the event out of all patients in the treatment group) and exposure-adjusted incidence rate (number of events per 100 patient-years at risk with the drug) in order to adjust for different exposure between the treatment arms in case of differential study discontinuation.

AEs of interest are displayed with their RR and 95% CI in a forest plot. Time to early discontinuation of patients from the study was compared with a Cox regression analysis of treatment effect using baseline long-acting muscarinic antagonist concomitant medication (tiotropium) use as a stratification factor. This is a post hoc analysis and no formal statistical testing of hypotheses was performed.
