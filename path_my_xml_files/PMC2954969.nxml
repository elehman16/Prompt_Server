Shoulder pain is a distressing complication of hemiplegia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and is reported as one of the 4 most common medical complications of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The prevalence of shoulder pain following stroke has reported to be as high at 70% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A more recent prospective study of 327 consecutive stroke patients concluded that almost a third of this population developed moderate-severe shoulder pain after stroke onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This more moderate figure reflects the 2006 paper by the same investigators, which focused on patient's perspectives on pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Each of these studies highlight a correlation between pain and reduced functional ability, as well as a higher incidence of depression. Hemiplegic shoulder pain is associated with reduction in functional use of the arm, interference with rehabilitation and increased length of hospitalisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A further complication of hemiplegic shoulder pain is identified as a limitation to patient access to developing technological upper-extremity rehabilitation techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Investigation into the cause of hemiplegic shoulder pain has revealed a multifactorial aetiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Note is made of the dependence on musculotendinous integrity to provide stability of the shoulder complex. The most common non-central, musculoskeletal aetiologies of hemiplegic shoulder pain include adhesive capsulitis, subluxation and rotator cuff patholgies, with up to one-third of patients have multiple contributing factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Biomechanical changes result from a combination of paralysis, fluctuation in muscle tone and prolonged shoulder immobility which lead to postural malalignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Dromerick et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] investigated the characteristics of hemiplegic shoulder pain, demonstrating that approximately 50% of the sample population experienced pain in the vertical stabilisers of the shoulder (biceps and supraspinatus). A 2006 evidence-based medicine review concluded that subluxation may be a cause of shoulder pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], though literature is inconsistent regarding this association. It should be noted that not all shoulder pain is associated with the complications of limb flaccidity, and may be attributable to spasticity or central-pain concepts.</p><p>There is lack of evidence to support the development of clear clinical guidelines, as identified in an overview of the challenges of managing shoulder pain after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This paper concludes that further efforts are required to examine intervention options. There have been positive research results for the use of Functional Electrical Stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], though a Cochrane Systematic Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] of this topic did not support electrical stimulation as an effective pain treatment. There is a lack of Level 1 evidence for surgical interventions, motor blocks and intra-articular corticosteroid injection.</p><p>Suprascapular nerve block is a safe and efficacious treatment of shoulder pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis and degenerative shoulder conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The objective of this study is to evaluate the use of Suprascapular nerve block as part of an interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of shoulder pain following stroke. There is anecdotal report of successful use of suprascapular nerve block in treating intractable hemiplegic shoulder pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], though to date no clinical trials have been completed to form an evidence base.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The study design is a double blind randomised placebo controlled trial will assess the effect of a suprascapular nerve block compared with placebo in a population of 66 stroke patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The trial will measure effect of injection on the primary outcome of pain, and secondary outcomes of function and quality of life. Measurements will take place at baseline, and 1, 4 and 12 weeks post intervention. Both groups will continue to receive routine physiotherapy and standard ward care.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study Design - Randomised Controlled Trial</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2377-10-83-1"/></fig><sec><title>Randomized controlled trial</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants will be willing patients aged over 18 years with a diagnosis of acute stroke within the previous 12 months and onset of hemiplegic shoulder pain post stroke with a visual analogue scale score of &#x0003e; 30 mm (100 mm scale).

Allocation will be managed by a pharmacist external to the project.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants will be assessed for eligibility, provided with information about the study, provide informed consent, be enrolled into the study and complete the baseline assessment prior to allocation into the control or intervention group. Participants will be assigned to the control or intervention group by a pharmacist external to the project by simple randomisation generated by a computer software program.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Intervention Group</title><p>The intervention group will receive an a suprascapular nerve block injection to the back of the affected shoulder (using depo-medrol 40 mg and 0.5% bupivivocaine hydrochloride). The technique proposed for suprascapular nerve block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] involves approaching the patient from posterior aspect of shoulder, which will ensure patient unable to visualise syringe contents. The doctor administering the injections will not be blinded for safety reasons. This approach has been used in a prior trial examining suprascapular nerve blocks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] Intervention participants will continue to receive routine ward care of positioning of limb, careful manual handling and physiotherapy/occupational therapy suitable for the individual. The treating team will remain blinded to the randomisation.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>The control group will receive an injection to the back of the shoulder of 5 ml normal saline infiltrated subcutaneously after the 2 ml subcutaneous 1% lidocaine infiltration. Control participants will continue to receive routine ward care of positioning of limb, careful manual handling and physiotherapy/occupational therapy suitable for the individual. This project does not involve the withholding of standard treatment to any participant. The treating team will remain blinded to the randomisation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Outcomes will be assessed at 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks by a physiotherapist blind to allocation. Proposed primary outcome measure involves use of a 100-point modified visual analogue scale (VAS) to assess pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This measure involves a 100 mm vertical line with periodic demarcations, anchored with the written extremes of subjective pain. Patients are asked to mark the severity of their current self-perceived pain on the scale, and this is then recorded in millimetre readings. Research suggests that a minimum change of 20 mm on the VAS is required to demonstrate clinically significant lessening of pain (initial reports &#x0003e;60 mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Whilst a lesser minimum change is accepted for lower initial pain scores, we have chosen the stronger difference in the context of best evidence in a population who is predicted to report higher pain scores.</p><p>Secondary outcomes of disability and quality of life will be measured using the Modified Rankin Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Croft Disability Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the EuroQol Health Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The Croft Disability Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] includes 22 questions regarding disability associated specifically with shoulder pain. This measure is validated and chosen for this study as it more applicable in a more dependant sample population. Minimal level of detectable change (90% confidence) will be 3 points. Secondary outcome of spasticity will be measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS). MAS scores spasticity from 0-5.</p><p>Validity data will be collected for the AbilityQ and ShoulderQ measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These tools were developed by Lynn Turner-Stokes in 2006 to provide a sensitive measure of shoulder pain which is responsible to change in pain experience in a stroke population.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on the data in the table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the standard deviation of the change scores are assumed to be in the range of 18-25. The attached table includes the estimated required sample size for a range of standard deviations and the three different clinically interesting changes above.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Sample Size</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center">Standard Deviation (change)</th><th align="center">Treatment Change</th><th align="center">N per group</th><th align="center">N total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">18</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">28</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">16</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center">14</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center">34</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center">18</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">8</td><td align="center">16</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">22</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">40</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center">22</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="center">25</td><td align="center">20</td><td align="center">26</td><td align="center">52</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">28</td><td align="center">14</td><td align="center">28</td></tr><tr><td/><td align="center">30</td><td align="center">12</td><td align="center">24</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Hence using a conservative estimate, it is expected that a sample size of 26 participants per group (treatment and placebo) will achieve a statistically and clinically significant difference between the two groups (power 80%, alpha 0.05). To allow for deaths and withdrawals with a total attrition rate of 20%, a minimum total of 66 participants will be recruited, 33 per group. It is anticipated that recruitment of 66 participants (33 treatment, 33 placebo) size will take approximately 12 months and that each patient will be followed for 12 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data will be exported into SPSS software for subsequent analyses. A statistical analysis plan will be drafted at the start of the project and all analyses will be carried out after masking allocation.</p><p>The research questions will be assessed using an intention to treat approach. Independent samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests and Chi-square test of association will be used as appropriate to compare groups at baseline. To determine differences between the groups at the primary end-point, ANCOVA or logistic regression will be used with models adjusted according to potential confounders.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The protocol has been carefully designed with the aim of achieving measurable, replicable and important results. The methodological strength of the study focuses around the use of placebo control, though the contributors acknowledge that this may pose a recruitment challenge. Considering that eligible patients have a pain score of &#x0003e; 3, it is anticipated that patients may decline participation on the grounds of not wanting to risk 50/50 chance of randomisation to placebo group. Taking this into account, greater time allowance has been given for recruiting. Careful provision of information prior to consent is vital in ensuring patient's are fully aware of implication of the randomisation. All patients will be informed of their randomisation group at the end of their trial participation and offered active suprascapular nerve block if desired.</p><p>Another uncertainty is in establishing methodology to catch probable timing of hemiplegic shoulder pain. Lindgren's 2007 population-based study on hemiplegic shoulder pain found that the majority of the incidence of pain occurred within the first 4 months post stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our inclusion criteria allow for patients to be up to twelve months post stroke, allowing for later incidences of pain occurrence. Difficulty may arise, however, in that ethics approval required injection in inpatient facility only. It is anticipated that many otherwise eligible participants may be unidentified by inpatient recruitment strategies.</p><p>Despite the realistic uncertainties outlined above, this study will provide useful information pertaining to an important topic. Shoulder pain is a common and debilitating symptom for a large number of people following a stroke and currently there is poor evidence regarding effective treatments. If the study shows that the suprascapular nerve block is efficacious in management of hemiplegic shoulder pain, it could potentially provide a new treatment option for stroke patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ZA, MS and MC conceived the study, drafted the original protocol, and applied for funding.
