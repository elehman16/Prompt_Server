Patients met the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for RA with a disease duration &#x02265;3&#x02005;months and &#x02264;10&#x02005;years, had active RA (Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28) C reactive protein score &#x02265;3.2), and had experienced an IR to MTX (MTX-IR) at a dose of 12.5&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week for &#x02265;12&#x02005;weeks, with the last 4&#x02005;weeks before baseline maintained at a stable dose. Minimal MTX doses of 7.5 mg/week or 10&#x02005;mg/week were permitted only in cases of documented intolerance to higher doses. Patients were biological naive and were either positive for anticyclic citrullinated protein (&#x02265;20&#x02005;U) or for rheumatoid factor (&#x02265;20&#x02005;IU/mL). Patients were also required to have erosion and/or clinical signs and symptoms of synovitis in a single (MRI) joint (metacarpophalangeal and/or wrist). In patients with a disease duration of &#x0003e;1&#x02005;year, clinical evidence of synovitis and &#x02265;1 definitive radiographic erosion at screening based on central review were required. In those with disease duration of &#x02264;1&#x02005;year, clinical synovitis needed to be confirmed by MRI at baseline. Key exclusion criteria included a history of rheumatic autoimmune disease other than RA or significant systemic involvement secondary to RA. Secondary Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome and secondary limited cutaneous vasculitis with RA were permitted.</p><p>Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1: ratio to receive two infusions of placebo, rituximab 500&#x02005;mg, or rituximab 1000&#x02005;mg intravenously on days 1 and 15. Premedication with analgesics, antihistamines and intravenous methylprednisolone 100&#x02005;mg were required before each rituximab infusion. Patients continued to receive stable doses of MTX and folic acid/folate (&#x02265;5&#x02005;mg/week). Concomitant oral glucocorticoids (at a stable dose &#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day) were allowed; intra-articular glucocorticoid injections could be used in a limited fashion to treat severe RA flares. Rescue therapy, or increased dose of MTX or use of non-biological DMARDs, was permitted at week 16 for patients with &#x0003c;20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts compared with baseline. Rituximab retreatment was permitted after week 24 if patients had a DAS28 C reactive protein score &#x02265;2.6 and no contraindications to treatment (such as active infections).</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (NCT00578305). The protocol and any accompanying material provided to the patient were approved by an Independent Ethics Committee or Institutional Review Board before starting the study.

The most clinically inflamed hand and wrist (or the dominant hand, in case of equal inflammation) were imaged with a 1.5-Tesla whole-body MRI scanner using a commercial surface coil and an acrylic frame<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> designed to ensure proper and reproducible positioning of the hand and wrist. The hand and wrist were scanned separately using coronal short-tau inversion recovery and coronal fat-suppressed three-dimensional gradient echo with and without intravenous gadolinium-based contrast agent.

Post hoc analyses evaluated for total inflammation scores at weeks 12, 24 and 52 and change in CARLOS and total damage scores at weeks 24 and 52.</p><p>The van Elteren test stratified for the factors used at randomisation (duration of MTX use &#x0003c; or &#x02265;6&#x02005;months and presence of bone erosions) was used for the primary analysis and to assess changes from baseline in RAMRIS erosion scores, Genant-modified Sharp radiographic erosion scores and CARLOS (imputation by linear extrapolation), and to assess changes from baseline in RAMRIS synovitis and osteitis scores (last observation carried forward). The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test was used to assess the proportions of patients with no newly eroded joints (no imputation used), of patients with no progression of erosions, of patients with improvements in synovitis and osteitis, and of patients achieving a EULAR and ACR 20/50/70 response (non-responder imputation). Analysis of covariance was used to assess changes from baseline in DAS28-ESR and HAQ-DI (last observation carried forward).

<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>This study had several strengths. It is the first published report of MRI's ability to discriminate suppression of cartilage loss in a multicentre randomised controlled trial in RA. This is important because exclusion of the assessment of cartilage loss in prior clinical trials has been an obstacle to accepting MRI as a substitute for radiography in clinical trials. Previous studies have demonstrated that articular cartilage loss is at least as important as bone erosion in determining long-term disability in patients with RA,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and suppression of bone erosion does not always indicate that cartilage loss has also been suppressed.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Inclusion of the assessment of cartilage loss in this study further allowed determination of total joint damage by MRI, analogous to the Total Sharp Score that is used in RA clinical trials to assess radiographic joint damage. A limitation of this study was that suppression of cartilage loss and radiographic outcomes were not measured at week 12, limiting the ability to compare cartilage loss against bone erosion or discriminate progression between the two imaging techniques. Additionally, although treatment effects in the rituximab 500-mg and 1000-mg groups largely overlapped, in a few of the end points (particularly cartilage loss and joint-space narrowing), one or the other dosing arm did not reach statistical significance compared with placebo. Because this study was not powered to compare the two active treatment arms, additional analyses were not performed to explore this apparent discrepancy. Of note, in the IMAGE study, only the approved 2&#x000d7;1000-mg rituximab dosing group exhibited significant inhibition of radiographic progression compared with the placebo group, whereas those in the rituximab 500-mg group did not&#x02014;a treatment effect that was robust to several analyses.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Lastly, it is important to highlight that patients in this study were biological naive and DMARD-IR; therefore, the results cannot be extrapolated to patients with more progressive or refractory disease, such as TNF-IR patients.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrated that rituximab significantly reduced erosion and cartilage loss at weeks 24 and 52 in MTX-IR patients with active RA. These changes were preceded by reductions in synovitis and osteitis, and explain radiographic evidence that rituximab+MTX prevents joint damage in patients with active RA. Our results suggest that MRI is a valuable tool for assessing inflammatory and structural damage in patients with established RA receiving rituximab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-206015-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1228" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the investigators and patients involved in RA-SCORE.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CP conceived and designed the research, was involved in generating data at his clinical research site, assured data collection from the NHIH and analysed and interpreted the data.
