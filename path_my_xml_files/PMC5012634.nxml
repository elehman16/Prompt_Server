This pooled analysis of two Phase III studies assessed the impact of aclidinium/formoterol on patients with COPD categorized by symptom status.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Data were pooled from two 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of twice-daily aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g in moderate-to-severe COPD (ACLIFORM [NCT01462942] and AUGMENT [NCT01437397]). These post hoc analyses evaluated the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol versus placebo or monotherapies in patients defined as less/more symptomatic by a) Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS&#x02122;) score &#x02265;10/&#x0003c;10 and b) Baseline Dyspnea Index score &#x0003c;7/&#x02265;7. Endpoints included trough and 1-hour morning postdose forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), Transition Dyspnea Index, E-RS total score, early-morning and nighttime symptom severity, early-morning limitation of activities, and exacerbation rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Data for 3,394 patients were analyzed (mean age: 63.5 years; 60.5% male).

Patients with minimal symptoms may initially receive treatment with short-acting agents or long-acting monotherapy, while patients with greater symptom burden may receive dual therapy with two long-acting bronchodilators in combination &#x02013; a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and a long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA).<xref rid="b2-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, this stratagem has not been examined by assessing the effectiveness of dual bronchodilation in patients stratified according to reported symptom burden.</p><p>ACLIFORM and AUGMENT were two large 24-week, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III trials evaluating the efficacy of dual therapy with aclidinium bromide 400 &#x000b5;g (a LAMA) and formoterol fumarate 12 &#x000b5;g (a LABA) twice daily versus placebo or monotherapies in moderate-to-severe COPD. As these studies did not restrict the inclusion of patients based on symptoms, the populations had a broad spectrum of symptom burden.<xref rid="b3-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Accordingly, the identification of patients with more symptomatic disease in these trials allows for a more comparable population when considering other trials of LABA/LAMAs in which patients were required to be symptomatic.<xref rid="b5-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Several validated tools are available to assess COPD symptoms. For daily clinical practice, GOLD recommends the use of the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) tool, the clinical COPD questionnaire, and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) tools as they are quick and easy to administer. However, in a clinical study environment, more detailed and complex instruments can be used for a more comprehensive assessment. Symptom burden in clinical trials is commonly assessed using the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire and/or the CAT to measure health status. However, as COPD is a multifactorial and highly symptomatic disease, categorization according to broad health status may not adequately identify patients who have a high or low symptom burden, and evidence of treatment efficacy according to stratified symptom levels in clinical trials is lacking.<xref rid="b2-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, in ACLIFORM and AUGMENT, symptoms were assessed using the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms (E-RS) in COPD diary (E-RS&#x02122;: COPD; formerly EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool [EXACT&#x02122;] &#x02212; Respiratory Symptoms) (The EXACT and E-RS are owned by Evidera. Permission to use these instruments may be obtained from Evidera [<email>exactpro@evidera.com</email>]). The E-RS is a derivative of EXACT and was developed to assess the efficacy of treatment on symptoms in clinical trials.<xref rid="b8-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The E-RS, which uses the eleven respiratory symptom items from the 14-item EXACT daily diary, provides a more comprehensive assessment of the burden of respiratory symptoms in COPD than standard patient-reported outcomes and has shown consistency with the classification of less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients by GOLD groups.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>The BDI is a fully validated, interviewer-administered measure of breathlessness, assessing functional impairment, the effect on activity, and the degree of effort required to perform daily tasks.<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The interviewer asks open-ended questions concerning the patient&#x02019;s breathlessness and then selects a grade reflecting the degree of impairment related to dyspnea in each category. Similar to mMRC, BDI reports on dyspnea; however, BDI is a more comprehensive measurement of breathlessness, and together with the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), it is more suited to the clinical trial environment as it is specifically designed to measure change in breathlessness over time.<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The aim of this pooled post hoc analysis of ACLIFORM and AUGMENT was to evaluate the efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g in patients with COPD who were identified as being less symptomatic or more symptomatic using two different measures of symptoms, baseline E-RS total score and BDI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The study designs of ACLIFORM (NCT01462942) and AUGMENT (NCT01437397), two 24-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, active- and placebo-controlled multicenter Phase III studies of twice-daily aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g in moderate-to-severe COPD, have been reported previously.<xref rid="b3-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Following screening and a 2- to 3-week run-in period, patients were randomized to twice-daily aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g, aclidinium/formoterol 400/6 &#x000b5;g, aclidinium 400 &#x000b5;g, formoterol 12 &#x000b5;g, or placebo (ACLIFORM 2:2:2:2:1; AUGMENT 1:1:1:1:1).

For the E-RS definition, more symptomatic patients were defined as those patients with an E-RS baseline score &#x02265;10 units. This threshold was selected based on evidence suggesting that an E-RS score &#x02265;10 units could distinguish between less symptomatic (GOLD groups A and C) and more symptomatic (GOLD groups B and D) patients.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> For the BDI definition, a score of &#x0003c;7 was used to identify more symptomatic patients, while a score of &#x02265;7 was used to identify less symptomatic patients. The rationale for this threshold is based on a previously reported study, which showed that a BDI score &#x02265;7 and &#x0003c;7 corresponds with the mMRC thresholds used by GOLD to identify less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients, respectively.<xref rid="b13-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> All patients with baseline E-RS and BDI data were included in this post hoc analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Assessments and endpoints</title><p>The efficacy of aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g versus monotherapies and placebo was assessed for both definitions of less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients. Lung function was assessed by standardized spirometric techniques at each study visit. Coprimary lung function endpoints were changed from baseline in 1-hour morning postdose FEV<sub>1</sub> and changed from baseline in morning predose (trough) FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 24. Dyspnea was assessed using the TDI to evaluate improvements in focal score at week 24.<xref rid="b11-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Daily COPD symptoms were evaluated using the E-RS questionnaire (eleven respiratory items from the 14-item EXACT questionnaire assessing breathlessness, cough and sputum, and chest symptoms) via electronic diaries, and change from baseline in E-RS total score was assessed at 24 weeks. The severities of early-morning and nighttime symptoms as well as limitation of morning activities were assessed using a COPD symptoms questionnaire, which was completed by patients each morning via electronic diaries (early-morning and nighttime symptoms: 5-point scale: 1= &#x0201c;did not experience symptoms&#x0201d;, 5= &#x0201c;very severe&#x0201d;; limitation of morning activities: 5-point scale: 1= &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d;, 5= &#x0201c;a very good deal&#x0201d;). The rate of moderate-to-severe COPD exacerbations (defined as a worsening of symptoms for at least two consecutive days requiring treatment with antibiotics, systemic corticosteroids, or hospitalization) per patient per year was also assessed.

Exacerbations were analyzed using the pooled ITT-exacerbation population, defined as all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication and had a baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> assessment.

These are validated instruments that have the benefit of being very quick to administer and simple to interpret. However, stratifying patients by E-RS total score and BDI score in a clinical trial environment allows for a more rigorous assessment of COPD symptoms than is achieved with common clinical tools, such as the mMRC or CAT. E-RS and BDI are sophisticated, sensitive, validated tools to investigate and quantify the symptoms of COPD in a clinical trial setting. They are not intended to replace those measures proposed by GOLD in clinical practice. BDI and E-RS correspond well with mMRC and CAT in terms of the assessments made, yet the mMRC and CAT are more practical tools for use in everyday clinical practice.</p><p>An interesting outcome to have emerged from this current post hoc analysis was that even those patients who did not present with significant respiratory symptoms at baseline achieved meaningful improvements in lung function with dual bronchodilator therapy. Improvements in postdose FEV<sub>1</sub> with aclidinium/formoterol compared with monotherapies were of a similar magnitude for both less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients. However, when considering trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, aclidinium/formoterol demonstrated greater improvements from baseline in more symptomatic patients compared with less symptomatic patients, suggesting that dual therapy becomes increasingly beneficial with worsening symptom severity.</p><p>All active treatments provided clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea (TDI reduced &#x02265;1 unit) compared with placebo in both less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients, which suggests that patients with minimal symptoms at baseline can also benefit from dual bronchodilator therapy. This finding may be particularly noteworthy as other Phase III LABA/LAMA trials required patients to have a baseline mMRC dyspnea scale grade of at least 2,<xref rid="b6-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> meaning that data on the efficacy in patients with a lower symptom burden have hitherto been lacking.</p><p>Using several measures of COPD symptoms (E-RS total score, early-morning and nighttime symptom severity, and early-morning limitation of activity) and two different ways of stratifying more symptomatic patients, the results from this post hoc analysis demonstrate that more symptomatic patients receive substantial benefits from aclidinium/formoterol dual therapy. The picture is less clear in less symptomatic patients, as there was no strong evidence of improvement or benefit according to the E-RS tool. Similarly, there were no clear improvements in nighttime symptoms in less symptomatic patients. This is understandable, as improvements in symptoms would not be expected in patients considered to be symptom-free. However, early morning is often reported by patients to be the most troubling part of the day for COPD symptoms,<xref rid="b15-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the results from this study demonstrate that even patients reporting fewer symptoms showed some improvements with aclidinium/formoterol in early-morning symptom severity and limitation of early-morning activities.</p><p>In more symptomatic patients, dual bronchodilator therapy with aclidinium/formoterol reduced the risk of exacerbations compared with placebo, and there was also a trend toward a lower rate of exacerbations compared with monotherapies. The higher rate of exacerbations observed in the more symptomatic subgroups, which is not unexpected and has been reported previously,<xref rid="b17-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> is likely to be why these reductions were detected in more symptomatic patients, but not in less symptomatic patients.</p><p>Taken together, the results of this study clearly demonstrate the benefits of dual bronchodilator therapy with aclidinium/formoterol in more symptomatic patients in terms of lung function, breathlessness, early-morning and nighttime symptoms, and exacerbations, compared with placebo or monotherapies. Notably, in less symptomatic patients, the improvements observed in postdose FEV<sub>1</sub>, breathlessness, and early-morning symptoms demonstrate that even patients judged to have fewer symptoms benefited from dual bronchodilator therapy. This is particularly pertinent given that it has been shown that patients often underestimate or underreport the severity of their COPD symptoms and that there can be a disparity in the perception of symptoms by patients and physicians.<xref rid="b18-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A potential constraint of this post hoc analysis was the method used to distinguish between less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients. The use of dyspnea tools to identify less symptomatic and more symptomatic patient subgroups is well established<xref rid="b2-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and the BDI threshold has been shown previously to correlate with established mMRC cut-offs.<xref rid="b13-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, the threshold used to determine less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients for the E-RS definition was selected based on historical score distributions and further validation of the tool is required.<xref rid="b10-copd-11-2041" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Overall, results for less symptomatic and more symptomatic patients were largely consistent between the E-RS and BDI definitions, suggesting that the thresholds selected were appropriate. A further limitation of this post hoc analysis is the low patient numbers in some subgroups, which may account for why some improvements reached statistical significance, while others of a similar magnitude did not.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this post hoc analysis, we have shown that aclidinium/formoterol 400/12 &#x000b5;g provides consistent improvements in bronchodilation and symptoms compared with monotherapies and a reduction in exacerbations versus placebo in more symptomatic patients with moderate-to-severe COPD, regardless of the definition used. Furthermore, patients with a low symptom burden achieved some benefit from dual bronchodilator therapy versus monotherapies, as demonstrated by improvements in postdose FEV<sub>1</sub>, dyspnea, early-morning symptoms, and limitation of activities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank all of the patients and their families, the team of investigators, research nurses, and operations staff involved in these studies.
