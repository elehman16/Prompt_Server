To assess the individuals, a demographic questionnaire, an anxiety trait State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and a religious knowledge and attitude trait (pre- test and post-test and 1 or 2 months after the test) were filled in by the two groups.

These effects include spontaneous abortion, low fetal weight,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] elevated levels of stress hormones, chronic increase in blood pressure,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] premature birth and infant mortality,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] change in endocrine secretion,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] change in hypothalamic-pituitary axis performance, immune system suppression, and changes in the number of lymphocytes and decrease in CD4/CD8 cells.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The role of prenatal stress in the etiology of childhood illnesses[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and adulthood disorders[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and maternal postpartum depression[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] is taken into consideration. However, pregnancy and the puerperium can be stressful enough to trigger mental disorders which may reflect the recurrence or exacerbation of ex-psychiatric disorders (preexisting) or may implicate the onset of a new disorder. Chemical factors (including hormones of progesterone-estrogen-cortisol-thyroid hormones) and life stressors can have a significant impact on mental health. Hence, logically it seems that pregnancy is supposed to have an impact on the number of concurrent psychiatric disorders. Women in a variety of ways respond to the environmental stressors and ongoing concerns about fetus health, child care, lifestyle changes, or fear of labor pain.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a study, negative effects of high antenatal maternal anxiety related to impulsivity during a performance on cognitive tasks in 14 and 15 years old subjects were mentioned.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The results of Austin <italic>et al</italic>.'s study has shown that maternal trait anxiety, depression, and life event stress during pregnancy are associated with the incidence of complications in infant temperament at 6&#x02013;4 months after birth.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Furthermore, the results of Robertson's study on 14,000 samples have shown that antenatal depression, anxiety, and life event stress in pregnancy can develop postpartum depression.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In this respect, religion is supportive for people encountered with problems, and religious beliefs and activities such as prayer, worship, trust and appeal to God are defined as religious resources to increase tolerance. Moreover, religious practices such as prayer, honesty and faith and also study of religious books in developing hope, encouragement and positive attitudes toward depressive conditions and helping the one to get out of the depressive crisis would create a kind of inner peace.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Some studies have shown that intrinsic religious orientation is among the organized psychological behavior of great importance in the treatment of diseases and plays basic roles in the treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, and stressors.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Since the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, the studies have revealed the effects of religious interventions for improving psychological suffering. Furthermore, the effects of praying and reciting to control the psychological disorders are considerable. Studies not only show the positive relationship between religion and mental health but also reflect the influence of religion on health status.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The current study has been designed to investigate the religious teaching impact on the religious knowledge and attitudes of primiparous women referring to the selected prenatal clinics of Tehran University of Medical Sciences in July 2013 up June 2014.

(2) They were randomly divided into a control and an intervention group using the table of random numbers. In doing so, the first qualified individual was allocated to the intervention group and the second one was allocated to the control group (each group with 110 patients).

To determine the validity of the questionnaire, it was given to 10 expert professors of schools of nursing and midwifery of Shiraz and Tehran Universities of Medical Sciences. After application of the professors&#x02019; recommendations, the questionnaire's validity was confirmed. To evaluate the questionnaire's reliability, it was given to 30 pregnant women in a pilot study and its reliability was assessed.

Severe state anxiety in the first trimester of pregnancy in the intervention cohort ceased, and the individual stages of anxiety were in the range of mild and moderate, whereas those in the control group in the third trimester of pregnancy had 21.4% of severe state anxiety and 23.8% of severe trait anxiety.</p><p>In a study on 4132 individuals aged 65 and older in Canada, who regularly worshiped and participated in the religious gatherings, it was demonstrated that they suffered less from depression while there was no relationship between depression and worship.
