Other components of dysglycemia, such as postprandial glucose and glucose variability, however, have been recently evaluated as possible targets for intervention. Glucose variability may contribute to the generation of excessive protein glycation and oxidative stress, which are key factors in the pathogenesis of diabetic complications <xref rid="pone.0057733-Brownlee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Moreover, high glucose variability was shown to be associated with reduced endothelial function in patients with type 2 diabetes and optimal metabolic control <xref rid="pone.0057733-DiFlaviani1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) could not predict the development of retinopathy or nephropathy in a cohort of type 1 diabetic patients <xref rid="pone.0057733-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is reasonable to speculate that the controversial findings regarding the association of glucose variability with outcomes in patients with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0057733-Brownlee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Kilpatrick2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> may result from limited tools to identify genuine disturbances in glucose variability.</p><p>Glucose curve, like any biological signal, has linear and non-linear properties that can be analyzed by statistical methods. The oscillatory nature of this signal seems to depend on physiological mechanisms related to free radicals <xref rid="pone.0057733-Monnier1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0057733-Churruca1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, and inflammatory markers <xref rid="pone.0057733-Buscemi1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> that modulate its behaviour. Accordingly, the application of spectral analysis could indicate the presence of senoidal components<monospace>,</monospace> allowing a quantitative and differentiated assessment.</p><p>Since age and disease are associated with loss of complexity in many physiological systems, complexity analysis techniques may provide information on these phenomena <xref rid="pone.0057733-Varela1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Varela2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. As recently reported <xref rid="pone.0057733-Churruca2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the progressive loss of complexity in glycemic profile from health through metabolic syndrome to type 2 diabetes seems to precede hyperglycemia and correlates with other markers of disease progression, suggesting that non-linear analysis may be useful in the evaluation of the progression of dysglycemia to overt diabetes or related complications. Complexity analysis can be performed by several methods, including the evaluation of entropy and entropy rate through symbolic analysis <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Pharmacological agents acting on postprandial glucose excursions may attenuate glucose instability. Although lifestyle interventions have an important role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0057733-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Sigal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Umpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, little is known about the effect of exercise in glucose variability, especially regarding whether different types of exercise modalities could have distinct impact on glucose variability. In the present study we aimed to assess the effect of a single exercise session on glucose levels and glucose variability in patients with type 2 diabetes, as evaluated by continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). To determine whether the post-exercise glucose levels would be influenced by different exercise modalities, we used two randomized sessions consisting of either aerobic (AER) or aerobic combined with resistance exercise (COMB). In order to separate the effects of meals and exercise sessions, the analysis was performed on data derived from all glucose curves, before and after exercise, divided in before and after meal, according to diary appointments. Glucose variability was evaluated by conventional methods (glucose standard deviation, glucose variance, MAGE and glucose coefficient of variation) and by non-conventional methods (spectral and symbolic analysis). As spectral and symbolic analyses had never been used in the evaluation of glucose variability, mathematic tools were applied for full validation of these methods for this signal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see Checklist S1 and Protocol S1.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Research Design and Participants</title><p>Fourteen patients with type 2 diabetes participated in the experiments using a crossover randomized design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057733-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

During the test, gas exchange variables were measured by a previously validated system (Oxycon Delta, VIASYS, Healthcare GmbH, Jaeger, Germany).

Proper technique was demonstrated and practiced for leg press exercise (Sculptor, Porto Alegre Brazil), leg extension, bench press and biceps curl. When new attempts were needed, a 5-min resting period was allowed between subsequent attempts.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>CGMS Measurements</title><p>Subjects were admitted to the laboratory in the morning at approximately 9&#x02236;00 a.m., 24 h before the exercise session, when the glucose sensor (Sof-Sensor&#x02122;, Medtronic Mini-Med, Northridge, USA) was inserted subcutaneously. The sensor is a glucose oxidase based platinum electrode that is inserted through a needle into the subcutaneous tissue of the anterior abdominal wall, using a spring-loaded device (Senserter, Medtronic, Northridge, USA). Glucose oxidase catalyzes the oxidation of glucose in the interstitial fluid, which generates an electrical current. The current is carried by a cable to a pager-size monitor that analyzes the data every 10 s and reports average values every 5 min, totalizing 288 readings per day. Glucose profiles were collected the day before (day 1), the day of (day 2), and the day following (day 3) the single 1-h bout of moderate exercise. Sensor readings were calibrated with a glucose monitor (Accu-Check Performa, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using 4 finger-stick blood samples for each 24 h. Each sensor was used continuously for up to 72 h. All patients were previously instructed about the operation of the monitor, which included event registration for meals, inserting capillary glucose values as calibration, general care and completing detailed food recall during the period of monitoring. Subjects were asked to closely match their daily nutritional intake, avoid physical exercise except for the protocol, and record detailed food intake and daily physical activities in diaries across the 3-d period. The dietary assessment was performed using the software DietWin (Porto Alegre, Brazil).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Glucose Variability Evaluation</title><p>Glucose variability was assessed from series of absolute values of glucose, obtained by CGMS, sampled every 5 minutes. Each method was used as reported in the literature and respecting its limitations. Glucose variability was evaluated using conventional analysis and other mathematical methods generally applied to biological series, here called non-conventional analysis of glucose variability. The selection of the segments for the following analysis is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0057733-g002">Figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0057733-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0057733.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Example of a glucose curve obtained from CGMS record of 72 hours depicting the time periods used to evaluate the effects of meals, pre (section A) and post prandial (section B), and exercise, pre (section B) and post (section C) sessions, indicated in blocks.</title><p>The dark grey line represents the period of exercise session.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0057733.g002"/></fig><p>Conventional analysis of glucose variability was constructed from the statistical properties of the series, obtaining the following indices: MAGE <xref rid="pone.0057733-Service1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, glucose variance (VAR), glucose coefficient of variation (CV%), and glucose standard deviation (SD), all normalized by the mean blood glucose in each period <xref rid="pone.0057733-Mcdonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Hill1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These indices, except MAGE, were calculated for every 6-h block to obtain the measures according to the period of the day. The MAGE index was calculated for the whole signal (24 h), and its calculation is based on the differences between consecutive points, considering those which are higher than one standard deviation <xref rid="pone.0057733-Service1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. In this way, according to the characteristics of the curves in our study, the MAGE index was calculated only for the highest curve between 12 h and 14 h.</p><p>Non-conventional analyses were applied in the pre- and the postprandial periods before the exercise session, and in the postprandial period after the exercise sessions. The first set period for the analysis was the one obtained before exercise, which was compared to the one obtained after the AER and COMB exercise sessions. Non-conventional analysis of glucose variability was conducted using two methods applied to the glucose series: a linear method based on spectral analysis and an integrated nonlinear approach to the complexity analysis, symbolic analysis. Spectral analysis is a linear method that allows quantifying the oscillatory components from time series, by autoregressive model, widely applied to heart rate and arterial pressure series <xref rid="pone.0057733-Malliani1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A peak detector algorithm was used to determine possible predominant bands in the frequency power spectrum. The same methodology was applied to 10 surrogate signals, generated from each segment, to test false spectral results <xref rid="pone.0057733-Schreiber1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Symbolic dynamics relies on the calculation of Shannon entropy (SE) of the distribution of patterns lasting three measures and the classification of frequent deterministic patterns lasting three measures. Entropy calculates the degree of complexity of the distribution of the samples of a signal. The largest entropy is obtained when the distribution is flat (the samples are identically distributed). In contrast, the entropy decreases whenever values are distributed closer to a Gaussian sample distribution. Usually, in the analysis of biological variability, entropy is not calculated directly over the samples of the series but over patterns of length L (i.e., ordered sequences of (L-1) samples). Differently, entropy rate (e.g., approximated entropy or conditional entropy) provides a global index of complexity of the distributions of the samples conditioned to (L-1) previous samples as a function of L <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Symbolic analysis is an approach based on quantification of complexity that allows an advanced characterization of glucose variability series and the identification of experimental conditions known to differently perturb glucose oscillations. This method was fully described and validated previously <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Each subject and each experimental condition had its own range of glucose variations. Therefore, the full range of the sequences was uniformly spread on 6 levels (from 0 to 5), and presence of patterns was quantified. A redundancy reduction criterion was proposed to distribute deterministic patterns of the group in four categories according to the number and type of glucose changes: 1) no variation (0 V); 2) one variation (1 V); and 3) two like variations (2 LV); 4) two unlike variations (2 UV). The Shannon entropy and corrected conditional entropy (CCE) of the distribution of the patterns were calculated to provide a quantification of the complexity of the pattern distribution <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Probability density function (PDF) provides the distribution of the patterns and reports the sample frequency of each pattern as a function of the decimal code <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The small number of quantization levels utilized to describe this dynamics can express some patterns more frequent than others only by chance. In order to rule out this possibility, 20 surrogate data series were obtained from each original series and the results were statistically compared.</p><p>The surrogate signals were generated by routines implemented in Matlab, based on the works of Theiler et al. (1992) <xref rid="pone.0057733-Theiler1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. The same algorithm is used to generate surrogates in previous workw by our group <xref rid="pone.0057733-Casali1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.Twenty surrogate data series were obtained from the original one by randomly shuffling the samples according to 20 different white noise realizations, thus completely destroying the original power spectrum but maintaining sample distribution. A complexity index (SE <bold>or</bold> MP%) calculated over the original series (CIO) was compared with those obtained from the surrogate series (CIS) by using the formula:<disp-formula id="pone.0057733.e001"><graphic xlink:href="pone.0057733.e001.jpg" position="anchor" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>

For the AER session, subjects exercised on a cycle ergometer (Embreex 360, Brusque, Brazil<bold>)</bold>. Each session included a 5-min warm-up at 20 watts, followed by 40 min at 70% of the peak heart rate, as determined in the incremental exercise test, and 5-min of stretching exercise as cool down. In the COMB session, subjects completed a 5-min warm-up on the cycle ergometer and continued for 20 min at 70% of the peak heart rate.

In contrast, our data, using multiple and frequent glucose measurements with continuous monitoring, do not confirm such long duration of glucose reduction after either AER or COMB exercise sessions. The increased insulin sensitivity determined by exercise is accomplished by increased GLUT4 protein [32&#x02013;30] which is determined by enhanced skeletal muscle AMPK activity <xref rid="pone.0057733-Holloszy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Sharoff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. These changes occur very rapidly after the exercise onset and can last 16 h after the intervention <xref rid="pone.0057733-Ren1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, feeding a high-carbohydrate diet, with development of glycogen supercompensation, prevents the increase in insulin responsiveness <xref rid="pone.0057733-Host1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, whereas feeding a carbohydrate-free diet maintains the increase in GLUT4 and insulin responsiveness for days after the exercise bout <xref rid="pone.0057733-Iscoe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Considering that patients in our study maintained their usual carbohydrate ingestion, this could be one reason influencing the reduced duration of the exercise-induced hypoglycemic effect. Moreover, the severity of the insulin-resistant state characteristic of type 2 diabetes has been shown to preclude the expected exercise increase in glucose uptake by muscle cells <xref rid="pone.0057733-Cusi1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>Considering that sulphonylureas <xref rid="pone.0057733-Larsen1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and insulin <xref rid="pone.0057733-Iscoe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Praet1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> may increase the hypoglycemic action of exercise when the treatments are combined, we studied patients who were not using these agents, in order to isolate the effects of exercise. Because current guidelines recommend metformin as the first step in type 2 diabetes treatment, and this drug has no hypoglycemic effect, patients on metformin were included. However, recent data have shown that the enhanced insulin sensitivity caused by an exercise bout is blunted by the administration of metformin, which was accounted for the absence of skeletal muscle AMPK activity rise, thus resulting in an attenuation of the well-documented hypoglycemic effect of exercise alone <xref rid="pone.0057733-Sharoff1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This is another fact possibly contributing to small lowering of absolute glucose observed in the present study. Moreover, the effect of metformin in lowering plasma glucose after a meal has been shown to be attenuated by exercise <xref rid="pone.0057733-Boule1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>To track changes in blood glucose levels of patients both in usual activities, as well as during exercises sessions, we used the CGMS, which has proven to be effective in registering changes in glucose levels in usual activities, recording nocturnal hypoglycemia and postprandial hyperglycemia that are not evident with routine monitoring <xref rid="pone.0057733-Boland1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, in a previous study, we showed that in patients with diabetes, agreement between finger-stick blood glucose and CGMS-measured glucose during exercise was within the recommended accuracy limits considering the proposed International Organization for Standardization (ISO) <xref rid="pone.0057733-Figueira1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>.</p><p>Results from glucose obtained with the CGMS during an acute exercise session were previously reported by other authors <xref rid="pone.0057733-Iscoe1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Cauza1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, but, to our knowledge, the present study is the first to compare an acute session of aerobic exercise with a combination of aerobic with resistance exercise. The similar reduction in glucose levels after AER or COMB exercise sessions are in accordance with the findings of our recent meta-analysis on the chronic effects of exercise on HbA1c in patients with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0057733-Umpierre1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Since controversial results in long-term trials <xref rid="pone.0057733-Church1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Sigal1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> might be related to the amount of exercise performed, we have been careful to apply the same duration of both exercise protocols. In addition, a modified Borg CR10 scale was used to measure the rating of perceived exertion, indicating similar perceived exertion between the two exercise sessions.</p><p>An interesting new finding of the present study was the reduction in glucose variability induced by acute exercise sessions, irrespective of the modality employed. Glucose fluctuations trigger activation of oxidative stress, a main mechanism leading to diabetic complications <xref rid="pone.0057733-Brownlee1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, different ways of evaluating glucose variability have provided controversial results concerning their impact to improve the risk prediction of microvascular complications above the risk predicted by HbA1c levels <xref rid="pone.0057733-Kilpatrick1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Kilpatrick2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Importantly, these studies were performed in patients with type 1 diabetes, and no study evaluated the possible beneficial effect of exercise training as a tool for lowering glucose variability and its potential in reducing diabetic complications in the long term. To our knowledge, the present study provides the first piece of evidence showing this potential by a single exercise session.</p><p>With regard to the results obtained with the non-conventional methods, we found some parameters were altered after the exercise sessions. The interpretation of these results requires attention to some important concepts related to the physiological mechanisms involved in the generation of glucose oscillations. First, the proposed validation using surrogated signals demonstrated the applicability of the method and the changes detected only in real signals, indicated the veracity of such characteristics present in the glucose curves, minimizing the possibility of intrinsic errors into the signal pattern. Second, spectral analysis indicated the presence of a slow physiological mechanism acting within a period of around 8 minutes (predominant band at around 0.002 Hz). The power of this band was not affected by meals, but was reduced after the exercise sessions. Moreover, the results of symbolic analysis were also not affected by meals, however, COMB exercise induced an increase of 0 V pattern, accompanied by reduction in the 1 V pattern. These changes, favoring 0 V pattern, represent no variation, indicating a decrease in glucose variability when evaluated on three consecutive measures. It is important to note that the results of non conventional methods can provide complementary information about glucose oscilation. Certainly, the most important information provided by our results is the detection of glucose curve features that were not previously detected by the indices conventionally used in the literature.</p><p>Interestingly, the question of complexity and pathology is not yet clear. Some studies have shown a relationship between pathological conditions and loss of complexity <xref rid="pone.0057733-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> but, on the other hand, but others suggest a possible opposite relationship <xref rid="pone.0057733-Porta4" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Our study evaluates the acute effect of two sessions that evoke different physiological responses. Reducing complexity after the COMB sessions may not be related to an impaired systemic context, but to the predominance of a nonlinear mechanism or the withdrawal of a nonlinear mechanism shortly after the session. The mechanisms involved should still be studied to clarify the observed patterns of linearity.</p><p>We can only speculate on possible physiological mechanisms acting on the predominant frequency range of the power spectra and symbolic patterns described above. The responses observed in the present study may have been underlying the responses observed in the present stuy, there may have been hormonal actions linked to insulin synthesis and release <xref rid="pone.0057733-King2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0057733-Childs1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, and/or inflammatory factors <xref rid="pone.0057733-Shephard1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Additionally, mechanisms directly affected by muscle contractions cannot be ruled out. The Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160), which is stimulated by insulin as well as by exercise, and its increase after exclusive sessions of either aerobic or resistance exercises may have contributed to change glucose dynamics <xref rid="pone.0057733-Dreyer1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0057733-Howlett1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Moreover, since only the COMB session changed the glucose variability pattern, it is possible that additive effects from aerobic and resistance stimuli may affect the post-exercise insulin signaling. Some studies have shown a correlation between such parameters and glucose variability, both under physiological and pathological situations, indicating a possible influence of these mechanisms on the changed variables <xref rid="pone.0057733-Monnier2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0057733-Rosa1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Therefore, further investigation is required in order to interpret the obtained results, since the isolated actions of these mechanisms on the parameters here addressed were not studied.</p><p>In conclusion, both AER and COMB exercise modalities in patients with type 2 diabetes using metformin were associated with small glucose level reductions, which lasted a short time. The glucose variability pattern was changed after COMB sessions only when non-conventional methods (symbolic analysis) were employed. Further research is needed to identify physiological mechanisms related to these mathematical characteristics. Long-term potential benefits of lowering glucose variability by exercise training should be tested in randomized clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057733.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>PRISMA checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0057733.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0057733.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0057733.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0057733-UK1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
