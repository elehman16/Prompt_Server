Scoliosis usually develops before puberty
and leads to a 3-dimensional trunk deformity<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compared to healthy individuals, patients with idiopathic scoliosis
have decreased overall balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and
asymmetrical left-right transversus abdominis muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lenssinck et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that exercise
was the most effective conservative treatment for scoliosis, whereas Lee et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that the core muscle release
technique was the most effective. Schroth exercises are 3-dimensional exercises used for
treating scoliosis, which were developed by Katharina Schroth in 1920<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>; these provide sensorimotor and kinesthetic stimulation,
thereby correcting abnormal breathing patterns present in patients with scoliosis. This
program also includes training to help patients consciously maintain correct posture in
daily living activities.</p><p>In this study, stretching, Schroth, and strengthening exercises were applied consecutively
in an adult with idiopathic scoliosis to assess their effects on Cobb&#x02019;s angle and the rib
hump.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUBJECT AND METHODS</title><p>A 26-year-old woman diagnosed with idiopathic scoliosis and Cobb&#x02019;s angle &#x0003e;20&#x000b0; during her
adolescence experienced back pain (visual analogue scale [VAS] score = 5) and shortness of
breath when climbing stairs. Her laboratory findings did not reveal anemia. She also
reported twisting of her skirt to the right and developing creases only on the left side of
her shirt. Prior to participating in the study, she demonstrated an understanding of its
purpose and provided written informed consent. This study was conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The rib hump (difference in height between the right and left thorax) was 15&#x000b0;, as measured
with the Adam&#x02019;s forward bend test using a scoliometer, during which the patient clasped her
two hands together while in a standing posture, naturally dropped the hands between her
legs, and bent forward to 90&#x000b0;<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas
Cobb&#x02019;s angle (the intersecting angle between the perpendiculars to the lines drawn parallel
to the superior and inferior endplates of the most tilted vertebrae)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> was 20.51&#x000b0;.</p><p>The exercise program used in this study consisted of 3 stages and was implemented 3 times a
week, for 8 weeks. The first stage was a warm-up consisting of stretching for 10 minutes to
relax the tightened muscles and improve joint flexibility. The second stage consisted of the
Schroth exercises. Schroth breathing (rotational breathing), the most fundamental Schroth
exercise, was used first to correct the breathing patterns, following which spine
stabilization was induced through breathing activities corrected by the 3D-made-easy
exercises. Finally, the patient was trained in the Schroth walking method to correct her
posture while walking. The third stage was a cool-down phase consisting of 10 minutes of
muscle strengthening exercises to activate the muscles corrected using the Schroth exercises
and to maintain the skeletal frame.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the 8-week intervention, Cobb&#x02019;s angle decreased from 20.51&#x000b0; to 16.35&#x000b0; (19.3%
decrease), and the rib hump decreased from 15&#x000b0; to 9&#x000b0; (40% decrease). The back pain rating
decreased from VAS 5 to VAS 1; shortness of breath while climbing stairs disappeared; and
the occurrence of her skirt twisting to the right and her shirt creasing only on the left
side became less frequent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, consecutive application of stretching, Schroth, and strengthening exercises
decreased the patient&#x02019;s Cobb&#x02019;s angle and rib hump. To treat scoliosis, the lengthened
muscles should be shortened, and the shortened muscles should be lengthened again to restore
the spine&#x02019;s vertical axis. Therefore, the stretching exercises implemented in the first
stage may have relaxed the muscles that were asymmetrically shortened around the spine and
lengthened the trunk, thereby increasing flexibility. Zakaria et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that stretching exercises decreased muscle spasms
on the concave side and hyperactivity and corrected the curvature of the lumbar region by
lengthening the shortened muscles.</p><p>Respiratory dysfunction is one of the major symptoms in patients with scoliosis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in the chest wall and spine
structure are associated with early onset scoliosis, which includes spine rotation, chest
wall distortion, and a rib hump<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Abnormal rib alignment may also affect thoracic rigidity and size<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, loss of elasticity of the costovertebral
joints and spine can impair respiratory mechanics<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Schroth exercises implemented in the second session comprise a
program based on sensorimotor and kinesthetic principles that promote the correction of
asymmetric posture and maintain correct posture through breathing activities<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rotational breathing, one of the Schroth
exercises, was used to selectively contract the convex area of the trunk and allow the
inspired air to move toward the concave areas of the ribs and thorax<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, rotational breathing may have corrected her
breathing patterns, and the 3D-made-easy exercises may have remedied her breathing
activities. Additionally, improvement in vital capacity secondary to performing the Schroth
exercises may have improved her breathing while climbing stairs.</p><p>Furthermore, to avoid supporting the posture only with the spinal ligaments, the trunk was
elevated through activation of its muscles, and the patient was trained to maintain the
corrected posture during her daily living activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Otman et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>
implemented Schroth exercises for a year in 50 adolescent patients with right thoracic
scoliosis (4 hours per session, 5 times per week, for the first 6 weeks, after which the
exercises were continued 90 minutes each day at home) and found that Cobb&#x02019;s angle was
decreased from 26.10&#x000b0; to 23.45&#x000b0; after 6 weeks, to 19.25&#x000b0; after 6 months, and to 17.85&#x000b0; after
1&#x02005;year.</p><p>The strengthening exercises implemented in the final stage activated the muscles that were
corrected using the Schroth exercises and may have helped the patient maintain spinal
stability by strengthening the trunk muscles. Zakaria et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the use of strengthening exercises for the weakened
muscles on the convex side corrected the body&#x02019;s line of gravity and improved muscle
balance.</p><p>Back pain is a common symptom, occurring in 60&#x02013;80% of adult patients with scoliosis<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although back pain is not directly
related to the magnitude of the spine curvature, rotational subluxation and sagittal
disproportion may increase back pain<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the patient showed sagittal
and coronal disproportion, which is customary in adults with scoliosis; this causes bad
posture, which may lead to back pain<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, changing the spine structure by performing consecutive stretching, Schroth, and
strengthening exercises may have decreased Cobb&#x02019;s angle and back pain in our patient.</p><p>This study had the following limitations. First, although the 8-week consecutive
application of stretching, Schroth, and strengthening exercises decreased Cobb&#x02019;s angle and
back pain, we were not able to perform a comparative analysis to determine whether this
program was more effective than other treatments, since it was a single case study. Second,
we were not able to conduct a long-term intervention for 6 months or 1&#x02005;year to further
reduce the patient&#x02019;s scoliosis. Therefore, a comparative study on the individual clinical
effects of stretching, Schroth, and strengthening exercises in patients with idiopathic
scoliosis is required.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>BN</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Moreau</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Is physical activity contraindicated for individuals with
