About one-third of patients undergoing such procedures develop acute kidney injury (AKI) (defined by an acute rise in serum creatinine of 50% or more or an acute rise of 26&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L or more), and 1% receive acute dialysis. This means there are several hundreds of thousands of cases of AKI attributed to cardiac surgery worldwide each year with about 20&#x02005;000 cases receiving acute dialysis. When AKI occurs (compared with when it does not), it associates with increased mortality, a longer hospital length of stay and higher healthcare costs.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></p><p>The major mechanism of AKI in cardiac surgery is impaired kidney perfusion causing an initial hypoxic insult followed by activation of inflammatory pathways during reperfusion (schematic depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004842F1">figure 1</xref>).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In animal models of kidney ischaemia-reperfusion injury, an elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species and interstitial inflammation all result in AKI.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2014004842F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Inflammation in cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, and mechanism by which acute kidney injury may be prevented by perioperative corticosteroids. Figure modified from Rosner and Okusa,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and reproduced with permission.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2014004842f01"/></fig><p>In this setting, an inexpensive drug that attenuates the inflammatory response and related consequences could have a worldwide impact. Corticosteroids are an inexpensive, generic class of anti-inflammatory agents. We provide four lines of evidence to support the hypothesis that they reduce the risk of AKI from cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> The mechanisms for AKI prevention are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004842F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><p>First, corticosteroid use may mitigate perioperative cardiac events. This may occur through a few processes including the inhibition of cytokines released during cardiopulmonary bypass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004842F1">figure 1</xref>). Many studies of corticosteroid use report postoperative improvements in the cardiac index and mean arterial pressure, with less use of inotropic support. A meta-analysis demonstrates that perioperative corticosteroid use clearly reduces the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation (44 studies).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Acute cardiac events are inextricably linked to AKI events; both events often co-occur in the non-operative setting. The process may include hypotension as a primary inciting event or from the cardiac injury itself, or from the aggressive use of diuretics used to treat acute heart failure.</p><p>Second, corticosteroid use targets the key pathological mechanisms for the development of AKI (displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014004842F1">figure 1</xref> along with where steroids act to prevent AKI). This involves reducing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome from cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, with reductions in inflammatory mediators, cytokines, complement, transcription factors and adhesion molecules.</p><p>Third, in the largest multicentre randomised trial of dexamethasone in cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, 4494 adult patients from the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone (1&#x02005;mg/kg of body weight with a 100&#x02005;kg maximum) or placebo administered as a single intravenous injection after the induction of anaesthesia before the initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> An outcome of acute renal failure defined by the study investigators was an increase in postoperative serum creatinine of at least three times the preoperative value, or a serum creatinine more than 350&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L associated with an acute increase of serum creatinine of at least 44&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L, within 30&#x02005;days of surgery. This outcome of acute renal failure was one of five components of the primary composite outcome. Dexamethasone versus placebo resulted in trends in the reduction of the primary outcome and the acute renal failure outcome that were non-significant (primary outcome: 157 patients of 2235 with dexamethasone (7.0%) vs 191 patients of 2247 with placebo (8.5%); relative risk reduction 17% (95% CI &#x02212;1% to 33%); acute renal failure outcome 28 patients of 2235 with dexamethasone (1.3%) vs 40 patients of 2247 with placebo (1.8%), relative risk reduction 30% (95% CI &#x02212;14% to 56%).</p><p>Two of the four existing small randomised controlled trials raise the possibility that corticosteroids may prevent AKI in cardiopulmonary surgery. In one trial, 29 children were randomised to receive either intravenous dexamethasone (1&#x02005;mg/kg) or saline 1&#x02005;h prior to cardiopulmonary bypass surgery.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the dexamethasone group, 1 of 15 (7%) children demonstrated AKI versus 7 of 14 (50%) children in the saline group; p=0.014 (AKI defined by &#x02265;18&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L increase in serum creatinine compared with the preoperative value). Another trial randomised 236 adults undergoing elective valvular or coronary artery bypass surgery to intravenous dexamethasone (0.6&#x02005;mg/kg) or placebo soon after the induction of anaesthesia.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Three of 110 (2.7%) patients with placebo versus none of the 110 patients with dexamethasone developed AKI (where AKI was defined by use of haemodialysis or oliguria). The results were statistically non-significant, recognising there were only three events, p=0.24. A non-statistically significant reduction in the risk of AKI was observed in the other two randomised trials (enrolled 86 and 20 patients, respectively, with the former also limited by a small number of events (2 episodes of AKI (undefined), 1/43 in steroid group versus 1/43 in placebo group)).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Fourth, intravenous corticosteroids are a mainstay of therapy for many acute processes that involve kidney inflammation: acute glomerulonephritis, vasculitis, lupus and resistant forms of acute allergic interstitial nephritis. It is rational to hypothesise similar benefits in cardiopulmonary bypass.</p><p>We are conducting the Steroids In caRdiac Surgery trial (acronym SIRS). The rational and design of this large, international, randomised placebo-controlled trial are described elsewhere.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In brief, adults at high risk of postoperative complications who are undergoing cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump are randomly allocated to receive either methylprednisolone divided into two intravenous 250&#x02005;mg doses (one dose at the start of anaesthesia and the other at the start of the cardiopulmonary bypass pump) or matching placebo. Allocation is performed by a central randomisation service and is stratified by centre. Patients, healthcare providers, data collectors and outcome adjudicators are blinded to treatment allocation. This trial is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. With respect to the study schedule, over 7500 patients (from the last in the order of registration) from 82 centres in 19 countries were randomised on 20 December 2013. The primary outcome is 30&#x02005;day all-cause mortality. The most important secondary outcomes are a 30-day composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure and respiratory failure. Renal failure is defined using thresholds of stage 3 AKI described in recent guidelines.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Secondary safety outcomes include postoperative infection, wound complications, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, delirium and insulin use.</p><p>In addition to the primary outcome, SIRS is uniquely positioned to determine the effects of corticosteroids on various stages and alternate definitions of AKI (and whether the treatment effect is homogeneous across these stages), to consider whether the treatment effect differs in those with and without preoperative chronic kidney disease (CKD), and to investigate the effect of corticosteroids at the time of surgery on kidney function 6&#x02005;months later. We were competitively awarded an additional grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research to examine these issues in a SIRS AKI substudy. The questions detailed in this grant are presented below followed by a prespecified analytical plan.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Primary questions</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In patients undergoing cardiac surgery with a cardiopulmonary bypass pump, does the use of intravenous methylprednisolone at the time of surgery compared with placebo alter the risk of postoperative AKI?

To refine the analytical plan, we reviewed SIRS data as of November 2013 (without knowledge of the treatment allocation and recognising SIRS data is actively being adjudicated and data discrepancies reconciled).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>SIRS kidney data collection</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Kidney data collection in all SIRS patients</title><p>A preoperative serum creatinine is measured and recorded in the 30&#x02005;days prior to surgery. The date of surgery (and not the date of randomisation) will be used to identify the start of follow-up in this protocol; the median (IQR) number of days between the date of randomisation and the date of surgery is 1 (0&#x02013;1), and the &#x0003c;2% of randomised patients expected not to receive surgery will be excluded from the analysis (see Patient selection section). A single peak serum creatinine in the 14&#x02005;days following surgery is recorded along with the date of this measurement. At the start of our study, 2&#x02005;weeks was felt to be a reasonable period in which any AKI related to the surgery would manifest (either from the initial insult during surgery, and/or related to a second insult that occurred soon after surgery). Since the launch of SIRS, international AKI guidelines were published in 2012 which define AKI by an increase in serum creatinine of &#x02265;26.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L within 48&#x02005;h, or an increase in serum creatinine of &#x02265;50% known or presumed to have occurred within 7&#x02005;days.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Currently, for all SIRS participants, the single peak postoperative serum creatinine is recorded a median of 2&#x02005;days after surgery (IQR 1&#x02013;4&#x02005;days). Approximately 60% of patients have this peak measurement recorded within 2&#x02005;days of surgery, and 70%, 80% and 83% of patients have this measurement recorded within 3, 4 and 5&#x02005;days of surgery, respectively. Less than 1.5% of patients die in the operating room or in the 48&#x02005;h after surgery (which may influence serum creatinine measurement). Less than 2% of patients are expected to have a missing peak serum creatinine value within 14&#x02005;days of surgery, and in such cases in the absence of receipt of acute dialysis, we will carry forward the prerandomisation serum creatinine value for all analyses (which means the patient will not have developed AKI; see Analysis section). No urine output data have been collected in SIRS, given difficulties with its accurate measurement in the setting of international data collection. Receipt of new dialysis for kidney failure is recorded at hospital discharge and at 30&#x02005;days after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Additional perioperative kidney data recordings in consecutive patients</title><p>After receipt of grant funding for this substudy, additional perioperative serum creatinine data began to be recorded in consecutive patients enrolled at substudy participating centres (earliest centre to start this process began in March 2012). The data collection includes all serum creatinine values performed as a part of routine care (and the time of measurement) within the 14&#x02005;days after surgery. If a patient is still in hospital beyond 14&#x02005;days, the most recent serum creatinine value performed in routine care prior to the hospital discharge is also recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>6-month kidney function data</title><p>After receipt of grant funding, in substudy participating centres, patients have been invited to enroll at the time of randomisation to record a single 6-month serum creatinine value (with instructions that a value is acceptable provided it is collected anytime between 3 and 8&#x02005;months after surgery when a patient is not acutely ill).</p><p>The additional serum creatinine collection (particularly the 6-month creatinine measurement) was added to the patient's consent requests and ethical approval was received at each of the AKI substudy participating sites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Patient selection</title><p>All SIRS randomised patients will be included in the AKI substudy except for the following three reasons: (1) those with end-stage renal disease prior to randomisation (expected &#x0003c;2% of patients), as the assessment of AKI is no longer relevant (estimated-glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x0003c;15&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup> as determined by the chronic kidney disease-epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> receipt of chronic dialysis or a prior kidney transplant or a baseline serum creatinine &#x0003e;327&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L; the last exclusion also enables retained patients to have their new onset AKI staged according to most recent guidelines)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; (2) those missing a prerandomisation serum creatinine value, or missing age or sex (expected in &#x0003c;1% of patients) as this is needed to define AKI or baseline CKD and (3) those who never underwent cardiac surgery (expected in &#x0003c;2% of patients) as they will not have the opportunity to have any postoperative serum creatinine measurements. When we publish the final results, these exclusions will be reported separately in each of the methylprednisolone and placebo groups. We expect over 7000 SIRS patients will be eligible for the AKI substudy from 81 centres in 18 countries.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intention to treat</title><p>The intention-to-treat principle will guide all primary analyses, irrespective of whether there is a deviation from the randomly allocated therapy or not (methylprednisolone or matching placebo). Currently, approximately 3% of patients did not receive the study medication, 2.4% of patients received non-study corticosteroids in the operating room and 4.4% of patients received non-study corticosteroids after surgery. At the time of final analysis, these results will be reported by treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Primary definition of AKI</title><p>We will use a mixed effects logistic regression model to obtain an estimate of the OR of AKI comparing methylprednisolone with placebo (after testing model assumptions). While logistic regression models will be used for hypothesis testing, at the time of final analysis, we will preferentially report relative risk reductions of methylprednisolone versus placebo as this metric is easier to interpret by a clinical audience (and hence we use relative risk reduction nomenclature throughout the protocol appreciating the logistic regression model produces an OR; the method to derive a relative risk reduction from an OR is described elsewhere<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In SIRS, this AKI outcome will use the most recent consensus criteria and will be defined as any of the following two criteria<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>: (1) &#x02265;50% change in the postoperative serum creatinine value from the preoperative value (((peak postoperative serum creatinine&#x02212;preoperative serum creatinine)/preoperative serum creatinine)&#x000d7;100), (2) &#x02265;26.5&#x02005;&#x003bc;mol/L increase in serum creatinine after surgery from the preoperative value. Given the nature of SIRS data collection, this peak postoperative serum creatinine value is assessed in the 14&#x02005;days following surgery (recognising greater than 80% of peak values are currently evident within 5&#x02005;days of surgery), thus the timing in this SIRS AKI definition is slightly modified than what is presented in the AKI consensus definition.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> For the primary analysis, we will treat centre as a random effect, and will adjust for the following baseline characteristics: age (per year), sex, left ventricular function (&#x02265;50%, 35&#x02013;49%, 20&#x02013;34%, &#x0003c;20%), diabetes, prerandomisation ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use, prerandomisation statin use, prerandomisation diuretic use, preoperative eGFR category (&#x02265;60 and &#x0003c;60&#x02005;mL/min/1.73&#x02005;m<sup>2</sup>), surgery type (coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), valve, CABG and valve) and evidence of non-elective surgery (defined by either preoperative use of inotropes or vasopressors, preoperative use of an intra-aortic balloon pump or ventricular assist device or history of a myocardial infarction within the 30&#x02005;days prior to surgery). In patients who underwent surgery but are missing a postoperative serum creatinine value (expected in &#x0003c;2% of patients), we will carry the prerandomisation serum creatinine value forward which should provide a more conservative estimate of the intervention effect than the alternative of removing such patients. For patients missing a left ventricular ejection fraction measurement (at present &#x0003c;1.5% missing), we will impute a value of 50%. If required, for each remaining covariate, we will include a missing data indicator variable (at present &#x0003c;0.1% data are missing for each variable).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> We will report the 95% CI for the adjusted RRR, and a two-tailed p value of &#x02264;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.

A significant unadjusted absolute risk difference will also be expressed as the &#x02018;number needed to treat (NNT)&#x02019; (1/absolute risk difference; a measure which indicates how many patients need to receive methylprednisolone to prevent one patient from developing AKI who otherwise would develop AKI if they receive placebo; a lower number indicating a greater benefit of methylprednisolone). The 95% CI of the NNT is the inverse of the Wald CI for the absolute risk difference.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>

Most patients routinely have their serum creatinine measured as a part of routine care for many days after cardiac surgery, so the potential of ascertainment bias is low (ie, where methylprednisolone versus placebo alters the incidence of another event such as myocardial infarction or infection, which in turn influences the likelihood of serum creatinine measurement). At the time of final analysis, we will examine the number of measurements by treatment group, and also look at the length of hospital stay in each group to consider whether there is the potential for differential ascertainment of AKI in the two treatment groups.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Errors with serum creatinine as a measure of kidney function</title><p>In SIRS, the preoperative serum creatinine is only recorded once in the 30&#x02005;days prior to cardiac surgery (where patients may be undergoing elective, urgent or emergent surgery). It would be preferably to have at least two baseline serum creatinine values on all SIRS patients, separated by at least 3&#x02005;months, to more accurately define the presence of CKD. Also, in SIRS, there is no knowledge of potential serum creatinine changes close to the time of surgery (particularly in the case of emergency surgery, poor perfusion or recent contrast) which may mean that the preoperative serum creatinine value is not in a steady state (although this characteristic should be equally balanced in the methylprednisolone and placebo groups). All of these considerations increase &#x02018;noise&#x02019; related to the baseline serum creatinine measurement, and reduce the ability to detect postoperative changes in the serum creatinine. To partly address this concern, we are adjusting for a definition of urgent surgery in the primary statistical models, and can also repeat the analysis excluding patients who meet the definition of urgent surgery.</p><p>Worldwide, over the last decade, there have been efforts to better standardise the serum creatinine assay. It seems likely (although not documented in SIRS) that most preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine measurements prior to hospital discharge would be performed in the same laboratory, and close in time to one another. This reduces concerns about interlaboratory and intralaboratory variability (drift) in the serum creatinine measurement. However, the same cannot be said for the 6-month measurement. Serial measures of serum creatinine assayed at a central laboratory 6&#x02005;months after surgery (and longer) were desired, but were not possible to obtain in SIRS. Also, SIRS has no measures of baseline or follow-up proteinuria, which are now featured in more recent CKD staging systems.</p><p>If corticosteroids decrease creatinine production, this in theory could blunt any rise in serum creatinine after surgery and result in less patients meeting our definitions of AKI. However, in other settings such as rheumatoid arthritis, high-dose intravenous glucocorticoid (equivalent to 1000&#x02005;mg of methylprednisolone) did not reduce the amount of creatinine in subsequent urine measurements (which would have declined if creatinine production had declined).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Limited statistical power for the most clinically important kidney outcomes</title><p>Stage 3 AKI with receipt of dialysis and long-term end-stage renal disease are the most clinically important kidney outcomes. However, there will be too few events for adequate statistical power to reliably determine the effect of our intervention on these outcomes. We focus on mild-to-moderate AKI (defined by accepted thresholds of changes in serum creatinine).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> While mild-to-moderate AKI is the outcome used in virtually all AKI prevention trials, we recognise that it is a surrogate outcome that may not directly impact how a patient feels, functions or survives.
