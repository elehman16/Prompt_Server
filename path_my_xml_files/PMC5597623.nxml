In addition, all subjects were given metyrapone (to inhibit adrenal cortisol secretion)&#x02009;+&#x02009;/&#x02212; hydrocortisone (HC) in a randomised crossover design to produce low, medium and high glucocorticoid levels. The clearest effects of insulin were to reduce plasma levels of the branched chain amino acids (BCAs) leucine/isoleucine and their deaminated metabolites, and lowered free fatty acids and acylcarnitines. The highest dose of hydrocortisone increased plasma BCAs in both insulin groups but increased free fatty acids only in the high insulin group, however hydrocortisone did not affect the levels of acyl carnitines in either group. The clearest interaction between HC and insulin was that hydrocortisone produced an elevation in levels of BCAs and their metabolites which were lowered by insulin. The direct modulation of BCAs by glucocorticoids and insulin may provide the basis for improved <italic>in vivo</italic> monitoring of glucocorticoid and insulin action.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Intracellular glucocorticoid receptors are widely expressed and affect energy metabolism, cardiovascular control and innate immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Acute elevation in cortisol is a crucial component of the stress response, but chronic glucocorticoid excess (Cushing&#x02019;s syndrome) causes obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, impaired immunity, depression, and cognitive dysfunction. Common medical conditions such as type two diabetes and the metabolic syndrome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> and neuropsychiatric disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> are associated with mildly elevated circulating and tissue glucocorticoid levels although at present it is not possible to measure circulating markers of tissue glucocorticoid action. Similarly, glucocorticoid deficiency, which can be life-threatening during stress, is especially difficult to diagnose during critical illness when conventional tests of cortisol production such as adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation tests may be unreliable<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This lack of specific biomarkers makes clinical management of patients requiring glucocorticoid replacement therapy particularly challenging, and may contribute to well-documented excess morbidity and mortality in patients with hypopituitarism or adrenocortical failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The complexity of glucocorticoid action imposes a major limitation in the development of new therapeutic agents, because of the lack of reliable indicators of a reduction in tissue cortisol action.</p><p id="Par3">Novel biomarkers of glucocorticoid action are urgently required and mass spectrometry has become increasingly applied to this area. A previous study using gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) reported limited metabolomic profiling in urine and plasma of subjects treated with anti-inflammatory synthetic glucocorticoids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. A recent more comprehensive study was carried out using GC-MS and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to both profile and quantify the metabolome of 20 healthy male volunteers following administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, which reduced plasma levels of alanine, methionine, asparagine, phenylalanine, proline and serine.</p><p id="Par4">Comparison of groups of people found a number of markers to be altered in insulin resistant individuals, particularly unsaturated fatty acids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. A distinct metabolic signature has been linked to obesity: elevated plasma levels of the branched chain amino acids (BCAs) leucine, isoleucine and valine; elevated amino acids methionine, glutamine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, asparagine, and arginine, with concomitant depression of glycine levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>; and elevations of a number of free fatty acids and acyl carnitines. In fact, it has been proposed that BCA levels provide a better signature of metabolic health than BMI<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> and may predict development of insulin resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">To date, no direct study on the effects on insulin and cortisol on metabolic profiles in individuals has been reported. To identify biomarkers which reflect glucocorticoid and insulin action, we performed metabolomic analysis of plasma samples obtained from a previously published study of healthy men treated with metyrapone followed by hydrocortisone (HC) infusion to induce low (~150&#x02009;nM), medium (~400&#x02009;nM) and high (~1400&#x02009;nM, supra-physiological) circulating cortisol levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Moreover, we tested specificity of the response to glucocorticoids by making measurements before and after insulin infusion, and examined the interaction between insulin and HC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Quality control</title><p id="Par6">Metabolomic profiling of subjects was carried out by using LC-MS. A pooled plasma sample was prepared and the instrument was set to inject the pooled sample after every 15 plasma samples, thus the pooled sample had 4 readings (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). To quantify the precision of the measurements, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated between the 4 pooled samples based on the sum of the intensities in each sample and an RSD of 0.5% was obtained. The RSD was also calculated for each of the metabolites in the pooled samples and the highest RSD was for 38:6 glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (9.7%) while the lowest RSD was for alanine (0.23%). The precision of these values clearly indicates that any metabolomic differences between groups could not be due to instrumental factors alone.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>2D PCA score plot for QC (pooled) samples in healthy individuals.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par20">The clearest effect where insulin and hydrocortisone oppose each other is with regard to an effect on the metabolism of branched chain amino acids and their metabolites. High insulin significantly reduces the levels of leucine/isoleucine, valine (branched chain amino acids, BCAs) and their metabolites compared with low insulin (Example chromatograms shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S7</xref>). Increasing the level of HC infusion increases the levels of leucine/isoleucine and their metabolites irrespective of insulin dose. HC in the presence of the low insulin infusion also produces an increase in BCAs as the concentration of HC is increased and this is the strongest metabolic signature of HC action amongst all the significantly altered metabolites. This observation links to the role of BCAs in obesity and insulin resistance observed in the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Thus, in the current case, a similar effect is observed from a different perspective, where insulin directly lowers BCA levels significantly and HC opposes this effect. HC is known to promote breakdown of muscle proteins<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, while BCAs are known to promote production of muscle protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Insulin is known to promote production of muscle tissue and this would be consistent with an increased requirement for BCAs and hence a reduction of their circulating levels. BCAs may exert some beneficial effect in the treatment of insulin resistance associated with chronic liver disease. In a rat model with liver cirrhosis, BCAs improved glucose uptake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>; in rodents, BCAs improve glucose metabolism in hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and adipocytes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">We previously reported that free fatty acids were increased by high cortisol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, this current work highlights this effect with regards to poly unsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and is in opposition to the effect of insulin. Previously it was observed that omega-3/omega-6 PUFA levels increased in response to BCAs in two cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. In the current case, high insulin lowers the levels of PUFA and, irrespective of insulin, the highest HC dose increases levels of PUFA.</p><p id="Par22">The most comprehensive list of metabolites within a class that were affected by insulin are the free fatty acids (FFAs). Many FFAs are lowered by&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 by insulin infusion and effects are seen on fatty acids with chain lengths between C10 and C22. HC appears to act in an opposite manner to insulin by promoting higher levels of some FFAs in plasma. Presumably a relatively low level of HC is required to increase levels of FFAs and thus increasing the level of the HC infusion does not promote this process any further&#x02014;a reason why there was no significant difference between medium and high HC doses. Nevertheless, irrespective of insulin, which lowers the levels of FFAs, the effect on some fatty acids of increasing the level of HC in the infusion can be observed.</p><p id="Par23">Batch <italic>et al</italic>. also described the elevation of C3 and C5 acylcarnitines in obese compared with lean subjects and the elevation of these metabolites in rats fed a diet enriched with BCAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Insulin has a marked effect in lowering acyl carnitines. The most marked effect is in lowering decanoylcarnitine. HC does not have a marked effect on the levels of these metabolites, significantly increases the level of 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine. High HC also promotes a marked elevation of oleoylcarnitine. There is evidence that high levels of long chain fatty acids are toxic, promoting apoptosis via a mechanism involving caspase 2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Carnitine conjugation provides a means removing fatty acids from tissues<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par24">Tryptophan metabolism is regulated by glucocorticoids and insulin which regulate the enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase (TDO)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

Bordag <italic>et al</italic>. observed elevation of a number of tryptophan metabolites in plasma following dexamethasone treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. There is a link between tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway and purine metabolism. TDO has haem at its active centre and enzyme activity is regenerated by coupling with the superoxide anion. One of the major sources of superoxide in the body is from the action of xanthine oxidise which converts hypoxanthine via xanthine to uric acid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Elevated xanthine and hypoxanthine are associated with the high HC group and this could indicate an increase in xanthine oxidase leading to increased availability of the superoxide required to support TDO activity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par25">Finally, the other major alterations in response to HC are, as might be expected, in steroid metabolism. HC suppresses ACTH resulting in reduced adrenocortical secretion of precursor steroids which, in the presence of metyrapone, are diverted to adrenal androgens. This likely explains the reduction, with increasing HC, of androsterone glucuronide, a metabolite of adrenal androgens such as dehydroepiandrosterone, dihydrotestosterone or androstenedione; and of pregnenolone sulphate, a metabolic precursor of HC.</p><p id="Par26">Of course, metabolite changes detected in plasma are only an indirect indicator of the biochemical changes in target tissues for cortisol and insulin. The current study is limited to acute manipulations of insulin and cortisol, and may not be replicated with longer term manipulations. In these studies, a &#x02018;pancreatic clamp&#x02019; was employed, involving infusion of somatostatin and replacement with glucagon and growth hormone in addition to insulin infusion; different effects of insulin and cortisol might have been observed in the absence of the pancreatic clamp. Moreover, there may be a bias in metabolomic studies in favour of detecting changes in the most abundant, rather than the most biologically important metabolites. Of equal interest, however, is the pragmatic application of changes in metabolites as biomarkers to measure glucocorticoid or insulin action. For insulin, fasting plasma insulin/glucose ratios are the only non-invasive approach to determine insulin sensitivity, and classification of risk of type 2 diabetes could be enhanced by additional biomarkers. By combining 10 markers, we demonstrate high sensitivity to discriminate between high dose and low dose insulin infusion, but further tests in larger numbers will be required to test associations with physiological insulin action. For glucocorticoids, there are no reliable specific or sensitive biomarkers, since even measurement of plasma cortisol is subject to many caveats. We show that a combination of 10 markers has moderately high sensitivity to discriminate between low and high dose HC infusion, although the discrimination of medium dose infusion remained relatively poor (AUC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69). In related work it was found that 7 marker compounds were predictive of corticosteroid dose in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia undergoing hormone replacement therapy (paper submitted). It remains to be tested whether the markers discovered in the current study, in combination or alone, will be sensitive to physiological or pharmacological variation in cortisol action, and crucially whether they have specificity when compared with effects of obesity and other features which accompany glucocorticoid excess.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Chemicals and materials</title><p id="Par27">HPLC grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Fisher Scientific, UK.
