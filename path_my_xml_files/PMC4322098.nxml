The primary methods to minimise blood loss during middle ear surgery included mild head elevation of 15&#x000b0;, and infiltration or topical application of epinephrine (1: 50,000 or 1: 200,000). Currently, many inhalational or intravenous anaesthesia techniques were evaluated to offer ideal intra-operative conditions for middle ear surgery with their advantages and disadvantages.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Numerous pharmacological agents effectively lower the systemic blood pressure for hypotensive anaesthesia techniques. Sodium nitroprusside and nitroglycerine precisely control the blood pressure due to their rapid onset and short duration of action, but intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring and electrocardiogram (ECG) with S-T segment analysis are mandatory. An infusion of 10 - 20 &#x003bc;g/kg/h remifentanil is also useful but is associated with side effect of hyperalgesia.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine, a potent and selective &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptor agonist, is used as adjuvant to general anaesthesia during surgery at pre-operative state (sedation), intra-operative state (analgesia and hemodynamic stability) and during post-operative period (no respiratory depression). It is valuable because of its anaesthetic and analgesic-sparing effects with predictable and dose-dependent haemodynamic effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The present prospective double blind placebo control randomised study was aimed to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine infusion on the requirement of isoflurane concentration to lower systolic blood pressure below 30% of baseline values, quality of oligaemic surgical field, and awakening time in patients undergoing middle ear surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After approval from institutional Ethical Committee and written informed consent, 64 adult patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II of both genders, aged 18-58 years, weighing 45-65 kg, scheduled for elective middle ear surgery, were enrolled for this prospective double-blind placebo controlled randomised study. Exclusion criteria were presence of cardiac or respiratory disease, hypertension, obesity (body mass index &#x0003e; 26 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), hepatic or renal dysfunction, bleeding or coagulation disorders. Patients with a history of anticipated difficult airway, those on sedatives, hypnotics or antihypertensive medication or allergy to any anaesthetic medications were also excluded from the study. None of the patients had previous experience with general anaesthesia.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into two groups of 32 patients each by computer generated random table number. Patients of Group I received infusion of dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and patients of Group II received placebo infusion of normal saline during middle ear surgery after induction of anaesthesia till 20 min before completion of surgery. The study drug solution was prepared by an anaesthesiologist who was blinded to study protocol and was not involved for intra-operative data collection. The surgeon and resident anaesthetist were also blinded to the treatment regimen.</p><p>All patients were admitted prior to the day of the surgery, and fasting of 6 h was ensured. On arrival to the operation theatre, the baseline systemic blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and ECG were recorded. After establishing the intravenous line, lactate Ringer solution was started and they were pre-medicated with palonosetron (75 &#x003bc;g), glycopyrrolate (0.2 mg), midazolam (2 mg) and fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg), 15 min before induction of anaesthesia.</p><p>After pre-oxygenation for 3 min, anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg/kg) till loss of verbal command and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen and isoflurane dial concentration was titrated to achieve a systolic blood pressure 30% below the baseline values. Patients were mechanically ventilated to maintain the end-tidal concentration (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 30 and 35 mm Hg.</p><p>Intra-operatively, the heart rate, arterial blood pressure, ECG, EtCO<sub>2</sub> and peripheral pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were monitored and recorded at 5 min intervals till end of surgery. Concentration of isoflurane was recorded in percentage every 15 min till conclusion of surgery. Hypotension was treated by decreasing the dial concentration of isoflurane or rate of infusion and bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine.</p><p>During procedure the bleeding at surgical site was assessed by the surgeon as Grade 0-no bleeding-excellent surgical conditions; Grade I-minimum bleeding, sporadic suction needed; Grade II-diffuse bleeding, repeated suction needed; and Grade III-considerable, troublesome bleeding, and continuous suction was needed.</p><p>After surgery, the residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) and glycopyrrolate (0.008 mg/kg). Patients were extubated after observing adequate motor recovery and spontaneous breathing efforts. Awakening time following reversal of neuromuscular blockade was recorded. This duration of awakening time comprised from administration of reversal of neuromuscular blockade till sustained eye opening on command.</p><p>Patients were transferred to post-anaesthesia care unit for observation of any respiratory depression, haemodynamic changes, nausea/vomiting or any other drug-induced side-effects or complications.</p><p>The sample size was based on previous studies in which 28 patients were required to detect 20% decrease in bleeding in the dexmedetomidine group with type 1 error of 0.01 and power of 90%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Assuming 5% drop out rate, the final sample size was set at 64 patients. The recorded data were tabulated and expressed in mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and Stat graphics Centurion<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for windows. The demographic data for categorical variables were compared using Chi-square test and statistical significance in time related variables were analysed using Student's t-test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The present study evaluated the clinical effects of dexmedetomidine infusion during middle ear surgery using operating microscope under general anaesthesia. It was successfully completed on 64 adult consenting patients, and all patients were included in the data analysis.

In the present study, the dexmedetomidine infusion was used to produce oligaemic surgical field during middle ear surgery using operating microscope. It is evident from the study that the patient receiving dexmedetomidine infusion has oligaemic surgical field and better visibility when compared to patient receiving placebo. These findings can be attributed to the fact that dexmedetomidine reduces sympathetic activity, resulting in lower blood pressure and reduced heart rate thereby decreasing blood loss at the surgical site to improve the quality of the surgical field.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective &#x003b1;2 adrenergic agonist and used as adjuvant in anaesthesia to reduce the intra-operative anaesthetic and analgesic requirement. It regulates the autonomic and cardiovascular systems by acting on blood vessels and inhibiting norepinephrine release at sympathetic terminals, thereby attenuating the heart rate and blood pressure responses to intra-operative stressful events of anaesthesia. It effectively minimises the surgical blood loss and improves the surgical field visibility. Its haemodynamic effects are predictable and dose-dependent.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Currently, many inhalational or intravenous anaesthesia techniques were evaluated to offer ideal intra-operative conditions for middle ear surgery. Jellish <italic>et al</italic>. judged that the intravenous anaesthesia technique provided better haemodynamic control, less movement, and faster emergence during middle ear surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Short acting inhalational anaesthetics such as desflurane and isoflurane produced excellent operating conditions for otological surgery.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Even small amount of blood can obscure the microscopic operating field and decreasing the extravasation of blood may improve the results of surgical procedures. Different techniques, to minimise intra-operative blood loss during middle ear surgery are used. The conventional techniques of electively lowering the blood pressure are positive pressure ventilation and administration of hypotensive drugs.</p><p>In the study of Bekker <italic>et al</italic>., patients received an initial loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and they determined that intra-operative dexmedetomidine infusion was effective for blunting the perioperative haemodynamic responses with no incidence of hypotension or bradycardia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our present study was in accordance with their study as all patients were haemodynamically stable, and none of them required vasopressor support or bolus administration of fluid to maintain haemodynamic status.</p><p>A meta-analysis of previous studies showed that the incidence of bradycardia requiring intervention was increased when maintenance dosages of dexmedetomidine were used in excess of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. In our study, no patients suffered from bradycardia as dexmedetomidine infusion was given in dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and loading dose of dexmedetomidine was not given.</p><p>The result of the present study indicates that the use of dexmedetomidine infusion reduced the percentage of isoflurane concentration to maintain a systolic blood pressure 30% below baseline values. These findings confirm with a previous study of Khan <italic>et al</italic>. which also showed that use of dexmedetomidine reduces the requirement of inhalational anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Aho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Aantaa <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported a reduction of isoflurane requirement in their study, thus confirm the synergism between isoflurane and dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine was well tolerated, and none of the patients developed any drug-related side-effects or complications in the perioperative period. The dexmedetomidine infusion did not affect the awakening time or delay the recovery from anaesthesia.</p><p>Coughing on the tracheal tube during awakening will increase venous pressure and may cause post-operative bleeding, so deep extubation with sooth recovery is preferable. Guler <italic>et al</italic>. found that the increase in blood pressure and heart rate during extubation is decreased, and the quality of extubation is improved by dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Our findings were in accordance to their study.</p><p>Ebert <italic>et al</italic>. did not observe any apnoea, airway obstruction and hypoxemia with bolus doses of dexmedetomidine in their study, and they reported that the depression of respiration may be seen due to deep sedation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In our study, none of the patients suffered from respiratory depression as we did not use dexmedetomidine in high doses.</p><p>Ear surgery may cause post-operative dizziness (vertigo), nausea and vomiting as inner ear is intimately involved with a sense of balance. Induction with propofol decreases the post-operative nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing middle ear surgery. Prophylaxis with palonosetron, a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor blocker in premedication was considered for the present study and none of the patients suffered from post-operative nausea and vomiting.</p><p>During surgery, middle ear is open to the atmosphere, and there is no pressure build up. Once the tympanic membrane graft is placed, the middle ear becomes a closed space. If nitrous oxide is allowed to diffuse into this space, middle ear pressure will rise and may interfere with tympanic membrane reconstruction. Therefore, nitrous oxide is either entirely avoided or discontinued prior to graft placement. Withdrawing nitrous oxide 10&#x02013;20 min before placement of graft is the usual technique used in our institution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine infusion was safe to provide oligaemic surgical field for better visualisation under operating microscope for middle ear surgery keeping the haemodynamic variations within the physiological range. It also reduced the requirement of isoflurane and recovery from anaesthesia was complete and smooth.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
