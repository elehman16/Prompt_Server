There is a critical need for a vaccine that can provide greater and more-consistent protection against tuberculosis than that offered by the only licensed vaccine, bacille Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG). This is especially important in an era that sees an estimated 9.0 million incident tuberculosis cases and 1.5 million tuberculosis-related deaths each year, exacerbated by an increasing burden of antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="JIV482C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The lack of reliable and validated immunological correlates of protection hampers the development of tuberculosis vaccines. In the absence of measureable markers to predict candidate vaccine effectiveness, the field has so far relied on animal challenge models and in vitro functional assays that assess the ability of a vaccine to inhibit mycobacterial growth (such as the mycobacterial growth indicator tube [MGIT] [<xref rid="JIV482C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). It is unclear how reliably these models forecast in vivo human efficacy. Selecting the best or most-appropriate candidate tuberculosis vaccines for further investment, research, and development is difficult. A safe and relevant mycobacterial human challenge model to allow more-rapid early assessment of candidate tuberculosis vaccines could be a game changer.</p><p>In general, large and expensive phase 2b and 3 field efficacy trials are required to demonstrate whether safety and immunogenicity results from small phase 1 trials translate into an impact on overall disease burden. Developers of vaccines, including those targeting pathogens responsible for malaria and typhoid [<xref rid="JIV482C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="JIV482C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], have adopted human challenge models to more quickly and inexpensively assess vaccine effectiveness, helping to rationalize which vaccines progress to field efficacy trials. Successful use of human challenge studies has accelerated advancement in these vaccine development pipelines. Safety and ethical reasons preclude the use of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in a human mycobacterial challenge model.</p><p>We have evaluated an alternative approach: the <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG challenge model. The model is based on the hypothesis that a tuberculosis vaccine that successfully reduces replication of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> should also reduce BCG replication. BCG is a potentially useful surrogate of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> for a challenge model. Years of use as a licensed vaccine verify its good safety record [<xref rid="JIV482C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="JIV482C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. BCG, when administered intradermally, causes a self-contained and limited infection. Importantly, the CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell mediated immune responses elicited by both mycobacteria are very similar [<xref rid="JIV482C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although there are some <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> antigens not present in BCG, which, if selected as tuberculosis vaccine candidates, would not be expected to have an impact on BCG replication, the optimization of a BCG human challenge model can still establish the clinical parameters for subsequent challenge models using attenuated <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> strains. We previously demonstrated that BCG-vaccinated mice that were later challenged with intradermal BCG had suppressed mycobacterial growth that mimicked observations following intranasal <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> challenge, suggesting that a skin mycobacterial challenge may adequately reflect a vaccine effect in the lung [<xref rid="JIV482C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>We have recently applied this BCG challenge model to humans. Our pilot study of a human BCG challenge model demonstrated that the degree of growth suppression of BCG can be measured in a punch biopsy specimen the skin from the challenge site where BCG was intradermally administered. We showed that the live mycobacterial load can be quantified up to 1 month after challenge [<xref rid="JIV482C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>We found that the model can distinguish between BCG-naive and BCG-vaccinated groups [<xref rid="JIV482C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], suggesting that prior BCG vaccination gives some protection against a subsequent challenge dose, in a population in which BCG has been shown to be protective [<xref rid="JIV482C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We have also assessed this BCG challenge model in individuals administered the candidate vaccine MVA85A [<xref rid="JIV482C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. We found that MVA85A receipt prior to BCG challenge had no effect on the subsequent recovery of BCG, a finding that may be consistent with the results of the recent infant MVA85A efficacy trial or, alternatively, a reflection of the limitations in the model's sensitivity to date [<xref rid="JIV482C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="JIV482C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, a major limitation of the model to date has been low mycobacterial readouts that approached the lower limit of detection, reducing both the sensitivity and ability to detect inter-individual variation in BCG suppression [<xref rid="JIV482C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we evaluated the effect of both BCG strain and dose on subsequent mycobacterial recovery, with a view to improving model sensitivity and the ability to discriminate between individuals with differing levels of vaccine-induced antimycobacterial immunity. We compare the use of 2 licensed strains of BCG at 2 different doses, to select the most-suitable conditions for BCG challenge for the future testing of tuberculosis vaccine efficacy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>We undertook a controlled human challenge study using 2 different licensed strains of BCG at standard dose or high dose (defined as 3 times the standard dose). This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice. The National Research Ethics Service South Central&#x02013;Oxford B research ethics committee reviewed and approved the study (REC reference 14/SC/0036). We conducted this study at 2 trial sites, recruiting volunteers at the Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Oxford, and the National Institute for Health Research Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Birmingham (clinical trials registration NCT02088892).</p><p>All 41 volunteers gave written informed consent before participation. We initially recruited 40 BCG-naive volunteers (groups A&#x02013;D). One volunteer was excluded following challenge and replaced, yielding 40 volunteers for analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV482F1">1</xref>).

We allocated volunteers into 4 groups: standard-dose BCG SSI (group A), standard-dose BCG TICE (group B), high-dose BCG SSI (group C), and high-dose BCG TICE (group D). Because there was no perceived benefit to blinding, for logistical reasons volunteers were allocated to groups, with as many volunteers as possible allocated to the same group on a given day. Once groups A and B were fully enrolled, volunteers were allocated to groups C and D. In each of groups C and D, a 2-week window elapsed between the challenge of the first and second volunteers and between the second and subsequent volunteers, to permit the detection of any unexpected adverse events associated with high-dose BCG.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Challenge and Follow-up</title><p>Volunteers were challenged intradermally with an injection of BCG (0.15 mL) into the upper arm.

The challenge dose was confirmed by plating serial dilutions of a 100-&#x000b5;L aliquot of the BCG strain onto solid Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Appleton Woods).</p><p>After challenge, we followed up all volunteers for 1 month, with clinic visits on days 2, 7, 14, and 28 after BCG challenge. On day 14, the volunteers underwent punch biopsy of the challenge site. Blood samples were collected at days 0, 2, 7, and 14, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated and cryopreserved.</p><p>We obtained data on the incidence of solicited and unsolicited local (challenge site) and systemic adverse events, reported by volunteers on diary cards for 14 days after BCG challenge, and by direct questioning at clinic follow-up appointments on days 2, 7, and 14. Challenge sites were assessed for local reactions, and vital signs were recorded. The day 28 follow-up was for clinical review of the BCG challenge and biopsy site. Adverse events were assessed by the trial investigators to determine their relationship to BCG challenge. These adverse events were classified as unrelated, possibly related, probably related, or definitely related to BCG challenge.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Skin Biopsies</title><p>We performed the punch biopsy using a sterile technique with a standard 4-mm punch (Stiefel); 0.5&#x02013;3.4 mL of 1% lignocaine was infiltrated subcutaneously.

All participants developed an expected local inflammatory reaction, regardless of which dose and strain they were administered. Local adverse events were comparable between groups and were generally mild. There was no difference between the diameter of redness or swelling across the different groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV482F2">2</xref>). When visually assessing the photographed challenge sites, a blinded clinician was unable to correlate severity of local reaction to challenge group. The majority of reported systemic adverse events were mild, and the mean number of systemic adverse events per person did not differ significantly between groups. The proportion of volunteers who experienced at least 1 systemic adverse event related to vaccination was broadly similar between groups: 6 of 10 volunteers in group A, 2 of 10 in group B, 5 of 10 in group C, and 7 of 10 in group D (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="JIV482TB2">2</xref>). Although 6 volunteers (2 in each of groups A, C, and D) reported feelings of feverishness, only 1 of these volunteers, who was in group C, had a documented increase in temperature that was deemed related to challenge (38.6&#x000b0;C on day 2 and 37.8&#x000b0;C on day 10). No serious adverse events occurred.

There was no difference in the number of BCG recovered between the groups who received the same challenge dose; that is, there was no difference between groups A and B or C and D and therefore no difference in number recovered between strains of BCG. However, the number of BCG detected in the high-dose groups (C and D) was significantly greater than that detected in the low-dose groups, by both methods of quantification (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05, by the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="JIV482F3">3</xref>).

This has enabled us to select the most suitable combination of BCG dose and strain for the future use of the model.</p><p>In the challenge site skin biopsy specimens, significantly higher numbers of BCG were detected in the higher-dose groups, compared with the standard-dose groups, and the spread of detectable BCG was much greater. With regard to strain, there was no significant difference between the number of BCG detected between the high-dose SSI group and the high-dose TICE group.</p><p>Clinically, the adverse event profiles of all 4 challenge groups were acceptable, and there were no safety concerns from administering a higher dose of BCG in comparison to the standard dose of BCG administered in routine vaccination.</p><p>For future studies with this model, use of a high challenge dose would provide increased sensitivity to detect a difference between groups of volunteers who have different levels of vaccine-induced mycobacterial immunity, and so we conclude that a high dose of either strain would be acceptable for use in further studies.</p><p>Practical reasons favor the future use of high-dose SSI over high-dose TICE. BCG SSI is licensed for intradermal administration in the United Kingdom, and preparation of the vaccine for challenge is more straightforward, with less wastage of the product in comparison to BCG TICE, which requires a significant amount of dilution. Furthermore, we found that high-dose BCG SSI had less variability in dose across vials than high-dose BCG TICE across vials (the volunteers in group D tended to receive the greatest range of BCG dose, with a 10-fold difference between the lowest and highest dose given in the group). For future head-to-head testing of candidate vaccines with this model, we plan to challenge the same number of volunteers from each vaccine group with BCG from the same vial, to ensure as much standardization of challenge dose as possible.</p><p>Ex vivo IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses to PPD 2 weeks after challenge showed a trend toward an inverse correlation between the number of BCG detected in the skin biopsy specimens by qPCR and the number of CFU, consistent with our previous findings with this model [<xref rid="JIV482C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This suggests that higher antigen specific T-cell responses lead to lower levels of BCG at the challenge site and demonstrates the utility of this model to facilitate the identification of potential immune correlates, which can be evaluated in field efficacy trials.</p><p>This skin BCG challenge model is also being tested and optimized for use in nonhuman primates (Harris et al unpublished data) and cattle [<xref rid="JIV482C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An established BCG challenge model in these species would overcome the need for limited biosafety level 3 containment facilities required for virulent <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> challenge. Furthermore, parallel skin BCG and lung <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> challenge experiments in preclinical animal models can provide some validation of detection of a vaccine effect in the skin BCG challenge approach in human clinical trials.</p><p>Looking forward, we plan to use this optimized high dose BCG SSI challenge model to evaluate novel tuberculosis vaccine candidates. This model has utility to streamline the selection of which vaccines progress onto efficacy trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/infdis/jiv482/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <uri xlink:href="http://jid.oxfordjournals.org">http://jid.oxfordjournals.org</uri>.
