There is a paucity of interventions with the aim of obesity prevention in preschool-age children in the UK. Previous research has demonstrated some positive results in changing specific health behaviours, however, positive trends in overall obesity rates are lacking. Preschool settings may provide valuable opportunities to access children and their families not only for promoting healthy lifestyles, but also to develop and evaluate behaviour-change interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This paper presents a cluster randomised feasibility study of a theory based behaviour-change preschool practitioner-led intervention tested in four preschool centres in the North East of England. The primary outcome measures were to test the acceptability and feasibility of the data collection measures and intervention. Secondary measures were collected and reported for extra information. At baseline and post intervention, children&#x02019;s anthropometric, dietary and physical activity measures as well as family &#x02018;active&#x02019; time data were collected. The preschool practitioner-led intervention included family intervention tasks such as &#x02018;family goal-setting activities&#x02019; and &#x02018;cooking challenges&#x02019;. Preschool activities included increasing physical activity and providing activities with the potential to change behaviour with increased knowledge of and acceptance of healthy eating. The process evaluation was an on-going monthly process and was collected in multiple forms such as questionnaires, photographs and verbal feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>&#x02018;Gatekeeper&#x02019; permission and lower-hierarchal adherence were initially a problem for recruitment and methods acceptance. However, at intervention end the preschool teachers and parents stated they found most intervention methods and activities acceptable, and some positive changes in family health behaviours were reported. However, the preschool centres appeared to have difficulties with enforcing everyday school healthy eating policies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from the current study may have implications for nursery practitioners, nursery settings, Local Educational Authorities and policy makers, and contributes to the body of literature. However, further work with preschool practitioners is required to determine how personal attitudes and school policy application can be supported to implement successfully such an intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

Globally, in 2010 the number of overweight children under the age of five, was estimated to be over 42 million [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] Overweight 2- to 5&#x000a0;year-olds are at least four times more likely to become overweight adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and disadvantaged members of the population may be more vulnerable to societal effects which may lead to obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The development of childhood obesity is multifaceted as demonstrated by the Foresight obesity segmented map for children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Long-term health risks of overweight and obesity include: obesity persistence; cardiovascular risk factors; stroke; gall bladder disease; diabetes; fatty liver disease; and some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is proposed that &#x02018;early childhood provides a unique opportunity within which to establish lifestyle behaviours that will promote health and minimise the risk of development of fatness&#x02019; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], p. 328). A number of influential independent reviews commissioned by the UK government have highlighted the importance of early intervention and support for families with young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. As part of a 2007 UK government strategy in an attempt to reverse the obesity trend, a Public Service Agreement (PSA) aiming to improve the health and wellbeing of children and young people was established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This aims to reduce the percentage of obese and overweight children to the year 2000 levels by 2020 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The UK has become the highest spender on early years services (preschool &#x02013; before formal education) in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In 2015 94% of 3-year olds and 99% of 4-year olds benefited from some form of free early education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] at government maintained schools or in the private, voluntary or independent sector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It follows then, that preschool settings may provide valuable opportunities to access children and their families not only for promoting healthy lifestyles, but also to develop and evaluate behaviour-change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Commission on Ending Childhood Obesity reported that progress in tackling childhood obesity had been slow and inconsistent and the preschool years have been highlighted as a critical period for obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Early years providers in England follow the mandatory &#x02018;Framework for the Early Years Foundation Stage&#x02019; (EYFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. One component of which is &#x02018;Physical development&#x02019;, in which &#x02018;Children must be helped to understand the importance of physical activity, and to make healthy choices in relation to food&#x02019; ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] p. 8). Therefore, an intervention with the aim of preventing obesity and improving family lifestyle choices which builds on these guidelines should be within the remit of a preschool setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, curriculum-based interventions rely on the motivation, training of staff and on their ability to deliver the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>There is a paucity of interventions targeting children in preschool settings in the UK and component descriptions are limited. Reviews of interventions to prevent obesity in preschool children suggest that behaviours thought to contribute to obesity (such as sedentary behaviour) may be positively influenced in preschool settings and that there was great scope for improving physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. One such study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] demonstrated increased structured PA in the daily preschool curriculum and an improvement in the children&#x02019;s motor skills by incorporating daily 10&#x000a0;min structured practitioner-led activities. Furthermore, parents&#x02019; ability to act upon their children&#x02019;s developing food choices/preferences and attitudes, through their own modelling behaviours is a powerful educational tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The main social influences (subjective norms) on physical activity and eating are reported to be parents and teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This belief is echoed in a review conducted by Skouteris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] which looked at parental influence in preschool interventions, they concluded that there was a need for interventions which target strategies and techniques to aid parents in modifying their child&#x02019;s diet and physical activity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, further &#x02018;practice-based&#x02019; evidence is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, several methodological limitations in reviewed studies have been reported such as lack of theoretical frameworks and objective behavioural measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It is important to identify appropriate behaviour change techniques in an intervention as without standardised definitions of the techniques, it would be difficult to replicate effective interventions and to identify techniques contributing to effectiveness across interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Moreover, it has been reported that conducting research in school environments can be challenging, with complex multi access issues that need to be addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Further research which is sensitive to the needs of preschool settings&#x02019; and parents&#x02019; environmental mechanisms is required to determine which factors and methods are most effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The Study of Kids in Preschool (SKIP) was a feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] cluster randomised study of a health behaviour-change, preschool teacher/practitioner-led intervention focusing on diet, physical activity and sedentary behaviours. The aim was to determine which methods, tasks and activities were acceptable to preschool teachers, practitioners and families with children aged 3&#x02013;4 years. In the UK, preschool or nursery practitioners (NP) are also known as nursery nurses, nursery workers or early year&#x02019;s educators. To avoid confusion, from this point they will be referred as NPs unless specifically referring to preschool teachers who have an additional teaching qualification and usually undertake a lead role in the centre. This paper presents a cluster randomised feasibility study of a theory based behaviour-change preschool practitioner-led intervention conducted in four preschool centres in the North East of England.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>A cluster randomised feasibility trial. Four local government preschool centres associated with primary schools in the North East of England consented to participate and were randomised to either intervention or wait list control. See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the Consort flow diagram which illustrates the numbers recruited, randomised, lost to follow-up and numbers for analysis. Two preschool centres received the intervention and the two control schools were placed on the wait list. Delivering a refined, delayed intervention provides an incentive for the wait list control preschools to participate, because instead of just providing control data, they later receive a refined intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. All four preschools were located in 10% of the most deprived locations of the region. In order to reduce selection bias the preschools were allocated to intervention or wait list control by a computerised programme by the Newcastle University Clinical Trials Unit.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the recruitment and analysis process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2017_4167_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>The main focus for this study was preschool children aged 3&#x02013;5 years which local government preschools (nursery schools or nursery classes &#x02013; henceforth reported as preschools) specifically cater for. It has been reported that families from a disadvantaged background are more likely to access preschool provision in these types of settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Therefore, the key inclusion criteria was any family with a preschool child (3&#x02013;5 years) who attended a local government preschool centre (as described above).</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Preschools</title><p>A convenience sampling strategy was employed to recruit preschools to the intervention. Forty preschools associated with primary schools were contacted by letter with a follow-up telephone call; head-teachers in four preschools consented to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Families</title><p>Information letters were disseminated to all parents (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;121) via the four preschool centres by staff. It was felt that face-to-face recruitment may prove effective and would give parents the opportunity to ask questions. Therefore &#x02018;recruitment days&#x02019; were organised for each school. The researcher arranged to be present at the preschool when parents dropped off or collected their child; this was to provide further explanation about the study and to invite parents to participate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention development</title><p>A primary qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which was conducted prior to this study, questioned parents and preschool centre staff of their views and knowledge of healthy eating promotion in preschool settings and informed the main goals and aims of the intervention. It was concluded that family friendly healthy eating strategies and activities should be developed and delivered in preschool settings in a manner that is sensitive to parents&#x02019; needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Preschool staff shared ideas and strategies for engaging parents and children.</p><p>The main goals of the intervention were to increase physical activity and healthy eating behaviours. The specific aims were distinct but complementary for the two contexts involved: preschool and family. For the preschool setting the specific aim was to increase physical activity. For the family setting the aims were to reduce TV viewing and increase family &#x02018;active time&#x02019;. For both settings the aims were to: a) reduce the consumption of high energy dense snacks, and; b) increase the consumption and the awareness of the importance of a &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; breakfast.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Theoretical background</title><p>Two behaviour change models which were identified as good frameworks for intervention development were: The Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and Operant Conditioning (OC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. SCT acknowledges the role of &#x02018;modelling&#x02019; and contextual &#x02018;availability&#x02019; as key in influencing a child&#x02019;s dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; especially in younger children who are potentially less influenced by peer pressure and more influenced by parent and teacher behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. &#x02018;Goal setting&#x02019; has demonstrated some success in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] and helps people set their goals in motion in accordance with values, priorities and commitment to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Using behaviour change techniques such as &#x02018;prompt specific goal setting&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] was considered to be an appropriate method to support parental behaviour change. OC theory and Social Learning Theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] uses reinforcement as one of the means of changing behaviour. Given that we are aiming at families with preschool-aged children, OC model seems suitable to support parents and NP in implementing changes with children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In order to promote children&#x02019;s engagement with healthy eating and physical activity, positive reinforcement strategies were used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> describes the behaviour change techniques (BCT) used in this intervention, based on the CALO-RE Taxonomy of behaviour change techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] as well as the targeted theoretical constructs (e.g., self-efficacy), implementation procedures (e.g., model/demonstrate behaviours), materials (e.g., parent information sheets) and intervention providers (e.g., preschool staff members). It is important to use specific BCTs that target hypothesised change mechanisms (based on the aforementioned theories) and that target in this case, both individual as well as environmental mechanisms.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Behaviour change techniques, target variables, intervention procedures materials and providers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Behaviour change technique</th><th>Target Variable (IP: individual predictors; EF: environmental factors)</th><th>Procedures, Materials and Providers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Goal setting</td><td>IP: Outcome expectations, goals, self-efficacy<break/>EF: Environmental cues, barriers, access</td><td>Formulation of specific plans of how to reduce unhealthy snacking; increase healthy breakfast consumption, reduce TV viewing and increase family active time.

The ultimate target of the proposed intervention was the child whilst acknowledging that in order to reach the child, the intervention would need to act via preschool staff and parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The intervention followed a detailed manual.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Alongside the manual, preschool staff were invited to attend a 1&#x000a0;h intervention training session. This was led by the main author. The staff members were led through a series of interactive scenarios relating to: a) parenting styles &#x02013; staff were shown photographs of parents demonstrating different types of parenting styles and were asked to discuss best practice and encouragement of optimum styles, b) working with parents &#x02013; how to interact with parents using the Family Partnership Model, c) behaviour change techniques &#x02013; how to encourage parents to set and monitor goals and, d) implementation of the intervention modules &#x02013; how the modules could be implemented in their own setting. During the 5&#x000a0;months of the intervention period the main researcher visited each preschool centre once a month for approximately 30&#x02013;60 min to discuss intervention procedures and techniques with preschool staff in preparation for each module.</p><p>The intervention titled: &#x02018;Study of Kids in Preschool&#x02019; (SKIP) consisted of five monthly modules (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) plus an introductory session for parents. The five monthly preschool-based sessions targeted the child and aimed at increasing physical activity, knowledge of and prompting of healthy eating. Active BCTs delivered by the preschool staff provided information on modelling and demonstrating behaviour, prompting practice and providing instruction on how to perform the behaviour.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Monthly intervention activities for preschool staff, parents and children</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Month</th><th>Module title</th><th>Activities led by NPs</th><th>Activities led by and for parents</th><th>Activities for children</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Introductory session</td><td>Meet with parents (reflection and goal-setting &#x02013; group or individual)<break/>Activities with children</td><td>Analysing self-monitoring diary and goal setting (consented parents)<break/>Information sheets &#x02013; &#x02018;Activity Tips and Eating Well for 3&#x02013;5 year olds&#x02019;</td><td>Fruit tasting sessions<break/>Learning a new song &#x02013; &#x02018;Apples and Bananas&#x02019;<break/>Healthy meals and physical activity with parents</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Five-a-day and Portion sizes</td><td>Monthly parent meetings<break/>Activities with children<break/>Update notice board</td><td>Reflection and monitoring of goals (consented parents)<break/>Information sheets- Snack tips, Five-a-day tips, portion size advice, snack and breakfast ideas, activity tips.<break/>Monthly challenges &#x02013; The Carrot Challenge, No TV day, Our family achievement sheet, Our family reward chart</td><td>Rope and playground games<break/>Make &#x02018;No TV&#x02019; signs<break/>Think of activities to do instead of watching TV<break/>Snack and art activities with carrots<break/>The Carrot challenge cooking activity with parents<break/>Physical activities with parents<break/>Learning a new song &#x02013; &#x02018;The Good Food Song&#x02019;</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Active Play</td><td>Monthly parent meetings<break/>Activities with children<break/>Update notice board</td><td>Reflection and monitoring of goals (consented parents) Information sheets &#x02013; Meal times and drink facts, Snack and breakfast ideas, Active play<break/>Monthly challenges &#x02013; The Apple Challenge, NO TV for 2&#x000a0;days, Family active challenge, Our family achievement sheet, Our family reward chart</td><td>Playground games and rope skills<break/>Learning about the importance of breakfast<break/>No TV signs and alternative activity ideas<break/>The Apple Challenge cooking activity with parents<break/>Physical activities with parents<break/>Activities with apples<break/>Learning a new song &#x02013; &#x02018;Round the Apple Tree&#x02019;</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Vegetable Tasters</td><td>Monthly parent meetings<break/>Activities with children<break/>Update notice board</td><td>Reflection and monitoring of goals (consented parents)<break/>Relapse prevention and coping strategies<break/>Information sheets &#x02013; My child doesn&#x02019;t like vegetables, Snack and breakfast ideas, Rainy day activities<break/>Monthly challenges &#x02013; The Broccoli Challenge, No TV for 3&#x000a0;days, Family active challenge, Our family achievement sheet, Our family reward chart</td><td>Family activity ideas<break/>No TV ideas<break/>Activities with broccoli and vegetable tasting sessions<break/>The Broccoli Challenge cooking activity with parents<break/>Physical activities with parents<break/>Learning a new song &#x02013; &#x02018;Oh do you eat your vegetables?&#x02019;</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Go Bananas!</td><td>Monthly parent meetings<break/>Activities with children<break/>Update notice board</td><td>Reflection and monitoring of goals (consented parents)<break/>Information sheets &#x02013; Snack swaps, Snack and breakfast ideas, Make walks interesting<break/>Monthly challenges &#x02013; The Banana Challenge, NO TV for 5&#x000a0;days, Family activity challenge, Our family achievement sheet, Our family reward chart</td><td>Ideas for no TV<break/>Activities with bananas<break/>End of programme preschool party &#x02013; with fruit skewers<break/>The Banana Challenge cooking activity with parents<break/>Physical activities with parents<break/>Learning a new song &#x02018;Buy me a banana&#x02019;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

These newsletters provided dietary and physical activity information and tips for home-based tasks to increase physical activity and healthy eating and decrease screen time. Active BCTs distributed via the newsletters were self-monitoring of behaviour, goal setting, action planning and coping planning.</p><p>Parents were asked to meet with preschool staff members once a month to set goals, monitor and review family health behaviour using written materials provided within the newsletters. The families were encouraged to share ideas, achievements, photographs and drawings of activities on a communal preschool information board. Home-based tasks included family cooking and tasting, &#x02018;No TV day&#x02019; and increasing family &#x02018;active time&#x02019; challenges. Preschool staff were given the choice of organising the monthly staff/parent meetings using an individual or group-based setting; this allowed each centre to tailor the mode of delivery according to preschool resources and parental preferences.</p><p>Preschool staff attended an intervention training session at the university or at their place of work and the intervention was delivered by preschool staff to all children.

Consent for the preschool to participate was granted by a senior member of staff such as the head-teacher or assistant head-teacher.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Staff members</title><p>The level of consultation which took place between senior staff and nursery practitioners in relation to participation in the intervention is not known. Some staff members appeared uncertain about their involvement and what was expected of them. They tended to avoid corresponding with the parents about the intervention and left all communication to the class teacher and/or researcher, especially during the parent recruitment sessions. The findings from this study corroborates other studies in that despite having commitment to a project from &#x02018;gatekeepers&#x02019; such as head teachers, this does not necessarily transfer to those who are working at ground level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. It is not sufficient to have the permission of &#x02018;gatekeepers&#x02019; to implement a study but all members of staff need to feel included in the development and potential deployment of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] if this is to be successful. An example of this is highlighted in a study with preschool staff in Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The Norwegian staff expressed some feelings of unease with the intervention and it was concluded that the staff needed more groundwork preparation and an indication of potential gains in participating. The teachers in the SKIP study were active and enthusiastic, however, it was challenging trying to engage with the nursery practitioners. Moreover, the nursery practitioners were reluctant to attend the training session out-with work hours. Recent work by De Silva et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] in Australia highlights the importance of providing preschool staff with support to develop and implement policies. Furthermore, positive and consistent reinforcement for preschool practitioners during an intervention may enhance morale and increase the likelihood of adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Finally, if all staff are to participate in the delivery of the intervention, protected time needs to be allocated for their training needs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Parents</title><p>Better practitioner engagement with the intervention may have transferred to the parents. It was difficult to know for certain why the parental recruitment rate (30%) was so low. Recruiting participants to engage in a research project is considered to be the most challenging aspect of the research process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. As identified in Social Marketing literature, it is important that potential participants in an intervention have a &#x02018;reason to care&#x02019; and feel ready for change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Thinking about the refinement of the procedures we conclude that an initial joint meeting involving research staff, all preschool staff members and parents may remove some of the uncertainty and mystery of participation. In addition, engaging parents/families in relevant &#x02018;fun&#x02019; activities, such as the cooking activities, prior to recruitment may be beneficial and a fun way to introduce them to the study. Many parents who declined to sign-up to the SKIP study cited lack of time; however, if the intervention/topic &#x02018;spoke&#x02019; to them, this possibly would not have been a deterrent.</p><p>As a result of the low recruitment rate for this study a sample size calculation for a potential main trial cannot be made. What we have learned from this feasibility and acceptability study will allow us to refine trial and intervention procedures. With this refined protocol the aim is to run a pilot study with at least 35 participants in each group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. The barriers and potential problem-solving strategies we have highlighted following the analysis of the data from this study will assist with recruitment to a future pilot trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>Parental compliance with the data collection tasks was mixed; the parents were most likely to complete the food and TV diaries. One mother commented that she kept the camera and physical activity monitor out of her children&#x02019;s reach (she had 5 children) for fear of them being damaged. At follow-up there was an increase in the number of families not completing any tasks, parents gave no other specific reasons for failing to complete the baseline measurements; therefore it was difficult to determine why the repeat measurements induced further levels of attrition. It simply may have been a decline in the novelty factor of taking part. The use of digital cameras to record dietary intake proved successful with many of the families and has previously been trialled in several studies with older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. This study demonstrates that photography may be a tool suitable for use in younger children also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The findings from the secondary outcome measures were consistent with other studies. Twenty-three per cent of the sample were classified as overweight or obese. The national percentage of overweight and obesity in reception age children (4/5&#x000a0;year-olds) from the 2010/11 National Childhood Measurement Programme (NCMP) data was 22.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Not only is there evidence that childhood overweight and obesity can be linked with numerous long-term and immediate health risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] but there is also an association between overweight and a lower self-concept (how one perceives themselves) in girls as young as 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Therefore, preschool aged children may already be at increased risk of negative psychological impacts of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p>On average all the children failed to reach the recommended 180&#x000a0;min of MVPA per day. This was in line with other studies which have reported very low levels of physical activity in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that preschool settings may have great scope for improving physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Parents of young children have reported that although they feel responsible for their child&#x02019;s diet, they were less decisive about PA and relied on school/preschool staff to ensure their child was adequately active [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. The 2009 NICE guidelines for promoting physical activity for children and young people, recommend that families should be given physical activity &#x02018;homework activities&#x02019; which children and parents/carers can do together [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].</p><p>It was reported that on average all the children watched more than 3&#x000a0;h of TV a day. This finding is of concern as it has been reported that children who watch more than 2&#x000a0;h per day of TV consume less fruit and vegetables, more high energy drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and have a higher consumption of calorie rich &#x02018;unhealthy&#x02019; food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. However, as BMI and TV viewing may not be associated until the child is 7&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]; this emphasises the importance of reducing sedentary behaviours in younger children. Although the impact on weight status may not be apparent until they are older, the learned behaviours can become habitual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Therefore, it is of great importance that parents and NPs are made aware of the current viewing habits of young children and the possible long-term impact on their health.</p><p>The nutrient intake results from the children were comparable with findings from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (NDNS); suggesting the FAST diary method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] was a suitable tool for collecting preschool children&#x02019;s dietary data. As with the NDNS results, children presented higher intakes of saturated fat and non-milk extrinsic sugars than daily recommendations. However, children in the current study recorded lower levels of Vitamin A, Vitamin D, non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) and sodium than other surveys.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Observational measures</title><p>Findings from the present study highlighted the apparent difficulty or preschool intentional lack of compliance with preschool health policies such as allowing high energy dense snacks and foods. Moreover, some practitioners appeared to be unaware of the impact of their own consumption behaviour on children (i.e., modelling). However, some practitioners did voice feeling &#x02018;guilt&#x02019; in giving the children &#x02018;treats&#x02019; when the researcher was observing these behaviours. Moreover, in the primary qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] it was evident that the provision of &#x02018;treats&#x02019; and birthday cakes brought into preschools from home was a regular occurrence. As discussed previously, there is a paucity of interventions targeting children in preschool settings in the UK. These findings highlight the need to further explore practitioners&#x02019; personal perceptions of health and how the embedding of food policies which promote healthier food being brought into the preschool setting from home can be implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Although the preschools were given the same training, information and tasks to complete, it was apparent that each school tailored the implementation to suit their own setting. This is significant finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], as it is essential that the intervention can function in a &#x02018;real&#x02019; world situation and is capable of being integrated into the daily routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, it was reported that there was some difficulty with completing all the intervention tasks due to curriculum demands and obligation to comply with primary school demands (all the preschools were based within a primary school setting). One teacher suggested that future preschools participating in such an intervention may want to plan the intervention into the curriculum in advance. This would not only benefit the implementation of the intervention but may also provide staff with involvement and ownership of the project. This could coincide with In Service Training (INSET) days and contribute to staff professional development. Potentially, a health officer working with several schools could be employed to support staff and intervention implementation.</p><p>The teachers displayed enthusiasm for and adherence with the intervention. The materials and activities were liked and reported as suitable. It was reported that a significant strength of the intervention was the capacity to encourage parents to become involved with their children, especially in the practical home tasks.</p><p>The teachers reported parental difficulties with the goal-setting meetings and activities, however, findings suggest it was not the goal-setting tasks per se that parents were opposed to, but the actual meeting and discussing of the goals with staff members. The parents may have found discussing family behaviours with the teacher too personal or overly intrusive fearing judgement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Previous US work reports that parents of a lower SES may have greater concerns about privacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Moreover, the parents may have questioned the teacher&#x02019;s qualifications to discuss such matters. Results from the primary qualitative study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] found that parents were worried about &#x02018;being told what to do&#x02019; and being thought of as &#x02018;bad parents&#x02019;. This highlights the importance of exploring other methods of feedback such as email, or an on-line website. Results from a telephone survey conducted in Australia in 2010, suggested that when trying to engage parents in interventions to prevent obesity in childhood, support services such as personalised mail/email support would be the most acceptable method to parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. In addition, further strategies for engaging NP engagement and interest would be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>].</p><p>The most successful and accepted elements of the intervention were the family cooking challenges and the shared preschool photograph/notice boards. The ability of these tasks to engage the parents is significant and should perhaps form the basis of future preschool behaviour change interventions. There was also evidence of parents attempting other intervention tasks such as increasing &#x02018;family active time&#x02019;, the &#x02018;No TV challenges&#x02019; and trying new recipes. Therefore the findings indicate an acceptability of the methods and materials by the parents; however, this was demonstrated mostly by the ongoing informal observations and collected task sheets as very few parents returned the intervention end evaluation questionnaires. It proved frustrating knowing that many parents had engaged with the intervention but felt unable to provide feedback.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Intervention refinement</title><p>The following proposals for the refinement of the intervention for future implementation are recommended. The researcher, preschool staff and parents should meet for a pre-intervention meeting to collaboratively discuss the intervention purpose, procedures and importance of data collection methods. Engaging parents in relevant &#x02018;fun&#x02019; activities prior to recruitment may encourage more parents to participate. The parental self- monitoring goal implementation and activity sheets should be simplified for optimal understanding and to potentially increase completion. In addition, ways to systematically collect process measures data, for example the parent-completed activity and feedback forms, should be identified. Preschool staff should be issued with more explicit physical activity and playground games ideas to improve use of provided activity equipment. Recipes should be provided with the cooking challenge activities, as it was highlighted by preschool staff that not all families were familiar with the provided fruits and vegetables. The delivering of a refined, delayed intervention provides an incentive for the wait list control preschools to participate, because instead of just providing control data, they later receive a refined intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Several strengths of this work can be reported. The study was able to demonstrate the acceptability of the intervention tasks and materials and it was evident that families were engaging with aspects of the intervention such as the cooking challenges. The intervention was underpinned by two theoretical models which aided the development of and implementation of the intervention and adds to the body of evidence.</p><p>The recruitment rates were very low; this was a doctorate study and time and resources limited further recruitment measures. However, those parents that did take part were from a varied SES thus it seems it is possible to reach a wide range of the population. Parental education level was used as a proxy measure for social economic status (SES) and it is acknowledged that a single proxy measure is unlikely to provide accurate information; ideally multiple proxy measures would be measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. We did not have the characteristics of those parents not taking part. Therefore, the sample may not necessarily be representative of the whole school; if this was a full trial and not a feasibility study, this could be regarded as a limitation. The lack of opportunity to meet with all staff members may have had a negative impact on parental recruitment and staff engagement. Ideally, more time would have been allocated to the staff training; 1&#x000a0;h of training for the complexity of the intervention was insufficient. However, time was a rare commodity for the NPs; especially those who were not willing to attend sessions out-with work hours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec42"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The preschool years have been highlighted as a critical period for obesity prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and interventions which target strategies and techniques which aid parents in modifying their child&#x02019;s diet and physical activity patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] have been recommended.</p><p>Despite some issues with staff engagement and parental recruitment, the preschool teachers reported that certain elements of the intervention, such as the cooking challenges and shared notice boards, were successful in engaging families with preschool age children. In future studies, it may be beneficial to engage families in &#x02018;fun&#x02019; activities, such as the cooking challenges before any formal recruitment is attempted. Furthermore, large scale studies are needed to further explore the suitability and effectiveness of the role of nursery settings for childhood obesity prevention.</p><p>It was found that the practices of some preschool settings and practitioners contradicted reported preschool health policies. The findings highlight the need to not only focus on family health behaviours but to address the whole &#x02018;obesogenic&#x02019; environment to which a child is exposed. The findings from this study will contribute to the small pool of UK research in understanding which strategies for the prevention of obesity in preschool children are most acceptable to preschool staff and parents. It is hoped that expansion of research in this area will contribute to the government aim of reducing childhood obesity to 2000 levels by 2020.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCT</term><def><p>Behaviour change techniques</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CONSORT</term><def><p>Consolidated standards of reporting trials</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EYFS</term><def><p>Early years foundation stage</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAST</term><def><p>Food in schools tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INSET</term><def><p>In service training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate to vigorous physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCMP</term><def><p>National Childhood Measurement Programme</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NDNS</term><def><p>National Diet and Nutrition Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NP</term><def><p>Nursery practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSP</term><def><p>Non-starch polysaccharides</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OC</term><def><p>Operant conditioning</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSA</term><def><p>Public service agreement</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p>Social cognitive theory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Social economic status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UK</term><def><p>United Kingdom</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p>The manual and materials from the programme are available from the corresponding author.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Thanks are due to the preschool centres, parents and children for their participation in the study.</p><sec id="FPar5"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was funded by an ESRC studentship awarded to FUSE, the Centre for Translational Research in Public Health.
