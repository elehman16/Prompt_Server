The occurrence of new episodes is higher in some black and minority ethnic groups. Psychosis is more common in urban populations, particularly in deprived areas. The course is usually recurrent, with significant health service use (and associated costs), especially at &#x02018;crisis&#x02019; points with inpatient bed usage.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Life expectancy is reduced by &#x0223c;15&#x02013;20&#x02005;years, mostly as a consequence of physical health problems.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Schizophrenia, the most burdensome of psychoses, is among the most costly illnesses worldwide. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, schizophrenia causes a high degree of disability, which accounts for 1.1% of the total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 2.8% of years lived with disability (YLDs). In the WHO report, schizophrenia is listed as the 8th leading cause of DALYs worldwide in the age group 15&#x02013;44&#x02005;years.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In addition to the direct cost, there is a considerable burden on the relatives.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>The longer the time between the onset of symptoms of psychosis and the start of treatment&#x02014;known as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP)&#x02014;the worse the outlook, more so for social functioning and recovery.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Therefore, DUP is considered to be the strongest predictor of symptom severity and prognosis.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Evidence from trans-cultural and international research suggests that DUP ranges between 364 and 721&#x02005;days<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and reducing DUP is of imminent national and international importance.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Therefore, the pathway goals are to identify the illness as early as possible, treat the symptoms, provide skills to patients and their families, maintain the improvement over a period, prevent relapses and reintegrate the individuals into the community so that they can lead as normal a life as possible.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Longer durations of untreated psychosis can occur due to client-related or service-related factors, or both. Client-related factors could be attributable to an inability to recognise early symptoms or due to the illness itself such as poor insight, social and emotional withdrawal<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or due to cultural values systems like attributions to illness and help-seeking pathways into care.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>There is a considerable unmet need currently in patients with psychosis in the way they can access services and receive evidence-based treatments as prescribed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> in a timely fashion. The Schizophrenia Commission Report<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and National Audit of Schizophrenia<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> have highlighted deficiencies in psychopharmacological and psychological care and recommended changes to the way care is provided to patients with schizophrenia. There is strong cost-effectiveness argument supporting early intervention and early intervention in psychosis (EIP) teams were developed in many countries to achieve this goal, but, in attempts to reduce costs, these teams have been diluted in many areas.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Community education and awareness campaigns have been tried to identify symptoms early with limited success.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Educating general practitioners to reduce delays in referrals to secondary care services has had limited impact<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in increasing the number of referrals. Delays in secondary care mental health services have been found to be of most significance in the care pathways of those with long DUP.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Therefore, there is a need for integrated pathways prescribing key stages, timelines and interventions matched to the diversity of presentations that occur with psychosis, for example, comorbidity with substance misuse and trauma, which will improve access to evidence-based services, interventions and support recovery.</p><p>Integrated pathways are also fundamental to improving the physical health and reducing premature morbidity and mortality in people with psychosis. Pathways can ensure delivery of appropriate health promotion at key stages, for example, weight gain from antipsychotic medication is especially pronounced in the first 8&#x02005;weeks of administration but it is rare that specific support is offered at this stage. Similarly smoking cessation support can be built in at critical periods, for example, on admission to hospital. Integrated pathways improve the quality of care by improving multidisciplinary communication, care planning, including primary care, and patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research question</title><p>Is implementation of TRIumPH integrated pathway in services feasible and acceptable and does it reduce duration of untreated psychosis, hospital stay and severity of symptoms at 12 and 24&#x02005;months?</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of the psychosis pathway, TRIumPH.

The approach has used a robust methodology that can be adapted and adopted nationally and internationally.</p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Intelligence from information</title><p>In developing the psychosis pathway, the Wessex Academic Health Sciences Network (AHSN) commissioned Janssen Healthcare Innovation to build a comprehensive picture of service use in Wessex from national data sets by pseudonymising, non-sensitive patient-level data for 2012&#x02013;2013. Licensed from the Health and Social Care Information Centre, the Mental Health Minimum Data Set (MHMDS), and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) were searched for individuals identified using the relevant ICD-10 clinical codes; Mental health (Payment by Results) PbR clusters and Health of the Nation Outcome Scale (HoNOS). The data confirmed that individuals who suffered with psychosis:<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Had higher psychiatric hospital admissions with longer stays (on average over 50% longer than other mental health conditions);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Accounted for the majority of community health professional contacts (around three times more);</p></list-item><list-item><p>Had more attendances and admissions to local accident and emergency departments</p></list-item><list-item><p>Are keen to work but could not find employment.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Limitations with the data and method used were acknowledged. The information on service use was consistent with other areas in the country.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3c2"><title>Coproduction</title><p>The Wessex AHSN supported co-production workshops that enabled patient, carer and clinician feedback. The aim of the coproduction workshops was to understand opportunities and challenges of current service provision and understand how &#x02018;experts by lived experience&#x02019; would like to see services improve. Southampton voluntary services (UK) provided rooms for the workshops that were attended by integrated stakeholders&#x02014;20 patients from across Hampshire, 3 carers and 5 healthcare professionals&#x02014;and lasted 4&#x02005;hours. The workshops were facilitated by Stripes partners (a global strategy and innovation studio that support organisations to understand their customers better by providing a fresh perspective and a deep understanding ie, then shared by the team collectively) to establish a &#x02018;bottom-up&#x02019; understanding of priorities specific to Wessex.</p><p>Following an ice breaker exercise, participants were asked to write about their &#x02018;hopes and fears.&#x02019; In the second stage, rather than start with any assumptions, the facilitators let participants define what was important to them by asking them to write postcards about a chosen experience and address it to a person who they felt should hear their story. Hundreds of postcards were obtained, yielding many first-hand experiences of current care. The feedback was then collated into themes by the facilitators. The themes were then rated by individual participants in terms of importance and experiences in different settings.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Below are the key themes rated as high priority with examples of quotes from the participants:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><italic>Prevention</italic>: &#x02018;I was introduced to the system after I committed a crime. It could have been avoided if I had received the right support and intervention&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Consistent</italic>: &#x02018;My brother always complains that his carers and Psychiatrists change all the time, he tells one person all about himself and then, some months or weeks later, he has to tell it all over again. He says he gets fed up with this&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Responsive</italic>: &#x02018;If services intervened early, hospitalisation could have been avoided. If I had been able to get rapid response might also have avoided crisis&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Empathetic</italic>: &#x02018;My husband called the hospital at home team and he did not feel listened to&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Seamless</italic>: &#x02018;The most difficult aspect of my care is that since I moved there is little communication between agencies&#x02019;.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This approach helped us to understand what was intrinsically important to patients and carers, rather than relying on assumptions.</p><p>The pathway attempts to address the key areas, as standardising care improves quality through multidisciplinary communication using care planning that makes care consistent, seamless and responsive. The pathway emphasises prevention through communication with primary care and reduction in DUP; it emphasises consistency and seamless care through a prescribed standardised approach in every phase; responsiveness through early access and interventions. Through a standardised approach to assessment and treatment, it promotes empathy.</p></sec><sec id="s3c3"><title>Engagement with clinicians and stakeholders</title><p>Wider engagement events were held with patients, carers, clinicians, managers and wider stakeholders like commissioners, academics and these also gained political support. Feedback can be viewed on: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wessexahsn.org.uk/programmes/show/5/mental-health">http://wessexahsn.org.uk/programmes/show/5/mental-health</ext-link></p><p>A steering group was then set up, involving clinicians, commissioners, patient and carer representatives, general practitioners and other stakeholders who were essential to the development of the pathway. Information from the acquired data and coproduction workshops were triangulated with clinical expertise and national evidence to chart process maps.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The process map identified the scope of the pathway and key outcomes desired, including the specific timeframes for access and intervention and highlight the potential challenges and opportunities.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>The pathway has been implemented in the EIP teams of two organisations, called the adopter sites. In implementing the pathway, a multipronged approach has been used, including training of EIP team clinicians and development of a guide supporting the pathway; establishment of a pathway facilitator and collection and discussion of live data in clinical teams.</p><sec id="s3c3a"><title>EIP team training and guide</title><p>A guide on how to use the pathway has been produced and placed on the trust website. All participant EIP teams in adopter sites have received information and training on different aspects of implementing the pathway. Training has followed the philosophy and psychological principles that underpin quality improvement initiatives. Training has also been provided on key aspects of care like how to conduct physical health examination; how to deal with comorbidity of alcohol and substance misuse among other aspects.</p></sec><sec id="s3c3b"><title>Pathway facilitator</title><p>A pathway facilitator role has been established within the EIP teams. The facilitator supports the EIP teams in adopter sites to implement the pathway and maintain consistency and fidelity to the model.</p></sec><sec id="s3c3c"><title>Continuous improvement through use of data</title><p>Regular data collection and feedback to clinicians, managers and the pathway steering group has been informing effective implementation of the pathway.</p><p>This pathway needs to be evaluated for its feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and direct costs. Therefore, this study will:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Assess the feasibility of implementing the pathway from the perspective of patients, carers and staff</p></list-item><list-item><p>Measure patient outcomes to assess effectiveness of the pathway</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assess the acceptability of the pathway to patients, carers and clinicians.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluate direct costs (eg, care cost, hospital bed costs etc) of the pathway</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Control&#x02014;care as usual</title><p>Participants in the control arm will receive care as usual. There is a significant variability in provision of care, despite NICE guidelines on treatment and management of first episode psychosis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The study team will record any uptake of NICE recommended programmes during the study, and collate information from centres about uptake of NICE recommendations more widely. These organisations are similar to the adopter sites in that they aspire to follow the EIP policy implementation guide and meet the access and waiting time (AWT) standard. There are also differences as there is a variability in the way care is provided in each team and organisation depending on culture of the team, resources allocated and leadership.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Feasibility and acceptability of the pathway will be assessed through quantitative and qualitative data collection regarding adherence to the process measures of the pathway, including timeliness of access and intervention; type of intervention offered, including medication, physical health assessment, psychological intervention etc and reasons for deviation from the pathway. Additionally, satisfaction and acceptability will be assessed using questionnaires and focus groups consisting of the following qualitative methods; patient experience using specifically designed patient experience questionnaires and focus groups, staff experience using staff questionnaires designed to measure the impact of the pathway on staff experience and carer experience using carer focus groups.</p><p>Effectiveness will be assessed through data collection and evaluation in patient outcomes, including clinical (eg, HoNOS: Health of Nation Outcome Score), functional and recovery outcomes (eg, employment, vocation, physical health), among other measures.

They provide a standardised framework for good clinical practice, reduce variation in care and have improved outcomes for patients through providing timely access and intervention. Standardised pathways improve quality by improving multidisciplinary communication with different care agencies using care planning, and improve patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> While currently there are pathways and guidance available for psychosis care in some countries such as UK,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> they do not provide prescriptive timeframes to improve access to care and interventions. In the UK, the access and waiting time standard<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> has been introduced to begin to address these issues and reduce the DUP in first episode psychosis. However, an Integrated Care Pathway provides far more benefits than meeting a target in terms of providing personalised good quality care.</p><sec id="s7a"><title>Development of the pathway</title><p>The strength of the Integrated Care Pathway TRIumPH is in its development through inspiring shared vision and purpose, patient empowerment through coproduction and codesign; intelligent use of information; influencing; and systems networking across interfaces through stakeholder engagement, to incorporate diverse views and impact on quality outcomes for patient care. Codesigning services with clinicians and patients together makes a difference to quality improvement, as it draws from the expertise of patients, who are experts by experience and professional leaders.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The recent Mental Health Taskforce report<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> recommends that Integrated Care Pathways are developed for mental health conditions to reduce fragmented care and improve outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s7b"><title>Evaluation</title><p>There is a huge potential to improve quality and productivity in mental health services.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Across the world initiatives have been taken in community services but there are few evaluations of effectiveness or efficiency.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> There is also a need for standardisation and guidelines on conducting such studies.</p><p>If the results of the study show that the pathway is feasible, of benefit to patients, carers and staff, the study protocol will set a benchmark against which organisations can organise and audit their practice, which can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of service changes. For practitioners, they will provide practical guidance about what to do and when to do it, making best use of their professional skills. The pathway can also assist in establishing workforce and training need, such as professional, therapy, vocational and support worker time and training.</p></sec><sec id="s7c"><title>Limitations</title><p>Most organisations are currently struggling to balance the quality versus finance agenda due to ongoing austerity. Limited resources within services to deliver care along the pathway may impact on results. These may include inadequate numbers of clinicians in teams with an understanding of the pathway and trained therapists to deliver the interventions. Adaptation and adoption of the pathway in other developed countries like the United States and Canada may have challenges due to system differences, hospital-based care and different payment systems. Similarly, there maybe challenges in developing countries where care is hospital-based and attributions to illness and help-seeking pathways into care are culturally influenced.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the TRIumPH study will provide evidence for the feasibility, acceptability and impact of an Integrated Care Pathway that has been developed through intelligent use of information, coproduction with patients, carers and clinicians and engagement with wider stakeholders. If the pathway is successful, the design of the intervention and study will allow a rapid dissemination within the NHS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> SR and DK are grant holders and contributed to the concept and design of the study.
