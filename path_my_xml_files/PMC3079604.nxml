Based on the high eccentric demands of these activities, marathon and ultra-marathon running as eccentric exercise lead to skeletal muscle damage resulting in an increase in myocellular enzymes such as plasma creatine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], urea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and myoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>It has been shown that the breakdown of body protein during endurance exercise occurs and the mobilized amino acids are available for increased rates of oxidation and gluconeogenesis during endurance performances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The increase in variables of skeletal muscle damage during ultra-endurance running might be associated with the decrease in skeletal muscle mass as has been shown in ultra-marathoners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, several laboratory studies in cyclists reported reductions of myocellular enzymes indicative of skeletal muscle damage during endurance performances, and enhanced performance after combined ingestion of carbohydrates and protein. It has been demonstrated that consumption of a carbohydrate-protein beverage during an intense cycling performance led to a reduced increase in plasma creatine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and myoglobin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Subjects were given 200 ml of a carbohydrate (6%) or carbohydrate plus casein hydrolysate (6% carbohydrate + 1.8% protein hydrolysate) 500 ml immediately pre-exercise and every 5 km in the study of Saunders <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the study of Valentine <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], participants consumed 250 ml placebo, carbohydrates (7.75%), carbohydrate plus carbohydrates (9.69%) or carbohydrates plus protein (7.76% + 1.94%) every 15 min until fatigue. The combined intake of carbohydrate and protein enhanced cycling performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and reduced ratings of muscle soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The ingestion of amino acids before a performance reduced both delayed onset of muscle soreness and muscle fatigue for several days after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, it was discovered that amino acid supplementation during training prevented exercise induced muscle proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>To date, no study has investigated whether the supplementation of amino acids would have an effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage and performance in ultra-endurance runners competing in events further than the classic marathon distance. We therefore asked whether the short-term supplementation of amino acids before and during a 100 km ultra-marathon might have an effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage in ultra-endurance athletes. Regarding the present literature, we hypothesized that the supplementation of amino acids before and during an ultra-marathon would lead to a reduced increase in the variables of skeletal muscle damage, a decrease in muscle soreness and an improved performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>An interventional field study at the '100 km Lauf Biel' in Biel, Switzerland was used for this research.

We hypothesized that the supplementation of amino acids before and during an ultra-marathon would reduce the increase in the variables of skeletal muscle damage, decrease the subjective feeling of muscle soreness and improve race performance. In contrast to our hypothesis, the amino acid supplementation showed no effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage, i.e. creatine kinase and myoglobin, on subjective feelings of muscle soreness and on performance. Potential explanations for these negative findings could be the time and duration of amino acid supplementation and the type of exercise.</p><sec><title>Change in variables of skeletal muscle damage</title><p>We hypothesized that an amino acid supplementation would lower post-race values of variables of skeletal muscle damage compared to control participants. In contrast, we found no differences in the increase in serum concentrations of creatine kinase, urea and myoglobin between the two groups. Cockburn <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated that creatine kinase and myoglobin increased to a lower extent after supplementation with a milk-based protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, they measured creatine kinase and myoglobin 24 h and 48 h after exercise, which might explain the disparate findings.</p><p>In marathon runners, post-race creatine kinase was significantly elevated among faster compared to slower runners and the elevations of creatine kinase drawn 24 hours after a marathon were inversely related to the finishing times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Skenderi <italic>et al. </italic>described 39 runners in the Spartathlon, a 246 km ultra-marathon, which the athletes completed within 33.3 (&#x000b1;0.5) h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The finishing time was not correlated to the post race creatine kinase concentration, as has been found in the present study.</p></sec><sec><title>Duration of amino acid supplementation</title><p>Our athletes ingested the amino acids as a pre-race load of 12 g and then 4 g at each aid station during the 100 km ultra-marathon. The total amount was 52.5 g amino acids and the time of supplementation was between 12 and 13 hours. This time period might be too short to show an effect of the amino acid supplementation on performance. An amino acid supplementation period of two weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], four weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] or even eight weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] showed beneficial effects on performance. The supplementation of amino acids for a shorter period may nonetheless have positive effects on serum variables or muscle soreness. Shimomura <italic>et al. </italic>demonstrated that the ingestion of 5 g of branched-chain amino acids 15 minutes prior to seven sets of 20 squats per set reduced the delayed onset of muscle soreness and muscle fatigue for several days after exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The duration of supplementation might also have been too short to show an effect on creatine kinase. Consuming 12 g of branched-chain amino acids during seven days reduced the increase of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase after performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Ohtani <italic>et al. </italic>showed a decrease in post exercise creatine kinase serum concentrations compared to pre-exercise when athletes ingested, three times per day, 2.2 g of a mixture of amino acids during one month [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, there is data that shows that the ingestion of amino acids during performance has an effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage. In a recent study in untrained male cyclist, the ingestion of branched-chain amino acids reduced the increase in creatine kinase serum concentration after performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The disparate findings might be explained by the fact that those researchers investigated untrained subjects during cycling where as we investigated well-trained and experienced ultra-runners.</p><p>Two recent studies showed an enhanced performance when both protein and carbohydrates were ingested during endurance performances. In two studies of cyclists, the combined intake of carbohydrate and protein during exercise enhanced performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In the first study of Saunders <italic>et al.</italic>, the subjects were given a carbohydrate and protein beverage with 7.3% carbohydrate and protein plus 1.8% protein concentrate versus a carbohydrate-only beverage with 7.3% carbohydrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the second study of Saunders <italic>et al.</italic>, the subjects received at 15 min intervals carbohydrate or carbohydrate and protein gels which were matched for carbohydrate content with 0.15 g carbohydrates&#x000b7;kg body mass<sup>-1 </sup>for the carbohydrate group versus 0.15 g carbohydrates + 0.038 g protein&#x000b7;kg body mass<sup>-1 </sup>for the carbohydrate plus protein group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In contrast to these findings, four studies demonstrated no improved performance after protein supplementation. In three studies using cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and one study using runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the intake of carbohydrate and protein did not enhance performance compared to carbohydrate intake. In accordance with our findings we must assume that protein supplementation during endurance exercise has no effect on performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid supplementation and muscle soreness</title><p>We hypothesized that the subjective feelings of muscle soreness after the race would decrease while ingesting amino acids. In cyclists, the combined intake of carbohydrate and protein during performance led to significant reductions in muscle soreness compared to carbohydrate intake alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The supplementation with amino acids before and after elbow flexion lowered muscle soreness in the recovery phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In a study with branched-chain amino acid supplementation during performance, the subjects' ratings of perceived exertion were 7% lower when branched-chain amino acids were given compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast to these findings, amino acid supplementation showed no effect on muscle soreness in our ultra-runners. This might be explained by the fact that we have investigated runners and not cyclists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and asked for subjective feelings of muscle soreness immediately upon arrival at the finish line, compared to the recovery phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the present study and implications for future research</title><p>The finding that athletes in the amino acid group were significantly faster compared to the control group was not brought about by the ingestion of amino acids but by the study sample. Although the athletes were randomly assigned to the two groups and no statistically significant differences regarding anthropometry and pre-race experience were found between the two groups, we a ssume a potential confounding caused by the personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon. The mean difference of 73.6 min. in race time between the two groups was statistically significant. The corresponding 95% confidence limits of the race time difference were between 6.5 min. and 140.6 min. The race time was significantly associated with the personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon for both groups. The corresponding mean (95% CI) difference in personal best time between the two groups was 71.0 (-33.2 to 175.1) min (<italic>p </italic>= 0.17). Due to the similar mean differences in race time and personal best time over 100 km between the two groups, and the significant association between the race time and the personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon, linear regression controlling for personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon as a potential confounder for the difference between 100 km race times revealed that the resulting mean (SE) race time difference of 5.5 (&#x000b1;28.6) min. remained no longer statistically significant when adjusted for the personal best time in a 100 km ultra-marathon. Personal best time proved to be an important variable regarding performance in ultra-endurance races [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, adjusting for personal best time resulted in a non-significant difference in race time between the two groups.</p><p>The number of athletes might also have affected the result. A decrease of 0.6 kg in body mass seems to be relevant. In a recent study of male 100 km ultra-marathoners, skeletal muscle mass decreased by 0.7 kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Regarding statistical power, we would have needed to include 42 subjects per group to detect a clinical relevant difference between the groups of 80% power. With our actual sample size, we had only 60% power. However, it was not possible to increase the sample of athletes under field conditions since only these 28 ultra-marathoners from the total field of athletes volunteered to participate.</p><p>Since variables of skeletal muscle damage, such as creatine kinase and myoglobin, remain increased for up to seven days after a marathon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], they should be measured not only immediately after the race but also in the recovery phase. Presumably the intake of amino acids during the race would lead to lower values of creatine kinase and myoglobin in the recovery phase.</p><p>In a multi-stage ultra-endurance run, skeletal muscle mass decreased continuously throughout the race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Presumably, amino acid supplementation would have an effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage rather in a multi-stage race than in a single ultra-marathon. It has been shown that the oral administration of amino acids resulted in a faster recovery of muscle strength after eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The ingestion of protein during rest periods might enhance recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In runners, especially, the combined ingestion of carbohydrate and protein after each training session over 6 days reduced the post exercise increase in serum creatine kinase and muscle soreness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ingestion of 52.5 g of amino acids immediately before and during a 100 km ultra-marathon had no beneficial effect on variables of skeletal muscle damage, muscle soreness, and race performance. A positive effect of amino acid supplementation in ultra-runners might be expected when amino acid or protein would be supplemented in the rest period during a multi-stage ultra-endurance run. Recovery might be enhanced and increase in variables of skeletal muscle damage might be reduced, effects that should be investigated in future studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>BK designed the study and wrote the manuscript.
