In human and small animal medicine, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs, eg, pantoprazole) have proven to be more effective at raising intragastric pH than histamine&#x02010;2 receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs, eg, famotidine) and are commonly used for prevention and treatment of acid&#x02010;related disorders.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref>
</p><p>Pantoprazole is a substituted benzimidazole PPI that is available as an injectable IV drug (Protonix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). PPIs exist as weak bases and are therefore unprotonated in the physiologic pH of the blood. After cellular diffusion, PPIs become protonated and trapped in their active form in the acidic environment of parietal cells. After activation, PPIs form disulfide bonds with available active parietal cell H<sup>+</sup>&#x002d7;K<sup>+</sup>&#x02010;adenosine triphosphatase (H<sup>+</sup>&#x002d7;K<sup>+</sup>&#x02010;ATPase) enzymes.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Recruitment and activation of previously inactive parietal cells follows initial PPI administration. Thus, PPIs need time to accumulate within newly recruited parietal cells and reach steady state.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Inhibition of acid secretion after PPI administration is approximately 30% of maximal at 24&#x000a0;hours because not all H<sup>+</sup>&#x002d7;K<sup>+</sup>&#x02010;ATPase enzymes are bound by the drug. Maximal inhibitory effect is thought to plateau at approximately 4&#x000a0;days.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In contrast, peak plasma concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>RAs occur within hours after a single dose.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Many veterinarians administer the rapidly acting famotidine in the first few days of treatment in combination with the slower acting, but more effective pantoprazole to critically ill dogs with or at high risk for GI bleeding.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Pharmacologists argue, however, that simultaneous treatment with an H<sub>2</sub>RA might decrease the efficacy of PPIs because of the requirement for PPI activation and trapping in the acidic canilicular environment of the parietal cell. This concept has been contested by intragastric pH studies in human subjects in which the combination of a PPI and H<sub>2</sub>RA in the first few days of treatment resulted in a more rapid time to raise intragastric pH&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;4 and improved clinical signs compared to a PPI alone.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p><p>Despite their frequent use in combination, no studies have been undertaken in dogs to determine if there is a benefit to short&#x02010;term simultaneous treatment with PPIs and H<sub>2</sub>RAs. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to compare the immediate, short&#x02010;term effect of IV pantoprazole alone to combination treatment with IV pantoprazole and famotidine on canine intragastric pH.</p><sec id="jvim12555-sec-0008"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="jvim12555-sec-0009"><title>Study Animals</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Tennessee approved the protocol for this study (Approval #2249&#x02010;0314). The subjects of this study were 12 healthy adult dogs (5 beagles, 7 mixed breed hound dogs) from a research colony at the University of Tennessee (7 neutered females, 5 neutered males), aged 2.5&#x02013;13.0&#x000a0;years (median, 8&#x000a0;years) and weighing 9.7&#x02013;23.6&#x000a0;kg (median, 14.9&#x000a0;kg). Dogs included in the study were deemed healthy on the basis of normal physical examination, normal CBC and biochemistry profile performed within 6&#x000a0;months of study entry. In addition, dogs had no evidence of GI disease (eg, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia) and had a normal PCV, as well as normal total serum protein, blood urea nitrogen and blood glucose concentrations and urinalysis results at study entry. To ensure inclusion of healthy dogs and to comply with IACUC guidelines, dogs were excluded from the study if they developed inappetence for &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;hours, lost &#x0003e;10% of their body weight, had gross evidence of disease on gastroesophagoscopy during the study period or some combination of these. Dogs were walked 4 times per day during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="jvim12555-sec-0010"><title>Study Design</title><p>A randomized, open label, 2&#x02010;way crossover study was performed.

All dogs received 2&#x000a0;mL 0.9% saline q6&#x000a0;hours for the first 24&#x000a0;hours of intragastric pH monitoring (before administration of either treatment) to obtain baseline pH data. All treatments were dosed at 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg IV q12h each for 3 consecutive days followed by a minimum 10&#x02010;day washout period. Each drug was administered as a slow IV bolus over a period of no less than 2&#x000a0;minutes. Dogs were randomized to a treatment group using a random number generator. Pantoprazole was resuspended to a concentration of 4&#x000a0;mg/mL immediately before administration according to manufacturer directions. Unused resuspended pantoprazole was discarded after 24&#x000a0;hours. Both famotidine and pantoprazole were stored at a controlled cold temperature (7&#x000b0;C) protected from light. The dogs' peripheral IV catheters were flushed with 2&#x000a0;mL of 0.9% saline every 6&#x000a0;hours throughout the study to maintain catheter patency. The dogs were medicated at 7:30 am and 5:30&#x000a0;pm daily and were fed a maintenance diet<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12555-note-1003">3</xref> 30&#x000a0;minutes after medicating at 8:00 am and 6:00&#x000a0;pm daily. Dogs had unlimited access to water during the pH monitoring period. Clinical signs, including changes in attitude, vomiting, number of defecations and fecal consistency were recorded twice daily. Feces were graded from 1 to 7 by a standardized fecal scoring system<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12555-note-1004">4</xref> .

For pH, the effect of day of treatment was also assessed. The pH data were analyzed with a cross&#x02010;over design analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Shapiro&#x02010;Wilk test was used to test the ANOVA assumption of normally distributed errors, and the Levene's <italic>F</italic> test was used to test the assumption of homogeniety of variance. When necessary, data were logarithmically (normal) transformed. Both assumptions were met with transformed data. Continuous variables (percentage food consumption, mean fecal score and change in fecal scores) were compared using an AB&#x02010;BA cross&#x02010;over design. Descriptive data (number of vomiting episodes and number of episodes with a fecal score &#x02265;4) were reported as frequency of occurrences. To minimize the probability of type I error, a Bonferroni adjusted alpha of 0.01 was used to evaluate test results. When a significant treatment effect was observed, a posthoc Tukey&#x02010;Kramer test was performed (to determine which groups were significantly different from each other) (protected &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). No significant period or sequence effects were found for any dependent variable.

On 5 of 24 occasions, the Bravo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> pH capsules detached and exited the stomach before the end of the pH monitoring period. This occurred in 1 dog while receiving pantoprazole and combination treatment, each on day 2 of treatment, and 2 dogs receiving pantoprazole and 1 dog receiving combination treatment on day 3 of treatment. Therefore, data from these dogs (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) were not included in the ANOVA treatment comparisons. An ANOVA performed using available pH data from all dogs on days 2 and 3 of treatment (excluding data from 1 dog from each treatment group) yielded the same results as the aforementioned analyses.

There were 5 episodes of vomiting in the pantoprazole group, 2 episodes in the combination group, and 1 episode in the placebo before pantoprazole group. There was no significant association with treatment received and appetite, mean fecal score or change in fecal consistency.

There were 5 episodes of fecal scores &#x02265;4 in the pantoprazole group, 3 episodes in the combination group, 3 episodes in the placebo before combination group and 3 episodes in the placebo before pantoprazole group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="jvim12555-sec-0018"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we evaluated IV administered pantoprazole alone and in combination with famotidine in order to determine if combination treatment with pantoprazole and famotidine is more effective at raising canine intragastric pH compared to monotherapy with pantoprazole during the first few days of treatment. No significant differences were identified between treatments when comparing the MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4 over the 72&#x000a0;hours treatment period or on individual treatment days. Moreover, over the 72&#x000a0;hours monitoring period, the pantoprazole monotherapy group, but not the combination group, met clinical goals established for the treatment of gastroduodenal ulceration (intragastric pH of &#x02265;3.0 for approximately 75% of the day) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (intragastric pH of &#x02265;4.0 for approximately 67% of the day) in humans.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref> Future studies using a larger sample size of dogs with GI bleeding are needed to address the clinical importance of this finding.</p><p>Pantoprazole resulted in a higher MPT intragastric pH was &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4 on treatment days 2 and 3 compared to treatment day 1. This is expected based on the pharmacokinetics of the drug which require binding and inactivation of newly recruited H<sup>+</sup>&#x002d7;K<sup>+</sup>&#x02010;ATPase enzymes.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> Despite the delay to peak effect, there was no significant difference in the efficacy of pantoprazole administered alone compared to combination treatment on day 1. Thus, there appears to be no benefit in the addition of IV administered famotidine to pantoprazole treatment even in the early stages of acid suppression in dogs.</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors have proven to be superior to H<sub>2</sub>RAs for raising canine intragastric pH and for prevention of exercise&#x02010;induced gastritis in dogs and are considered to be the standard of care for the treatment of GI bleeding in dogs at our hospital.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">6</xref> For this reason, we did not include a treatment group that received famotidine alone. Additionally, we chose to evaluate twice daily administration of pantoprazole as a previous study performed in dogs demonstrated that once daily administration failed to meet clinical goals established for the treatment of people with gastroduodenal ulceration. In the same study, twice daily omeprazole administration significantly improved the MPT intragastric pH &#x02265;3 and 4 compared to once daily therapy.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> In our study, twice daily pantoprazole achieved goals established for the treatment of acid&#x02010;related disorders in people.<xref rid="jvim12555-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>
</p><p>This study evaluated a small group of dogs with no history, physical exam or laboratory findings of GI disease. The crossover design of the study allowed for each dog to serve as its own control. The response to acid suppressant treatment in healthy dogs might not fully predict the response of dogs with GI bleeding to acid suppressant drugs; however, this study serves as a platform for future studies to address the utility of combination treatment in dogs with GI bleeding.</p><p>In conclusion, these results suggest that the combination of famotidine with pantoprazole administration is not more effective than pantoprazole administered alone for raising intragastric pH.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="jvim12555-sec-0019"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Randy Buddington, Gina Galyon, Shanna Hillsman, and Frank Brown for their technical support.</p><p>
