Training for intrapartum emergencies has been widely recommended but there are conflicting data about their effectiveness. Observational studies have shown sustained local improvements in perinatal outcomes associated with the use of the PRactical Obstetric Multi-Professional Training &#x02013; (PROMPT) training package. However this effect needs to be investigated in the context of randomised study design in settings other than enthusiastic early adopter single-centres.

Following the T3 training, the teams commenced the implementation of local intrapartum emergency training in their own Units by the start of their allocated intervention period. Blinding has not been possible due to the nature of the intervention.

Perinatal outcomes are substantially worse than those in countries with similar Gross Domestic Product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and rates of maternal death, stillbirth, neonatal death, neonatal injury and cerebral palsy are higher than those reported from many developed countries. It is believed that over 50% of adverse pregnancy outcomes in the UK could be prevented with better intrapartum care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] thus benefiting families as well as the NHS which spends more than half of its total litigation costs on maternity services, amounting to &#x000a3;3.1bn between 2000 and 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Training for intrapartum emergencies has been recommended consistently since 1924, and almost annually since 1999 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While some training reports have either failed to demonstrate any change or shown deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], others from single maternity Units have suggested post&#x02013;training improvements in individual outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Observational studies of a local, multi-professional intrapartum emergencies training course for local maternity staff &#x02013; PRactical Obstetric Multi-Professional Training &#x02013; (PROMPT, Bristol, UK) have all shown positive effects. Its implementation was associated with improved compliance with clinical standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and a reduction in clinical error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is also evidence of improvements in perinatal outcomes including a 70% reduction in brachial plexus injuries (paralysed arm) and a 50% reduction in neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (predictor of cerebral palsy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The prevalence rate of 5-min Apgar (Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration) scores &#x0003c;7 has reduced by 48% from 0.87% to 0.45% following training and the retention of clinical skills in maternity staff at 12&#x000a0;months were excellent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These improvements in outcomes after training have been sustained since 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. More importantly, similar advances were also observed in three other settings, Melbourne Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Kansas USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and Zimbabwe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Clinical benefits demonstrated in small studies can prove to be less impressive when applied at scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. While these early data for PROMPT training are extremely encouraging, it is important to determine whether these improvements can be sustained outside the host Unit and enthusiastic early adopters, ideally across a health system.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for the trial</title><p id="Par26">There is currently no definitive evidence to recommend a specific training programme for intrapartum emergencies to improve safety in labour. PROMPT is the only training package for which several observational studies, mostly single-centre but conducted in different settings have shown consistent improvement in key perinatal outcomes. Stronger evidence from a more robust multicentre study is now required to ascertain its effectiveness, especially at scale.</p><p id="Par27">Scotland has over 50,000 births annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and provides an ideal setting to study the effect of implementation of training at scale, as only 3 of the 15 Scottish Maternity Units (with births per year &#x0003e;900, 2012 data) have previously undertaken PROMPT training. Local maternity outcomes in Scotland are collated centrally providing an extremely robust data set for investigation.</p><p id="Par28">Furthermore, one quality indicator for intrapartum care, the 5-min Apgar &#x0003c;7 in term babies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], was higher in Scotland than other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Data from the Information Statistics Division (ISD) Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR 02) show a relatively high proportion of term births with 5-min Apgar scores &#x0003c;7 of 1.1% in 2012. The Apgar score is based on a standardised clinical assessment of the infant&#x02019;s condition at birth, using a scoring system in 5 categories scoring 0&#x02013;10 at 1&#x000a0;min, 5&#x000a0;min and 10&#x000a0;min post birth. The 5-min Apgar &#x0003c;7 rate is an important measure of intrapartum care as it is associated with a considerably higher rate of cerebral palsy in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and observational data suggest that it can be improved by training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, the Low Apgar rate appears to be independent of maternal demographics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], which makes direct comparison of Units useful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Null hypothesis</title><p id="Par29">The PROMPT training has no effect on the rate of term infants born with an Apgar &#x0003c;7 at 5&#x000a0;min observed when implemented at scale across the Scottish maternity health service.</p><p id="Par30">To test this hypothesis we have designed and implemented the THISTLE Study- Trial of Hands-on Interprofessional Simulation Training for Local Emergencies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par31">The study is a multi-centre stepped-wedge clustered randomised controlled superiority trial (SW-RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] .</p><p id="Par32">This design has been chosen because there was not sufficient equipoise amongst participating centres about the intervention. So far, observational studies have consistently shown that PROMPT training is consistently associated with positive outcomes - indicating at least absence of clinical equipoise compared to no treatment and suggesting, albeit risk of confounding and selection biases associated with observational study design a potential treatment effectiveness. It was therefore deemed unethical to use a traditional parallel cluster RCT design in which some Maternity Units and their patients would have been allocated to no training. Furthermore, there was no obvious choice for an alternate training strategy to deliver in a control group as other similar training programmes have either been associated with harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or have no evidence with regards to their effectiveness and safety. Several Units had also requested the training prior to this study and the PROMPT training was supported by a Scottish Government initiative. A SW-RCT was considered as the safest and most ethical option allowing us to roll out the intervention to all Units whilst still using randomisation, and with a number of practical and logistic advantages including modest costs and staffing requirements.</p><p id="Par33">Finally, the established practice of routinely recording birth outcomes across all Scottish Maternity Units (ISD SMR 02) also allowed access to good quality data. The SMR02 is regularly updated reducing the burden on participating Units to provide outcomes specifically for this trial at each time-period and therefore the risk of incomplete data, facilitating the implementation of a SW-RCT.</p><p id="Par34">Details of the study design are presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The study has one control period (step 0) during which none of the Units receives training, three intervention (steps 1&#x02013;3) and two follow-up (step 5) periods, each lasting 6&#x000a0;months. This duration allows all 12 Units to receive their training (see section on intervention) within 12&#x000a0;months, keeping each step short to reduce contamination between trained and untrained Units (rotation of trained staff between Units) but also to remain within the funding and time constraints while allowing for follow-up periods. Based on previous experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] it was anticipated that Units would be able to train all of their staff within one year of commencing their local training. Four Maternity Units are randomised to each intervention step, i.e. the intervention is rolled-out sequentially to the Units in groups of four.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Stepped wedge-design of the THISTLE study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12884_2017_1455_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Units have been provided with a Thistle Study Follow-up pack containing information and data collection sheets (Thistle Study - Local Training Record). The Local Training Records are completed by the Unit&#x02019;s training coordinator and returned to Thistle Study office, as soon as possible after each of their local PROMPT Courses. It records the date of the local course and the numbers, grade, and job roles of staff attending. No personal information from Unit staff will be collected and only aggregated totals by professional group as shown in the previous section will be collected at Unit level. Staff should also include a copy of the course programme when sending back the completed form. These data will be entered onto the Thistle database by the study data coordinator. Data collected during the course of the research will be kept strictly confidential and accessed only by members of the study team. The sponsors are responsible for ensuring that study data is archived appropriately. Essential data shall be retained for a period of at least 10&#x000a0;years following close of study. The study will comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and regular checks and monitoring are in place to ensure compliance. Data are stored securely in accordance with the Act and archived to a secure data storage facility. The senior IT manager (in collaboration with the Chief Investigator) will manage access rights to the data set.

The ISD of the National Health Service, Scotland, is a national organisation for health information, statistics, and computing services and has been in existence for over 40&#x000a0;years. Anonymised patient based data for maternity care are routinely collected from the whole of Scotland and this database (specifically SMR02) will allow us to identify eligible births. The database is subjected to regular quality assurance checks and has been more than 99% complete since the late 1970s. Information from the Scottish Birth Record, another data source maintained by the ISD recording every baby born in Scotland but less exhaustive than the SMR 02, will also be used to complete information relative to the Apgar score missing in the SMR 02 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].Data will be accessed remotely using the National Services Scotland Safe Haven, a secured facility allowing authorised researchers to analyse individual-level data while maintaining the utmost confidentiality. Permission to use the data has been approved by ISD (XRB13180). These data will be saved on the Safe Haven, only accessed by approved member of the research team (EL) and will be archived as per ISD regulations.</p><p id="Par58">Maternal/infant characteristics will be limited to the date of birth and the Apgar score at 5&#x000a0;min. Preliminary research conducted by the co-applicants on term births in one Bristol local hospital have revealed the limited interest of risk adjusting the analysis of Low Apgar status at 5&#x000a0;min for maternal socio-demographics characteristics. To select the relevant population of term infants (see exclusion criteria), the following factors will be considered: type of birth (vaginal, emergency or elective CS); duration of gestation (&#x0003c;37, &#x02265;37&#x000a0;weeks); place of birth (at home, transfer from a non-NHS Unit, transfer from a NHS Unit, in the Unit of interest); and intra-uterine deaths. We will extract the information from 2000 to the end of step 5. There are no patient-reported or economic outcomes.</p><p id="Par59">Perinatal outcome data from the ISD SMR 02 will continue to be collected from participating Units irrespective of whether the PROMPT T3 training programme is undertaken and local PROMPT courses are implemented within the time span of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par60">Of a total of fifteen Maternity Units with &#x0003e;900 births per year in Scotland (in 2010) three Units have already undertaken the PROMPT Train the Trainers day and had started implementing the intervention prior to the start of this study. These three Units are excluded in the following power calculation which focuses on the remaining eligible 12 Units that will contribute data to the before and after intervention periods. Annual birth numbers per Unit are available via an anonymised aggregated Maternity Unit dataset from SMDR for the period 2004&#x02013;2010. We have made a conservative assumption that the Maternity Units which have already undergone PROMPT training are the three largest Units in the anonymised data. The 12 remaining Units had an Apgar&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;7 rate at term of 1.18% in 2010 and an average monthly 200 births per Maternity Unit, i.e. around 1200 births per semester (duration of a step).</p><p id="Par61">Using the method to calculate power for Stepped Wedge designs defined by Hussey and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and its Stata implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and considering that all available and eligible data for the considered Maternity Units will be analysed, the following intervention effectiveness can be detected: With a power of 80% (alpha&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5%), four Maternity Units randomised at each step with three intervention steps - steps 1 to 3 - (12 Units(clusters) in total) and two follow-up steps - steps 4 and 5 -, of six-month duration each (steps 1 to 5), an average cluster size of 1200 births, and an intra-cluster correlation coefficient of 0.1, we will be able to detect a reduction of 35% or more in the Apgar&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;7 rate (i.e. 1.18% vs 0.77%).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par62">One Maternity Unit, independently undertook the PROMPT T3 training a few weeks before the start of the study but had not commenced in-house PROMPT courses and was therefore constrained to be allocated to Step 1 to allow inclusion of this Unit in the study.</p><p id="Par63">The remaining participating Units are allocated to the intervention at one of the &#x0201c;randomisation steps&#x0201d; (step 1, 2 or 3 see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) using the &#x0201c;imbalance statistic&#x0201d; method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This approach permits the balancing of the steps by number of births per annum (small, medium, large Units). An independent statistician from the Centre for Healthcare Randomised Trials (CHaRT) will randomly select an allocation sequence from a subset with the most desirable balance properties using computer-generated random numbers. CHaRT will then inform the nominated in-house training coordinator from each Unit of the date that their team had been allocated to attend the T3 programme.</p><p id="Par64">If the allocated step does not suit the local circumstances of a Maternity Unit (e.g. inability to release clinicians at the allocated training dates due to a shortage of staff), the step allocation is reconsidered. As mentioned by Handley et al. a more pragmatic approach is possible in a stepped-wedge design, by for example considering a manual assignment of Units to steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. To continue to ensure an equal balance in the size of the Maternity Units in each step, if a Unit is unable to attend the allocated training, this Unit will be assigned to a more convenient step, but swapped with another of a similar size wherever possible.</p><p id="Par65">Pregnant women will not be made aware of Maternity Unit status regarding participation in the study, and any additional training that each Unit would normally undertake, should continue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par66">Due to the nature of the intervention and the choice of study design, the staff and research teams could not be blinded to the Unit&#x02019;s training status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec25"><title>Pre-intervention period investigation</title><p id="Par67">The secular background trend before the initiation of the study of the rate of term Low Apgar at 5&#x000a0;min will be described from the ISD SMR data using births between 2000 and the beginning of step 0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Participation, loss to follow-up and withdrawal</title><p id="Par68">Analysis and presentation of data will be in accordance with CONSORT guidelines and recommendations for Stepped Wedge available at the time of reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

If a Unit does not attend their allocated train the trainer session during the THISTLE study intervention or follow-up period, that Unit data will be excluded from the primary analysis (See section on sensitivity analysis). We do not anticipate extensive missing data for the primary outcome and our analysis strategy will be on complete cases. However, it is known that for a very small number of births, the Apgar score is not collected.

This will allow us to account for the correlations between births occurring in the same Maternity Units. Initial models will assess the intervention effect (control period/step vs. intervention effect/step considering follow-up steps as intervention steps) and be adjusted for the effect of time-period to account for potential confounding effect of time, i.e. an underlying time-trend in the prevalence rate of Apgar score&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;7 during the study period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We will model the time-period using dummy indicators for each step. The interaction between time and the main intervention effect will then be tested to investigate the timing and duration of the intervention effect.
