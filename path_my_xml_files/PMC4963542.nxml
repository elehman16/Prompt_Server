Drowsy driving has been reported to account for approximately 20% of accidents worldwide<xref rid="bib_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In Australia, there were 251 fatalities (16.6% of total road deaths) caused explicitly by sleep-related accidents in 1998 alone<xref rid="bib_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition to that, a new EU regulation about sleepiness in driving with a focus on sleep apnoea patients has been issued. Drivers or driving licence applicants with moderate and severe obstructive sleep apnoea shall be referred for further medical advice before a driving license is granted or renewed<xref rid="bib_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is well established that drowsiness caused by extended hours of driving has considerable influence on driver performance, therefore, compromising transportation safety<xref rid="bib_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although some research have demonstrated the is a possible link between short-term exposure to vibration and reduction of wakefulness level<xref rid="bib_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, however, drowsiness caused by vibration is not well investigated and characterized in the available literature. Hence, automotive industry standards to limit vibration-induced drowsiness do not as yet exist.</p><p>In the automotive industry, vehicle seat structure is exposed to vibration from various sources such as vehicle powertrain and road surface. Fundamental vibration modes (resonant frequency and correspondence mode shapes) of automotive body which can transmit vibration to the seat structure occur at a frequency below 60 Hz<xref rid="bib_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the fundamental resonance of the human body occurs at a frequency below 15 Hz<xref rid="bib_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is well known that vibration that is transmitted to the seated human body has a significant influence on human perception and ride comfort<xref rid="bib_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib_010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. ISO 2631-1 (1997)<xref rid="bib_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> International Standard for evaluation of human exposure to whole-body vibration has been used successfully for several years. Although this International Standard (ISO 2631-1) has been developed for the assessment of human body discomfort that is called &#x0201c;Equivalent Comfort Contour&#x0201d;, however, there is little quantitative knowledge of how vibration causes drowsiness.</p><p>Hence, there is considerable scope for defining the exact effects of vehicle and particularly seat vibration on seated human drowsiness levels. No particular attempt has yet been made to rank the factors that contribute to drowsiness in their order of importance. Therefore, we focused on drowsiness caused by vibration only. Drowsiness or sleepiness is a transitory period between being awake and asleep<xref rid="bib_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various studies have suggested that drowsiness affects our daily functioning and our physical and mental health<xref rid="bib_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the literature, drowsiness or a state of near-sleep can be quantified in many ways<xref rid="bib_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the most reliable methods to predict drowsiness, as used in sleep deprivation and performance research, is the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT)<xref rid="bib_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. PVT requires a response to a visual stimulus by pressing a response button as soon as the stimulus appears. Research consistently shows that cumulative sleep restriction and drowsiness results in an increase in reaction time, a decrease in response speed (1/RT), and an increase in the number of lapses (RT&#x0003e;500 ms)<xref rid="bib_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib_020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib_021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="bib_022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="bib_023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many studies have attempted to demonstrate the links between PVT performance and drowsiness, drowsiness caused by vibration has not been experimentally assessed by PVT. Therefore, it was also important to investigate the feasibility and utility of PVT in the detection of drowsiness caused by vibration. Hence, it was the primary aim of this study to investigate the effects of vibration on human drowsiness level using both objective (PVT) and subjective (KSS) measurement methods.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="s2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Volunteers for this investigation included eighteen young male and healthy university students (mean age&#x000b1;SD: 23.0&#x000b1;1.3 years). The average height was 168.2&#x000b1;4.0 cm and weight 64.2&#x000b1;12.2 kg. The average BMI of volunteers was 22.6&#x000b1;2.54 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. None of the volunteers had a history of neck pain, diseases of the cervical spine or musculoskeletal disorders. They had normal hearing and normal or corrected-to-normal vision. One week prior to laboratory experiment, volunteers were required to maintain their normal amount of sleep (between 7 and 9 h) and keep a normal sleep schedule. Therefore, they were asked to keep a sleep diary of when they go to sleep at night and wake up each day. Volunteers were also screened using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) to detect any abnormalities in sleepiness<xref rid="bib_025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The total ESS score ranged from 0 to 24; scores below 7 were considered as normal, scores between 8 to 10 as moderate sleepiness, scores between 11 to 15 was applied to define an elevated risk, whereas scores above 16, severe excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS)<xref rid="bib_026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, was considered as high risk of falling asleep in various monotonous situations<xref rid="bib_027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.

Participation in the experiment is a voluntary basis. Therefore, volunteers have right to refuse participation, and the results of the experiment would remain confidential. The informed written consent form was obtained from all the volunteers after the procedure of the experiment was explained, and the laboratory facilities were introduced to them. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the RMIT University Human Research Ethics Committee (Approval Number: EC 00237).</p></sec><sec><title>Apparatus</title><p>The experiment set-up for drowsiness assessment is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>. The seat used for the experiments is a mid-sized sedan car seat with adjustable headrest. The seat was mounted on a cast aluminium table (2 m&#x000d7;1.2 m&#x000d7;1.2 m), and the table was mounted on four air mountings (regulated to 20 psi). The seat&#x02019;s inclination angle was set at 15&#x000b0; to the vertical direction. Experiment set-up has been developed with a single vertical hydraulic actuator to replicate the vibration perceived by seated occupant in a moving vehicle. Although, the input vibration was not independent on each axis. However, the input vibration generated from the hydraulic vertical actuator is located below the table away from the centre of the table. The off-centre excitation provides the multi-axial (x, y, z-axis) input vibration. This vibration setup also was built to be somewhat similar to the vibration that is transferred from the vehicle floor to the seat. The vibration table below the seat was designed to be dynamically rigid in frequencies below 100 Hz. This is to ensure that there is no interaction with vehicle seat structural dynamics. The time and environment of the experiments are chosen so that the noise level were same for different test conditions. In order to minimize any possible effects of noise on the results of this study, care was taken to run all experiment in similar noise conditions. Prior to drowsiness measurement, measurement of total transmitted vibration (seat pan and backrest) to each volunteer have been done in accordance with ISO 2631-1 (1997) and used the method reported by Fard <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="bib_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.

Volunteers arrived at the laboratory at 8.00 h after a normal night&#x02019;s sleep and light breakfast. They were required to not consume any alcoholic or caffeinated beverages. Volunteers were required to complete an initial screening session to assess their fitness for inclusion in the study. The experiment began at 8.30 h. All volunteers were subjected to two experiment conditions (with-vibration and no-vibration). These two conditions were performed over two separate days. The orders of two conditions were randomly ordered to avoid order-related influences.</p><p>Vigilance was assessed with the PC-based Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT-192: Ambulatory Monitoring Inc., Ardsley, New York)<xref rid="bib_030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, a 10-minutes visual reaction time (RT) task that evaluate sustained attention in two conditions; before vibration exposure and after vibration exposure. The 10-minutes PVT has become the most widely used measure of neurobehavioral test and has shown to be sensitive to both acute and total sleep deprivation<xref rid="bib_028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this PVT test, volunteers were instructed to respond to the onset of a visual millisecond counter by clicking a mouse as quickly as possible. The stimulus was a red light emitting diode displaying time in milliseconds. The light remains visible and stops counting immediately at the subject response. During each 10-minutes session, visual stimuli appeared the variable intervals of 2&#x02013;10 second. From each PVT condition, six PVT performance metrics; minor lapse (response time &#x0003e;500 ms), mean RT, median RT, response speed 1/RT, fastest 10% RT, slowest 10% RT, were extracted using a software program. According to literature<xref rid="bib_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>, The reciprocal transform (1/RT) or response speed was one of the PVT performance metrics found to be sensitive to total and partial sleep loss<xref rid="bib_031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.

The footrest was not connected to the vibration table and was isolated from the vibration. Volunteers were also instructed to limit any physical movement. Then, volunteers were exposed to a Gaussian random vibration, with 1&#x02013;15 Hz frequency bandwidth, for 20-minutes.

The use of the scale had been practiced beforehand and consisted of the following scores: 1=extremely alert, 2=very alert, 3=alert, 4=rather alert, 5=neither alert or sleepy, 6=some sign of sleepiness, 7=sleepy, but no effort to stay awake, 8=sleepy, some effort to stay awake, 9=very sleepy, great effort to stay awake. No conversation was permitted between the volunteer and the test leader unless in the event of an emergency. Similar procedures and sitting arrangement as in with-vibration condition with the only difference being no vibration exposure were applied for the no-vibration condition.

As mentioned in the introduction, drowsiness has been one of the primary causes of road accidents<xref rid="bib_001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, drowsiness that is caused by vehicle vibration is not well understood or investigated.</p><p>We demonstrated that the increase of human drowsiness level, measured by the six performance metrics of the PVT test and subjective sleepiness rating significantly correlated with exposure to vibration. These data support the hypothesis that exposure to vibration (random vibration with 1&#x02013;15 Hz frequency band) even for as little as 20-minutes causes drowsiness and adversely affects psychomotor performance as measured by reaction time and increases lapses of attention, both found in all eighteen volunteers. High effect sizes were observed for minor lapse (ES=0.75) which indicate large statistical and clinical differences between no-vibration and with-vibration condition. Together these findings also suggest a high degree of sensitivity for PVT metrics (mean RT and response speed 1/RT), in detecting a vibration-induced decline in alertness. It has also been reported that reaction time impairment is the most common and persistent finding in sleep deprivation and drowsiness<xref rid="bib_024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib_035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results demonstrate, for the first time that exposure to whole-body vibration is a possible mechanism for reaction-time impairment. Together these changes in RT values indicated that exposure to as little as 20-minutes of vibration reduced human alertness levels and induced significant drowsiness. This induced-drowsiness caused by vibration influenced the volunteers&#x02019; ability to respond quickly to visual stimuli. Another significant finding to emerge from this study is that PVT showed high levels of sensitivity to whole body vibration-induced changes in human drowsiness.</p><p>As expected, results from subjective measurement (KSS) also shows a significant declination of alertness level for all the volunteers after 20-minutes exposure to vibration. Increases in subjective sleepiness scores provide important corroborating evidence that exposure to 20-minutes of vibration level can steadily reduce human alertness levels that are linked to drowsiness.</p><p>In a study which set out to determine the influences of exposure to whole-body vibration on the wakefulness level, Landstrom <italic>et al.</italic> exposed the volunteers to a low frequency sinusoidal and random vibration in the vertical direction at 0.3 ms<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> r.m.s.<xref rid="bib_036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. A significant increase in theta and decrease in alpha activity were observed indicating a decrease in wakefulness level following exposure to vibration. However, the effect is more pronounced in sinusoidal vibration than random vibration. Although the transmitted vibration used in their study is differed from those used in our study, their findings are consistent with ours. The findings observed in our study also mirror those of the previous studies that have examined the effect of short-term exposure to whole-body vibration in human<xref rid="bib_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although no significant difference was observed in subjective wakefulness level using KSS, regardless with or without exposure to vibration, a significant decrease of wakefulness level was detected in objective wakefulness level during vibration exposure. These findings are in agreement with our study which showed short-term exposure to vibration for 20-minutes can cause a reduction in wakefulness level.</p><p>Various methods have been proposed in the past to assess human drowsiness and performance, such as measuring brainwave activity using electroencephalography (EEG)<xref rid="bib_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="bib_037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="bib_038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib_039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. EEG method has the ability to measure changes in brainwave power spectrum. However, the implementation of EEG in the real environment is still challenging. Brainwave activity signals measured by the electrode on the human scalp can be easily distorted by movement artefacts such as muscle activity and eye-movements<xref rid="bib_040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.

This limited frequency band is selected to improve the measures of drowsiness-inducing vibration and focus on a narrow frequency band. Furthermore. several studies also have suggested that vehicle seat&#x02019;s resonance frequency and corresponding mode shapes occur at a frequency above 15 Hz<xref rid="bib_029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore the frequency of vibration limited to 1&#x02013;15 Hz in this study to ensure that there is no interaction of vehicle seat&#x02019;s dynamics (resonance frequency and corresponding mode shapes) with the total transmitted vibration to human body measured from seat pan and seat backrest. Although the exposure time was only 20-minutes, however, findings from the current study demonstrated that constant exposure to the only vibration has considerable influence on seated occupant alertness level. The findings observed in this study mirror those of the previous studies that have examined the effect of short-term exposure to whole-body vibration on wakefulness level<xref rid="bib_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib_006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, this study does not include female participant. It would be beneficial to conduct a similar study on a group of female volunteers.</p><p>The assessment and guidelines of human body ride comfort caused by vibration are reasonably well founded in ISO 2631-1 (1997) International Standard<xref rid="bib_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Following that, the relevant weighting factor has been established to represent the human perception of vibration. Although the guidelines for health effect due to exposure to vibration are well documented, there is little quantitative research data available on the influences of vibration on seated human drowsiness. In many studies, the relationship between vibration and drowsiness has been assumed without supporting research<xref rid="bib_045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup> This study demonstrates a link between exposure to vibration and drowsiness, at least under these experimental conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first study to investigate the effects of whole-body vibration on seated human alertness and drowsiness. Our data clearly demonstrate that exposure to vibration has considerable influence on subjective sleepiness levels, and more importantly, human reaction times and lapses of attention. These findings need to be further consolidated particularly in relation to driving behaviour (steering entropy). This line of research can then assist in the development of practical and relevant guidelines for limitation of vibration exposure in the automotive industry, in an effort to reduce the burden of disease of road accidents.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib_001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name name-style="western"><surname>Horne</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name>, <name name-style="western"><surname>Reyner</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group> (<year>1995</year>) <article-title>Sleep related vehicle accidents.</article-title>
