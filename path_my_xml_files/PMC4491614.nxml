A blinded SNP dose of 0.3, 1, 2, or 3 &#x003bc;g/kg/min was infused for 30 min, followed by open-label administration for at least 90 min. Both infusions were titrated to effect.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The final intent-to-treat group comprised 203 patients. Significant reductions in mean arterial pressure (MAP) from baseline were observed for all four doses at 20 and 25 min after the start of infusion (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.009 and <italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.010 for each time, respectively). Overall, 98.5% of the patients achieved the target MAP; 72.9% first achieved the target MAP during the blinded infusion. The mean infusion rate at target MAP was 1.07 &#x003bc;g/kg/min.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We determined that 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/m is a reasonable starting dose for SNP in pediatric patients requiring controlled hypotension. The infusion rate can then be increased to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure. On the basis of our results, we found an average infusion rate of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min might be appropriate. Of note, no cyanide toxicity was reported, and no measureable cyanide levels were detected in any blood samples obtained during the study. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00135668">http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00135668</ext-link>.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>nitroprusside</kwd><kwd>pediatric</kwd><kwd>BPCA</kwd><kwd>cyanide toxicity</kwd><kwd>controlled hypotension</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">NICHD</funding-source><award-id rid="cn001">NO1-HD-4-3385</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="23"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5931"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) was first discovered in 1850, but its hypotensive effects were not noticed until 1929. Page et al. reported its first therapeutic use in 1955 (Page et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1955</xref>), and in 1962 Moraca et al. were the first to use SNP clinically to induce deliberate hypotension during surgery (Moraca et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1962</xref>). Since then, SNP has been widely used to control blood pressure in infants and children in the perioperative period, despite the lack of FDA approval for this age group in the United States. Sodium nitroprusside is the first medication to gain regulatory approval through the Best Pharmaceuticals in Children's Act (BPCA), which was enacted in 2007.</p><p>Two million surgical procedures are performed annually on children &#x0003c;15 years of age, and general anesthesia is administered in the vast majority of cases. Controlled hypotension is used in a select group of patients undergoing certain orthopedic, neurosurgical, craniofacial, ear-nose-and-throat, and burn procedures. Controlled hypotension is the stepwise, deliberate reduction of systemic arterial blood pressure in order to decrease blood loss and the need for blood transfusion and to improve visibility in the surgical field.</p><p>Blood pressure control in children is also a concern in the intensive care unit (ICU), where it is often necessary to manage arterial pressure during periods of acute physiologic stress, which occurs during and after certain surgical and medical procedures, such as aortic coarctation repair, pulmonary valve autograft (Ross) procedures, and solid organ transplantation. Control of systemic arterial pressure is also indicated in cases of hypertension associated with renal disease, drug therapy (corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents), and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</p><p>A wide variety of drugs of various therapeutic classes have been used to induce controlled hypotension in the operating room and to prevent or treat hypertension in the pediatric ICU. These drug classes include calcium channel blockers (Tobias et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>), beta-adrenergic antagonists (Kay et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), ganglionic blockers (Du Toit, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Gallagher and Milliken, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>), inhalation anesthetics (Tobias, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>), and direct-acting vasodilators such as nitroglycerin and SNP (Jones and Cole, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Taylor et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Wilson et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Tinker and Michenfelder, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Kaplan et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1980</xref>; Groshong, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Sinaiko, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Despite the frequency of their use, vasodilating agents have not generally been systematically studied in children. Sodium nitroprusside is a direct-acting vasodilator commonly used for blood pressure control. It induces vascular smooth muscle relaxation via nitric oxide production. Because SNP metabolism also liberates cyanide (CN), CN toxicity is a concern when SNP is infused at high doses and/or for prolonged periods of time, but there are little data to inform clinicians of the risks of specific infusion regimens across pediatric age groups.</p><p>We performed a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging, effect-controlled, multicenter study examining the effects of SNP in pediatric patients requiring controlled hypotension for at least 2 h during a surgical or medical procedure. Our aim was to establish the starting and maximum infusion rates that afford optimum blood pressure control and to develop a safe dosing regimen in children. The specific objectives were to (1) describe the relationship between the infusion rate of SNP and changes in blood pressure (2) to define the onset and offset of blood-pressure-lowering effects of SNP to be used to provide adequate instructions for dose titration in the pediatric population undergoing a surgical or medical procedure, and (3) to assess the safety of SNP administration in pediatric patients requiring controlled reduction of blood pressure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was approved by the IRB at each of the 11 study research centers before enrollment.

A minimum of 30 patients per treatment arm was estimated to be required to detect this difference, with 80% power to prevent a Type II error (which would incorrectly accept the null hypothesis that a statistical test would not demonstrate a treatment difference) and an overall two-sided significance level (alpha) of 0.05. If a formal interim analysis of the primary study endpoint was deemed appropriate, alpha levels of 0.03 and 0.02 would be assumed for the interim and final data reviews. On the basis of these parameters, between 40 and 50 patients per treatment arm were required. Approximately 200 patients were recruited during the course of the trial; about half were scheduled to have completed the trial by 1 year.</p><p>For the primary efficacy analysis, we used a last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach to replace missing values in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. For all secondary efficacy analyses, we used the observed data. For demographic and baseline characteristics and safety endpoints, we analyzed each variable using all available data.

During this time, patients were administered a blinded dose of SNP for up to 30 min. To improve the safety of onset of effect, the blinded dose was initiated at one-third the full randomized rate for 5 min and was then increased to two-thirds the full rate for 5 additional minutes, after which time the dose was increased to the full rate if the target blood pressure was not attained for the final 20 min of the 30-min blinded period. The blinded dose was chosen from a pre-designed randomization schedule and included doses of 0.3, 1, 2, and 3 mcg/kg/min. Blinded study drug administration was started either before or after the surgical incision. If the blinded study drug was initiated before the incision, administration was also completed prior to incision, so the incision was not made during the 30-min blinded study drug administration period. This period ended at the start of open-label study drug infusion or at the completion of the blinded infusion, if no open-label study drug was given.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Open-label study drug administration</italic>, which is also referred to as the open-label treatment phase (OTP), began with the start of open-label study drug infusion. This phase lasted at least 90 min, during which time SNP was initiated at a dose deemed appropriate by the investigator and was gradually adjusted to reach a target MAP defined by the investigator for each individual patient, in keeping with the clinical presentation and the needs of the patient. The target MAP was determined and recorded before infusion of the study drug was initiated and could not be less than 50 mmHg (or 40 mmHg for patients younger than 30 days of age). The OTP ended at the completion of open-label infusion. In some cases, patients continued to receive SNP after the period was completed when it was clinically indicated. In these cases, SNP was considered concomitant medication and not study drug.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Follow-up</italic> was started immediately after infusion of the study drug was concluded and ended after 30 days, during which time any serious adverse events (SAEs) were monitored and recorded.</p></list-item></list><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic of study flow</bold>.

infusion during the blinded study drug period. A comparison of change from baseline in MAP across the SNP dose groups is summarized by mean at baseline after 30 min, and change from baseline for the ITT population (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). This comparison includes an analysis of within-group differences. For the ITT population, administration of SNP statistically significantly reduced MAP 30 min after the start of infusion at each of the four SNP doses (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). A dose response was observed for the change in MAP from baseline 30 min after the start of infusion; larger mean reductions from baseline in MAP were observed with increasing SNP dose (0.3&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min). Notably, the reductions in MAP from baseline at the 1-, 2-, and 3-&#x003bc;g/kg/min SNP doses (&#x02212;17.0, &#x02212;20.0, and &#x02212;16.6 mmHg, respectively) were larger than the reduction observed at the 0.3-&#x003bc;g/kg/min dose (&#x02212;11 mmHg). The mean MAP over time is presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for the ITT population. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> graphically depicts our finding that all four SNP doses decreased MAP from baseline, with larger reductions seen with the 1-, 2-, and 3-&#x003bc;g/kg/min doses compared with the 0.3-&#x003bc;g/kg/min SNP dose. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> also demonstrates that increasing SNP dose produced greater reductions in MAP with increasing SNP dose (0.3&#x02013;2 &#x003bc;g/kg/min).

Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were defined as follows: an AE first observed after the initiation of the study drug (blinded or open-label) or a representation of an exacerbation (usually in severity) of a pre-existing condition observed prior to treatment. An overall summary of tolerability and AEs is provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>. All 203 patients (100.0%) experienced one or more TEAEs. Eighteen patients (8.9%) experienced one or more treatment-emergent SAEs, and 166 patients (81.8%) experienced treatment-related TEAEs (probably or possibly related).

This was an unexpected finding that could be due to the protocol design, which may have selected for non-responders, as evidenced by the number of ITT patients in the 2- and 3-&#x003bc;g/kg/min SNP dose groups (13, 23.6%; and 18, 35.3%) compared with those in the 0.3- and 1-&#x003bc;g/kg/min SNP dose groups (38, 74.5%; and 23, 46.9%).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overall, 98.5% of the patients achieved target MAP during therapy. The majority of patients (72.9%) first achieved target MAP during the blinded study drug period.</p></list-item></list><p>Our study's safety results included the following: 18 patients (8.9%) experienced one or more treatment-emergent SAEs. Vascular disorders were the most common study-drug-related TEAEs (&#x0003e;5% overall) and comprised the most common severe, specific drug-related TEAEs. Hypotension was the AE that led to the most study drug withdrawals. No patients experienced TEAEs leading to study discontinuation and no deaths occurred during the study.</p><p>An enormous safety concern is cyanide poisoning, but it can be addressed. One way the development of poisoning happens is as follows: The metabolism of SNP in red blood cells (RBCs) results in the production of 5 molecules of cyanide, one of which is then converted to thiocyanate (SCN) or is bound to methemoglobin to form cyanomethemoglobin. This conversion occurs enzymatically via two sulfur transferase systems: (1) rhodanase (the primary pathway) and (2) beta-mercaptopyruvate-cyanide sulfurtransferase (the secondary pathway). Rhodanase is ubiquitous in the body but highly concentrated in the liver. Rhodanase catalyzes the transfer of sulfur from a donor molecule such as sodium thiosulfate (NaS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) to cyanide, to form SCN, which is subsequently eliminated in the urine, where it serves as a marker of cyanide exposure. However, this conversion is limited by the availability of sulfur donor molecules. A life-saving intervention in the event of possible acute cyanide intoxication is to provide the patient exogenous sulfur donors such as Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Pasch et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Cole and Vesey, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>).</p><p>Despite the widespread use of SNP, there is a paucity of information on its safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in children. Davies et al. and Bennett and Abbott described their retrospective experience with SNP used to induce deliberate hypotension in small cohorts of children (Davies et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>; Bennett and Abbott, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Both observed that younger patients required more SNP than older ones to achieve comparable degrees of blood pressure control. In their small retrospective cohort, Bennett and Abbott recommended that doses of 10 &#x003bc;g/kg/min were necessary to achieve satisfactory blood pressure response. Davies et al described three possible responses to SNP administration in children: (1) a constant response to &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; doses &#x0003c; 3 mg/kg, (2) a tachyphylactic response characterized by continuously escalating dose requirement (&#x0003e;3 mg/kg) to achieve a satisfactory blood pressure, and (3) resistance to the blood pressure lowering effects of the drug (Davies et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1975</xref>). Yaster et al. compared SNP and nitroglycerine for inducing hypotension in a group of 14 adolescents (Yaster et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). They found that doses of SNP between 6 and 8 &#x003bc;g/kg/min were superior to doses of nitroglycerine at any dose for reliably inducing hypotension for children and adolescents undergoing scoliosis, craniofacial, or hepatic surgery.</p><p>Hersey et al. performed a randomized trial comparing SNP to the dihydropyridine calcium-channel antagonist nicardipine in 20 healthy adolescents with idiopathic scoliosis undergoing spinal fusion (Hersey et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>), and they easily obtained target blood pressures in both groups and operating conditions were comparable. They found that time-to-restoration of baseline blood pressure after termination of the infusion was significantly longer in the nicardipine group than in the SNP group, but, interestingly, blood loss was significantly greater in the SNP group. Details on SNP dose requirements were not provided. Przybylo et al. described cyanide and SCN blood levels in 10 children who received SNP at doses up to 10 &#x003bc;g/kg/min (mean infusion rate 6 &#x003bc;g/kg/min) while undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of complex congenital cardiac defects (Przybylo et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>). Cyanide levels rose as a function of time while SNP was infused and rapidly fell when SNP was discontinued. Despite the fact that some children demonstrated plasma cyanide levels above the generally accepted threshold of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL, no patients developed clinically apparent toxicity. Kazim et al. questioned the validity of the results of Przybylo et al's study because of the cyanide assay methods used (Kazim et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Linakis et al. retrospectively examined physician-ordering practices for blood cyanide levels in children receiving SNP (Linakis et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>). They sought to determine how the laboratory determinations were used to monitor patients and if there was clinically apparent toxicity in children found to have cyanide concentrations exceeding the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; limit of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/mL. They found poor correlation between blood cyanide concentration and dose or duration of therapy in patients whose cyanide levels were &#x0201c;toxic.&#x0201d; Thiocyanate determinations were normal and no child manifested signs or symptoms of cyanide toxicity. They concluded that further pediatric studies were needed.</p><p>On the basis of this study's efficacy and safety data, we make several recommendations:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>A reasonable starting dose of SNP in pediatric patients requiring deliberate induced hypotension is 0.3 &#x003bc;g/kg/min; in our study the mean infusion rate was approximately 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinicians should increase the infusion rate to achieve the desired reduction in blood pressure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Because our data demonstrate wide variability in patient responses to SNP, especially in regard to baseline MAP, basal metabolic rate, and age, clinicians should use their experience and the patient's clinical situation as a basis for determining both the starting and maintenance infusion rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Given that SNP is titrated to MAP response in most situations, SNP dosing is already implicitly individualized. However, modeling hemodynamic responses suggests ways to more rapidly achieve target MAP endpoints and also suggests that an algorithm-guided approach as opposed to the currently employed empirical dose-titration approach may be desirable.</p></list-item></list><p>In summary, individual patient dosing guidance must reflect both the target and the population.</p></sec><sec><title>The SNP investigators group</title><p>Peter Davis, MD (Children's Hospital of Pittsburg), Shoba Malviya, MD (Mott Hospital, Ann Arbor, MI), Lynne Maxwell, MD (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia), David McLeod, MD (Duke University Medical Center), Gary Scott, MD (Children's Hospital Los Angeles), David A.
