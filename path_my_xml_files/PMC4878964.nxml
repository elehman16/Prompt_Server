At the end of treatment, the results showed that only seizure frequency of the control group was decreased than that before treatment, while the intervention group showed not only the significantly decreased seizure frequency, but also the significantly decreased scores of anxiety and depression, while family dynamics, family functions SRS were improved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study found that the seizure frequency of the control group was significantly decreased after treatment (p&#x0003c;0.05), indicating the effects of AEDs in treating epilepsy alone, consistent with the literatures.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> This study also found that compared with the control group, the seizure frequency of the intervention group was decreased much more significantly, and the difference was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05), indicating that the efficacies of AEDs combined with SFT were much better than single AED in controlling seizures.<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>Meanwhile, the scores of anxiety and depression of the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group, and the reasons might include: 1) the decreased seizure frequencies of adolescents with epilepsy made the patients' fears and tensions towards the disease eased;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> 2) the family dynamic characteristics, family functions and social support were changed. The alleviation of anxiety was related with the improvements of family sentiments, as well as the increased democracy, openness and subjective support of family behaviors; the alleviation of depression was related with the improvements of family sentiments, the increased subjective support, and the transition of behavioral control from severity to democracy.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The study also found that anxiety and depression interacted, and exhibited the parallel relationships.<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Thirdly, this study found that the family dynamics, family functions and social support of the intervention group had changed, among which the family functions of the intervention group were significantly improved,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and the communication among family members was clear and effective, the role-division was clear, with mutual acceptance, appropriate emotional responses and clear boundary, so that the problem-solving skills were improved, and the execution of family tasks was enhanced, the abilities of adapting the changes when the tasks changed were improved. It was also found during the intervention process that the parental modes of rearing epileptic teenagers changed a lot, the emotional comfort from parents was increased, while the excessive interference, rejection and punishments were reduced, therefore the family environments were improved, the communication ways between young people with their parents were changed, and the patients' life qualities were significantly improved. This study found that the overall social support, material and financial support, subjectively-felt support and utilization rates towards various supports of the intervention group were significantly increased, indicating that SFT increased the overall social support towards the adolescents with epilepsy, and the patients subjectively felt that they were more understood, as well as morally respected and supported.<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>In addition, the control group also showed some changes of family dynamics, family functions and social support before and after treatment, the system logic, overall functions, behavior control, emotional reactions and problem solving all developed towards positive directions, while the family atmosphere, individualization, disease concepts, emotional involvement, roles, communications and total score of family functions were deteriorated towards the worse directions, which further validated the family theory, crisis theory and Josselson separation-individualization theory, indicating that the ADAE's abilities of family self-regulation and repairing were limited, therefore the SFT intervention was necessary.<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>This study showed that if the seizure frequency was decreased, anxiety and depression were relieved, the family atmosphere would be pleasant and relaxed, the mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual relations among family members, as well as social supports actually obtained and felt, would be increased, and these changes would also further promote the declining of seizures frequency, and vice versa. Therefore, the factors that caused the mood changes of ADAE were not isolated and static, but interrelated, dynamic and cause-effect circulated; they were not linear, while formed a ring-feedback process, interrelated, mutually restricted and mutually influenced, the SFT intervention was feasible and effective towards ADAE.<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>In summary, SFT theory and techniques were the main reasons towards the remarkable results achieved in this study, the therapists should establish stable and good therapeutic relationships with the epileptic youth and their family members on the basis of maintaining "neutrality". At the same time, the patients should not be considered as the family troublemakers, on the contrary, they were just the bearers, expressors and victims of "system problems", the treatments should not target the inner conflicts and personality traits of individuals, but should actively look for the breaking points of "disturbance" from the view of family. Finally, this study introduced the system theory, information theory and cybernetics to induce "the second level change" of families, namely fundamentally changed the disordered family dynamics model; the intervention targeted directly towards the rigid, aging, or invalid family structures and disordered family relationships, used the differentiated questioning, circulation questioning, feedforward questioning, alteration and explanation, symptom prescriptions, positive meaning assignment and homework to make the family behaviors re-assign their meanings, promote the family members to change the family "rules", improve their family dynamics, family functions, family relationships and social support, thus encouraging every member to develop the effects possessed by the resources inside them as much as possible.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by Science and Technology research project of Chongqing Municipal Educational Commission (No.
