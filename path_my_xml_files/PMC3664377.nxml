After run-in, patients were randomised (2:2:1) to one of three treatments: FF/VI 100/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g (representing an emitted dose of 92/22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) or FF/VI 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g (emitted dose 184/22&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) once daily in the evening or fluticasone propionate (FP) 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily for 52&#x02005;weeks. FF/VI was administered via a dry powder inhaler (DPI) and FP was administered by DISKUS/ACCUHALER. To maintain blinding of the treatment schedule, a double-dummy system was employed with a placebo DISKUS/ACCUHALER administered to patients receiving FF/VI and a placebo DPI administered to patients receiving FP. Following randomisation, patients attended clinic during Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, 36, 44 and 52. A follow-up assessment was performed 1&#x02005;week after completing study medication. Adherence with study treatment (using the device dose counters) was assessed throughout the treatment period.</p><p>The central randomisation schedule was generated by the sponsor using a validated computerised system (RandALL; GlaxoSmithKline, UK).

A severe asthma exacerbation was defined according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society taskforce guidelines as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids for &#x02265;3&#x02005;days, or an inpatient hospitalisation or emergency room visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The rate of oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis was diagnosed by oral examination (each visit); where the investigator suspected oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis a confirmatory culture specimen was taken. A positive culture was required for oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis to be reported as an AE.</p><p>Clinical laboratory assessments, including non-fasting glucose, potassium, liver function tests and 24-h urinary cortisol (UC) excretion were completed prior to treatment and at Weeks 12, 28 and 52 or early withdrawal. UC was measured by an inhouse liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (Quest Diagnostics, Valencia, California, USA). Electrocardiogram (ECG) assessment (heart rate [HR] and QTc[F], each measured 10&#x02005;min post dose) was completed at screening, at Weeks 2, 12, 28 and 52 or early withdrawal. Holter monitoring (subset of &#x0223c;50% patients) for 24 h was completed at screening, baseline, and Weeks 28 and 52 or early withdrawal. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate) were measured prior to treatment and 10&#x02005;min post dose at every visit.</p><p>Ophthalmic assessments were completed by a qualified ophthalmologist at screening, Week 28 and Week 52 or early withdrawal. Examinations of posterior subcapsular opacity, cortical opacity, nuclear colour and nuclear opalescence were conducted using the Lens Opacities Classification System, Version III (LOCS III).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Separate assessments for intraocular pressure and visual acuity (LogMAR) were also undertaken.</p><p>Plasma concentrations of FF and VI and derived pharmacokinetic parameters were reported, however, they are not presented in this manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>With safety the primary objective of the study, formal sample size calculation was not performed. The recruitment target was determined based on International Conference Harmonisation guidelines and feasibility considerations. Randomisation was planned for 200 patients to each FF/VI group, and 100 patients to the FP group. Assuming a maximum 30% withdrawal rate during the 52-week treatment period, it was expected at least 140 patients in each FF/VI group and 70 patients in the FP group would have exposure data for the full 52&#x02005;weeks. Further information regarding the sample size estimation is provided in the online supplementary material.</p><p>The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients randomised to treatment who received at least one dose of study drug (primary population for all data displays). The UC population consisted of patients in the ITT population whose urine samples at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment did not have confounding factors that would affect interpretation of results (see online supplementary material). Statistical analyses were performed for 24-h UC, HR, QTc(F), blood pressure and pulse rate. The relative safety of each FF/VI dose was evaluated by assessing the confidence intervals for the treatment differences compared with the marketed benchmark, FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily for these endpoints and p values were provided for descriptive purposes. For all other endpoints, summary statistics were evaluated.

However, examination of patients with increases in pulse &#x0003e;20&#x02005;bpm revealed considerable inter-visit variability; increases occurred sporadically (usually at one or two visits) during the study and no treatment-related patterns were evident.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>ECG</title><p>Statistically significant increases in HR with FF/VI were also reported versus FP (differences between FF/VI and FP ranged from 4.1&#x02005;bpm [95% CI 1.9 to 6.4] to 5.9&#x02005;bpm [95% CI 3.3 to 8.5]; p&#x0003c;0.001).

asthma showed that FF/VI 100/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g or 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g, dosed once daily in the evening, was well tolerated. We compared the safety and tolerability profile following FF/VI to that obtained with FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily. FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g has been shown to improve lung function in patients with asthma and 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily is the highest recommended dosage for treating patients with asthma symptomatic on low-dose ICS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> In an earlier phase II study, FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily had a similar efficacy to FF 200&#x02005;&#x000b5;g once daily (vs placebo) in patients with persistent moderate-to-severe asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> However, FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily is associated with more steroid-associated AEs than lower FP doses<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref> and this dose of FP was therefore selected in our study as a benchmark to which FF/VI safety data could be compared.</p><p>The patient population contained a wide age range (12&#x02013;73&#x02005;years) in order to adequately assess the safety and tolerability of FF/VI in adolescent and adult patients with asthma. In addition, the majority of patients had not experienced an asthma exacerbation (all severities) in the past 12&#x02005;months.</p><p>The number of withdrawals due to an AE was similar across treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2012202606F1">figure 1</xref>). The most frequently reported AE was headache and upper respiratory tract infection, and the frequency was generally similar across treatment groups. The frequency of SAEs was also similar across treatment groups. One SAE with FP (worsening hepatitis B) was considered by the investigator to be possibly treatment related. However, this SAE on FP is not substantiated by reports in the current literature and has not been identified as a potential AE associated with FP therapy in asthma.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>More patients on FF/VI reported the AE of oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis than those receiving FP. However, the lower rate of oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis with FP versus FF/VI is not consistent with rates of this AE in other studies of FP when dosed at 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> Additionally, in earlier phase II studies of FF in asthma, the incidence of oral candidiasis was generally similar to FP at doses of FF &#x02264;600&#x02005;&#x000b5;g once daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7">5&#x02013;7</xref> Other potential effects of long-term ICS use include increased intraocular pressure and cataract formation. Extensive study-specific ophthalmic examinations reported no apparent effects with FF/VI or FP.</p><p>There was little change from baseline in UC excretion in any treatment group. However, UC ratios to baseline in patients on FP were lower compared with FF/VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2012202606F3">figure 3</xref>). The reduction from baseline UC with FP was significantly different compared with FF/VI at Weeks 12 and 28 but not at Week 52 suggesting that UC excretion had recovered to pre-treatment levels in these patients (UC population). Prior to randomisation the majority of patients were receiving medium-dose ICS (data not shown), therefore FP 500&#x02005;&#x000b5;g twice daily (high dose) may have been a &#x02018;step-up&#x02019; for these patients. Although not formally evaluated in this study, such a &#x02018;step-up&#x02019; in treatment may account, at least in part, for the observed excretion ratios to baseline with FP observed at Weeks 12 and 28 in this study. However, it is important to note that the majority of patients had &#x02018;normal&#x02019; or &#x02018;no change&#x02019; in 24-h UC excretion at any post-baseline visit. Treatment compliance was very high throughout the study (including inter-visit assessments), suggesting that changes in patients&#x02019; level of compliance to FP study medication during the study is an unlikely reason for the UC excretion observations reported with FP at Weeks 12, 28 and 52.</p><p>Statistically significant differences with FF/VI versus FP were reported for HR (by ECG) and pulse rate (both measured at T<sub>max</sub>). However, the increases in pulse rate were reported only sporadically during the study (one or two visits only). Furthermore, the ECG HR findings observed post dose are consistent with that observed with other inhaled agonists at the &#x003b2;-agonist receptor. No increases in HR by 24-h Holter monitoring were observed, and the increases in HR by ECG, although statistically significant versus FP, were not considered to be clinically significant. No clinically significant effects on QTc(F) outputs were observed during the study with FF/VI versus FP. Indeed, adjusted mean change from baseline in QTc(F) with FF/VI 100/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g ranged from 1.2 to 5.7 FF/VI 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and for FF 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g was &#x02013;0.8 to 3.8&#x02005;msec. The QTc(F) results for FF/VI 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g are similar to results from a placebo-controlled cardiac safety study (FF/VI 800/100&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) in healthy subjects where time-matched mean differences from placebo with FF/VI 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g in QTc(F) were &#x0003c;5&#x02005;msec.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> NSVT was reported in 2% of patients on FF/VI 100/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and FF/VI 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and no patients on FP. However, a 2% incidence is not greater than the expected (&#x02018;background&#x02019;) rate of 1&#x02013;3% in healthy subjects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17 R18 R19">17&#x02013;19</xref> These episodes of NSVT were isolated and short (3&#x02013;7 beats) with only one patient having two episodes (3 and 4 beats). No clinically relevant decreases in potassium or increases in non-fasting glucose were observed.</p><p>An important strength of this study is the 52-week duration which provides useful information on the longer-term safety and tolerability effects of FF/VI in patients with asthma. Another is the double-dummy, double-blind design, which avoids bias in reporting of AEs. Measuring HR 10&#x02005;min post dose following FF/VI administration is an advantage as this permitted evaluation of the maximum potential effect of VI (at the T<sub>max</sub>) on HR. A study limitation is that more information on treatment effects on pulse rate and HR (by ECG) would have been collected had measurements been taken over a 24-h period post dose, not just at 10 min post dose. Another is that we did not include an active LABA comparator; however current treatment guidelines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> recommend against the use of LABA monotherapy in asthma due to a possible increased risk of severe exacerbation. Also, some patients in the study had moderate asthma so for these patients the FP dose was very high (1000&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/day). However, a lower daily dose of FP for 52&#x02005;weeks would have been a &#x02018;step down&#x02019; for the majority of patients who had more severe asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, both doses of FF/VI (100/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g and 200/25&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) administered once daily over 52&#x02005;weeks were well tolerated by patients &#x02265;12&#x02005;years of age with asthma. The overall safety profile observed with FF/VI did not reveal unusual or unexpected findings of significant clinical concern. Safety findings that were observed reflected the expected pharmacological activity of the ICS and LABA components.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2012-202606-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1911" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.
