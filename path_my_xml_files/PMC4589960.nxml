A relationship between vitamin-D insufficiency and osteoporosis as well as increased risk of bone fractures has been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, low vitamin-D levels are connected to the development of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], multiple sclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and maintenance of a healthy immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although the specific mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.</p><p>It is well known that both muscle strength and vitamin-D levels decrease with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Low vitamin-D levels are associated with decreased muscle strength and poor physical function in elderly individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, it has been proposed that vitamin-D plays an important role for obtaining optimal skeletal muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Expression of the vitamin-D receptor (VDR) in skeletal muscle tissue has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, recent data strongly indicate that VDR is expressed in C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], in murine skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and <italic>in situ</italic> detection of VDR in human skeletal muscle points towards a role of vitamin-D on muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, VDR has been located in skeletal muscle cells that promote <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Addition of the active form of vitamin-D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>)) to C2C12 myotubes has been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis and Akt/mTOR-signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], down-regulate the expression of Myostatin and increase the size of myosin heavy chain (MHC) type II positive myotubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, vitamin-D signaling has been reported to alter gene expression and increase C2C12 myotube size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These findings support the hypothesis that vitamin-D has a direct positive effect on the contractile filaments and thus muscle strength. Furthermore, preliminary data from another exercise experiment in our lab suggest that resistance exercise increases mRNA expression of VDR and 25-hydroxy vitamin-D (25(OH)D) hydroxylase cytochrome p450 27B1 (CYP27B1), which is responsible for converting the inactive form of vitamin-D, 25(OH)D, to the active form, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, further supporting a positive role for vitamin-D in skeletal muscle.</p><p>Studies in humans have shown positive effects of concomitant intake of vitamin-D on muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and intramyonuclear VDR level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] in vitamin-D insufficient individuals. Moreover, it has been shown that vitamin-D intake increases cross sectional area (CSA) of skeletal muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], the diameter and number of type II muscle fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and specifically type IIa fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, it appears that elderly vitamin-D insufficient people may benefit the most from vitamin-D intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] whereas young people might not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>Based on these findings we wanted to examine the hypothesis that vitamin-D is important for the hypertrophic response to resistance exercise; specifically whether serum vitamin-D levels may influence the muscular response to resistance training. UVB radiation from the sun is the primary source for vitamin-D production and is very low at northern latitudes from September to April [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The resulting seasonal fluctuations in serum vitamin-D levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] could influence muscle strength and function. If this is so, it is possible that low serum vitamin-D levels during the winter months could partly blunt the positive effect of resistance training, and in such case, vitamin-D supplementation could be important for maximizing improvements in skeletal muscle mass and strength during resistance training.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether vitamin-D intake during 12&#x000a0;weeks of resistance training has an additive effect on muscle hypertrophy and strength. We hypothesized that intake of vitamin-D plus calcium would improve the outcome of three months of resistance training in healthy untrained individuals resulting in greater muscle strength and hypertrophy compared to a training control-group supplemented with calcium alone (placebo). Moreover, we hypothesized that resistance exercise would increase the mRNA expression of VDR and CYP27B1. The study included a group of young and a group of elderly individuals to elucidate a possible blunted hypertrophic response in the aging muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy, sedentary young (aged 20&#x02013;30 years) and elderly (aged 60&#x02013;75 years) Caucasian men living within the local community in Copenhagen, Denmark, were recruited through newspaper and web advertisements.

Inclusion was continuous from November 17, 2010 to December 21, 2010 and the last subject completed the study on April 25, 2011. Thus, the study was conducted in a period of low UVB irradiation from sunlight. Participants were informed about the study protocol, the risks of tests and investigations, and their rights according to the Declaration of Helsinki II. The study protocol was approved by Research Ethics Committee Region Hovedstaden Committee F (H-2-2010-100) and by the Danish Data Protection Agency (2011-41-5965). All participants gave written informed consent.

The placebo-group received an equivalent dose of calcium by consuming two calcium tablets (400&#x000a0;mg per tablet) (Basic, Unikalk, Frederiksvaerk, DK). The two tablets were taken simultaneously at the same time each day together with a meal. Tablets containing vitamin-D plus calcium or calcium alone were indistinguishable and only labeled with the name of the manufacturer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Training protocol</title><p>Participants were subjected to 36 training sessions (12&#x000a0;weeks with 3 sessions/week) consisting of 5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min warm-up on cycle ergometers followed by resistance training exercises of the lower extremities performed in commercial knee extension and leg press devices (Technogym, Super Executive Line, Gambettola, Italy). All sessions were supervised. Progressive loading levels were monitored continuously and adjusted throughout the entire training period to maintain muscle loading at the intended values.</p><p>Prior to commencement of training, 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength was estimated from a 5-repetition-maximum (5RM) test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The 5RM test was performed every two weeks, to ensure that the training load was relative to the strength progression throughout the training period. During the first 6 training sessions, participants completed 3 sets of 12&#x02013;15 repetitions at 65&#x02013;70&#x000a0;% of 1RM. During session 7&#x02013;12, participants performed 3 sets of 10&#x02013;12 repetitions at 70&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% of 1RM, increasing to 4 sets at 70&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% of 1RM during session 13&#x02013;18.

The exercises were performed in a moderate slow, controlled manner with 1&#x02013;2 s in the concentric- and eccentric phase with a rest of 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min between sets. Exercise compliance (sets, repetitions, and load) was calculated from daily exercise records completed by the instructors at each training session. Participants were informed that a mean attendance of less than 2 training sessions per week resulted in exclusion. All adverse events associated with the training intervention were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analyses</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>CSA of quadriceps muscle</title><p>CSA of quadriceps muscle was measured pre (week 0) and post (week 12) training intervention. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) (3.0&#x000a0;T, T1-weighted, Radiographic department, Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark) was conducted to obtain six images starting at the tibia plateau and proceeding proximally to the mid/proximal femur. Each slice was 6&#x000a0;mm thick and the distance between each slice was 54&#x000a0;mm. The slice tangential to the tibia plateau was used as an anatomical marker (first slice) and the subsequent slices were numbered slice-by-slice proximally. The fourth axial slice of the thigh was selected for further analysis. To avoid any effect of body fluid disturbances directly related to the preceding exercise session, the MRI-scans were performed no sooner than 48&#x000a0;h post exercise and before the biopsies were taken. CSA images of both legs were analyzed for changes from pre to post training by manually drawing margins of the quadriceps muscle (Osirix, open-source 32 bit, Pixmeo SARL, Geneva, Switzerland) and a mean of both legs was calculated. Images from one participant were analyzed in succession to ensure uniform measure technique. Analyses were performed blinded according to trial group and time point. Whether the pre- or post picture was analyzed first was randomized.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Isometric muscle strength</title><p>All participants were familiarized with the strength test at inclusion in order to reduce any learning effects. Isometric knee extension peak torque of both legs was measured pre and post 12&#x000a0;weeks training with the participants sitting in a custom-made rigid chair with hips and knees flexed to 90&#x000b0;. To avoid movement or unwanted contribution of other muscles, participants were strapped at the hip and the abdomen. A leg cuff, connected to a strain gauge (Bofors KRG-4, Bofors, Sweden) through a rigid steel rod perpendicular to the lower leg, was mounted on the lower leg just above the medial malleolus. The signal from the strain gauge was amplified (Noraxon Telemyo 2400&#x000a0;T&#x000a0;G2) and sent to a computer to analyze the greatest force (N) for each participant (Myoresearch, XP Master Edition 1.07.25). Lever arm was defined as the distance from the joint line of the knee to the middle of the leg cuff. After a 5-min warm-up on a cycle ergometer and 2&#x02013;3 submaximal pre-test-measurements, each leg was measured 3 times with 2&#x000a0;min rest between each measurement. Participants were randomized to start with either the left or the right leg.</p><p>On the basis of the quadriceps CSA and isometric strength measurement, isometric strength/CSA was calculated as an expression of muscle quality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Serum 25(OH)D concentrations</title><p>Blood samples were obtained at baseline (week &#x02212;4) and after 0, 2, 6 and 12&#x000a0;weeks of resistance training.

At week 12, two biopsies were taken; 4&#x000a0;h (TR+4h) and 48&#x000a0;h (TR+48h) after the last exercise session, respectively. The biopsies were obtained using a 4-mm biopsy needle (Bergstr&#x000f6;m, Stockholm, Sweden). Briefly, the skin was shaved and disinfected before local anesthetization (1&#x000a0;% lidocaine). An incision was made through which the muscle biopsy was taken. Afterwards, the incision was strapped with SteaStrips and covered with waterproof plaster. The muscle specimen was quickly freed from any visible blood, fat or connective tissue and subsequently divided in two; one piece was mounted in Tissue-Tek and frozen in precooled isopentane, the other piece was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Both pieces were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Fiber type analysis</title><p>Cross sections (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m) were cut from the muscle specimen mounted in Tissue-Tek in a cryomicrotome (HM 560, Microm, Germany) at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and stained for myofibrillar ATPase at pH&#x000a0;9.4 after both alkaline (pH&#x000a0;10.3) and acid (pH&#x000a0;4.3 and 4.6) pre-incubations as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. All samples were stained in the same batch to avoid inter-assay variations. Muscle fiber type and size were analyzed in a blinded fashion. Only true horizontal fibers were analyzed for size. Thereby, slightly fewer fibers could be analyzed for size (202&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7 fibers per biopsy, mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD) than for type (204&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4 fibers per biopsy). As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], muscle fibers were characterized as type I, IIa, or IIx based on the ATPase staining pattern. Tema Image-analyses System (Scanbeam, Denmark) was used to analyze the cross sections for muscle fiber type and size. The fiber type distributions and mean fiber CSA were calculated. Muscle fiber morphology analysis included determination of fiber type % and mean CSA. Type IIa and IIx fiber results were pooled to yield the combined type II fiber area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measurement of mRNA</title><p>The mRNA expression of VDR, CYP27B1 and Myostatin was measured using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Approximately 20&#x000a0;mg of muscle tissue was homogenized in 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, RT 118) using a FastPrep 24 (MP Biomedicals), with muscle tissue placed in a 2&#x000a0;ml microvial with a screw cap (BioSpec) containing one silicium-carbide crystal and five 2.3&#x000a0;mm steel beads. Thereafter, 1-Bromo-3-chloropropane (BCP) was added to the homogenized sample to separate the sample into an aqueous and an organic phase. The RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase using isopropanol, washed with ethanol, and dissolved in RNase-free water. The RNA was then re-precipitated using sodium acetate (NaAc), washed in ethanol, and dissolved in RNase-free water.

The lack of an additive effect of vitamin-D on skeletal muscle function in elderly with training could also reflect a blunted response in the aging muscle. Therefore, in designing this study it was important that vitamin-D intake and resistance training were optimal for increasing serum 25(OH)D, and strength and hypertrophy parameters, respectively, and that both young and old subjects were investigated.</p><p>Whereas studies have shown muscular improvements of vitamin-D plus calcium intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], three studies on vitamin-D without concomitant calcium supplementation showed no gain in muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], suggesting that calcium is a prerequisite for the vitamin-D effect on skeletal muscle. Furthermore, control groups receiving calcium supplements alone have shown no increase in muscle strength. Thus, in the present study calcium was given to both groups. Calcium absorption is vitamin-D dependent. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that calcium plays a role in the skeletal muscles outcome, along with the proposed effect of vitamin-D.</p><p>The optimal dose of vitamin-D supplementation and optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations are widely discussed, and recommendations regarding vitamin-D intake vary depending on age and grade of sufficiency, ranging from 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day in infants to 250 &#x003bc;g/day in adults with severe insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. But clearly, a dose&#x02013;response relationship exists between daily dose and increments in serum 25(OH)D concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 50&#x000a0;nmol/L are defined as vitamin-D insufficiency and concentrations around 90&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nmol/L are reported to be optimal for lower extremity strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. This study examined what effect supplemental vitamin-D intake might have on a population with sufficient 25(OH)D concentrations and not merely vitamin-D-insufficient subjects. Only the mean serum 25(OH)D for the young vitamin-D group at baseline (week -4) showed insufficiency (41.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.5&#x000a0;nmol/L), whereas the elderly vitamin-D group had a baseline 25(OH)D concentration of 70.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;16.0&#x000a0;nmol/L. The maximal increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration in absolute numbers, taking the variation into account, for the young and elderly were almost the same (32.8&#x000a0;nmol/L and 40.5&#x000a0;nmol/L, young and elderly, respectively). As the increase in serum 25(OH)D leveled off in the vitamin-D groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) the baseline levels determined the maximal concentration achieved. Thus, it could be argued that the vitamin-D dose should have been further increased throughout the study. However, with the vitamin-D supplementation we did achieve serum 25(OH)D concentrations for the vitamin-D groups (maximal concentrations: 74.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6&#x000a0;nmol/L and 111.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.2&#x000a0;nmol/L, young and elderly, respectively) that are expected to be close to optimal for improved muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], and a further increase in vitamin-D dose would have been impossible due to the recommendations from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority. Importantly, the mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations for the young and elderly placebo groups were significantly lower (50.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2 and 66.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.4&#x000a0;nmol/L, respectively) and thus suboptimal. Therefore, with the intake of 48&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day in the present study, significant differences in serum 25(OH)D concentrations between the two groups, vitamin-D and placebo, were reached thus making it possible to examine potential differences in the response to resistance training due to concentrations of 25(OH)D. It should be noted that applying chromatography-mass spectrometry could be a more precise method of measuring serum 25(OH)D than the ELISA-kit used in the current study. However, all samples were measured at the same time with the ELISA-kit, which strengthens the data, and most importantly as vitamin-D<sub>3</sub> is given the ELISA-kit includes measurement of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Significant increases in CSA of quadriceps muscle in both young and elderly men were achieved. The increase in CSA in the young and in the elderly men is in line with the expected outcome of 12&#x000a0;weeks resistance training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A parameter that may affect the measurement of the CSA is the location of the analyzed slice from the MRI-scan. Therefore, in the present study the CSA of the quadriceps muscle was measured in the middle third of the thigh, as the greatest increase is known to occur in this location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The isometric strength of the quadriceps muscle increased in the young and the elderly after 12&#x000a0;weeks of resistance training. The increase for the young men (6.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.8&#x000a0;% and 8.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9&#x000a0;%, vitamin-D and placebo, respectively) is slightly less than what has been reported previously in resistance training studies in healthy untrained young men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], whereas the increase in the elderly is in line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Taking increase in CSA and isometric muscle strength into account, we believe that the training protocol applied has been optimal for gaining skeletal muscle mass and strength. In contrary to our hypothesis, no evidence for an additive effect of vitamin-D supplementation was seen on the CSA or isometric muscle strength of the quadriceps muscle in either the young or elderly men. It could be argued that the lack of effects of vitamin-D supplementation is due to lack of power in the analysis. However, when correlating the mean serum 25(OH)D concentration throughout the training period to quadriceps CSA or isometric strength no correlation was seen, indicating that serum 25(OH)D concentrations within sufficient concentrations do not affect skeletal muscle hypertrophy or strength improvements during resistance training. If muscle strength increases more than muscle CSA the muscle quality increases, indicating that the present muscle mass has improved the ability to exert muscle force. Thus, calculating muscle strength/CSA gives an estimate of the muscle quality. Comparing young and elderly, the elderly vitamin-D supplemented subjects improved their muscle quality more than the young vitamin-D group during the 12 weeks resistance training. This indicates that when performing resistance exercise, elderly subjects may benefit more from vitamin-D supplementation than young counterparts.</p><p>Muscle fiber type specific hypertrophy in response to resistance training of both slow-twitch type I fibers and fast-twitch type II fibers has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>], but most studies find hypertrophy of primarily type II fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. After 12 weeks resistance training, a muscle fiber type switch occurred from IIx muscle fibers towards IIa muscle fibers (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> and 5b). This is recognized as a normal response to resistance training. Again, this may indicate that the training intervention was effectively recruiting even the fastest motor units (type IIx fibers). In the elderly vitamin-D group, no decrease in fiber type IIx was seen. This is most likely caused by a small number of fiber type IIx at week 0, pre training, thus a significant decrease was difficult to detect. Increases in the mean area of type II fibers, but also type I fibers, in the young men also indicate an effective resistance training (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5c</xref>). However, the elderly men did not show any increase in type I or type II fiber mean area. From the ANOVA test of type II mean area in the elderly there was a tendency towards a time-point effect (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.074), so it can be speculated that the training period in the present study was too short for the elderly. Thus, a longer training period for the elderly could lead to a significant increase in the mean area of type II fibers as seen in the young.</p><p>In response to vitamin-D, previous human studies have reported an effect on the mean area of type II fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and fiber type switch from IIx towards IIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the young men, a significantly greater change in the percentage of type IIa fibers was seen in the vitamin-D group compared to the placebo group, indicating a positive effect from vitamin-D intake on the muscle fiber type morphology. However, as previously mentioned this difference was not translated into significantly greater muscle strength of the vitamin-D group compared to the placebo group. It should be noted that in the present study the improved muscle function has been measured as isometric muscle strength (force). Therefore, muscle power (force x speed) rather than muscle strength (force) could be a more functional measure for improvements in type II fibers if vitamin-D should have a selective effect on type II fibers as previously indicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Myostatin mRNA expression was decreased 4&#x000a0;h after the last exercise session, which was an expected finding. Interestingly however, 12&#x000a0;weeks of vitamin-D supplementation decreased the Myostatin mRNA expression compared to the placebo group in the young men. Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle mass, hence a decrease in Myostatin expression could induce a more positive balance between skeletal muscle protein synthesis and breakdown. Our finding on Myostatin mRNA level points towards a positive effect of vitamin-D intake on skeletal muscle mass and is in line with what has been seen in C2C12 myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Decreased Myostatin mRNA expression due to vitamin-D supplementation was only seen in the young men, thus an aging effect could exist but needs further investigation.</p><p>In contrary to our hypothesis, we did not see any increase in VDR mRNA expression in response to resistance training or in response to vitamin-D intake. Only the elderly showed a tendency towards an increased VDR mRNA expression 4&#x000a0;h after the last exercise session. The CYP27B1 mRNA expression was decreased in the elderly vitamin-D group post training. This could be a negative feedback mechanism from high serum concentrations of 25(OH)D (111.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.2&#x000a0;nmol/L) for the elderly vitamin-D group. Thus, the active form of vitamin-D (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>) would be expected to be present in sufficient quantities and thereby decrease the need for the converting enzyme CYP27B1. The young vitamin-D group did not show a decrease in CYP27B1 mRNA expression post training. This may be explained by lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations (71.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.1&#x000a0;nmol/L) compared to the elderly vitamin-D group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Perspectives</title><p>Without any exercise intervention, previous studies have shown a positive effect of vitamin-D intake on improved skeletal muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, these studies focused on vitamin-D-insufficient subjects, whereas in the present study the subjects were vitamin-D sufficient. Our primary findings, muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy, are in line with previous studies on elderly where the additive effect of vitamin-D and exercise training is examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], although the interventions in those studies have not been optimal for improving skeletal muscle function. In the present study, a progressive resistance training protocol was applied to attain an optimal gain in muscle strength and mass. Thus, any possible additive effect of vitamin-D on strength and hypertrophy could be overruled by the substantial effect of resistance training.</p><p>Previous studies seem to indicate that it is important to monitor vitamin-D levels in frail vitamin-D-insufficient subjects to maintain skeletal muscle function. This study indicates that high (vitamin-D groups) or low (placebo groups) vitamin-D levels within the sufficient range (above 50&#x000a0;nmol/L) results in the same muscle strength and mass gain from resistance training. Despite the lack of effect on our primary outcome, we still found that vitamin-D supplementation had a positive effect on muscle quality of the elderly and muscle fiber type morphology and Myostatin mRNA expression of the young subjects. This indicates that vitamin-D is involved in skeletal muscle remodeling and could be more important for certain age groups or vitamin-D insufficient subjects. Thus, studies have yet to elucidate to what extent vitamin-D intake could add to an improved skeletal muscle function in vitamin-D-insufficient and frail elderly when applied to resistance training or rehabilitation. Thus, vitamin-D intake in such subjects could be an important co-factor in fighting sarcopenia with resistance training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations for muscle function improvements were reached in vitamin-D supplemented healthy untrained young and elderly men. Despite this, no additive effect of vitamin-D supplementation was seen on the increase in quadriceps CSA or isometric strength from 12&#x000a0;weeks progressive resistance training in either the young or elderly men. However, vitamin-D intake during resistance training increased muscle quality in elderly men, and improved fiber type morphology and decreased Myostatin mRNA expression in young men. The latter may indicate an effect of vitamin-D on regulation of skeletal muscle mass, yet further investigations are required to explore this connection.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12986_2015_29_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Hypertrophy and strength comparison Young vs. Elderly of % change from pre-values. p-values from two-way ANOVA test show outcome for main effects of Age and Vitamin-D, respectively, and interaction (Age x Vitamin-D). * different from Young. # different from Placebo.
