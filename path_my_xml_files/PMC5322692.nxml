Particularly, strontium chloride (SC) and potassium nitrate (KN) are reported to reduce skin and tooth sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to compare the anti-irritant effects of four inorganic salts and assign the ingredient which can suppress skin irritation due to chemical or environmental exposure, more effectively. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of SC, strontium nitrate (SN), KN, and zinc chloride (ZC).</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This double-blind trial was conducted on 32 healthy volunteers with sensitive skin. Irritation was induced by 24 h exposure with 1.0% sodium lauryl sulfate on arms. Treatments were applied by an ointment of SN, SC hexahydrate, KN, and ZC and their 1%, 3%, and 5% (w/v) concentrations were prepared. The dosage was twice daily for 6 days to the irritated areas. Skin reactions were evaluated instrumentally.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>SC had a beneficial effect that was significant overall. All other treatments exert a protective effect in skin barrier function but not significantly. With the exception of ZC, all test substances improved skin hydration but the effect of SC was significant. In respect of colorimetric assessment, all treatments, excluding ZC, reduced erythema significantly compared with an untreated control 7 days after treatment start. There was no support for a dose-response effect.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Analysis of the biometric measurements revealed that the strontium salts are best, not treating is worst, and there is little difference between the other treatments. Hence, the skin care products containing SC and SN may reduce the signs and symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anti-irritation</kwd><kwd>contact dermatitis</kwd><kwd>potassium nitrate</kwd><kwd>sensitive skin</kwd><kwd>strontium chloride</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Approximately, 40&#x02013;50% of the population believes to possess the characteristics of sensitive skin. Itching, burning, stinging, and tightness are the most common complaints.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition to chemical and environmental causes of skin irritation, many people have an inherent sensitivity or genetic predisposition to skin irritants.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The sensory reactions of consumers to common products such as health and beauty products strongly influence their purchasing decisions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Manufacturers of skin care products have made available a large variety of products which are designed for persons with sensitive skin.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] So-called anti-irritants (AIs) are widely used in cosmetic formulations, with the aim of reducing irritation from substances in the formulation. It may also be claimed that they are &#x0201c;soothing&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;healing&#x0201d; ingredients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Some of the most popular ingredients used in these products are minerals and botanical extracts. Despite the media attention and consumer popularity that these ingredients have generated, there have been few scientific studies to support these claims. Furthermore, the consumer with self-assessed sensitive skin has no way of judging which products are likely to be most beneficial and least harmful.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Several studies indicate that inorganic salts inhibit irritation and inflammation when applied topically.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The therapeutic and cosmetic properties of Dead Sea mud and water have been well-established. Their unique composition is especially rich in magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, zinc, and strontium.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the effect of four inorganic salts (strontium chloride [SC], strontium nitrate [SN], potassium nitrate [KN], and zinc chloride [ZC]) on suppression chemically-induced skin irritation in human volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-two volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind study. G*Power - Statistical and Qualitative Data Analysis Software version 3.0.10 (Heinrich-Heine University, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany) used for sample size calculation. Subjects were 28&#x02013;52 years old, 19 males and 13 females, and all classified as sensitive skin type by a prescreening lactic acid facial challenge.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The study protocol was approved by Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (No: IR.MUI.REC.93.3.378).

Eight sites include Two AIs in three concentrations, vehicle and &#x0201c;no treatment.&#x0201d; On each site, a 12 mm diameter Finn Chamber was applied. Each chamber includes 60 &#x003bc;l of 1.0% SLS on filter paper discs. The patches were removed after 24 h, and skin reactions were evaluated by biometric measurements within 1 h of patch removal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Application of substances</title><p>About 5 mg of ointment per cm<sup>2</sup> (corresponding to a total of approximately 160 mg) of each of the formulations, was applied twice daily for 6 days (days 1&#x02013;6) to the treatment areas. Morning applications were performed immediately after measurements by a technician, whereas evening applications (at least 6 h later) were self-administered by the volunteer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Design of experiment</title><p>The study was conducted according to double-blind, vehicle-controlled, random treatment assignment protocols in which both the subject and the assessor being blind to the treatment modality applied to each site (apart from the untreated site).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Biometric measurements</title><p>Measurements were performed once daily on days 1&#x02013;4 immediately before treatment application and at the end of treatment on day 7.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Transepidermal water loss</title><p>Transepidermal water loss (TEWL), a measure of skin barrier integrity, was determined with a TEWL probe (MPA 9 System, Courage + Khazaka electronic GmbH, Cologne, Germany), according to the published guidelines.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The instrument is made of two pairs of sensors to measure the humidity and temperature gradients in two different spacings.</p><p>Regarding the resulting humidity and temperature gradients, the TEWL is automatically calculated and shown.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Skin hydration</title><p>Hydration of the stratum corneum was determined using a Corneometer Probe (MPA 9 System).

There is a manifestation of a less hydrated, less elastic, and more erythematous skin, compared with normal people.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Classical and subjective methods of sensory testing, such as stinging test and sensibility of consumers, have been utilized to provide information on sensitive skin reactions. Bioengineering or noninvasive biophysical methods enabling the most accurate quantification of different skin biometric parameters are now replacing subjective judgments. They are typically used as methods to measure the efficacy of dermal preparations.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Inorganic salts have been shown to inhibit irritation and reduce inflammation when used topically. In this work, we investigated the effects of certain inorganic salts on skin sensitivity in individuals exposed to SLS exposure test.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>We herein reveal that only one of four supposed AIs showed any improvement in healing rate when compared with &#x0201c;no treatment&#x0201d; in regard to all biometric parameters. SC had a beneficial effect that was statistically significant overall. All other treatments had reduced TEWL and probably exerted a protective effect in skin barrier function but not significantly. With the exception of ZC, all test substances improved skin hydration but the effect of SC was significant. With regard to colorimetric assessment, all treatments, excluding ZC, reduced erythema significantly compared with an untreated control 7 days after treatment start.</p><p>As mentioned previously a dose-response relationship was not observed between the salts. The lack of dose-response in the test substances could be due to too small a sample size.</p><p>In accordance with previous studies, strontium salts were found to have AI effect in experimentally induced irritant contact dermatitis. It seems that strontium&#x02019;s suppressive activity is not due to the nitrate or chloride anion alone since sodium nitrate and sodium chloride were inactive at concentrations equimolar to active concentrations of SN.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The exact mechanism supporting the AI effects of strontium salts is not well understood. In fact, strontium ions can interact with calcium sensing receptors; a G-protein coupled receptor on type C nerve fibers. As a result of similarities in the chemical nature, size, and charge between Sr<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, strontium ions could demonstrate the ability to compete with calcium for receptor binding and transfer through calcium channels. It can finally lead to inhibition of calcium-dependent depolarization of C-type nerve fibers that normally transmits the sensory signal to the brain.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] It is assumed that strontium salts could induce the release of neurotransmitters in synapsis or could antagonize the usual calcium-induced depolarization. It is also possible that strontium salts could influence keratinocytes or inflammatory cells and regulate the release of some cytokines.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study reveals that strontium salts can effectively improve the skin biometric parameters in comparison to other tested salts and can significantly reduce the signs and symptoms of irritant contact dermatitis.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This Research Project was partially supported by Goltash Company (Isfahan, Iran).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>SF contributed to the conception of the work, conducting the study, drafting and revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
