Secukinumab is the first biologic treatment to be approved in the European Union for the first-line systemic treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In the Indian population, secukinumab was more efficacious compared to etanercept and placebo, with respect to the co-primary efficacy end points and all key secondary end points. Secukinumab was associated with greater PASI 75 rates and higher rates of IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 responses over the comparators at week 12 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. These results were comparable to the responses for the global study population.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] For the key secondary efficacy objectives, secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg both yielded higher response rates than etanercept or placebo in PASI 90 (which indicates clear or almost clear skin) and PASI 100 (complete clearance) response at week 12 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Responses at week 12 were sustained up to week 52 of secukinumab treatment in the Indian sub-population with slightly better efficacy, as compared to the global population. In the Indian population, maintenance of the PASI 75 response at week 52 for patients who were PASI 75 responders at week 12 was similar in secukinumab 300 and 150 mg groups (96.0% and 100.0%, respectively). Moreover, maintenance of IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at week 52 was also high and similar in both secukinumab 300 and 150 mg groups (83.3% and 85.7%, respectively). In the global population, 82.2% and 84.3% of patients who achieved PASI 75 at week 12 in the secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively, maintained PASI 75 at 52 weeks. Whereas 67.7% and 79.7% of patients who achieved IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response at week 12 in the secukinumab 150 mg and 300 mg groups, respectively, maintained this response at 52 weeks. Therefore, the efficacy appeared slightly better in the Indian sub-population.</p><p>Consistent with the global population, EQ-5D and DLQI scores improved continuously during the induction period and improved further throughout the maintenance period at week 52 in the Indian sub-population [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Secukinumab was largely well-tolerated at both the doses in the Indian sub-population and the safety results in the Indian patients were similar to those observed in the global population. There were no noticeable differences in AEs reported between the secukinumab groups. In addition, in the Indian sub-population, there were no treatment-emergent AEs in any of the secukinumab groups leading to discontinuation from study treatment. A limitation of this Indian sub-population analysis is small population size, which may not have been sufficient to detect rare AEs. More studies with adequate sample size are required in the Indian psoriasis population.</p><p>The findings of the sub-analysis of Indian population in the FIXTURE study demonstrated that secukinumab, a novel, selective anti-IL-17A targeted therapy, improves symptoms rapidly and significantly. The results showed a trend that the secukinumab 300 mg was relatively better than the secukinumab 150 mg in the Indian patients with moderate to severe psoriasis during the entire study duration. Secukinumab provided faster onset of action and sustained higher clinical efficacy, compared to etanercept. The results also demonstrated that secukinumab was well-tolerated, suggesting that the targeted blockade of IL-17A does not result in any notable off-target AEs.</p><p>In conclusion, secukinumab 300 mg and 150 mg administered subcutaneously over a period of 52 weeks in the Indian population were superior to placebo and etanercept in treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. In addition to this, no major safety concerns were identified with secukinumab treatment in this study, demonstrating that the drug was well-tolerated in the Indian population.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Novartis Pharmaceuticals and designed by the scientific steering committee and Novartis Pharmaceuticals personnel.
