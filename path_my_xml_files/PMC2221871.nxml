Later in the 20<sup>th </sup>century it was discovered that increases in energy expenditure after eating, called the thermic effect of feeding (TEF), varied depending on the composition of the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Metabolic rate not only rises to a greater extent with an increased caloric intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but there is a 6&#x02013;8% increase in energy expenditure with carbohydrate meals, 3% increase with fat, and 25&#x02013;40% with protein based meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Research tends to focus on the extent and timing of the peak TEF where measurements can go on for hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Measurement intervals too can be lengthy often occurring in 15 or 30-minute periods. Lengthy measurement intervals reduce measurement variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] but they also make it difficult to pinpoint precise time periods; for example, determining when TEF rises.</p><p>Sports nutritionists have brought timing issues to attention where it has been recommended that nutrient ingestion post-exercise (i.e., recovery) be completed sooner rather then later to optimize nutrient uptake by muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Likewise, it is apparent that both colder drinks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and lower drink volumes (meal size) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] tend to hasten the gastric emptying time of a liquid meal. Dependent on the meal consumed blood glucose levels often rise within 10 or 15-minutes but again, measurement periods are often conducted in 10 to 15-minute intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this regard it is not known if the rise in blood glucose above fasting levels is meaningful or not within the first measurement period.</p><p>In this investigation we asked the following 'timing' questions: 1) at a given 5% and 10% increase in RMR, when exactly does energy expenditure begin to rise after feeding and, 2) is the onset of TEF different between equi-caloric carbohydrate and protein liquid meals (1255 kJ; 300 kcal)? Comparisons between sexes also were made.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects consisted of eighteen healthy participants (males, n = 7; females, n = 11) (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>): age, 25.9 &#x000b1; 9.1 years; height, 169.9 &#x000b1; 9.1 cm; weight, 67.2 &#x000b1; 11.4 kg.

Subjects were encouraged to report to each visit at the same time of day to ensure consistency. Testing occurred between 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Each test required a three hour fast (including water consumption). Exercise was not allowed on the day prior to testing. On both testing days, subjects lay comfortably in a semi-recumbent position on a gurney for 60-minutes and were encouraged to position themselves in a way that would refrain from fidgeting. Resting gas exchange measurements were collected using a Parvo Medics metabolic cart (Sandy, UT); the cart was calibrated for gas analyses and volume at least twice prior to each test. Room air (25&#x000b0;C) was drawn through the hood at a rate of 40 L min<sup>-1</sup>. Data were recorded each minute.</p><p>Resting metabolic rates (RMR) were collected over the initial 30-minute reclining period with the last 10-minutes averaged into an estimate of RMR.

Both powders were mixed via blender with 12 oz of tap water (23&#x000b0;C).

Our study was designed to determine the onset of the TEF. These results indicate that for a compilation of male and female subjects and regardless of whether the (room temperature, 1255 kJ) liquid meal is predominantly carbohydrate or protein, a 5% rise in energy expenditure after feeding occurs in about 8-minutes; a 10% increase in energy expenditure occurs in almost double that time at about 14&#x02013;16 minutes. It is apparent that subject variability was evident, perhaps in accordance with the considerable between-subject variability that has been found with gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] (see standard deviations in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Metabolic rate is shown as RMR subtracted from TEF (&#x00394;ml O<sub>2 </sub>min<sup>-1</sup>) in 1-minute intervals after ingestion of a 1255 kJ, high CHO liquid meal.

Given between-subject variability, subjects could have been classified into specific groups for analyses, for example: comparing age, activity level, or body composition. A more direct investigation may better correlate gastric emptying with TEF. Our methodology also is subject to interpretation. For example, we considered the origin of the TEF as the first of 2 consecutive data points rising 5% and 10% above RMR. Perhaps 3 consecutive data points should have been chosen. Or perhaps the onset of TEF could better be depicted by a different statistical analysis (dependent on a measure of variance or being significantly different from a RMR baseline). We chose a 5% increase in energy expenditure based on the statistical alpha level where significance is found at p &#x0003c; 0.05. Some subjects never achieved 2 consecutive 1-minute rises in energy expenditure: 2 men for 5% increase with PRO, 3 men and 1 women for 10% increase with PRO, 1 man and 4 women for 10% increase with CHO (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Post-feeding measurements could have been extended to ensure a TEF onset with all participants (a pilot study of 3 subjects provided the rationale for our protocol revealing an observable increase in energy expenditure in less than 10-minutes). These data could also be affected by a limited 3-hour fast, the size (kcal and grams), temperature and type (solid versus liquid) of meal consumed and perhaps the amount of time spent consuming and the palatability of the meal [see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]]. Female subjects in the current study were not tested according to their menstruation pattern. Research has shown that the phases of menses do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and do not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] affect RMR and the TEF. In the carefully designed study of Tai et al. where TEF decreased during the luteal phase of menstruation, measurement times were conducted in 30-min intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]; in our investigation onset time was recorded in 1-minute intervals throughout a 30-min period. Another factor that may have affected our results was the subject's anticipation and added movement after removing the hood for consumption of the drink. This resulted in considerable variation (standard deviation) for the first minute of TEF measurements (the first 2-min of TEF data were not considered as consecutive time points) (see Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Extended measurement times ensure less variability but our 1-minute collection periods were designed to help pinpoint the rise in the TEF.</p><p>Tai et al. postulated that glucose uptake was slowed during the luteal phase of menstruation suggesting the likelihood of a gender effect. Gender differences were only evident for the initial 5% increase in TEF with the CHO drink where women had a significantly lengthier onset of TEF as compared to men. A larger sample size will be needed to verify this. When using a 10% increase in TEF as a marker of significance, no gender or drink related (CHO vs PRO) differences were found.</p><p>Previous research has revealed a rather high degree of individual variability in gastric emptying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the time to peak increase in TEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We conclude that the onset of TEF is likewise variable among subjects but is initiated within about 5 to 20-min for most subjects after ingestion of a 1255 kJ (300 kcal) liquid meal. The onset of TEF does not appear to differ between carbohydrate or protein liquid meals.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>C.B.
