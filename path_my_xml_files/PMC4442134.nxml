Recommendations for normalizing glycemia around exercise consist of prandial adjustments to bolus insulin therapy and food composition, but this carries only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the impact of a combined basal-bolus insulin dose reduction and carbohydrate feeding strategy on glycemia and metabolic parameters following evening exercise in type 1 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ten male participants (glycated hemoglobin: 52.4&#x000b1;2.2&#x02005;mmol/mol), treated with multiple daily injections, completed two randomized study-days, whereby administration of total daily basal insulin dose was unchanged (100%), or reduced by 20% (80%). Participants attended the laboratory at &#x0223c;08:00&#x02005;h for a fasted blood sample, before returning in the evening. On arrival (&#x0223c;17:00&#x02005;h), participants consumed a carbohydrate meal and administered a 75% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose and 60&#x02005;min later performed 45&#x02005;min of treadmill running. At 60&#x02005;min postexercise, participants consumed a low glycemic index (LGI) meal and administered a 50% reduced rapid-acting insulin dose, before returning home. At &#x0223c;23:00&#x02005;h, participants consumed a LGI bedtime snack and returned to the laboratory the following morning (&#x0223c;08:00&#x02005;h) for a fasted blood sample. Venous blood samples were analyzed for glucose, glucoregulatory hormones, non-esterified fatty acids, &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;.

Clearly, it is imperative that individuals can effectively manage glycemia following exercise in order to benefit from adherence to regular exercise.</p><p>Our laboratory has demonstrated that it is possible to normalize glycemia early after exercise by making mealtime adjustments to both rapid-acting insulin administration<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>and postexercise carbohydrate composition.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Specifically, consuming postexercise foodstuffs that elicit a low glycemic index (GI), while employing a reduction to rapid-acting insulin dose, protects patients from early-onset hypoglycemia, and minimizes exposure to postprandial hyperglycemia and inflammation.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Unfortunately, these acute prandial adjustments carry only short-lasting protection from hypoglycemia; glucose nadirs are still likely to occur beyond &#x0223c;8&#x02005;h postexercise, and during the hours of sleep if exercise is performed in the evening.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It may be prudent to adjust the dose of basal insulin that is administered over the course of the exercise day. Considering that late falls in glycemia following evening exercise typically coincide at &#x0223c;8&#x02005;h postexercise,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> basal insulin may play a major role. Although basal insulin reduction is sometimes advocated in clinical practice, there is currently a lack of evidence to support this advice, especially if patients are also employing acute prandial-based strategies.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Within the literature, alterations to the basal component of an insulin regimen have been predominantly trialed in individuals treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) therapy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> When infusion rate is reduced or suspended for exercise, the risk of developing hypoglycemia can be reduced by up to two-thirds.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, a large proportion of patients are treated using a basal-bolus regimen with multiple daily injections (MDIs). This is a far less flexible method of insulin delivery than CSII, meaning even small changes in dose may have significant and long-lasting effects. Moreover, there is even less information for performing exercise in the evening, especially when insulin replacement is provided using MDIs. While reducing basal insulin dose could potentially prevent hypoglycemia in the hours following exercise, it is possible that heavily reducing pre-exercise and post-exercise rapid-acting insulin dose may induce periods of sustained hyperglycemia, promoting inflammation and causing other hormonal and metabolic disturbances.</p><p>This study aimed to examine the effects of reducing basal insulin dose, when employing acute prandial adjustments to rapid-acting insulin and carbohydrate feeding, on early, late-nocturnal, and next day glycemia, after evening exercise in type 1 diabetes. In addition, we aimed to assess the impact of such a strategy on the metabolic, inflammatory, and counter-regulatory hormonal responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligibility criteria included age 18&#x02013;35&#x02005;years, diabetes duration &#x0003e;2&#x02005;years, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &#x0003c;8.0% (64&#x02005;mmol/mol).

Participants had been stable on their respective insulin regimen for a minimum of 1&#x02005;year. Fifty percent of participants using insulin glargine administered this in the morning, and 50% in the evening. Both participants using insulin detemir administered this twice daily (morning and evening). All were familiar with carbohydrate counting, administering 1.0&#x000b1;0.2&#x02005;units (IU) of insulin aspart per 10&#x02005;g of carbohydrate.</p><p>Fully informed written consent was obtained from all participants following study approval by the local National Health Service Research Ethics Committee (13/NE/0016; NCT02204839).

Although the Paradigm Veo provides real-time glucose profiles as part of an insulin pump facility, participants did not use CSII and continued their usual basal-bolus insulin regimen. The CGM was installed with glucose alerts that were set at &#x02264;3.5 and &#x02265;16.0&#x02005;mmol/L during the pretrial period, but the high glucose alert was discontinued after experimental trials. During CGM wear, participants provided a minimum of four daily capillary blood glucose test readings (GlucoMen LX, Menarini, Diagnostics, Berkshire, UK) that were entered into the CGM for calibration purposes. Capillary glucose values, not real-time CGM data, were used for self-informed rapid-acting insulin administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Diet and activity replication</title><p>Participants were required to replicate their diet (assessed using weighed dietary recording sheets) and instructed to maintain their normal insulin regimen, with basal dose standardized (dose, injection site, and time of injection) for 24&#x02005;h before each experimental trial day. The start of the experimental trial day was considered as the morning sample prior to evening attendance. Throughout this time, participants were provided with a pedometer (Omron Healthcare Europe BV, Hoofdorp, the Netherlands) to record total step count. Participants were instructed to maintain similar patterns of activity across trials avoiding strenuous activity in the preceding 48&#x02005;h.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Experimental trial day</title><p>The intervention consisted of either maintaining regular basal insulin dose (100%; 34&#x000b1;4&#x02005;IU), or reducing the total amount of basal insulin dose administered across this day to 80% (ie, a 20% reduction; 27&#x000b1;3 IU). Basal dose timings were maintained throughout as per each participant's individual regimen. On the day after exercise, participants under the 80% condition returned to their usual full basal insulin dose.</p><p>Participants presented to the laboratory on the morning of each main trial at &#x0223c;08:00&#x02005;h for a resting, fasted venous blood sample via venepuncture. This blood sample defined the start of each experimental arm. Participants then consumed a standardized cereal-based breakfast meal (sugar-coated corn flakes, peaches, and semiskimmed milk; 534&#x000b1;27&#x02005;kcal), before being discharged from the laboratory. At &#x0223c;13:00&#x02005;h participants consumed a standardized pasta-based lunch meal (pasta, tomato-based sauce, cheddar cheese, olive oil 951&#x000b1;40&#x02005;kcal) which was prescribed to them by the research team, before returning for the evening visit at &#x0223c;17:00&#x02005;h. Each meal equated to 1.3&#x02005;g carbohydrate/kg body mass, so that when combined with meals provided in the laboratory, total carbohydrate intake across the day was calculated to constitute &#x0223c;5.0&#x02005;g carbohydrate/kg body mass.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The combined macronutrient content of all meals equated to carbohydrate=77%, fat=12%, and protein=11%.

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> With this insulin dose, participants consumed a pre-exercise carbohydrate bolus (sugar-coated corn flakes, peaches, semiskimmed milk; 415&#x000b1;17&#x02005;kcal) equating to 1.0&#x02005;g carbohydrate/kg body mass. Following this bolus, participants remained rested for 60&#x02005;min, at which point a second blood sample was drawn immediately before starting 45&#x02005;min of treadmill (Woodway, Weil am Rhein, Germany) running at a speed calculated to elicit 70% of VO<sub>2peak</sub>.

In addition, we show that adopting this strategy does not induce other metabolic disturbances.</p><p>To our knowledge, we have, for the first time, demonstrated that it is possible to completely avoid acute and late-nocturnal hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetes, despite performing a prolonged bout of moderate-to-vigorous intensity running (expending &#x0223c;740&#x02005;kcal and running 7.3&#x02005;km) exercise in the evening. In addition, we show that while protecting patients from hypoglycemia, it is also possible to reduce exposure to hyperglycemia. Typically, preventing hypoglycemia after exercise occurs as a consequence of inducing hyperglycemia;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> avoidance of this is critical for long-term diabetes management, especially if exercise is to be performed regularly and consistently. We required our participants to reduce the total amount of basal insulin by 20% (&#x0223c;7&#x02005;IU), in addition to reducing pre-exercise and post-exercise prandially administered rapid-acting insulin dose, and consuming low GI carbohydrates after exercise, to achieve this. As this is a strategy that can be readily communicated to patients, these data have considerable clinical relevance. Effectively managing the risk of hypoglycemia and normalizing glycemia following exercise is critical for safe long-term exercise adherence, and potentially improvements in wider diabetes management.</p><p>Differences in glycemia did not become apparent until &#x0223c;6&#x02005;h postexercise, suggesting that reducing total basal insulin dose does not alter acute postprandial glucose handling or acute glycemic control following exercise. Beyond &#x0223c;6&#x02005;h postexercise, interstitial glucose concentrations began to fall under the non-reduced basal insulin condition with the first episode of hypoglycemia occurring at &#x0223c;8&#x02005;h postexercise (&#x0223c;02:00&#x02005;h). Further falls in glycemia were evident during the night, such that 90% of patients experienced nocturnal hypoglycemia when basal dose was not reduced. This is in keeping with our previous findings<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and those of others,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and highlights that falls in glycemia during the night cannot be prevented when employing prandial adjustments only. Conversely, when a basal reduction is employed in combination with acute prandial adjustments, glycemic control is maintained throughout the evening and night, protecting all patients from hypoglycemia.</p><p>We also set out to assess the implication of employing such a basal-bolus insulin reduction and carbohydrate feeding strategy on the wider metabolic milieu. We have previously shown that substantially reducing pre-exercise and postexercise rapid-acting insulin dose does not cause clinically meaningful increases in &#x003b2;-hydroxybutyrate (&#x0003e;1.0&#x02005;mmol/L),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and when these reductions are applied in concert with the consumption of a low GI postexercise meal, the appearance of IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; is also reduced.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> We now demonstrate that when these alterations to prandial rapid-acting insulin and meal composition are made in combination with a reduction in basal insulin dose, ketonemia is not raised and there are no other metabolic or counter-regulatory hormone disturbances. An important observation was the response in inflammatory cytokines following the intervention as the avoidance of inflammation is important for preventing the early onset of diabetes-related complications.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>With our relatively small sample size, it was not possible to compare insulin types and timing of administration. However, further research is planned to investigate this aim. It is also important to consider method of insulin delivery also. The participants in this study were treated on a basal-bolus regimen, and therefore study findings may differ in patients treated with CSII therapy. Despite this, our findings are likely to carry practical implications which could be of use to patients across treatment regimens. Importantly, our patients were well-controlled and physically active males performing a single bout of continuous aerobic exercise; outcomes pertaining to acute and late-onset hypoglycemia may differ in less well-controlled, less active patients, females, and following different forms of exercise. Indeed, recent data suggest that not all patients choose to consume a bedtime snack, and that this should not necessarily be recommended systematically, but prescribed in an individualized manner.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We suggest that patients tailor these strategies to their individual self-monitoring plans and exercise habits. Indeed, because of the complexity of type 1 diabetes and postexercise glucose regulation, a degree of individual trial and error will remain. Nevertheless, this should not detract from the clinical importance of these findings. Exercise participation rates for patients with type 1 diabetes are significantly lower than their age-matched and gender-matched non-diabetic counterparts,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and helping patients better manage their blood glucose control after exercise could encourage those fearing exercise-induced hypoglycemia to engage in regular physical activity.</p><p>In summary, this is the first study to demonstrate that exercise-induced hypoglycemia can be avoided, without exposure to hyperglycemia, when people with type 1 diabetes employ a combined basal-bolus insulin reduction and low GI carbohydrate feeding strategy. This strategy does not significantly augment ketonemia or cause other metabolic disturbances.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the study participants for their time, effort, and commitment, as well as the research team at the National Institute for Health Research Clinical Research Facility, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for their assistance.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MDC and DJW contributed to the study concept and design, researched data, and wrote the manuscript.
