Forty-four patients including 24 males and 20 females with a mean age of 48.2 &#x000b1; 16.5 years old were in the modified group, and 38 patients including 21 males and 17 females with a mean age of 50.1 &#x000b1; 14.7 years old were in the conventional group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with complete or partial peripheral posterior capsular defects which are hard to support IOL were enrolled in this study. The inclusion criteria included no retinal detachment, and the best corrected vision acuity (BCVA) above 0.1. Patients in the modified group underwent PCIOL through pars plana fixation with knot buried and without scleral flap. Mydriasis was performed with 0.5% tropicamide 1 h prior to surgery. After retrobulbar anesthesia, conjunctival incision was performed, and then a scleral tunnel was made 1.5 mm posterior to the limbus at 12 o&#x02019;clock position, extending 1 mm into clear cornea. The scleral puncture, 3 mm from the corneal limbus, was made with a 20&#x000b0; needle knife (size 1.5 mm) at the 3 and 9 o&#x02019;clock position, respectively, after conjunctival incision was performed. A 1-mL syringe needle was then administered to the pupillary area through a puncture at the 3 o&#x02019;clock position, the suture needle (suspensory IOL double-armed needles with 10-0 polypropylene suture, needle 1/4 Circle Side Cutting, IOL CZ70BB, USA, Alcon) was inserted into the syringe needle from the top limbus tunnel, and exited the 1-mL syringe needle at the same time the suture needle was then guided through the scleral puncture. The same method was used to derive another suture needle at the 9 o&#x02019;clock position. To prevent future stretch or proliferation caused by IOL eccentric transposition or peripheral retinal breaks, we performed the anterior vitrectomy before placing the IOL in all cases. A 10-0 polypropylene suture was fixed in the two holes of IOL haptics, and the IOL was then implanted from the top scleral tunnel, with particular attention to adjusting the IOL in the center. When IOL was fixed, the suture needle was passed from the scleral puncture and the incision depth remained one-half the thickness of the sclera. When the needle was away from the sclera by 1 mm, the suture needle was removed. The needle was then passed 1 mm from the scleral incision on the opposite side at 1/2 depth of the sclera, and removed from the scleral incision. The suture was adjusted to the proper position and tied in a knot. In short, the needle entered into the sclera from the inner surface of scleral incision and left the sclera from the offside of the incision. The whole suture knot was buried into the inner incision. The same sutures were used on the other side [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The suture was adjusted to the proper position and tied in a knot (red and green suture).

Two triangle scleral flaps with 3 mm bottom and the tip pointing the limbus were made at the 3 and 9 o&#x02019;clock position, respectively. A 1-mL syringe needle was punctured into the pupillary area through the scleral bed under the lamellar scleral flap at the 3 o&#x02019;clock position. The remaining procedures were performed according to the above-mentioned steps of the modified group. After making sure that the IOL was in the proper position, the suture needle was administered to the lamellar sclera. The knot was fixed under the scleral flap. Scleral flaps at the 3 and 9 o&#x02019;clock positions were sutured and the knot was buried into the sclera.</p><p>We calculated the IOL degree using the SRK/T formula when the axial length was greater than 26 mm and using the SRKII formula when it was &#x0003c;26 mm. The IOL power was generally chosen much more than one diopter than that of the ciliary sulcus fixed IOL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A comparison of posterior visual acuity between two groups was assessed using a Chi-square test.

It was reported that the IOL position did not influence postoperative BCVA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, because of the significant long-term postoperative complications such as corneal endothelial decompensation, secondary glaucoma, and pupillary ectopia occurring in the patients who have undergone anterior chamber IOL implantation, PCIOL implantation is a more optimal choice in eyes without capsular support.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] It has been shown that sulcus fixated IOL implantation is well tolerated and widely used.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, because of the inconsistency of distance from the ciliary groove to the corneal limbus in each direction, in most cases, the surgeon cannot look straight into the ciliary sulcus for stitching. Therefore, it is difficult for suturing precisely at the ciliary sulcus.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we found that pupillary capture of the IOL optic occurred more frequently in the conventional group, so we hypothesize that the ciliary sulcus might not be the optimal fixation position of PCIOL. In the modified group, we punctured the sclera at the pars plana, 3 mm behind the limbus, no scleral flap, and the knot was buried into the scleral puncture incision. The advantages of the modified fixation include the difficulty in damaging the ciliary crown and positioning is relatively easy. Therefore, the two loops in the PCIOL can be symmetrically fixed. The operation time will be shortened accordingly by reducing steps of making sclera flap and sutured scleral flap. Compared with fixation in the ciliary sulcus of PCIOL implantation, the location of PCIOL fixed in the pars plana is relatively behind, so the IOL power is generally chosen much more than one diopter than that of the ciliary sulcus fixed IOL. Another study also compared clinical efficacy between ciliary sulcus and pars plana fixation of PCIOL and showed that no significant difference of postoperative visual acuity and corneal endothelial counts between two operative techniques, but the spherical equivalent difference, IOL dislocation, and optical pupil capture were more common in the ciliary sulcus fixation group.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In summary, this modified operation simplified the procedures, reduced the operation time, and obtained satisfactory clinical efficacy.</p><p>We also found that scleral incisions located at the 3 and 9 o&#x02019;clock positions were not an absolute contraindication, because it was easier to fix the loops of IOL at these two positions and no ciliary artery injury occurred when scleral incisions were performed at these two positions, with special emphasis on maintaining normal intraocular pressure during the operation. Some measurements should be taken to keep the normal intraocular pressure. For example, balanced salt solution could be injected into the anterior and posterior chamber. If ligating the sutures when intraocular pressure was too low, the ciliary blood supply would be influenced and the IOL loops-induced stimulation on ciliary body would be increased. As a result, it is necessary to clean up the anterior vitreous, exudative membrane, and organized membrane to prevent the future IOL dislocation induced by pulling.</p><p>In summary, modified sutured PCIOL implantation not only simplifies the operation steps, and reduces operation time and operation-related complications, but also makes PCIOL fixation more accurate and improves postoperative visual acuity. Modified sutured PCIOL implantation is a safe, effective, and feasible technique for correction in eyes without adequate posterior capsular support, which deserves widely clinical application.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>What is known?</title><p>Posterior chamber is the ideal place for intraocular lens (IOL) implantation because of its rightness of the physical location of lens and the posterior chamber IOL implantation with the suture fixation remains the first choice for most operators. Usually, a sclera flap is made and the IOL is fixed through ciliary sulcus. When making the sclera flap, operating with the left hand is relatively difficult and time-consuming. An often time the thin scleral bed may be damaged by the knot and dislocation of IOL occurs. In addition, the two loops of IOL are hard to precisely fix in the ciliary sulcus due to the inconsistency of distance from ciliary groove to limbal.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>What this paper adds</title><p>We modified the operation for conventional posterior chamber IOL implantation through ciliary sulcus fixation with knot buried and without sclera flap. The operative steps and postoperative compilations in the modified group were significantly less than those of the conventional group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
