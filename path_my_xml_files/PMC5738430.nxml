Predictive biomarkers able to anticipate response to the therapeutic treatments aiming at dystrophin re-expression are lacking. The objective of this study is to investigate Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) as predictive biomarker for Duchenne. Two natural history cohorts were studied including 168 longitudinal samples belonging to 66 patients. We further studied 1536 samples obtained from 3 independent clinical trials with drisapersen, an antisense oligonucleotide targeting exon 51: an open label study including 12 patients; a phase 3 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study involving 186 patients; an open label extension study performed after the phase 3. Analysis of natural history cohorts showed elevated MMP-9 levels in patients and a significant increase over time in longitudinal samples. MMP-9 decreased in parallel to clinical stabilization in the 12 patients involved in the open label study. The phase 3 study and subsequent extension study clarified that the decrease in MMP-9 levels was not predictive of treatment response. These data do not support the inclusion of serum MMP-9 as predictive biomarker for DMD patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a neuromuscular disorder with an incidence of 1 in 5000 newborn males<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. DMD is caused by the absence of dystrophin due to protein truncating mutations in the <italic>DMD</italic> gene<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In-frame mutations in the same gene allow formation of partially functional dystrophin and cause the milder Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. There is no cure available for DMD but the standard of care includes use of anti-inflammatory corticosteroid drugs such as prednisone and deflazacort, which are capable of delaying disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. In the last 15 years several therapeutic approaches have been developed following experimental evidence in cells and in animal models, showing it was possible to restore dystrophin, improve muscle quality, reduce oxidative stress and delay disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Some compounds have been tested in clinical trials where groups of patients were treated with different dosages or treatment regimens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) mediated exon skipping restored dystrophin in DMD patients after intramuscular and systemic delivery with two independent chemistries and the morpholino compound has recently received accelerated approval by the FDA<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Due to the mutation-specific nature of the exon skipping approach, only subsets of patients are eligible for a clinical trial assessing the skipping of a certain exon, leading to AON trials generally being conducted in small cohorts of patients. Also the low potency of the exon skipping drugs currently tested in patients calls for longer observational time to avoid that treatment-induced changes could be masked by inter-patient variability. The lack of objective functional outcome measures increases this risk even further. At the moment, the functional measure used in clinical trials for DMD is the 6&#x02009;minute walk test (6MWT)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, which can only be performed in ambulatory patients (the majority of patients is non-ambulant) and where the outcome has been shown to be influenced by patient&#x02019;s motivation. The identification of functional and molecular outcome measures able to monitor disease progression and predict response to treatment is a priority for the field, also to avoid invasive muscle biopsies which constitute a burden for patients and their families<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. The only diagnostic serum biomarker available at the moment is muscle creatine kinase, the serum levels of which are elevated in DMD patients and similarly elevated in BMD. Unfortunately, serum creatine kinase concentration is also strongly influenced by exercise and decreases at the later stages of the disease due to loss of muscle tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Previously, we reported serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to be elevated in DMD patients over healthy controls and to increase over time in 9 DMD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">The overall objective of this study was to assess whether MMP-9 serum levels increases over time in DMD patients and to provide proof that it could be used as exploratory biomarker in clinical trials aiming to restore dystrophin. Towards this goal we (i) used 3 independent techniques to validate the association of MMP-9 serum levels with Duchenne, (ii) we characterised the MMP-9 isoforms in DMD by gelatin zymography, (iii) we confirmed in 2 large longitudinal cohorts that MMP-9 levels increase over time and (iv) we studied MMP-9 levels in two clinical trials involving patients treated with drisapersen, a 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl-phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide able to skip exon 51 in the dystrophin pre-mRNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Serum MMP-9 levels are higher in DMD patients compared to healthy controls</title><p id="Par5">Serum MMP-9 levels were found to be elevated in DMD sera compared to controls<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (and Spitali <italic>et al</italic>., submitted, and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

Several therapeutic approaches have been in development in the last few years ranging from stem cells, viral gene therapy and RNA targeting therapies such as exon skipping<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. For all these approaches <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> proof of principle, mainly in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model, supported the clinical experimentation in DMD patients. For most clinical trials at least one muscle biopsy was requested to obtain proof of mechanism. Yet muscle biopsies represent an invasive procedure limited to a single muscle, thus it would be preferred to monitor disease progression and response to treatment in the least invasive possible manner. To achieve this, considerable effort has been placed to identify molecular markers which are differentially represented between DMD patients and controls, in blood derived fluids such as serum and plasma. This has the added benefit that, while a single piece of muscle from one muscle group may not be representative for the condition of all muscles in the body, the circulating nature of blood is considered to provide a snapshot of the state of the whole body (30&#x02013;40% of which is skeletal muscle in healthy individuals). A few proteins and nucleic acids have been identified among which muscle specific creatine kinase (CK) is already known for long time<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. CK is a very useful biomarker for the identification and diagnosis of various myopathies including DMD, however reduction of CK serum levels over time make this marker difficult to use as biomarker for DMD disease progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>; however it has been reported that CK decreases following therapeutic intervention by ataluren and gentamicin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. CK is the most known among the muscle specific markers which are released in circulation by muscle due to leaky sarcolemma, but many others have been recently identified or confirmed such as CA3, MDH2, TNNT3, TTN, MYOM3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. While these markers are of interest for diagnostic purposes and may help to better understand the muscle condition at a given time point, they remain of difficult interpretation as they all decrease as disease progresses; it is however possible that the extent to which they decrease over time contains information regarding disease progression. We have shown in the past that serum MMP-9 levels were higher in DMD patients compared to healthy controls and that serum levels increase over time in a small longitudinal cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. MMP-9 is already known in the Duchenne field due to its role in disease pathogenesis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and for the ability to modulate the capacity of stem cell to correctly engraft in a dystrophic muscle<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. MMP-9 has also been connected to heart disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, tissue damage and cancer metastasis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> making it a non-specific marker, which is not appropriate to use as diagnostic marker for DMD. In this study we show that serum MMP-9 levels are elevated in DMD compared to healthy individuals by analyzing the serum of 172 patients and 32 healthy controls, providing a good but not excellent separation as assessed by ROC curves analysis. We elucidated that the inactive form is the most prevalent form in patients&#x02019; sera, probably due to inefficient MMP-9 activation in the extra-cellular space and quick uptake by blood vessels. Verification of the used ELISA kit (quantification range, precision, linearity, specificity and parallelism) and significant correlations with 2 independent techniques (antibody array and gelatin zymography) demonstrated that this method is in line with regulators guidelines for serum sample analysis. We report MMP-9 levels increase over time in 2 large independent longitudinal cohorts, and since DMD is a progressive disease, one could postulate that MMP-9 correlates with disease progression making MMP-9 a potential biomarker to monitor disease progression in Duchenne patients. This indication is also supported by a recent paper in which MMP-9 and Adiponectin were reported to be increasing over time in a relatively small cross-sectional cohort of DMD patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. The association with disease progression remains however to be demonstrated by studying correlations between MMP-9 levels and clinical outcome measures. Interestingly, we observed in a group of 12 patients treated with drisapersen that high levels of serum MMP-9 significantly decreased with treatment over time. The observed reduction is significantly different compared to the 2 independent natural history cohorts, indicating that MMP-9 may have the potential to be used as predictive biomarker for treatment response in DMD patients. Nevertheless, it is important to consider that data points in the drisapersen study and natural history cohorts were not phased and that sampling frequency was lower in the natural history cohorts compared to the study involving drisapersen. To further study in depth the potential of MMP-9 as predictive biomarker we analyzed serum samples obtained during the phase 3 study (NCT01254019 - DMD114044) and the follow up open label extension study. More than 1400 data points have been analyzed showing comparable decrease of MMP-9 levels in both treatment and placebo arms during the blinded and open label extension phases, thus clarifying that the decrease in MMP-9 levels is not caused by treatment with drisapersen. This finding questions the validity of MMP-9 as predictive biomarker for response to therapy with dystrophin restoring drugs mainly because we did not observe the expected increase in the placebo group. It is possible that the shorter observational time compared to the natural history cohorts does not allow to detect an increase in MMP-9 over time or that MMP-9 levels at baseline in the natural history cohort were artificially reduced due to instability of MMP-9 during long term storage at -80&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. This remains to be tested as literature reports show that plasma MMP-9 levels may or may not be affected by long term storage<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Analysis of other serum biomarkers as exploratory outcome measures in large placebo controlled clinical trials will be important to verify/falsify our findings and ascertain whether candidate biomarkers can qualify as biomarker for disease progression and treatment response in DMD patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par11">DMD Natural History cohorts: Patients involved in the study were followed up at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne (United Kingdom) (referred throughout the article as NCL), at the Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden (The Netherlands) (referred throughout the article as LUMC) and at the Dubowitz Neuromuscular Centre, UCL Institute of Child Health, London (United Kingdom) (referred throughout the article as UCL).

We used a Mann-Whitney U test to test for differences between baseline MMP-9 levels of patients treated with drisapersen (at the start of the extension study PRO0-51-02) and patients from Newcastle and Leiden pooled together. We used a univariate linear model with serum MMP-9 levels as dependent variable to test the effect of cohort (LUMC, NCL, UCL), corticosteroid treatment, age and clotting time (only available for some samples of the NCL cohort). Longitudinal data of Leiden and Newcastle were analyzed with linear mixed models to determine the effects of age at baseline and follow-up time on serum MMP-9 levels. The fixed effects were age at baseline and follow-up time, while patients were considered as random effect. Residuals were normally distributed according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests. To compare the DMD natural history cohorts with the cohort of patients treated with drisapersen, we expanded the linear mixed model including the factor cohort (LUMC, NCL, drisapersen) as well as the interaction between cohort and follow-up time. The fixed effects were age at baseline, follow-up time, cohort and the mentioned interaction, while patients were considered as random effect. For the analysis of only long follow-up data or only short follow-up data, we used the same model as when all data points were used. Analysis of MMP-9 data obtained during the phase 3 trial was performed using a linear mixed model with MMP-9 as dependent variable. Fixed effects were MMP-9 levels at baseline, treatment arm, visit, the interaction between treatment arm and visit and the interaction between visit and MMP-9 levels at baseline; given the balanced design we did not use random effects, instead we used a repeated covariance matrix with compound symmetry structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
