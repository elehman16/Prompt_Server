In addition to achieving feasibility benchmarks (accruing and retaining at least 80% of participants, and observing no serious adverse effects attributable to the intervention), we will explore the potential impact of an acute state of negative energy balance on tumour proliferation rates (Ki-67), as well as other tumour markers, serum biomarkers, gene expression, microbiome profiles and other clinical outcomes (eg, quality of life).

In 2016, an estimated 61&#x02005;000 new cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and 246&#x02005;660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed, with 40&#x02005;450 individuals dying of this disease.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Many studies have shown that overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer; most recently comprehensive meta-analysis has reported that the relative risk of postmenopausal breast cancer was 1.05 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.07) per 2&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> increase in body mass index (BMI).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Moreover, obesity is linked to poorer prognosis, that is, increased disease-specific and overall mortality, among premenopausal and postmenopausal women.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Currently, the exact mechanisms that link obesity to cancer progression are unknown, though it is surmised that complex interactions among multiple factors are involved.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> In breast cancer, various growth factors, inflammatory markers, adipokines and hormones, such as oestradiol and insulin, are likely to play roles and are influenced by weight status.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> It is speculated that the microbiome also may play a role in breast cancer related to systemic oestrogen levels and obesity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Similarly, there are numerous observational studies linking insulin to breast cancer. Several weight loss intervention trials have shown that negative energy balance via caloric restriction and/or increased physical activity results in lower insulin levels.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It has been proposed that weight loss has potential as a therapeutic strategy to slow disease progression, not only for women with DCIS, but also for those who have invasive disease.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> We aim to explore the feasibility of weight loss in this patient population, and describe the potential impact that weight loss invokes on tumour biology and the host environment, assessing effects on biomarkers and gene expression in the tumour and circulation using serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).</p><p>This research builds on our similarly designed phase II randomised controlled trial (RCT) in prostate cancer, in which we also use a presurgical model to explore whether we are able to affect tumour biology with brief exposure to a modified diet.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> While analyses of those results are currently underway, we observed significantly reduced tumour proliferation rates (Ki-67) in men with prostate cancer who received 30&#x02005;g of ground flaxseed daily in another presurgical trial which also employed a 3-week intervention period.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Secondary analysis showed that tumour levels of cytokines and angiogenic factors associated with the convergence of hormones, inflammation and energy-related factors (CHIEF) pathway, for example, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were also responsive to the brief period of dietary manipulation, as well as to weight status.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> We postulate similar effects in early-stage breast cancer through biological and biobehavioural pathways in which weight loss may affect cancer progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Initially, the study was designed as a two-arm presurgical RCT among 40 overweight or obese postmenopausal women with DCIS (stage 0 breast cancer) in which overweight and obesity are hypothesised as key in the aetiology and progression of disease. However, due to slow accrual and because obesity is related to mortality regardless of stage and age, we expanded our eligibility criteria to include premenopausal and peri-menopausal women, as well as those with stage I and II breast cancer.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Consenting patients are randomised to one of the two study arms after completion of their baseline assessment. Attention control and experimental arms receive diet counselling during the study period to correct nutritional deficiencies with food sources, as well as instruction on progressive resistance training (PRT) of the upper body using Therabands (Hygenic Corporation, Akron, Ohio, USA). The experimental arm receives PRT plus mentored aerobic exercise and diet counselling for caloric restriction to promote a weight loss of up to 0.91&#x02005;kg/week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012320F1">figure 1</xref>). Participants in each of the study arms are contacted at least twice weekly by study staff.

Based on the results of our prior diet and exercise trials, we speculate that in comparison to the attention control arm with stable weight, the experimental arm will lose weight and exhibit decreases in Ki-67, though we acknowledge that such analyses are exploratory and may be insufficiently powered. While our accrual has been slower than anticipated, thus far and with more than half of our sample enrolled, we have observed excellent rates of retention and no serious adverse events.</p><p>Secondary outcomes are to explore improvements in other biomarkers. These changes are studied in relation to the following end points: (1) adiposity measures, that is, body weight, waist circumference (WC) and per cent body fat from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA); (2) energy intake and nutrient density of the diet; (3) time, frequency, and intensity of physical activity via self-report and accelerometry; (4) cardiorespiratory fitness; (5) tumour markers and phosphoro-proteins on the CHIEF pathway in tumour; (6) gene expression profiles in tumour and PBMCs; (7) serum levels of insulin, leptin, estradiol, VEGF, tumour necrosis factor &#x003b1; (TNF&#x003b1;), and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG); (8) changes in the salivary and faecal microbiome; and (9) quality of life (QoL).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Recruitment/consent</title><p>Cases are recruited from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Kirklin Interdisciplinary Breast Health Clinic (Birmingham, Alabama, USA)<italic>.</italic> A thorough explanation of the study and printed materials are provided to all patients who meet general screening criteria, that is, overweight or obese (BMI of 25&#x02013;60&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with histopathologically confirmed stage 0&#x02013;II breast cancer who will receive surgical treatment.

The concentration and purity of total RNA is determined using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). At the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Shared Genomics Resource, samples are purified to cDNA. After conversion to biotin-labelled cRNA, they are hybridised to a HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, California, USA) and stained with strepavidin-Cy3 for visualisation. Though select genes have been identified specifically on the CHIEF pathway, the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip contains sequences representing &#x0223c;47&#x02005;231 curated and putative genes and expressed sequence tags. Quality standards for hybridisation, labelling, staining, background signal and basal level of housekeeping gene expression for each chip is verified on all assays. After scanning the probe array, the resulting image is analysed using GenomeStudio software (Illumina). Gene lists are created by exporting the data from GenomeStudio into GeneSpring (V.11.5.1, Agilent Technologies).

Comparisons of baseline characteristics between enrolled participants and potential participants who refused to participate, as well as between participants who completed the study and those dropped out, are compared using the two-group t-test for continuous variables and the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Biomarkers and anthropometric change scores are also compared between the groups using the two-group t-test. Overall changes in measures from baseline to postintervention may be examined using the paired t-test. Adverse events are summed as frequencies and are compared between the two groups using the Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. The primary method of analysis will be mixed models repeated-measures analyses, such as repeated-measures analysis of covariance. When a model term is statistically significant, the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test will be used to determine which specific pairs of means are significantly different. This method allows us to compare changes over time (within-group changes) and differences between groups simultaneously. These models include terms for group (study arm), time (baseline, follow-up) and group&#x000d7;time, as well as terms for interactions that are of scientific interest. Variables such as select demographic (eg, race and menopausal status) and tumour factors (eg, cancer stage) are accounted for in these analyses.</p><p>Relationships between serum and tissue markers and adiposity are examined using the Pearson correlation analysis. Distributions of continuous variables are examined using stem-and-leaf plots, normal probability plots and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Variables that are determined to deviate greatly from a normal distribution are transformed prior to analysis or are analysed using non-parametric tests such as the Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests. Statistical tests are two-sided and are performed using a 5% significance level. SAS software (V.9.4; Cary, North Carolina, USA) is used to conduct the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial opened for recruitment 21 August 2014, with recruitment expected to be completed by August 2016. At the time of submission of this study protocol, 85 potentially eligible patients have been approached, 57 were found to be ineligible, 28 patients were enrolled and 26 patients have completed the study. One patient was excluded before the follow-up assessment due to findings of advanced cancer after the baseline assessment. Currently, our rate of drop-out is 3.5% (far lower than the 20% forecasted). One of the greatest barriers to recruitment has been the required 3&#x02005;week lagtime between baseline assessment and surgery, as many prospective participants elect to have surgery as soon as possible. Other reasons for ineligibility are patient's overwhelming distress resulting from their cancer diagnosis and expressed concern that they &#x02018;just can't take on anything else&#x02019;, job/time conflicts and other responsibilities such as a caregiver role for family members. Currently, none of the enrolled patients have volunteered for an additional biopsy at baseline assessment; while this will preclude our ability to compare biomarkers in fresh-frozen tissue, we still will be able to conduct all assessments planned on paraffin-embedded samples.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Dissemination</title><p>As such, all adverse events are recorded and classified as either serious or non-serious.

Our study will explore effects on metabolic markers within the CHIEF pathway as mediators by which negative energy balance affects tumour growth. Downstream of the CHIEF pathway are the PI3K and the mTOR signalling pathways which are currently being evaluated for drug development and are also affected by caloric restriction and increased physical activity.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></p><p>Our primary study limitations include a lack of statistical power to determine anything more than the feasibility of weight loss. Moreover, the sheer number of assessments in combination with a small sample size may increase the type 1 error, and result in inconclusive findings. However, it must be borne-in-mind that is a feasibility trial and one in which the exploration of other end points is strictly for the purposes of hypothesis generating (not testing). Another limitation is the substantial trade-offs inherent when a study is dependent on and integrated within a pre-surgical clinical care timeline. While it would be ideal to delay surgery more than a minimum of 3&#x02005;weeks, in order to allow for longer accelerometry collection periods as well as longer intervention periods, further delay is seldom acceptable within the US healthcare system which schedules women for surgery on demand. Although the study period is brief, we will explore differences in tumour proliferation rates and cancer-related biomarkers within the span of 3&#x02005;weeks as experienced in a similar study among patients with prostate cancer.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In summary, this study builds on our prior work and extant clinical practice, utilises an appropriate and accessible patient population and is designed to gather data that will begin to improve our understanding of the effect of weight loss on breast cancer biology and related biomarkers and outcomes. Since weight loss is apt to be pursued as complementary care in the clinical setting, this study is further strengthened by its real-world approach. Indeed, we expect to uncover exciting findings that could ultimately influence the standard of care for treatment of early-stage breast cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the efforts of Dr Kimberly Keene, Dr Catherine Parker, Dr Jennifer De Los Santos, Dr Drexell Boggs, Dr Marshall Urist, Dr Carla Falkson, Dr Andres Forero, Dr Kirby Bland, Dr Chris Vaklavas, Dr Erica Stringer-Reasor and Dr Markus Bredel, Alma del Grosso, RN, Kathleen Romundstad, RN, Sara Mansfield, MS, ACSM Certified Exercise Physiologist (CET), Alexandra Yates, MS, ACSM Certified Exercise Physiologist (CET), Britney Blackstock, Heather Hunter, MS, Madeline Morgan, and Lora Roberson.
