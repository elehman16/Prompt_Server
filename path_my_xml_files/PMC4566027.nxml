Barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) and soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) are major food crops, but can also be used as ingredients for the maintenance of skin health. We developed a natural product-based skin treatment using a barley and soybean formula (BS) incorporating yeast fermentation, and evaluated its skin hydration effects as a dietary supplement in a clinical study.

A significant increase in hydration in the BS group as compared to the placebo group was observed on the faces of subjects after 4 and 8 weeks, and on the forearm after 4 weeks. Decreases in stratum corneum (SC) thickness were also observed on the face and forearm. BS enhanced hyaluronan (HA) and skin barrier function <italic>in vitro</italic> and reduced Hyal2 expression in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF).

The hydration of skin is essential for its attractive appearance, softness, complexion, protection, and helps to reinforce its barrier properties against deleterious and exogenous environmental factors.<sup>(<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> Properly hydrated skin is smooth and soft, while inadequately hydrated skin appears dry and scaly, and exhibits poor barrier function.<sup>(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> Consumers are generally receptive toward functional food ingredients in skincare products.<sup>(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup></p><p>Intrinsic water binding capacity and barrier function are key properties that improve with adequate skin hydration. In the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the skin, hyaluronan (HA) plays an important role in hydration due to its water-binding properties.<sup>(<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup> HA is a linear, high molecular-weight polysaccharide composed of a non-sulfated repeating disaccharide unit of glucuronic acid and <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine.<sup>(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> HA exists ubiquitously as one of the major components of extracellular matrices of tissues, and effectively retains water, absorbing more than 1,000 times its weight. The HA content in skin accounts for approximately half the total amount of HA present in the body. HA is synthesized by hyaluronan synthase (HAS) at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and the newly synthesized chains are thought to be extruded into the extracellular space through pore-like structures composed of HAS and membrane phospholipids. Three different HAS genes, HAS 1&#x02013;3, have been identified in mammals. However, HA is degraded by the enzyme hyaluronidase (HYAL). HYAL-1 and HYAL-2 are major components of somatic tissue and are believed to act in concert to degrade high molecular-weight HA to disaccharides and tetrasaccharides.<sup>(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup></p><p>Healthy skin is an effective barrier for maintaining water retention.<sup>(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> Skin barrier dysfunction can be influenced by the dysregulation of factors including aquaporin-3 (AQP3), loricrin, involucrin, and filaggrin. Profilaggrin is the precursor protein of filaggrin, and is composed of 2 to 3 repeating filaggrin monomers.<sup>(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> Profilaggrin initially decomposes to filaggrin, which is then degraded into free amino acids (FAA) which are a major component of natural moisturizing factors.<sup>(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> AQP3 represents a family of water channel proteins which are found in the basal cell layer of the epidermis, and are essential transporters of glycerol and water.<sup>(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> Ultraviolet (UV) light is one of major causes of damage to the skin barrier and induces detectable changes in the expression of these skin barrier markers. Proper ongoing maintenance of appropriate levels of epidermal hydration helps to mitigate the skin aging process.</p><p>Soybeans (<italic>Glycine max</italic>) are an important plant protein source worldwide, harboring various nutrients and functional components including isoflavonoids.<sup>(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup> Isoflavone in particular has been reported to exhibit bioactive properties including preventive effects toward cancers and menopausal symptoms, as well as anti-inflammatory and anti-cardiovascular disease properties.<sup>(<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> Similarly, barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>) is a major food crop that is used primarily as a cereal, but also as an industrial commodity in fermented products. &#x003b2;-glucan, an active constituent of barley, has been reported to prevent skin problems.<sup>(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup> In a previous study, we developed a fermented barley and soybean formula (BS) with enhanced isoflavone (genistein and daidzein) and &#x003b2;-glucan content by yeast fermentation. BS provided protection against ultraviolet (UV) B-induced photoaging effects in hairless mice.<sup>(<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> In this study, we investigated the skin hydration effects of BS in a clinical trial and assessed changes in molecular markers of skin hydration <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>BS was prepared as described previously.<sup>(<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup> Primary human dermal fibroblasts (HDFs) were isolated from the outgrowth of foreskin obtained from 7&#x02013;30-year-old healthy volunteers by JH Chung&#x02019;s laboratory (Seoul National University Hospital, Korea) after approval from the Institutional Review Board at Seoul National University Hospital and Seoul National University.

The trial was conducted as described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A. Skin hydration of the front cheek and interior of the forearm of the volunteers was examined prior to initiation of the study and 2, 4 and 8 weeks after the administration of a drink containing BS (3&#x000a0;g added to a 100&#x000a0;ml drink/day). There were no significant changes in weight (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B) or side effects observed during the trial. Compared with the placebo group, the BS-treated group showed enhanced hydration of skin on the face (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) and forearm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D). We then assessed the stratum corneum, a marker of skin hydration. BS administration reduced the quantity of stratum corneum present on the face (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A and C) and forearm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B and D).

To validate effects on skin hydration, we treated HDFs with the BS formula. Treatment with BS was observed to increase HA levels in the skin fibroblasts (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). HA is synthesized by HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3, and is degraded by Hyal1 and Hyal2. There were no significant changes in mRNA levels of HAS1, HAS2, HAS3 or Hyal1, although Hyal2 expression did change after BS treatment of HDFs for 24&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>B, C, D and E). Only Hyal2 mRNA was decreased by BS treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>F). Protein levels of Hyal2 also decreased after BS treatment in HDFs. We therefore hypothesize that the increases in HA elicited by BS are mediated by suppression of Hyal2 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>BS recovers UVB-induced down-regulation of a barrier function-related gene</title><p>Healthy skin acts as a barrier to protect the body from harmful external elements while preserving internal homeostasis.<sup>(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> Skin barrier proteins including filaggrin, loricrin and involucrin are produced by keratinocytes and play crucial roles in skin barrier function.<sup>(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> AQP3 downregulation in the skin leads to dehydration.<sup>(<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup> We tested BS treatment on filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin and AQP3 levels following UVB irradiation in HaCaT cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>).

They also reduce matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, and stimulate fibroblast proliferation.</p><p>Barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> L.) is a major food crop, and is used primarily as a cereal but also as an industrial commodity for the production of fermented commodities. &#x003b2;-glucans are the active component of barley <sup>(<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup> and exert beneficial effects on skin health, by decreasing hyaluronidase and collagenase expression. They also stimulate collagen protein expression, and reduce wrinkling both <italic>in vivo</italic> and in human subjects.<sup>(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup> BS is itself a yeast fermentation product with enhanced daidzein, genistein, and &#x003b2;-glucan content.<sup>(<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup></p><p>Proper skin hydration is dependent on natural hygroscopic agents including HA,<sup>(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> which is produced by HAS and destroyed by HYAL. HAS produces HA by alternately incorporating two UDP-sugar substrates, UDP-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and UDP-glucuronic acid in the cytoplasm. HA is then secreted via an ABC transporter system. HYAL1 can digest HA into tetrasaccharides while HYAL2 cleaves high molecular weight HA into disaccharide units.<sup>(<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)</sup> We observed that BS increased HA levels in HDF cells, but did not alter HAS1, HAS2, HAS3 or HYAL1 mRNA expression. However, BS did appear to inhibit HYAL2 mRNA and protein expression levels.</p><p>Another important reason to maintain skin hydration is to improve the barrier function of the skin.<sup>(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> Loss of water from the skin is carefully regulated by the epidermis.<sup>(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> The proteins which play crucial roles in skin barrier function such as filaggrin, loricrin, involucrin and AQP3 are also important for skin hydration.<sup>(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> Filaggrin monomers are derived by proteolysis from the precursor protein profilaggrin, and are then degraded into free amino acids that are major components of natural moisturizing factors.<sup>(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup> Loricrin is a major reinforcing factor for the cornified envelope. Involucrin consists of repeating peptide units and is a component of the cornified envelope,<sup>(<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)</sup> while AQP3 is found in the basal cell layer of the epidermis and is an essential transporter of glycerol and water.<sup>(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> UVB damages the skin barrier and causes water loss via changes to the expression levels of these proteins.<sup>(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> In this study, we observed that UVB reduced filaggrin, loricrin, and AQP3 expression, while BS rescued their expression. Involucrin levels remained unchanged by both UVB and BS treatment. Previous studies have shown that HA is slightly upregulated by UVB treatment as a defense mechanism.<sup>(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)</sup> HA-regulating enzymes change in expression after irradiation with UVB.<sup>(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)</sup> With our experimental conditions, mRNA levels of HAS1, HAS2, HYAL1, and HYAL2 were decreased after UVB treatment, while mRNA levels of HAS3 did not change. Only HAS2 levels were found to be recovered by BS after UVB irradiation. The HAS2 protein levels also increased, similar to the mRNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that the increase in HA content after UVB irradiation stems from recovery of HAS2 levels by BS. BS appears to enhance skin barrier function and HA content, and may help to keep water within damaged skin.</p><p>Our results demonstrate the skin hydration effects of BS in human subjects. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> mechanism studies revealed that BS upregulates HA content via inhibition of HYAL2. In conclusion, BS has promising potential as a natural product-based material with beneficial effects for skin health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology in Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (iPET, 311035-03-3-HD110), the R&#x00026;D program of MOTIE/KIAT (Establishment of Infra Structure for Anti-aging Industry Support, N0000697), and the Leap Research Program Grant of the National Research Foundation funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (2010-0029233) in Republic of Korea.</p></ack><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Watt</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Mammalian skin cell biology: at the interface between laboratory and clinic</article-title><source>Science</source><year>2014</year><volume>346</volume><fpage>937</fpage><lpage>940</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25414300</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Draelos</surname><given-names>ZD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modern moisturizer myths, misconceptions, and truths</article-title><source>Cutis</source><year>2013</year><volume>91</volume><fpage>308</fpage><lpage>314</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23837155</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Verdier-S&#x000e9;vrain</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bont&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Skin hydration: a review on its molecular mechanisms</article-title><source>J Cosmet Dermatol</source><year>2007</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>75</fpage><lpage>82</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17524122</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vranesi&#x00107;-Bender</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The role of nutraceuticals in anti-aging medicine</article-title><source>Acta Clin Croat</source><year>2010</year><volume>49</volume><fpage>537</fpage><lpage>544</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21830469</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wiest</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerscher</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Native hyaluronic acid in dermatology--results of an expert meeting</article-title><source>J Dtsch Dermatol Ges</source><year>2008</year><volume>6</volume><fpage>176</fpage><lpage>180</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18315621</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Hyaluronan, a truly &#x0201c;youthful&#x0201d; polysaccharide.
