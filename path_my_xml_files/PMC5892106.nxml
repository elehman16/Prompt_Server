Successful implantation of embryo requires a receptive uterus. Poor endometrial receptivity is an important cause of repeated implantation failure. Endometrial receptivity is modulated by various signaling molecules such as prostaglandins, cytokines, integrins, and leukemia inhibitory factor. Dysregulation in these factors may lead to repeated implantation failure.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Various uterine pathologies, such as thin endometrium, altered expression of immunological factors, and adhesive molecules, may decrease endometrial receptivity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Clinical and basic science data have implied the association of endometrial injury with improved endometrial receptivity and hence improved implantation rates in women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) with repeated implantation failures.</p><p>In controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) performed during ART, the implantation rate is decreased due to abnormally advanced endometrial maturation and disturbed endocrine and paracrine milieu. Endometrial scratching by stimulating delay in endometrial maturation corrects asynchrony between endometrium and the conceptus and also promotes wound healing by inducing a significant increase in the local secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1E, tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, osteopontin, interleukins, growth factors, macrophages, and dendritic cells which in turn promotes successful implantation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Cytokines, growth factors, and natural killer cells are also responsible for increased angiogenesis, thereby providing adequate blood flow to the tissue and preventing embryo rejection.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Despite maximum studies showing the benefit of endometrial injury in luteal phase of preceding cycle, few studies were conducted in which endometrial injury improved pregnancy outcomes when done in the follicular phase of the same cycle.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Very few randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have been conducted that showed the benefit of endometrial scratching in IUI cycles.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the hypothesis is that endometrial scratching in follicular phase of the same cycle of COS with IUI increases the chances of clinical pregnancy in cases of two or more failed COS cycles as compared to controls by improving endometrial receptivity.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>

Endocell of Wallach surgical devices Trumbull, CT 06611 (203) 799-2005 made in the USA was used for the study. After proper written informed consent, patient was asked to lie on the table for a routine pelvic examination. No analgesics were given before the procedure. Sims speculum was inserted, and anterior lip of cervix was held with Allis forceps. The cannula was inserted gently through the cervical canal into the uterine cavity and advanced slowly till just resistance felt. Gentle movement of endometrial aspiration cannula (endocell) along all four walls of the uterine cavity was performed. Within 10 min after the procedure, the women were asked to quantify the degree of pain experienced during the procedure with the help of a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS consists of a 10 cm long horizontal line with its extremes marked as &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Each woman was asked to tick her pain level on the line, and the distance from &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; on the extreme left to the tick mark was measured in centimeters yielding a pain score from 0 to 10. Endometrial scratching was done in an outpatient setting. Pregnancy was confirmed by beta human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine/serum 2 weeks after IUI.

Although cases with primary infertility were more (87 vs. 59.5%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04) in this study, pregnancy rate was less in intervention group in women having primary infertility (38.5% vs. 34.6%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.03).</p><p>A maximum number of cases recruited in our study had a duration of 6&#x02013;10 years of infertility; distribution of which was 47.27%, 49.09%, and 50.91% in Group A, B, and C, respectively. Mean duration of infertility was similar in all three groups which was 6.22 &#x000b1; 2.62, 7.38 &#x000b1; 3.56, and 6.67 &#x000b1; 3.07 years in Group A, B, and C, respectively. In similar study conducted by Parsanezhad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] mean duration of infertility was less as compared to our study that is 3.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 and 3.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 years (<italic>P</italic> = 0.34) in intervention and control groups, respectively.

Association of pregnancy outcome was not analyzed in any of the above-mentioned studies. In our study, maximum pregnancy was found in women with duration of infertility between 1 and 5 years with a pregnancy rate of 15.38%, 27.78%, and 19.05% in Group A, B, and C respectively. Minimum duration of infertility was 2 years in all three groups, and maximum duration of infertility was 12.11 and 13 years in Group A, B, and C, respectively. Thus, it was observed that clinical pregnancy rate was higher in young women with shorter duration of infertility in similar studies.</p><p>In our study, maximum cases were of UI with distribution of 43.64%, 27.27%, and 30.91%, respectively, in Group A, B, and C (<italic>P</italic> = 0.355) followed by combined etiology (18.8%, 27.27%, and 14.5%, respectively, in A, B, and C) and male factor (16.36%, 20%, and 25.45% in A, B, and C, respectively).</p><p>In similar RCT conducted by Zarei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in IUI cycles, maximum cases were of UI, with distribution of 73.6% and 63.9% in intervention and control group respectively, followed by mild male factor and mild endometriosis. Abdelhamed [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared the effect of endometrial sampling in follicular phase of same cycle and previous cycle with control group in women undergoing IUI cycles. UI was most common etiology in all three groups (50%, 46%, and 50% in Group A, B, and C, respectively) followed by ovulatory dysfunction, male factor, and combined. Yeung <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] conducted an RCT to study the effect of endometrial injury in unselected subfertile women undergoing IVF. Male infertility was the most common cause of infertility in both intervention and control group (22 and 23.3%) followed by UI and tuboperitoneal factor. In most of the studies, correlation of etiology with pregnancy outcome was not done. In our study, pregnancy rate was highest in combined etiology (20%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.7) in Group A and Group C (25%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.7). In Group B, pregnancy was maximum in male factor (27.2%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.34), but values were statistically insignificant [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><p>Majority of cases enrolled in Group A, B, and C underwent ovulation induction using CC alone (63.64%, 81.82%, and 90.91%, respectively), followed by clomiphene with gonadotrophins and pure gonadotrophins. Although pregnancy rate was highest with CC + gonadotrophins in Group A and B (28.5%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.47), the results were not statistically significant. In other studies, also, ovulation induction was done with CC and gonadotrophins, and significant improvement in pregnancy outcomes was found after local endometrial injury.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In RCT conducted by Zarei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in women undergoing IUI cycles, ovulation induction was done by clomiphene with recombinant FSH (rFSH). Abdelhamed [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] used letrozole with pure gonadotrophins in IUI cycles and found significant improvement in pregnancy outcome after EB.</p><p>The mean length of COS cycle from day of ovulation induction to day of trigger was similar in all three groups. Mean cycle length was 12.18 &#x000b1; 1.59, 12.42 &#x000b1; 1.57, and 11.98 &#x000b1; 2.02, respectively, in all three groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.42). In COS cycles, it is known that the endometrial maturation is advanced, and cycle length hence may shorten. In our study, even after endometrial scratching on D7&#x02013;D9, cycle length was not reduced and remained optimum for endometrial maturation. In our study, mean number of DF &#x0003e;18 mm on date of hCG trigger was similar in Group A, B, and C, i.e., 1.25 &#x000b1; 0.7, 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.87, and 1.2 &#x000b1; 0.62, respectively, and the CPR was not statistically significant with regard to number of follicles on day of hCG trigger.</p><p>On the day of hCG trigger, endometrial thickness (ET) was between D7 and D9 in 74.55%, 83.64%, and 74.55% women in Group A, B, and C, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.65). Mean ET on day of trigger was 7.98 &#x000b1; 1.52, 7.93 &#x000b1; 1.05, and 8.19 &#x000b1; 1.18, respectively, in Group A, B, and C, respectively. ET on day of trigger was higher in Group B in our study as compared to controls although it was statistically insignificant. CPR was 33.33% in women with ET 9&#x02013;11 mm in Group B. The good endometrium development after scratching in the same phase may be due to increase in angiogenesis and inflammatory mechanism which in turn may be one of the contributing factors for better implantation. Furthermore, endometrial injury retards the already advanced endometrial maturation due to COS cycle, which may lead to the better endometrial thickness and better synchronicity.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In a study by Hafiza Zepnep <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] ET on day of trigger was also more in intervention group (10.3 &#x000b1; 1.4 and 10.8 &#x000b1; 1.6 in control and study group), but observation was statistically insignificant with <italic>P</italic> value (0.09). In a similar study conducted by Parsanezhad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in ovulation induction with natural contact cycle, mean ET on day of trigger in intervention group was similar to control group, respectively (8.94 &#x000b1; 1.21 and 9.18 &#x000b1; 1.3 in intervention and control, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.16). In RCT by Zarei <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] ET on day of trigger was 7.6 &#x000b1; 1.2 and 7.7 &#x000b1; 0.9 mm in EB group and control group, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.6). In the RCT conducted by Guven <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] mean ET on day of trigger was 9.26 &#x000b1; 2.27 and 9.63 &#x000b1; 2.15 in intervention and control group.(<italic>P</italic> = 0.38). In all above-mentioned studies, even after endometrial scratching, ET on the day of trigger was comparable between intervention and control group.</p><p>In our study, we used endometrial aspiration cannula (Endocell, Wallach surgical devices, USA), which is cheap, easily available, and nontraumatic.

It is more convenient for the women to undergo scratching after transvaginal ultrasound for folliculometry in the same cycle, thus avoiding the need to come in the cycle before IUI. There is a theoretical advantage of a recent inflammatory response and release of cytokines in the same cycle that may lead to better implantation.</p><p>In Group A (early follicular phase, D2&#x02013;D4), the mean day for taking EB in Group A was 2.63 &#x000b1; 0.75.

RCTs conducted by Wadhwa <italic>et al</italic>., Maged <italic>et al</italic>., and Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>. (2016) reported a significant improvement in clinical pregnancy rate when endometrial scratching was done in follicular phase of same COS with IUI cycle. However, in study conducted by Wadhwa <italic>et al</italic>., most women underwent scratching in first IUI cycle and Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>.

Since in our study, women with &#x02265;2 failed COS cycles were recruited, this led to inclusion of older women with longer duration of infertility that might have contributed to lower clinical pregnancy rate.

Our inclusion criteria mentioned an age group of 20&#x02013;38 years, which might have led to low pregnancy rates due to the inclusion of older age group. Ovulation induction in majority of cases was done by clomiphene alone, and very few study in literature has been conducted to show the effect of endometrial scratching in clomiphene alone cycles. Inflammatory markers were not measured, so we cannot comment on the role of inflammation in implantation. Although we have recruited women with previous two or more failed IUI cycles, unselected group of patients was recruited including patients with male factor, tubal factor, ovulatory dysfunction, and combined infertility. In IVF cycle, the role of endometrial injury in improving endometrial receptivity is established as embryonal factors, leading to RIF are excluded to an extent by transfer of good quality embryos. In previously failed COS cycles, many unknown factors besides poor endometrial receptivity may be present that may lead to repeated failure cycles and reduced CPR. Endometrial scratching is hypothesized to improve endometrial receptivity, but other factors such as autoimmune conditions, embryonal defects, and immunological incompatibility might be responsible for cause of RIF despite endometrial scratching. In our study, we only performed endometrial scratching by gentle movement of endocell, but suction was not done and neither attempt to take biopsy. This might have had led to a theoretical effect of less inflammatory response as compared to if biopsy was taken. In other studies, like Nossair <italic>et al</italic>.

Its benefit in women with repeated COS failure cycles or couples trying to conceive with IUI and OI remain unclear. If endometrial injury improves reproductive outcomes in this situation, it could provide a low-cost treatment alternative for some couples before they consider undergoing IVF. In our study, we found a slight increase in pregnancy outcome in women with repeated COS failures undergoing endometrial scratching in late follicular phase, but the result was not statistically significant.
