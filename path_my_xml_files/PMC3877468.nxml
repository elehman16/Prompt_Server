Then, the participants were randomly divided into three groups. The first group was considered as control group. The second group received training by school health trainers and the third group received designed training through their parents.</p><p>The main questionnaire of this multidimensional study included 93 closed questions in which 28 questions focused on nutrition. Family suitable nutritional habits pattern means suitable consumption of nutrients, and suitable consumption of various kinds of nutrients was defined as daily consumption of dairy, fruits, and vegetables and at least two or three times a week consumption of meat and cereals. Another subject that was considered in this study was meal skipping.</p><p>The validity of questionnaire was confirmed through the peer-reviewed literature by 10 experts. Its reliability was confirmed by test &#x02014; retest (reliability coefficient: 0.8).</p><p>On assessment following 2 years of intervention, the overall response rate was 79%. It was 82% in the trained by parents group, 81% in the trained by health trainer group, and 80% in the control group.</p><p>Data analyses were done by the use of SPSS software version 16 (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive statistics alongside the chi-squared (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for the analysis. Statistical significance level was set at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 (two tailed).</p><p>This study was approved by National Ethical Committee of Medical Research. Participation in this study was voluntary, and self-administered questionnaires were filled anonymously on getting the consent of every participant after they were explained the objectives of the study. Moreover, all information was collected anonymously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Following 2 years of intervention, 1331 female adolescents were enrolled in the assessment. There was no significant difference in age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and the wrist circumference in the three groups. Based on BMI measurements, 64% of participants were thin, 28.6% normal, 6.3% overweight, and 1.1% were obese. 59.5% of the girls had a positive perception of their height, and in this regard, no significant difference was found between the study groups. Overall, 14% of the students had imagined themselves as obese girls, and this imagination significantly was higher in the control group compared with the other two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0002).</p><p>25.1% of the control group participants, 33.9% of those trained by school health trainers, and 41% of those trained by parents had positive perception about their physical form. There was significant difference between the studied groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003). Some relative variables are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The pattern of variables related to body image</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJNMR-18-425-g001"/></table-wrap><p>In the control group and the groups trained by school health trainers and parents, respectively, 34.8%, 31.9%, and 33.3% girls had special diet for losing weight. Accordingly, having such diet in the trained groups, especially in the parents&#x02019; trained group, was less than in the control group. Totally, 50% of the students who were on diet had normal BMI. Only about 50% of subjects believed increasing &#x0201c;need for calorie&#x0201d; during puberty and 11.9% of them believed it decrease.</p><p>With regard to participants&#x02019; nutritional habits, breakfast skipping was found in 9.6% of the participants. Moreover, the habit of eating breakfast was significantly higher in the trained groups in comparison with their counterparts in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).</p><p>Appropriate consumption of various kinds of nutrients, dairy, meat, cereals, fruits, vegetables in the group trained by parents was higher than in the other groups, while use of fatty foods was higher in the control group than in other groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0005).</p><p>The study of suitable use pattern of nutrients among the groups showed significant statistical difference in the suitable consumption of dairy, meat, cereals, and vegetables between the group trained by parents and the other groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).</p><p>There was a positive correlation between parents&#x02019; educational level and their family suitable nutritional habits and also with awareness of the adolescents regarding requirement of different nutrients.</p><p>Following special diet for weight loss and skipping meals was significantly lower in the trained groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). This study indicated that nutritional health training leads to more tendency to eating breakfast in trained groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.000).</p><p>88.2% of the participants believed that there was no difference between family members&#x02019; meal, but 11% of the adolescents thought that the fathers in the families received more and better meal. Data analysis showed the high level of parents&#x02019; education led to less gender discrimination in the family.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>Adolescence is a window to a healthy life in future.
