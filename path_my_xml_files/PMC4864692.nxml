New Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organization regards pain as fifth vital sign and requires caregivers to regularly assess pain. Inadequate pain relief during childhood may have long-term negative effects including harmful neuroendocrine responses disrupted eating and sleep cycles and increased pain perception during subsequent painful experiences. Postoperative pain can result in an uncooperative and restless child. Hence, it is preferable to prevent the onset of pain rather than to relieve its existence.</p><p>Various multimodal techniques have been designed for pediatric pain relief. These include both systemic and regional analgesia. The most commonly used regional technique is caudal epidural block. Advantages of the caudal block are early extubation, ambulation, and decreased the risk of chest infections, decreased postoperative analgesic requirements, and early discharge.</p><p>As one of the disadvantages of the caudal block is the relatively short duration of analgesia. Therefore, various additives, e.g., ketamine,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] ephedrine,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] clonidine,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and opioids[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have been used to prolong the duration of analgesia provided by single injection.</p><p>Both clonidine and dexmedetomidine belong to same &#x003b1;2 agonists group, but the difference is that latter has 1600 times' greater affinity for &#x003b1;2a receptors. These drugs interact with local anesthetics by three possible mechanisms. First, by blocking A&#x003b4; and C fibers as a consequence of an increase in potassium conductance in isolated neurons, thus intensifying local anesthetic conduction block, second by causing local vasoconstriction, thus decreasing local anesthetic spread, and removal around neural structures. This effect is mediated by drug action on postsynaptic &#x003b1;2 receptors; spinal &#x003b1;2 adrenergic agonists may also induce analgesia by activating spinal cholinergic neurons resulting acetylcholine release. Dexmedetomidine has an 8-fold greater affinity for &#x003b1;2a receptors, responsible for the hypnotic and analgesic effects of such drugs.</p><p>Considering the above facts, we designed this study using bupivacaine alone and bupivacaine with dexmedetomidine to assess analgesic efficacy, duration of postoperative analgesia, hemodynamic stability, postoperative sedation, and any adverse effects in children undergoing infraumbilical operations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining approval from Ethical Committee, a written informed consent was obtained from all the parents of the children who participated in this study. This study was conducted in 100 children of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 2&#x02013;10 years, undergoing elective infraumbilical surgeries such as herniotomy, orchidopexy, hypospadias repair, etc. The patients with a history or evidence of infection at back, allergy to drugs, congenital malformations of the back, preexisting neurological or spinal diseases were excluded from this study.</p><p>All these patients underwent a preanesthetic check-up the day before surgery, and all the routine and specific investigations were noted. The children were electively kept nil by mouth for 6 h. Before surgery and before operation a written and informed parental consent was taken from the parents. An intravenous line was secured, and injection isolyte <italic>P</italic> was started. Standard monitors such as an electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive blood pressure (BP) were applied. All children were premedicated intravenously with injection glycopyrrolate 0.04 mg/kg and Emeset 0.1 mg/kg. General anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane, and orotracheal intubation was done. Anesthesia was maintained on O<sub>2</sub>+ N<sub>2</sub>O + sevoflurane/isoflurane + injection atracurium/injection vecuronium bromide.</p><p>As this study was double-blind, both groups were given according to calculated weight basis dose with an equal volume of 1 ml of (dexmedetomidine or saline) to the observer. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either (bupivacaine + saline) or (bupivacaine + dexmedetomidine) in each group. All assessments were made by single observer in a double-blind fashion.</p><p>After induction, caudal block was performed with full aseptic and antiseptic precautions with the patient in the left lateral position. According to the drug administered the patients were randomly allocated into two groups:</p><p>

</p><p>The site of injection was dressed, and the patient was turned supine. Heart rate (HR), BP, respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation were recorded before induction and then immediately after caudal anesthesia, and every 10 min during surgery thereafter. Adequate analgesia was defined as hemodynamic stability as indicated by the absence of an increase in systolic BP or HR of more than 20% compared with baseline value and from the intraoperative requirement of the inhalational agent. A decrease in mean arterial pressure &#x0003e;30% was defined as hypotension and was treated with intravenous fluids/injection ephedrine. A decrease in HR &#x0003e;30% was considered as bradycardia and was treated with injection atropine 0.01 mg/kg.</p><p>After completion of surgery, the residual neuromuscular block was reversed with injection neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and injection glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg. The patients were then extubated after thorough oral and endotracheal suction.</p><p>All patients were observed for 2 h, in recovery room before returning to ward. HR, BP, RR were monitored continuously. Postoperative pain was assessed at 30 min 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 18, and 24 h after recovery from anesthesia using face, legs, activity, cry, consolability (FLACC) scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Face, legs, activity, cry, consolability pain scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-10-227-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Duration of analgesia (time from caudal block to the first dose of rescue analgesic) was recorded.

It is a reliable and safe technique that can be used with general anesthesia for intra and postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal and lower limb surgeries.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The main disadvantage of caudal anesthesia is the short duration of action after a single injection of local anesthetic solution. The use of caudal catheters to administer repeated doses or infusions of local anesthetics is not popular because of the risk of infection. &#x0201c;Double-caudal&#x0201d; technique whereby the caudal is &#x0201c;topped up&#x0201d; at the end of the procedure has recently been advocated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is highly selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptor agonist, the analgesic action of intrathecal or epidural dexmedetomidine results from direct stimulation of pre- and post-synaptic &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenoreceptors in the dorsal grey matter of spinal cord thereby inhibiting the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters. This effect correlates with the concentration of dexmedetomidine in the cerebrospinal fluid but not that in the plasma.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>This study was undertaken to assess the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine in pediatric patients undergoing infraumbilical surgeries under caudal analgesia.</p><p>Group A: (0.25%) plain bupivacaine 1 ml/kg + NS 1 ml.</p><p>Group B: (0.25%) plain bupivacaine 1 ml/kg + 1 &#x000b5;g/kg dexmedetomidine in 1 ml NS.</p><p>Sharpe <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] speculated that small volume of bupivacaine (0.5 ml/kg) may not be enough to deliver clonidine up to the spinal cord leaving only direct action on the nerve routes in the caudal area. These findings suggest that the addition of clonidine 2 &#x000b5;g/kg to the low volume of caudal anesthetics has limited clinical benefit in children undergoing circumcision. Furthermore, Joshi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] in their study did not recommend the addition of 2 &#x000b5;g/kg clonidine to 0.125% bupivacaine mg/kg. Hence, we chose a standard dose of 1 ml/kg 0.25% bupivacaine in both the groups.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>We chose a dose of 1 &#x000b5;g/kg of dexmedetomidine in our study as there were similar studies[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] done with clonidine showing that increasing the dose from 1 &#x000b5;g/kg to 2 &#x000b5;g/kg did not enhance the analgesic effect of clonidine but increased the incidence of side effects such as respiratory depression, bradycardia, and hypotension with increasing dose. Data are still insufficient about the effects of different concentrations of dexmedetomidine when used to prolong caudal analgesia. Recently, a study was done by Al-Zaben <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in which they assessed analgesic efficacy and side effects of two doses (1 &#x000b5;g/kg and 2 &#x000b5;g/kg) of dexmedetomidine administered along with bupivacaine and concluded that increasing the dose increased side effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and urinary retention whereas duration of postoperative analgesia was comparable.</p><p>We chose the FLACC pain scale to evaluate postoperative pain as it is easy to use, is validated and gives an objective evaluation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intra- and post-operative pulse rate and blood pressure</title><p>In children, dexmedetomidine has been used without clinically important respiratory or hemodynamic effects. Although hemodynamic side effects appears to be less pronounced in children than in adults, they may be dose-dependent as reported by Konakci <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The side effects of neuraxial dexmedetomidine administration include hypotension and bradycardia. The antihypertensive effect results from stimulation of &#x003b1;2 inhibitory neurons in the medullary vasomotor center of the brainstem, which leads to a reduction in norepinephrine turnover and sympathetic outflow from the central nervous system to the peripheral tissues. Bradycardia is caused by an increase in vagal tone resulting from central stimulation of parasympathetic outflow, as well as reduced sympathetic drive. Dexmedetomidine has an 8-fold greater affinity for &#x003b1;2 receptors as compared to clonidine. It is more selective for &#x003b1;2a receptors that are responsible for sedative and analgesic effects of such drugs.
