The following variables were assessed before intervention and 3 and 6 weeks after its beginning: Waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting serum concentrations of triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST).

They are high in phytochemicals, fibre, protein, minerals and vitamins. Most of the researches that have investigated the effect of legume consumption on metabolic features studied soybeans rather than non-soybean legumes. The effects of soy bean on metabolic features are well-known.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In Iran low amounts of soy beans are consumed, while non-soy legume such as white, red and wax beans, chickpeas, cowpea, lentils and split peas are conventional foods. Anderson and Major in 2002 performed a meta-analysis on secondary outcomes of eleven clinical trials and showed consumption of non-soy legumes was associated with increasing of HDL-C and decreasing of triglyceride (TG) and weight.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] After Anderson and Major meta-analysis several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were studied the effects of legumes on metabolic features. Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. tested the effects of legume on biomarkers of insulin resistance among males in isocaloric and hypocaloric diets. Despite isocaloric diet, in hypocaloric period of intervention, mean body weight, body mass index (BMI), Levels of serum TG, C-peptide and fasting plasma glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein were significantly reduced.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In Hermsdorff study, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was improved only with the legume-based hypocaloric diet compared to calorie-restricted legume-free diet.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Inconsistent with Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. study, Crujeiras <italic>et al</italic>. and Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. showed baseline and endpoint values of insulin, C-peptide and glucose were not statistically different after following hypocaloric and isocaloric diets with or without legumes.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Even Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. showed high-legume diet increased fasting blood sugar (FBS) compared to legume-less diet.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Due to paradoxical results this study was planned.

Participants in HDWL group increased consumption of animal proteins (meat, poultry, fish, egg or cheese) as much as 2 servings/day (60 g) instead of legumes and reduced consumption of fats as much as 2 servings/day to compensate increased intake of animal fats. The amount of cereals in daily diet of both intervention groups was equivalent but participants in HDEL group were prescribed to consume 2 servings of cereals as legumes. The macronutrient content of both diets was 55% carbohydrate, 30% fat and 15% protein. In the intervention period, all of subjects in both groups were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (500-kcal less than their isocaloric needs). Diets were given individually. Participants were being visited every week for 20-30 min. The nutritionist explained the advantages of diets for the participants and trained participants how to write &#x0201c;food diaries.&#x0201d; Each participant had to write her 3-day physical-activity and diet records before the run-in period as well as before, in the middle and at the end of the intervention period.

The true isocaloric needs of some of the participants were different from the amount calculated in the formula from the Food and Nutrition Board at the Institute of Medicine. Among individuals eligible to enter the study, only those who maintained their weight at the end of the run-in period were chosen. After the run-in period on an isocaloric diet for 2 weeks, subjects were randomly allocated to two intervention groups for 6 weeks: (1) HDEL and (2) HDWL. For allocation of the participants, a computer-generated list of random numbers was used.</p><p>We repeated random allocation several times to obtain most homogenous groups.

Recent studies have indicated that liver enzymes are correlated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular diseases.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Due to blood liver enzymes levels as a new component of metabolic syndrome and their association with insulin resistance, our study provides new evidence for the benefits of consuming a specific food, like legumes, for women with central obesity.</p><p>In consistent with most of previous studies in healthy or obese participants, legumes had not beneficial effects on FBS, insulin and HOMA-IR.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] However, studies on diabetic or insulin resistant participants showed beneficial effects of legumes on insulin resistance parameters.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Another reason contributed to beneficial effects of legumes on insulin resistant parameters in Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. study can be the high amount of legumes in their hypocaloric diet.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The amount of legumes in legumes enriched hypocaloric diet of Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. study (3.8 servings/day) was higher than all of the previous RCTs. Furthermore, we showed in HDWL group percent of increase in FBS between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> weeks were significant and after enhancement of HOMA-IR in 1<sup>st</sup> 3 weeks in both groups only HDEL returned it to basal levels in the subsequent 3 weeks. These results represent probability of beneficial effects of legumes on insulin resistance in long period.</p><p>HDEL and HDWL significantly reduced the WC and legumes had no advantage in 3 and 6 weeks.</p><p>In HDWL group percent of increase in SBP, DBP, FBS and TG between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> weeks was significant. These findings confirmed beneficial effects of legumes on metabolic features and showed that omitting of legumes from diet may have harmful effects on metabolic features and increase the cardiovascular risk. In HDWL group participants stopped their usual intake of legumes and replaced it and some of diet liquid fats with animal proteins and fats. Probably the effect of this change on increasing TG is more than lowering effect of hipocaloric diet.</p><p>In our study, legumes marginally increased HDL-C compared to legume-less diet only in 1<sup>st</sup> 3 weeks of the intervention. Hirshberg <italic>et al</italic>. exhibited a small positive correlation between pulses intake and HDL-C.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Short-term effect of legumes on HDL-C levels can be contributed to their specific proteins. Lasekan <italic>et al</italic>. represented in rats that pea proteins significantly increased HDL-in 4 weeks.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In consistent with Zahradka study,[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] HDEL had no advantage in increasing HDL-C compared to HDWL in 6 weeks but Abet <italic>et al</italic>. showed legumes reduced HDL-C.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Probably inconsistent result of Abet <italic>et al</italic>. study was created because of different amount of fat in their interventional diet.</p><p>In this study, the mean consumption of legume in pre-study period was 2.94 servings/week compared to 1serving/week in Hermsdorff study[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and 1.3 servings/week in Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. and Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. study.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In fact, the pre-study consumption of legume in our study was almost 3 times more than pre-study legume consumption in previous RCTs. In Crujerias and Hermsdorff studies the legumes consumption even after intervention reached to the pre-study level of the current study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The beneficial effects of different doses of legumes such as 4 serving/week in Hermsdroff study,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] 2 servings/d in current study, 3 servings/d in Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. and Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. studies,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] on BP, TG, HDL-C and liver enzymes and more beneficial effects of 3.8 servings/d in Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] not only on motioned metabolic features but also on C-peptide and fasting plasma glucose and insulin indicates probably there are liner relationship between the legumes consumption and SBP and fasting blood TG, HDL-C, liver enzymes, glucose, insulin and C-peptide. Legumes beneficial effects on these parameters did not reach to a plateau.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research studied a high-legume hypocaloric diet exclusively in women. The advantage of current research was the particular population of our research which their mean usual intake of non-soy legumes was nearly threefold of usual intakes in preceding RCTs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This study offered an opportunity to discover the effects of high-legume diet on metabolic features in subjects with high basal intake of legumes. The present study had two limitations: First, The subjects&#x02019; explanations for leaving the research were not assessed in the current study. Second, Intervention diets had inevitable differences in animal protein and fat content in addition to legumes content and some of observed results could be related to this diversity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>HDEL significantly reduced the SBP and TG. Both HDEL and HDWL significantly increased fasting concentration of insulin and HOMA-IR after 3 weeks, but their significant effects on insulin disappeared after 6 weeks and HDEL returned HOMA-IR to baseline levels in the subsequent 3 weeks. In HDEL group percent of decrease in AST and ALT between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> weeks was significant. In HDWL group percent of increase in SBP, DBP, FBS and TG between 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> weeks was significant. The study indicated beneficial effects of hypocaloric diets on central obesity and legumes on blood pressure, metabolic features and hepatic function. Long-term studies for approving these results are necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Tabriz University of medical sciences, Nutrition Research Center and Liver and Gastrointestinal Disease Research Center for their support and also thank the participants of this study for their enthusiastic support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This work was supported by Tabriz University of medical sciences (Grant no. 5.4.8491), Nutrition Research Center (Grant no. 5.71.2419) and Liver and Gastrointestinal Disease Research Center (Grant no.
