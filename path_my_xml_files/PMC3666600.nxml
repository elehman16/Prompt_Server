Persons living with HIV (PLWH) commonly experience negative cognitive, coping, and emotional processes that negatively impact self-care, symptom management and subsequent disease, quality of life, and symptom outcomes.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ijtmb-6-9">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ijtmb-6-9">3</xref>)</sup> Dysfunctional coping approaches include increasing drug use, fatalistic thoughts about their future, suicidal tendencies, and selective or nondisclosure of HIV status.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijtmb-6-9">4</xref>)</sup> Negative cognitive experiences, such as depression or self-blame for contracting HIV<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijtmb-6-9">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ijtmb-6-9">6</xref>)</sup> and avoidant and/or intrusive thoughts related to HIV, appear to compromise coping abilities and are associated with psychological distress.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ijtmb-6-9">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijtmb-6-9">9</xref>)</sup></p><p>Persons with HIV commonly experience an overwhelming severity of symptoms from both the disease and HIV medications.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijtmb-6-9">10</xref>)</sup> Major depression is the psychiatric disorder most associated with HIV infection<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ijtmb-6-9">11</xref>)</sup> and, along with substance use disorders, is highly predictive of suicidal ideation in PLWH.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ijtmb-6-9">12</xref>)</sup> Sleep disturbance is another very common symptom, experienced by as many as 73% of persons with HIV. <sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijtmb-6-9">13</xref>)</sup> Negative cognitive-emotional factors may exacerbate or interfere with management of the broad and severe array of HIV symptoms, including depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, muscle aches, and pain, among other psychological and physical symptoms. <sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ijtmb-6-9">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ijtmb-6-9">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijtmb-6-9">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ijtmb-6-9">15</xref>)</sup> The degree to which symptoms affect PWLH varies;<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ijtmb-6-9">16</xref>)</sup> this raises questions about potential contributors to symptom experience, including psychosocial factors. A longitudinal study of a diverse sample of PLWH found that poor emotion regulation strategies and lack of social support predicted an increase in HIV-related physical symptoms across time, indicating the importance of learning strategies for positive emotional coping and self-care.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ijtmb-6-9">17</xref>)</sup></p><p>Because certain cognitive and emotional factors are amenable to change, such factors known to be beneficial or detrimental to HIV coping and symptom outcomes may be ideal targets for nonpharmaceutical treatments, particularly those involving a mind-body approach. Mind-body approaches are designed to promote integration of cognitive, emotional, and physical awareness.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ijtmb-6-9">18</xref>)</sup> In somatic and experiential psychology theory, psychophysical awareness is linked to symptom reduction and to conscious internal processes of self-acceptance and emotion regulation.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijtmb-6-9">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ijtmb-6-9">20</xref>)</sup> The few studies that have investigated mind-body interventions for HIV show positive results. In three recent randomized control trials, Tai Chi<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ijtmb-6-9">9</xref>)</sup> and mindfulness meditation<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijtmb-6-9">21</xref>)</sup> showed immune dysfunction attenuation compared to controls; a mindfulness-based stress reduction study showed reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) symptoms and distress.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ijtmb-6-9">22</xref>)</sup> A Cochrane review of massage studies for HIV found that interventions that combined massage and mind-body approaches, such as stress reduction or meditation, were superior to massage alone for improved quality of life.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ijtmb-6-9">23</xref>)</sup></p><p>This study is the first to examine the mind-body intervention Mindful Awareness in Body-oriented Therapy (MABT) for persons living with HIV. MABT involves both massage and mindful body awareness practice (see Methods section for details). Developed by the first author, MABT is designed to develop the capacity to mindfully attend to inner-body experience as a self-regulatory mechanism to better cope with the psychological and physical stressors of daily life and chronic illness. Distinct from other mindfulness-based approaches, MABT incorporates a hands-on (manual) approach, and individual (vs. group) delivery, andfocusses on learning interoception and integrating mindful body awareness strategies for self-care. Interoception involves the processing of sensory input from inside the body<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ijtmb-6-9">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ijtmb-6-9">25</xref>)</sup> and MABT teaches interoceptive skills to facilitate embodied sense of self. Multiple prior studies of MABT with individuals in recovery from sexual trauma<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijtmb-6-9">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ijtmb-6-9">27</xref>)</sup> and from substance use disorders<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ijtmb-6-9">28</xref>)</sup> have shown positive results, including improved psychological and physical symptoms, body connection, and emotion regulation. These results suggest MABT applicability to PLWH who similarly tend to live with chronic levels of physical and psychological distress, stigma, and shame.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ijtmb-6-9">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ijtmb-6-9">5</xref>)</sup> The study aims were to describe: 1) MABT recruitment and retention feasibility; 2) MABT acceptability as an adjunct to HIV medical management;, and 3) health (depression, HIV symptoms, life events stress, awareness and regulation, and HIV management self-efficacy) of study participants at pre- and postintervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Research Design</title><p>A one-group, pre&#x02013;post design was employed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the MABT intervention with PLWH. Eight individual 1.5 hour sessions of the MABT intervention, delivered by one of two interventionists over ten weeks, were offered to all participants. A battery of self-report questionnaires and one week of actigraphy were administered pre- and postintervention. The study procedures and consent forms were in accord with the Helskinki Declaration of 1975, and were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Washington.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Recruitment and Selection</title><p>Ten individuals that attended an outpatient day program for medical management for low-income individuals with HIV in a large northwestern city of the United States were recruited to participate in this study. The outpatient facility serves only patients on Medicaid; 70% use addictive substances and have comorbid psychological disorders, and 30% meet the broad criteria of &#x0201c;homelessness,&#x02019; meaning that they do not have a permanent address. Licensed social workers (MSWs), integral staff members of the outpatient day program, identified patients to be recruited. These patients were contacted by phone by the study research coordinator and given an overview of the study using an IRB-approved recruitment script. Interested individuals were scheduled for an initial appointment with the research coordinator for eligibility screening. Inclusion criteria: HIV infected, willing to sign permission for collection of medical data from their charts, willing to sign release to contact the social work staff in the case of concern regarding their safety or well-being, able to read and write in English, available for study intervention on days when MABT sessions were offered, and willing to forgo nonstudy body therapy and mindfulness meditation during the intervention period. Exclusion criteria: diagnosed with psychosis, having cognitive impairment as indicated by chart diagnosis or observable cognitive difficulties, report being in a current abusive domestic/interpersonal relationship.</p></sec><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Sample Characteristics</title><p>Of the ten patients contacted for recruitment, nine (four female and five male) were interested in study participation.

Massage therapy facilitates sensory awareness and bodily association;<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ijtmb-6-9">26</xref>)</sup> body literacy involves identification and articulation of sensory experience. Interoception is thought to facilitate positive coping<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ijtmb-6-9">29</xref>)</sup> and the development of awareness that is integral to sense of self.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ijtmb-6-9">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ijtmb-6-9">31</xref>)</sup> Mindfulness skills of present-moment awareness, observation, and acceptance that are taught in MABT are thought to facilitate compassionate presence toward self and others.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ijtmb-6-9">32</xref>)</sup> Mindfulness research has demonstrated reduced stress, reduced psychological symptoms, and improved coping for disease symptom management.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ijtmb-6-9">33</xref>)</sup> The MABT intervention was designed to be responsive to individual comfort and safety needs and, thus, there is flexibility in the protocol to attend to emotional or physical discomfort, should it arise.</p><p>Key elements of the intervention (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ijtmb-6-9">Table 1</xref>) are:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Check-in.

Massage, using a standardized protocol,<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ijtmb-6-9">34</xref>)</sup> was delivered over clothes on a massage table. To facilitate body literacy, therapists asked questions such as, &#x0201c;What are you noticing in your body right now?&#x0201d; and, &#x0201c;How would you describe how it feels in this area?&#x0201d;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Interoceptive training.

Delivered on the table, it involved: a) interoceptive awareness of a specific area within the body; b) sustained mindful present-moment awareness in the body; and c) intermittent attention to specific aspects of sensory awareness, a process guided by the therapist.

The first was the Satisfaction Survey, a revised version of the Project Match participant satisfaction questionnaire.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ijtmb-6-9">39</xref>)</sup> The survey included four Likert-type questions (each scored individually) with a scale range of 1 (&#x0201c;extremely dissatisfied&#x0201d;) to 8 (&#x0201c;extremely satisfied&#x0201d;) specific to satisfaction with the MABT intervention experience, including overall satisfaction, satisfaction with therapist and number of sessions, and the extent to which the MABT intervention met therapeutic goals. An additional set of survey questions specific to the perceived helpfulness of MABT components (check-in, massage, body awareness exercises, mindful practice, session review, and homework) was included with a scale of 1 (&#x0201c;extremely unhelpful&#x0201d;) to 5 (&#x0201c;extremely helpful&#x0201d;). Also, a written questionnaire was administered asking participants to describe their MABT experience.

Engagement included session attendance and completion of homework. Process evaluation of MABT delivery was collected from the MABT therapists, and involved therapist completion of a process evaluation form immediately after each session to assess administration of MABT key elements.

There were two primary steps involved in the qualitative analysis. The initial step involved categorizing types of general response to the questions. Two research team members individually coded the written questionnaires for overall themes across participant responses identified in response to each question or set of participant responses.

In situations in which the log was not brought to the session, the therapist would fill one out with the participant that day. Based on the logs for the eight participants who completed the intervention, we had data for 78% of the weekly sessions. The logs showed consistent use (daily or almost daily) of body awareness homework for the majority of participants, with an average of body awareness practice for 3&#x02013;5 minutes/day.

All indicated satisfaction with the number of sessions received. In response to a question about whether they would want to receive MABT if available in the future, all indicated that they would.</p></sec><sec><title>MABT experience: perceived benefit</title><p>Three themes emerged from responses to the written post-test questionnaire. First, the most important MABT experience was the relief of emotional and physical pain or discomfort through the use of new mind-body techniques. One participant wrote that these techniques help to &#x0201c;experience a space or state of mind completely away from the [usual] behaviors one can have (eg, rapid thoughts, lack of concentration, negativity)&#x02026;&#x0201d; Another wrote, &#x0201c;[I] leave [the] shame from past &#x02026; [MABT has] allowed me to start dancing again, feel more loose, sleep better. Dancing is from happiness &#x02013; lifts the burden &#x02013; [the trauma] separated me from it &#x02026; [now I] have joy again.&#x0201d; A third person wrote that MABT helps &#x0201c; &#x02026; know myself better, about my feelings, how I respond to other people&#x02019;s treatment of me and how to &#x02018;stay on top.&#x0201d;</p><p>Secondly, seven out of eight participants indicated that they&#x02019;d learned something new from MABT; one was not sure. The common theme among their responses was that they learned self-care skills based on a new awareness of self. One participant wrote, &#x0201c;Compassionate attention to pain rather than fighting it is so much more successful for managing pain&#x02026; [I&#x02019;m] trying to do less stressful physical activities.&#x0201d; From another, &#x0201c;This has helped me relax and if I&#x02019;m having a hard day I can breathe deeply and detach from negative situations easier, acknowledge the feelings, and move on vs. having them affect me so bad.&#x0201d;</p><p>A third theme emerged in response to the question about whether or not MABT had an influence on living with HIV. With one exception, all participants perceived that MABT had a positive effect, either by helping with symptom management or helping them to face challenges of living with HIV. One participant wrote, &#x0201c;When I feel the pressure to get things done throughout the day I take deeper breaths and relax. It helps me think more clearly which helps me deal with the pressure [of living with HIV].&#x0201d; Another wrote, &#x0201c;Compassionate attention has helped me in dealing with all parts of my life including the symptoms of HIV &#x02013; the night sweats and the physical pains I attend to compassionately rather than fight the pain with anger and Ibuprofen.&#x0201d; Participants noted a wide variety of HIV symptom improvements including reduced pain, ability to manage pain, sleep, stress management, and an ability to engage in self-care. One participant discussed the importance of addressing depression and body image for individuals with HIV.</p></sec><sec><title>MABT readiness and challenge</title><p>All participants indicated that body-oriented therapy was appropriate and therapeutic for them at this point in their illness. Five participants described the body therapy intervention as challenging, two said it was not, and one was unsure. The challenging aspects of MABT were: newness of the process, uncomfortable memories, and the commitment required to attend regularly scheduled sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Protocol Fidelity and Safety</title><p>While the interventionists were able to administer the protocol as designed, they noted that participants&#x02019; ability to maintain sustained attention to their bodies was limited. In clinical terms this means that when participants were guided to bring attention to their inner body, they were only able to do so for brief moments.</p><p>The protocol is designed to meet participants at their ability and comfort levels, thus the session time included more attention to interoceptive training and less sustained time in mindful body awareness practice than we&#x02019;ve seen in studies with other populations. The process evaluation forms were also used to identify possible adverse events specific to delivery of the intervention. Assessment of negative or adverse events occurred at session check-in, through therapist observation or direct report by the participant to a research team member, and in post-test written questionnaire. There were no unexpected effects of the intervention, and no reported adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-intervention Health Status</title><p>Individual change from pre- to post-treatment was examined using means and graphs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ijtmb-6-9">Tables 3</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ijtmb-6-9">4</xref>). This small pilot sample was underpowered to detect significant effects and none were statistically significant by Wilcoxon signed-ranks testing. There were, however, a few notable pre&#x02013;post changes. These included, first, a reduction in number of participants that scored above the screening threshold for severe depression. At pretest, eight study participants that completed the intervention scored above the screening cutoff for severe depression, compared to five at postintervention, suggesting a clinically meaningful reduction in depression symptoms for 40% of the participants. Second, all individual participants, except one, improved across all sleep outcomes. With the exception of diary-reported sleep efficiency which showed a 50% improvement, the mean values of most sleep outcomes (Sleep Onset Latency, WASO, Total Wake Time, and Total Sleep Time) showed small improvements from pre- to post-treatment (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-ijtmb-6-9">Table 4</xref>). Third, there were changes in the unexpected direction, such as an overall mean reduction in self-compassion and increase in bodily dissociation.</p><table-wrap id="t3-ijtmb-6-9" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Pre- and Post-Self&#x02013;Report Health Outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Construct</italic></th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Pre Mean (SD) N=9</italic></th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Post Mean (SD) N=8</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Depression</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 (6)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (10)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HIV Symptoms</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (12)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (12)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Life Events Stress</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9 (2.6)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9 (1.6)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body Awareness</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.1 (1.0)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5 (.45)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bodily Dissociation</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">.95 (.41)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 (.43)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Emotion Regulation</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">74 (19)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76 (22)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Self-Compassion</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38 (5.3)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (5.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adherence Self-efficacy</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">107 (20)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">95 (25)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic Disease Self-efficacy</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">79 (13)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 (14)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="t4-ijtmb-6-9" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Sleep Outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Sleep Disturbance: Sleep Diary</italic></th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Pre Mean (SD) N=8</italic></th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Post Mean (SD) N=7</italic></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sleep Onset Latency (min)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34 (40)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (5.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sleep Efficiency (%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85 (8.1)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">87 (11)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">WASO (min)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (35)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (18)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total Sleep Time (hours)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 (1.3)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0 (1.5)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1">

There was substantial interest in study enrollment and participation, a positive recruitment/enrollment response, and a high number of completed MABT sessions. The intervention provided new self-care skills to cope with emotional and physical distress; these were perceived to be important for management of HIV-related symptoms. Notably, the qualitative findings indicate that participants perceived MABT to facilitate self-compassion and symptom management self-efficacy.</p><p>This study population fit the characteristic profile of high psychological and physical distress,<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ijtmb-6-9">40</xref>)</sup> poor sleep,<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ijtmb-6-9">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ijtmb-6-9">67</xref>)</sup> moderate-high HIV adherence self-efficacy,<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijtmb-6-9">41</xref>)</sup> and moderate self-compassion<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ijtmb-6-9">41</xref>)</sup> common among PLWH. The results of this pilot study suggest that MABT decreases depression and improves quality of sleep. Such outcomes suggest that it may be particularly useful to continue to study the effects of MABT on persons suffering from symptoms related to chronic HIV infection. Triangulation of contrasting qualitative and quantitative findings facilitates interpretation of study outcomes. The worsened pre-to-post response on the self-compassion and bodily dissociation questionnaires is likely the result of improved participant familiarity with these concepts and a concomitant self-reappraisal based on experiencing the perceived challenges and gains in self-compassion and body connection. When a measure for a construct such as self-compassion and body connection involves skills and new language learned during an intervention, the participant&#x02019;s understanding of the questionnaire items may change during the learning process. This has been observed and described in development of a mindfulness measure for mindfulness meditation.<sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-ijtmb-6-9">68</xref>)</sup></p><p>The participants were familiar with massage, and this could have positively influenced recruitment and overall implementation feasibility and acceptability of this intervention. On the other hand, participants were unfamiliar with body-oriented therapy, particularly as it relates to attending to and processing of sensory experience, including emotion. Process evaluations from the research therapists highlight the additional time needed to teach interoceptive and mindful body awareness tools. The participants&#x02019; report of learning beneficial skills, their satisfaction with all aspects of the MABT intervention, and their willingness to engage in body awareness homework indicates that the challenges of MABT did not detract from MABT engagement, satisfaction, or perceived benefit. Process evaluation accounts do suggest, however, that more intervention sessions to practice and learn MABT skills may be appropriate for this population.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>There are several study limitations to consider. The small sample size, socio-economic status of the participants, and one-group design limit interpretation and generalization of the study results. With regard to the sampling approach, the recruitment of patients identified by the social workers (vs. self-referral) may have biased the feasibility results. However, all patients at the facility were similar to the study participants in that they were long-term HIV-infected, and suffered from related physical and psychological symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>The results suggest a few important clinical implications specific to treatment. First, the positive response to this intervention suggests the interest in, and therapeutic importance of, mind-body interventions that emphasize body connection and self-care for HIV symptom management. Second, the qualitative findings point to the importance of self-compassion and self-acceptance to facilitate better coping and self-care in this population; these are critical aspects for improving quality of life, and for addressing the challenges&#x02014;depression in particular&#x02014;of living with HIV as a long-term chronic illness. Last, learning MABT skills was not easy for many of the participants, as these skills were unfamiliar and the participants struggled with the concentrated inner focus of mindful body awareness. Thus their willingness to engage and practice MABT skills was remarkable and speaks to the motivation for personal growth and better coping skills. It is possible that receiving nurturing touch and personal attention contributed to participant engagement in the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This pilot project was an important first study to examine the feasibility and acceptability of body-oriented therapy for PLWH. Future research is needed to address the study limitations and test MABT efficacy to improve coping with HIV symptoms among PLWH through the use of a larger sample, more diverse sample (perhaps based on a study with multiple sites), and a randomized clinical trial. MABT research to examine improved self-compassion and coping among PLWH in palliative care is also an important area for future research.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the study participants for their willingness to join us in the research process, and the Bailey Boushay staff for their support and assistance in taking care of details that made it possible to implement this project. We could not have successfully completed this study without the sensitive care, flexibility, and multiple efforts of the research massage therapists, Nina Edgerton and Sarah Huntting&#x02014;to you both we extend our sincere gratitude. Funding for this project was received from the University of Washington School of Nursing Research and Intramural Funding Program.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ijtmb-6-9"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF
