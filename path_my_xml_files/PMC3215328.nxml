Cartilage is the slippery tissue that covers the end of bones in a joint. Healthy cartilage allows the bone to glide over one another. It also absorbs energy from the shock of physical movement. In osteoarthritis the surface layer of cartilage break down under and wears away. This allow bones under the cartilage to rub together, causing pain swelling and loss of motion of the joint. Over the time the joint may lose its normal shape. Also the bone spurs small growth called osteophytes may grow on edges of the joint . Bits of bone or cartilage can break off and float inside the joint space. This causes more pain and damage.</p><p>In <italic>Ayurveda</italic> the symptom of this disease are approximately similar to that of janu sandhigata vata . The complete remedy of this disease is still not available in modern medicine the drugs used are mainly -Analgesic, anti inflammatory, steroids, which cannot pacify the disease but are only symptomatic. On the other hand furious side effect like gastritis, ulceration of mucosal layer of stomach, heart burn and vomiting are added as the unwanted results. In other words, osteoarthritis of later age is a <italic>Jarajanya vyadhi</italic> (disease of the ageing). In <italic>Ayurveda, snehana, swedana, guggulu</italic> administration in the disease could be considered relevant treatment measures. Knee traction could be helpful in maintaining the reduction of space in Osteoarthritis of knee and in the clinical recovery of the sign of crepitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims &#x00026; Objectives:</title><p>

It is a slowly progressive joint disease. It is reported that age is the most powerful risk factor for OA. In a radiographic survey of women less than 45 years old, only 2% had OA, however prevalence was 30%, between the ages of 45 to 64 years, and for those older than 65 years it was 68%. In males, the figures were similar but somewhat lower in the older age groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>. In India these degenerative changes in joints arise from the age of 30 years in women. Osteoarthritis is a major cause of morbidity and disability, limiting activity and impaired quality of life especially among the elderly. The primary complaints of patients with Osteoarthritis are pain and difficulty in joint mobility. The etiology of pain is multi-factorial, including inflammatory and non-inflammatory causes. The disease is managed by NSAIDs, analgesic drugs, physiotherapy and corticosteroids etc. Above drugs are very costly and cause unwanted affects. Even the surgical treatment does not provide complete relief.</p><p>In <italic>Ayurveda, Sandhivata</italic> is given as a <italic>Vatavyadhi</italic> and it is also believed that any type of pain can not be without presence of <italic>Vata.

This does not seen to have any important role to play as far as <italic>Sandhivata</italic> is concerned.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Results</title><p><italic>Effect on Joint Pains:</italic> Statistically highly significant improvement (p&#x0003c;.001) in joint pains was observed in all the three groups ,while percentage gain (88.24%) in group C is highest indicating the synergistic effect of drug with <italic>snehana, swedana</italic> &#x00026; traction.</p><p><italic>Effect on Oedema:</italic> Statistically insignificant improvement in joint pains was observed in groups A (p&#x0003e;.05) ,whereas significant improvement was observed in group C (p&#x0003c;.02) &#x00026; moderate significant improvement in group B (p&#x0003c;.01).</p><p><italic>Effect on Tenderness:</italic> Statistically highly significant improvement in joint pains was observed in all the three groups (p&#x0003c;.001), percentage gain (53.85%) is best in group C.</p><p><italic>Effect on Restriction in Joint Movement:</italic> Statistically highly significant improvement in joint pains was observed in all the three groups, the percentage gain (88.57%) in group C exceeds the other two groups A &#x00026; B (48.86% &#x00026; 76.47).</p><p><italic>Effect on Stiffness:</italic> Statistically highly significant improvement in joint pains was observed in all the three groups, whereas percentage gain was highest in group C (50%).</p><p><italic>Effect on Local Crepitation:</italic> Statistically insignificant improvement in joint pains was observed in group A &#x00026; more significant improvement in joint pains were observed in group B &#x00026; group C, whereas percentage gain was highest in group C (71.42%).</p><p><italic>Effect on Walking Distance:</italic> Statistically highly significant improvement in walking distance were observed in all the three groups, whereas percentage gain was highest in group C (87.09%).</p><p><italic>Effect on Heamatological Parameter:</italic> The evalution of heamatological parameters were done for screening the exclusion &#x00026; inclusion criterias &#x00026; to see any side effects of drugs &#x00026; treatment modalities during the trial. There were no significant changes in any groups.</p><p><italic>Follow up:</italic> Follow up was done for 2 months after completing the therapy to see any worsening or reccurence in signs &#x00026; symptoms of patients after treatment. Reccurence was seen only in 5 pts out of the total 30 pts with no reccurence in group C.</p><p><italic>Overall Result:</italic> In group A the results were highly significant in sign &#x00026; symptoms except in oedema &#x00026; crepitations where the results were insignificant, whereas in group B results were highly significant in sign &#x00026; symptoms except oedema &#x00026; crepitations where the results were more significant. In group C the result were highly significant in sign &#x00026; symptoms except in oedema where the results were significant &#x00026; moderately significant results in crepitations.</p><p>Joint pain, Tenderness, Restriction of joint movement, Stiffness &#x00026; Walking distance were considered for comparing the overall result among the groups because these were present in all the 30 pts. These show that group C is the best, group B is better than group A in bringing overall clinical recovery of patients.</p><p><italic>Comparison of three groups by unpaired &#x02018;t&#x02019; test:</italic> For comparison of the better group unpaired &#x02018;t&#x02019; test was done , which shows that group C was either more significant or highly significant in all the sign &#x00026; symptoms than group A &#x00026;B except in local crepitations where group C was not significant than group B. Thus it can be concluded that group C was better than group A &#x00026; B. Group B was better in treating oedema &#x00026; crepitations than group A due to more significant results. Group B &#x00026; C are equally competent in treating the crepitations. In walking distance the improvement was best in group C.</p><p>In combined group or group C best relief &#x00026; better significant results were seen in maximum signs &#x00026; symptoms of disease which were taken in present trial. Also it was seen in trial that group B was better in treating oedema &#x00026; crepitations than group A due to more significant results. According to significance, group B &#x00026; C were equally competent in treating the crepitations but more relief was seen in group C. In walking distance the improvement was best in group C.</p><p><italic>Laksha guggulu, snehana, swedana</italic> &#x00026; traction in combination provided better relief in the amelioration of signs and symptoms. As a matter of fact, either of these therapies did not appear to be solely responsible for the end result. Therefore combined effect of these therapies- was responsible in bringing overall clinical recovery of patients.</p><p><italic>Drugs &#x00026; Procedures:</italic> For the present study 30 clinically diagnosed patients were selected &#x00026; randomly divided into three groups. And all the patients were advised dietary restriction as per <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> texts. The content of <italic>Laksha guggulu</italic> include purified <italic>guggulu, Laksha, Asthisanharaka, Arjun, Ashwagandha</italic> and <italic>Nagabala</italic>. Most of these drugs have properties like.- <italic>Vatakaphanashaka, deepana, balya, rasayana, tridoshanashaka, pachana, shothaghna, vedanashamaka</italic> &#x00026; <italic>shoolaprashamaka</italic>. A compound preparation having these properties is likely to check the etiopathogenesis of the disease <italic>Sandhigata Vata</italic> and arrest its progress.</p><p>Similarly <italic>snehana</italic> and <italic>swedana</italic> with <italic>Dashamoola taila</italic> and <italic>Dashamoola kwatha</italic> together bring about <italic>vatashamaka, balya, anulomaka, deepana</italic> &#x00026; <italic>pachana</italic> effect in the body and may help to check the progress of the disease in <italic>Sandhigata vata</italic>. The probable mode of action of traction could be that it increase the joint space temporarily and increases movement &#x00026; flexibility of the joints. Muscle, ligament &#x00026; tendon strengthening and pain is relieved because of the bony fragment is separated.</p><p>On the clinical evaluation it was observed that the total effect of the therapies was mild, moderate &#x00026; maximum in group A, group B &#x00026; group C respectively. As the matter of fact no single mechanism appear to be solely responsible. Combined effect of <italic>Laksha Guggulu, Snehana, Swedana</italic> &#x00026; Traction was responsible in bringing overall clinical recovery of patients. The relief in clinical manifestation notably leads to functional recovery and the patient becomes functionally more competent. All the patients tolerated medicine &#x00026; treatment modalities well and side or toxic effects of these were not noticed in any of the patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>
