Due to its low blood/gas partition coefficient (0.68) and weak airway irritation, sevoflurane is the most popular anesthetic used for children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, it is associated with higher incidence of (EA) (up to 80%) and this incidence is not related to the duration of exposure and the dose of sevoflurane.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Multiple drugs and techniques used to control this problem as benzodiazepines, propofol, fentanyl, and &#x003b1;-2 agonists to improve quality of recovery profile in pediatric age group.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Among these drugs dexmedetomidine, the dextroenantiomer of medetomidine; the methylated derivative of etomidine is a highly specific &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonist and has sedative and analgesic properties without significant respiratory depression at the clinically approved dosage.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>There is now an increasing evidence to support the use of dexmedetomidine as a premedication, sedative, anesthetic adjunct, and for EA management in pediatric age group[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] for nonpainful[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and painful procedures[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] despite the lack of the United States&#x02019; Food and Drug Administration approval for use in this age group.

The study obtained an approval from the local Institution Research and Ethics Committee and registered at The Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.pactr.org">www.pactr.org</ext-link>) by the identification number of registry (PACTR201604001572340). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of all the children. The study included 86 patients ASA I and II physical status, and their ages ranged between 3 and 7-years. These patients were scheduled for an elective tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy under general anesthesia with sevoflurane. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea, mental retardation or developmental delay, chest, cardiac or neurological diseases, known allergy or hypersensitivity to dexmedetomidine, and patients receiving medications known to interact with dexmedetomidine such as furosemide, lorazepam, and diphenhydramine were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to hospital on the morning of surgery. They waited in pediatric preanesthesia holding area with their parents. They received no premedication and moved to the operating room (OR) accompanied by one of their parents. The parent was permitted to be present during the induction of anesthesia. All patients fasted 6 h for solids and 2 h for clear fluids. Patients were randomly allocated using a computerized random number generator into two groups. Group D (Study group) received intranasal dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA) at 1 &#x003bc;g/kg after induction of general anesthesia. Intranasal dexmedetomidine was prepared from the 100 &#x003bc;g/ml parenteral preparation in a 1-ml syringe (with 0.9% saline added to make a final volume of 1 ml.), 0.5 ml installed in each nostril. Group C (control group) received intranasal saline 0.9% after induction of general anesthesia, 0.5 ml in each nostril. Dose calculation, drug preparation, and administration were done by attending anesthesiologists who were not involved or had not participated in this trial. The observers and data collectors were blinded to the study drug given also. General anesthesia induction was done by gradual increase of sevoflurane concentration to a maximum of 6 Vol. % in 100% oxygen (6 L/min) via facemask. An intravenous (IV) catheter was inserted after the loss of eyelash reflex, then dexamethasone at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg given, and the airway was secured with oral endotracheal tube after an adequate depth of anesthesia reached with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and cis-atracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Electrocardiogram, oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> concentration (EtCO<sub>2</sub>), and end-tidal sevoflurane concentration were monitored continuously. Sevoflurane concentration was maintained at 2&#x02013;4 Vol. % in 50% oxygen air mixture (2 L/min) after intubation, then adjusted according to the patient's response to provide a stable HR, blood pressure (BP), and SpO<sub>2</sub> with pressure-controlled ventilation, inspiratory pressure, and respiratory rate adjusted to maintain EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 45 mmHg. All patients received acetaminophen (200 mg) suppository after induction of general anesthesia. During surgery, the surgeon infiltrated the operative site by 1% lidocaine with epinephrine (1:100,000) for pain and bleeding control (1 ml in each tonsillar bed). At the end of surgery, sevoflurane was discontinued, reversal of neuromuscular block facilitated by neostigmine bromide 20 &#x003bc;g/kg with atropine sulfate 20 &#x003bc;g/kg, and endotracheal tube was removed in lateral decubitus when the patients met the criteria of extubation (return of gag reflex, facial grimace, and purposeful motor movements). The time between the insertion and removal of the mouth gag recorded as the duration of surgery, and the time from sevoflurane mask induction till the extubation time was recorded as the duration of anesthesia. The time to extubation defined as the time from the end of surgery to tracheal extubation and the emergence time defined as the time of first response to command or eye opening on command after extubation were also recorded. On admission to postanesthesia care unit (PACU), the patients were monitored for HR, noninvasive BP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and respiratory rate continuously for 30 min by anesthesia nurses who were blinded to groups&#x02019; allocation. The primary outcome of this trial was the incidence of EA (highest score) which was assessed at six time points (after extubation, leaving the OR, on arrival to PACU, 10, 20, and 30 min after arrival in PACU) by four-point agitation scale[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Four-point scale for the assessment of emergence agitation[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-11-137-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Agitation scores of 3 and 4 were defined as an agitation episode and treated by nalbuphine (0.1 mg/kg) as a rescue therapy to control agitation episodes.

Nalbuphine as a rescue analgesic at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg was given if FLACC scores &#x02265;5. The four-point agitation score and FLACC scale score assessment were done by anesthesiologists blinded to groups&#x02019; allocation. In addition, time to discharge from PACU, defined as time started from patient's arrival to PACU till modified Aldrete score[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] &#x02265;9, and the incidence of adverse events (nausea, vomiting, somnolence, apnea, desaturation, hypotension, and bradycardia) were recorded.

Akin <italic>et al</italic>. used the same dose and route of administration in comparison to intranasal midazolam, their primary end-point was satisfactory mask induction which was significantly better in midazolam group, and they were unable to find statistically significant difference in incidence and severity of EA between groups when administration of the drugs was 45&#x02013;60 min before induction. In contrary, our trial was powered primarily to detect the preventive effect of dexmedetomidine on incidence and severity of EA. Nevertheless, Akin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the number of children requiring postoperative analgesia was significantly lower in children allocated to the dexmedetomidine group, and these data go in line with our findings.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In the same context, Guler <italic>et al</italic>. reported that an IV bolus of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine given 5 min before the end of surgery could significantly decrease incidence and severity of EA in children undergone adenotonsillectomy with sevoflurane.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In line with our findings, Olutoye <italic>et al</italic>. reported that there was no statistically significant difference in the analgesic effects of dexmedetomidine 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg and morphine 50 &#x003bc;g/kg in children underwent tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies, and they added that postoperative sedation and incidence of nausea and vomiting were less with dexmedetomidine.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In our trial, we used the FLACC scale to assess pain score, and it worked efficiently in nonverbal pediatric patients, and it was easily estimated in OR and PACU. The previously mentioned trials used other pain scales such as objective pain score,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] children and infants postoperative pain scale (CHIPPS),[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Wong&#x02013;Baker FACES pain rating scale,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain score.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] The pain after this type of surgical procedures could be severe and this may increase the incidence and aggravate the severity of EA, in addition, assessment of pain could be mistaken as an agitation episode and vice versa. Furthermore, most of the children with high-FLACC scale score &#x02265;5 had also high agitation score of 3 or 4 and require nalbuphine rescue dose. The clinical and statistical significant difference of nalbuphine use in control group emphasized both the sedative and the analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine which are also used for sedation and analgesia. The comparable recovery times between both groups could be attributed to the sedative effects of dexmedetomidine in Group D and on the other hand excess use of nalbuphine in Group C [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>There was relative delay of anesthesia time over surgery time in both groups; this delay could be attributed mainly to the period from removing mouse gag till extubation (extubation time). Although the extubation time was longer in Group D than in Group C by about 2 min (mean difference), it was statistically insignificant difference [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Of note, this relative delay was comparable between both groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting between both groups and also there were no reported cases of perioperative hypotension, bradycardia, apnea, desaturation, and excessive somnolence reflected high safety profile of the drug even with higher doses (2 &#x003bc;g/kg) as those used by Yuen <italic>et al</italic>. for better sedation and parent separation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In this trial, we choose to administer the drug intranasally after the induction of anesthesia to compensate for delayed onset (30&#x02013;45 min) to procedure lasting for 25&#x02013;45 min with peak effect at 90&#x02013;105 min after administration.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Although the anesthesia time is not matched perfectly in this trial (33.6 &#x000b1; 6.5 and 35.1 &#x000b1; 5.9 in Groups D and C, respectively) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] with the reported onset time of intranasal dexmedetomidine (30&#x02013;45 min),[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] it is fairly acceptable in clinical practice. The role of dexmedetomidine in the reduction of incidence and severity of EA in children after sevoflurane anesthesia is documented with different dose regimens, timing, techniques, and route of administration in two meta-analyses done by Gyanesh <italic>et al</italic>. and Sun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As a limitation to this study, we use one milliliter syringes dripping for intranasal drug installation due to lack of intranasal drug delivery systems as an atomizer and nasal spray which improve drug absorption, hasten onset time, and optimize bioavailability instead we use 1-mL syringe dripping. In addition, we did not measure serum concentration of dexmedetomidine repeatedly after intranasal installation, and future studies are needed to elucidate detailed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug in pediatric age group via the intranasal route.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrates that a dose of 1
