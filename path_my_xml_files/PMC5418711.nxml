Treatment options for severe malaria are limited and the choline analogue SAR97276A is a novel chemical entity that was developed primarily as treatment for severe malaria. Before starting clinical investigations in severely ill malaria patients, safety and efficacy of SAR97276A was studied in patients with uncomplicated malaria. Here, we summarize two open-label, multi-center phase 2 trials assessing safety and efficacy of parenterally administered SAR97276A in African adults and children with falciparum malaria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
<italic>Study 1</italic> was conducted in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Benin and Tanzania between August 2008 and July 2009 in malaria patients in an age de-escalating design (adults, children). A total of 113 malaria patients received SAR97276A. Adults were randomized to receive a single dose SAR97296A given either intramuscularly (IM) (0.18&#x000a0;mg/kg) or intravenously (IV) (0.14&#x000a0;mg/kg). If a single dose was not efficacious a second adult group was planned to test a three dose regimen administered IM once daily for 3&#x000a0;days. Single dose SAR97276A showed insufficient efficacy in adults (IM: 20 of 34 cured, 59%; and IV: 23/30 cured, 77%). The 3-day IM regimen showed acceptable efficacy in adults (27/30, 90%) but not in children (13/19, 68%). SAR97276A was well tolerated but no further groups were recruited due lack of efficacy. <italic>Study 2</italic> was conducted between October 2011 and January 2012 in Burkina Faso, Gabon and Kenya. SAR97276A administered at a higher dose given IM was compared to artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine. The study population was restricted to underage malaria patients to be subsequently enrolled in two age cohorts (teenagers, children). Rescue therapy was required in all teenaged malaria patients (8/8) receiving SAR97276A once daily (0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg) for 3&#x000a0;days and in 5 out of 8 teenaged patients treated twice daily (0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg) for 3&#x000a0;days. All patients (4/4) in the control group were cured. The study was stopped, before enrollment of children, due to lack of efficacy but the overall safety profile was good.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Monotherapy with SAR97276A up to twice daily for 3&#x000a0;days is not an efficacious treatment for falciparum malaria. SAR97276A will not be further developed for the treatment of malaria.</p><p>

Treatment of uncomplicated as well as severe malaria heavily relies on one class of compounds&#x02014;artemisinin derivatives. Starting in 2010 WHO has recommended parenteral artemisinins (artesunate as first-line treatment) also as treatment for severe malaria. Besides quinine no other substances for treatment of severe malaria are available. Reduced sensitivities against artemisinins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the adverse event of delayed hemolytic anemia after parenteral artesunate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] call for the development of new compounds. This is especially important for the treatment of severe malaria, where the development pipeline is particularly scarce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>SAR97276A (CAS number 321915-72-4) is a bis-thiazolium-dibromide whose precursor was synthesized in a series of choline analogues which act via interference with the choline metabolism of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites and lead to the inhibition of phospholipid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and also interferes with heme-detoxification by binding to ferriprotoporphyrin IX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Chemical optimization of choline analogues led to SAR97276A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] which showed powerful in vitro-activity against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> laboratory and clinical isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It was also highly efficacious in a malaria mouse and monkey model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. SAR97276A was less active when given orally (curative 4-day dose in the mouse model 20&#x02013;45&#x000a0;mg/kg/day orally; and 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day parenterally) and was therefore administered parenterally.</p><p>SAR97276A was well tolerated in three phase 1 clinical trials evaluating single doses of 0.2&#x02013;12.8&#x000a0;mg given intravenously (IV) to 52 participants, and single doses of 3.2&#x02013;36&#x000a0;mg given intramuscularly (IM) to 48 participants, compared to 32 placebo controls (unpublished data owned by Sanofi). Multiple doses (3&#x000a0;days) were given in two phase 1 trials to 27 participants IV at doses from 4.3 to 12.8&#x000a0;mg and to 36 participants IM at doses of 12.5&#x02013;36&#x000a0;mg compared to 21 placebo controls. Terminal half-life after single IM administration of 36&#x000a0;mg was 5.5&#x000a0;h in plasma and 73&#x000a0;h in whole blood. Adverse events (AEs) at the highest IV-single and multiple dose were accommodation disorders of the eye, blurred vision and gastrointestinal disorders (esophageal spasms); two participants had AEs of severe intensity displayed by severe abdominal spasm after receiving multiple doses of 12.8&#x000a0;mg IV. The highest administered dose was 36&#x000a0;mg given IM for 3&#x000a0;days. The highest tolerated dose for twice daily IM administration for 3&#x000a0;days was 18&#x000a0;mg, although one participant had an AE with severe intensity complaining of ophthalmologic problems including a temporary decrease in visual acuity that were considered to be drug related after receiving multiple administrations of 18&#x000a0;mg twice daily.</p><p>To develop SAR97276A for parenteral treatment of severe malaria, safety and efficacy was first assessed in uncomplicated falciparum malaria patients. Here, we summarize two open-label, adaptive, multi-center phase 2 studies of SAR97276A conducted in patients with uncomplicated malaria. Study 1 followed an adaptive, age de-escalating trial design aiming to progressively assess SAR97276A first in adults and in children with uncomplicated malaria, and then in children with severe malaria&#x02014;provided that threshold criteria of efficacy were met at each cohort level together with a satisfactory safety profile. Due to lack of efficacy in children with uncomplicated malaria in Study 1, a follow up study (Study 2) was designed to evaluate a higher dose of SAR97276A at two different regimens (once daily or twice daily, each for 3&#x000a0;days) for safety and efficacy in pediatric patients with uncomplicated malaria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design summary</title><p>Study 1 and Study 2 followed both an open-label, adaptive, multi-center phase 2 trial design to assess safety and efficacy of SAR97276A in malaria patients of different age groups including adults (only Study 1) and children (both studies). Both studies were hospital-based. Study 1 was performed in Burkina Faso (three sites: Nouna, Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou), Benin (Cotonou), Gabon (Lambar&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;), and Tanzania (Bagamoyo) between August 2008 and July 2009. Study 2 was done in Burkina Faso (Nouna, Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouagadougou), Gabon (Libreville), and Kenya (Ahero) from October 2011 to January 2012.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study 1</title><p>The study was designed to enroll up to 210 malaria patients in sequential cohorts. A staggered trial design was planned to assess a single, IM dose of SAR97276A (0.18&#x000a0;mg/kg, or 12.5&#x000a0;mg fixed dose) first in adults and then progressively in children (age 7&#x02013;17&#x000a0;years) and young children (age 0.5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;years). Age de-escalation of the study was only allowed if threshold response rate in the respective study cohort was met (26 patients out of 30 patients need to have met the 4 criteria of the primary endpoint at 72&#x000a0;h plus adequate safety results). If efficacy criteria were not met but safety was acceptable, SAR97276A would be tested as a 3-day IM regimen (3 injections, 24&#x000a0;h apart) in an additionally recruited 30 patients of the respective cohort. Subsequently, in case of acceptable safety and efficacy, all following cohorts were treated with the 3-day IM regimen. In parallel, SAR97276A was planned to be tested as a single, IV dose (0.14&#x000a0;mg/kg or 10&#x000a0;mg fixed dose) first in adults and then in young children with severe malaria, if threshold response rate was met.

WHO recommends a cure rate of 95% assessed in clinical trials to advance clinical development of a new antimalarial towards licensure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The primary endpoint following IM administration of SAR97276A for 3&#x000a0;days treatment met the criteria of efficacy in the adult population in Study 1 with 27/30 cured patients. However, this result could not be reproduced in children when the same dose as in the adults was given nor at the higher dose of SAR97276A in the following study (Study 2). Study 1 was terminated when in the children&#x02019;s cohort 5/19 enrolled patients failed to meet the predetermined efficacy response criteria. Due to the acceptable safety profile and the promising efficacy in the adult cohort receiving the 3-day treatment a second study (Study 2) was conducted. Study 2 was designed to evaluate the activity of a higher dose of SAR97276A in children after confirming safety of this dose in phase 1 studies. Study 2 was also terminated prematurely as efficacy was not acceptable, reflected by the fact that most teenaged patients receiving SAR97276A required rescue therapy. The observed difference in efficacy between adults and children could be explained by the acquired level of immunity in adults, a feature that is well described from endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Young children are not semi-immune and therefore cannot clear parasites. In addition, parasitemia as inclusion criteria was set on a lower threshold for adults (&#x0003e;100 parasites/&#x000b5;L) than for children. Indeed, in 19 out of 30 adults of Group 1B of Study 1 parasitemia was below 1000&#x000a0;parasites/&#x000b5;L at inclusion, a fact that might also influence the efficacy outcome. Another reason for the lower efficacy might be the different pharmacokinetic profile as children had a lower AUC when compared to adults. Differences in efficacies of the drug between children from Study 1 and 2 are more difficult to explain, as children in Study 2 were older (median 14&#x000a0;years) than in Study 1 (9&#x000a0;years). Children were recruited partly from different study sites and differences in exposure to malaria might explain the result as level of immunity can differ substantially between different age groups and geographic settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, in Study 2 occurrence of parasites until day 14 were judged as late treatment failure. In Study 1 efficacy was only assessed until 72&#x000a0;h as a primary endpoint and 3/13 successfully cured children (assessed after 72&#x000a0;h) had a recrudescence of the same parasite until day 14, explaining partly the difference in efficacy in children of the two studies.</p><p>SAR97276A showed a reasonable safety profile in both studies. Deterioration of malaria was indirectly due to SAR97276A as it was not efficacious enough to control parasitemia and malaria symptoms.</p><p>The new mechanism of action of SAR97276A could make it an interesting partner for combination therapy with another strong malaria medication. However, as oral availability is low it has to be given parenterally and is therefore not a good candidate compound for treatment of uncomplicated malaria as this should be treated orally. Compounds against severe malaria should have a rapid onset of action, which cannot be seen by SAR97276A in the current studies. SAR97276A does not show a post-treatment prophylactic effect reflected by recurrent as well as new infections until day 28. As a secondary endpoint the parasite clearance time of SAR97276A was evaluated. When compared to artemisinins, the licensed drug class with the fastest clearance of parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], SAR97276A showed a much slower parasite clearance, underlining that it is not at all a suitable compound for the treatment of severe malaria.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p>SAR97276A will not be further developed. However, compounds acting against phospholipid biosynthesis remain potentially interesting with a mode of action different to other antimalarials currently in use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
