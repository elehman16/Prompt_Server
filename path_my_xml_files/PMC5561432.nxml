It is characterized by increased serum endotoxin concentration during the first five hours of the post-prandial period following consumption of a meal with a high-fat, high-calorie content. The key findings of the present study, were that 30-d of oral spore-based probiotic supplementation reduced the incidence of dietary endotoxemia, which may be indicative of reduced gut permeability.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) distress and permeability has increased in prominence in modern society due in large part to the excessive consumption of highly processed, calorie dense, commercially available foods[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These same dietary choices coupled with low physical activity are believed to be the primary causes underlying the current obesity epidemic[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Recent efforts have focused on the use of over-the-counter probiotics (typically Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) to address symptoms associated with GI abnormalities[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The lay literature has generally identified a goal of improved &#x0201c;GI health&#x0201d;, but unfortunately this is so broadly defined that it is nearly impossible to identify a single research focus[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Further complicating matters is that probiotic supplementation does not yield consistent results[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. We have speculated that if an individual doesn&#x02019;t have a pre-existing GI abnormality then they would not be a &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; to probiotic supplementation. Complicating oral probiotic supplementation efforts is the fact that few traditional probiotic supplements (<italic>i.e</italic>., Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) delivery fully viable bacteria to the small intestine[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Recently it has been speculated gram positive, spore-forming probiotic strains may be a good alternative because the endospores that encapsulate the strains are highly resistant to stomach acid, potentially resulting in the delivery of more viable probiotics to the small intestine[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Thus, it appears that two major limitations of the existing probiotic literature lie with an inability to identify &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; subjects prior to enrollment and issues associated with viable probiotic delivery to the small intestine.</p><p>Dietary or metabolic endotoxemia occurs when one&#x02019;s dietary consumption causes disruption in either GI permeability, the microbiota profile, or both[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Dietary endotoxemia transiently increases systemic inflammation, which chronically may increase one&#x02019;s risk of a variety of diseases[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Our laboratory and others have demonstrated that consumption of a single, high-fat, high-calorie meal was associated with an increase in serum endotoxin, triglycerides, metabolic biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, endothelial microparticles, and monocyte adhesion molecules[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The post-prandial time course varies for each biomarker, but generally the transient changes occur during the first five hours of the post-prandial period. Given the direct link between nutrition, microbiota, GI permeability, and disease risk, our laboratory and others have speculated that these changes represent an appropriate treatment target for a probiotic intervention[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. To address known issues with sufficient probiotic delivery, we utilized a &#x0201c;spore-based&#x0201d; probiotic in the present study. According to the literature the biggest advantages of a &#x0201c;spore-based&#x0201d; probiotic is that it is compose of endosomes which are highly resistant to acidic pH, are stable at room temperature, and deliver a much greater quantity of high viability bacteria to the small intestine that traditional probiotic supplements[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to clinically leverage the benefits of spore-based probiotics to improve health outcomes. The primary purpose of the present study was to determine if 30-d of spore-based probiotic supplementation reduced post-prandial endotoxemia and triglycerides. The study enrollment was unique in that we developed an additional level of screening to only enroll subjects who had dietary endotoxemia (<italic>i.e</italic>., responders). Our secondary purpose was to determine if other metabolic biomarkers and cytokines, known to change after consuming a high-fat meal, would also be modified by 30-d of spore-based probiotic supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Determination of appropriate sample size</title><p>All the procedures described in the present study were reviewed and approved by the University of North Texas Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Subject&#x02019;s Research. Subjects provided their written and verbal consent to participate before being enrolled in the study. The present study was completed following a completion of a preliminary proof of concept study in the laboratory (data not shown). From this data, we identified that only 2 of 6 subjects (&#x0201c;responders&#x0201d;) had a measurable dietary endotoxemia response (<italic>i.e</italic>., at least a 5-fold increase from pre-meal values at 5-h post-prandial). &#x0201c;Responder&#x0201d; subjects experienced a 30% reduction in serum endotoxin (effect size = 0.40) at 5-h post-prandial following a 30-d probiotic intervention (same probiotic used in the present study). Based on these criteria, we identified that we needed to enroll a minimum of <italic>n</italic> = 10 &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; in placebo and spore-based probiotic groups (<italic>n</italic> = 20 total) in order to achieve at least 80% statistical power.

Screening included measurement of body composition (whole body DEXA scan; GE Lunar Prodigy, United States), medical history assessment, and resting metabolic rate (RMR; MGC Diagnostics Ultima; St. Paul, MN, United States). Subjects who were currently taking or had taken in the previous 6-mo medications for the treatment of metabolic disease, antibiotics, probiotic supplements, anti-inflammatory medications, and/or daily consumed at least 3 serving of yogurt were excluded from further participation.

Thus, we designed and implemented a screening protocol for the present study to identify individuals who presented with post-prandial endotoxemia at baseline, which may be a hallmark sign of intestinal permeability and &#x0201c;leaky gut&#x0201d; syndrome[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We believe our approach to subject selection increased the efficacy and applicability of our key findings. Within our &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; population (who likely had a non-protective microbiome), we were able to demonstrate that 30-d of oral supplementation with a viable, spore-based probiotic was associated with a significant reduction in post-prandial endotoxin and triglycerides. Further, we found that several of our exploratory biomarkers were either significantly reduced (IL-12p70, IL-1&#x003b2;, and ghrelin) or trended toward reduction (IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1) with spore-based probiotic supplementation. It is reasonable to speculate that the spore-based probiotic supplement may have exerted its effect by altering the gut microbial profile, altering intestinal permeability, or a combination of the two effects. The present study was designed to assess systemic changes rather than focus on intestinal measures that are invasive or impossible to make accurately in human subjects. The reductions observed in the present study with spore-based probiotic supplementation were consistent with a transient reduction in chronic disease risk. It is also important to note that the reported changes were observed while the college-aged subjects continued to lead their habitual life with no directed modification. They continued to be exposed to many of the stressors that are known to negatively affect gut permeability in college-aged individuals (<italic>i.e</italic>., consumption of microwaved and other processed food, fast foods, soft drinks with their excess of sugars, including artificial sugars, colorings and flavorings, energy drinks, alcohol consumption, lack of sleep, exam anxiety, <italic>etc</italic>.).</p><p>Previous authors consistently speculate that the onset and progression of chronic disease results from the accumulation of transient changes in ones&#x02019; health that result from lifestyle choices[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>-<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Unfortunately, the current literature has yet to define the quantity of transient change that must be accumulated to cause disease onset. Instead, previous studies have attempted to use lifestyle modifications (<italic>i.e</italic>., nutrition, physical activity, <italic>etc</italic>.) to minimize negative changes in health. One such problem, especially in western cultures, is the wide accessibility to high-fat, high-calorie meals, creating an environment where excessive, low-quality nutritional habits are the norm. In these diets elevated post-prandial endotoxin and triglyceride are consistently reported as problematic changes. Our observed baseline responses mirror previous reports[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Recently a review article touted the potential of probiotic supplementation to prevent metabolic or dietary endotoxemia[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], but to our knowledge no published study has yet to demonstrate this outcome. Thus, our finding of a 42% reduction in metabolic endotoxemia is novel and unique. Further interpretation of our finding does reveal a potentially interesting effect, while 30-d of supplementation reduced metabolic endotoxemia by 42%, it did not completely prevent metabolic endotoxemia. It is plausible to speculate than a longer period of supplementation may result in greater reductions in metabolic endotoxemia. Cani et al[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] previously reported in rodents, that the only viable method to &#x0201c;reprogram&#x0201d; the gut microbial response was to initially treat animals with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. For obvious ethical reasons treating human subjects with antibiotics is likely not a viable experimental design consideration, but perhaps the same effect could be achieved with a longer period of probiotic supplementation. In addition to probiotic effects, we also observed an interesting response in placebo subjects. Specifically, the placebo subjects presented with an even greater metabolic endotoxemia response following a 30-d period. We do not believe that this observation is due to the experimental treatment, but is rather likely due to a diurnal fluctuation in metabolic endotoxemia responses. Thus, placebo subjects trended toward increased metabolic endotoxemia, while probiotic intervention reversed that effect. Since the present 30-d probiotic intervention did not completely prevent metabolic endotoxemia, it is reasonable to speculate that an intervention longer than 30-d may be necessary to completely prevent metabolic endotoxemia.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that the consumption of a high-fat meal causes transient biological changes that were consistent with a transient increase in risk of atherosclerosis[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These changes combined with a post-prandial increase in serum triglycerides creates a milieu that favors foam cell formation and the development of atherosclerotic plaques[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In the present study, the baseline post-prandial meal response presented outcomes that were consistent with published data from our laboratory and others[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>-<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, the present study presented an opportunity to assess if a probiotic intervention would change disease risk biomarkers in a similar manner as endotoxin and triglycerides. We found significance across the entire meal combined between conditions, but were unable to tease apart specific time point differences. A <italic>post hoc</italic> sample size analysis revealed that we would have needed to enroll approximately 20 &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; subjects in each group to delineate specific time point changes for biomarkers. Regardless, we found significant reductions in IL-12p70, IL-1&#x003b2;, and ghrelin. Previous research has indicated that obese subjects do not have as great of a post-prandial suppression ghrelin than normal weight subjects[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The authors do not explain the nature of the change, but given the observations of the present study, it is reasonable to speculate that obesity status may very well effect the gut microbiome[<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. It is plausible that in the present study, without changing body weight, we were able to create the microbiome of a normal weight individual thus restoring normal post-prandial ghrelin responses.</p><p>Given the pro-inflammatory actions of IL-1&#x003b2;, the observed reduction with probiotic supplementation was consistent with reductions in post-prandial systemic inflammation. Reduced ghrelin may be indicative of better post-prandial hunger/satiety control with probiotic. IL-12p70 has a variety of metabolic actions, the chief action in the present study is the ability to modulate the release of TNF-&#x003b1; or related inflammatory cytokines following antigenic challenge[<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In the case of the present study, reduced IL-12p70 with probiotic supplementation may reflect a reduction in systemic inflammatory capacity. In addition to the biomarkers that reached significance, we also found similar numerical trends for IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1, which are all released by adipose tissues and commonly elevated in obese individuals[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The biomarkers observed to change in the present study following the probiotic intervention are involved in the accumulation of systemic inflammation[<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. The existing literature has linked elevated systemic inflammation to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, thus even a transient reduction in systemic inflammation biomarkers may be associated with reduced disease risk[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The biomarkers measured in the present study are most often measured in the context of long-term weight loss (&#x0003e; 12 wk) interventions. In those weight loss models, it can take up to 16-wk to reduce body weight enough that biomarkers change. It is interesting that we demonstrated similar reductions in inflammatory biomarkers in 1/4 the time, but also in the absence of weight loss. We have presented novel results concerning the ability of probiotic supplementation to elicit transient effects.</p><p>In summary, the key findings of the present study demonstrate that 30-d of spore-based probiotic supplementation resulted in a blunting of dietary endotoxin, triglycerides, and potentially systemic inflammation. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to report that a short-term spore-based probiotic intervention altered dietary endotoxemia in human subjects, although the effect has been widely reported in mice[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Due to limitations associated with using human subjects, it was not possible to directly measure gut permeability in the present study. Despite this, it is reasonable to speculate that the underlying cause of the observed reductions in post-prandial endotoxemia may be due to changes in the gut microbiome, gut permeability, or a combination of the two. Future research is needed to determine if a longer course of treatment with a spore-based probiotic results in additional health improvements.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The present study was funded in part by a competitive research grant from Microbiome Labs, LLC (Glenview, IL, United States) to the University of North Texas.

It is characterized by increased serum endotoxin concentration during the first five hours of the post-prandial period following consumption of a meal with a high-fat, high-calorie content. Long-term repeated dietary endotoxemia may increase the risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases <italic>via</italic> an inflammatory etiology. Of the available treatments, oral probiotic supplementation has been purported to reduce gastrointestinal (GI) permeability to endotoxin, which in theory should suppress the dietary endotoxin response.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>GI health is a hot topic and there is great interest in the study of natural substances that have the potential to improve GI health. Probiotics have been studied with inconsistent results, the present study was designed to specifically address previous limitations</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>For the purposes of this study the authors validated a new method for identifying subjects that may be &#x0201c;responders&#x0201d; to probiotic intervention. This screening method included only enrolling subjects that had at least a 5-fold increase in serum endotoxin at 5-h post prandial. Using this method of subject screening, the authors believe that the present study is the first published account demonstrating a significant reduction in post-prandial endotoxemia. It is also significant that the authors also found reductions in disease risk biomarkers after only 30-d of probiotic supplementation. The approach to subject screening for probiotic studies is a novel approach that the authors hope will become a standard for future studies in the area.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>To the knowledge the present study is the first published report that has conclusively documented that short-term probiotic supplementation can reduce the incidence of leaky gut syndrome. The authors believe that the lessons learned from this study that will be critical to future projects is that: (1) detailed screening is needed to qualify subjects who are certain to respond; and (2) the type of probiotic used should be carefully selected. The present study used a spore-based probiotic that is known to have greater than 90% survivability after exposure to stomach acid. Survivability after exposure to stomach acid is a critical factor in the assessment of commercial probiotics that is often overlooked in the selection and study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology</title><p>Dietary or metabolic endotoxemia is defined as a rise in blood serum endotoxin concentration during the first five hours after eating a meal. This post-meal period is also known as the post-prandial period. The most common cause of dietary endotoxemia is a disruption of gut barrier function. There is currently no accepted clinical test in humans to measure for gut barrier function. Disrupted gut barrier function cannot be predicted by any combination of baseline measures. Thus, to the knowledge the only means by which to assess gut barrier function was to complete a dietary endotoxemia test used in the present study. The endotoxin measured in the blood comes from bacteria that populate the GI track.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer-review</title><p>The article is interesting and maybe beneficial to the clinical physician.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Institutional review board statement: The study was reviewed and approved by the UNT Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects Research.</p></fn><fn><p>Informed consent statement: Subjects provided written and oral consent to participate using an IRB-approved informed consent form specific to the study in question.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflict-of-interest statement: The present study was funded in part by a competitive research grant from Microbiome Labs, LLC (Glenview, IL) to the University of North Texas.
