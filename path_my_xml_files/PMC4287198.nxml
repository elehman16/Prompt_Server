removal of such deposits has proven to be efficient in the treatment of this disease. Deep lesions
may, however, not revert rapidly and fully to a sulcus with physiological probing depth (PD)
(Heitz-Mayfield et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, van der Weijden &#x00026;
Timmerman <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). As self-performed oral hygiene procedures
have a limited capacity to remove newly formed bacterial deposits from residual pockets, regular
debridement by professional intervention is necessary to prevent recurrence of disease. This absorbs
a considerable amount of work time of qualified dental professionals, notably dental hygienists. As
an example, 704 residual pockets with PD &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm were counted upon completion of active
periodontal therapy in a cohort of 172 patients &#x02013; on average 4.1 per patient (Matuliene
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). A total of 959 pockets, or 5.4 per
patient, were present at a re-evaluation after a mean of 11&#x000a0;years in supportive periodontal
therapy.</p><p>Traditionally, calcified and non-calcified bacterial deposits (i.e. calculus and biofilm) are
removed from root surfaces by scraping with a steel curette, or using a steel tip activated by sonic
or ultrasonic oscillation. Repeated instrumentation of this kind has unwanted effects that may
cumulate over time. They include gingival recession and loss of tooth substance. As subgingival
bacterial deposits may not mineralize between two maintenance visits to form hard and firmly
attached calculus, methods less harmful than instrumentation with steel instruments may be more
appropriate in this situation. Bacterial deposits can also be removed by
&#x0201c;air-polishing&#x0201d;, a technology to clean or polish a surface with a jet of compressed
air containing an abrasive powder (Petersilka et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Using a low abrasive agent and a nozzle that can be introduced into a periodontal
pocket, it is possible to remove subgingival biofilm from root surfaces in residual pockets. The
safety, patient acceptance and short-term (7&#x000a0;days) microbiological effects of this method
were evaluated in 50 patients with residual pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm deep, by testing a newly
designed nozzle that allowed the projection of the air-powder jet onto the root surface, and glycine
powder with a grain size of 20&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m as the agent (Mo&#x000eb;ne
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The results indicated that this
procedure was safe, more acceptable and more time efficient than SRP. The clinical and
microbiological effects in the longer term remained to be determined. A split-mouth study of two
months duration in 20 recall patients confirmed these results, revealing no relevant differences in
clinical or microbiological outcomes between subgingival air-polishing and ultrasonic debridement
(Wennstrom et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). A subsequent study (Flemmig
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) examined the effects on bacterial biofilm
in moderate-to-deep periodontal pockets over a period of 90&#x000a0;days and demonstrated beneficial
shifts in the composition of the subgingival microbiota.</p><p>In the studies conducted thus far the procedure was applied only once and the benefit of the
intervention was only evaluated short term. As it is customary in periodontal maintenance to clean
subgingival root surfaces repeatedly, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the benefit
of repeated subgingival cleaning with such an air-polishing device in residual pockets
&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm over a period of 1&#x000a0;year.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>This was a single-centre, examiner masked, randomized clinical trial of 12&#x000a0;months duration
with a two-arm, within-subject parallel design to compare the long-term effects of subgingival
air-polishing (test group) with ultrasonic instrumentation (control group). The Ethical Committee of
the University Hospitals of Geneva approved the protocol. Research was conducted according to the
principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki on human medical experimentation. All
participants were informed about the procedures and signed a consent form in advance of their
inclusion in the study.</p><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifty systemically healthy patients were recruited between September 2011 and November 2012 from
patients previously treated for periodontal disease at the School of Dental Medicine, University of
Geneva. The clinical procedures and evaluations were carried out between October 2011 and November
2013.</p><p>The participants were included based on the following criteria: in maintenance care at least
3&#x000a0;month after completion of comprehensive periodontal therapy, aged 18 or over, and the
presence of at least one residual pocket with PD &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm on the right and the left side
of the dentition, absence of clinically detectable subgingival calculus, in the area between the
distal aspect of the first incisor and the mesial aspect of the second molar. Exclusion criteria
included chronic bronchitis or asthma and major systemic illnesses (i.e. diabetes mellitus, cancer,
HIV, bone metabolic diseases or disorders that compromise wound healing, radiation or
immunosuppressive therapy), antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs or other medication taken within
the previous 28&#x000a0;days that may affect the outcome of the study, confirmed or suspected
intolerance to the test products (erythritol or chlorhexidine), and any physical limitations or
restrictions that might preclude normal oral hygiene procedures. The smoking history was recorded,
but smoking was not an exclusion criterion. Dental professionals or dental students were not allowed
to participate.</p></sec><sec><title>Test products and randomization</title><p>Subgingival air-polishing was carried out with erythritol powder (Air Flow&#x000ae; Powder PLUS,
mean grain size of 14&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m, Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>) containing 0.3% chlorhexidine, using the air-polishing device of the
Air-Flow&#x000ae; Master Piezon unit (all products from EMS Electro Medical System S.A., Nyon,
Switzerland). A special disposable nozzle made from thermoplastic elastomer was utilized
(Perio-Flow&#x000ae; Nozzle, EMS Electro Medical System S.A., Nyon, Switzerland). The air-powder
mixture exits from this nozzle horizontally. The pocket is irrigated concurrently with water exiting
from an outlet at the tip of the nozzle (Mo&#x000eb;ne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). The test procedure consisted in inserting the tip into the pocket (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>) and activating the device for 5&#x000a0;s. The control treatment
was subgingival instrumentation with the ultrasonic scaler (Piezon&#x000ae; LED, tip PS, EMS Electro
Medical System S.A., Nyon, Switzerland) of the same unit for approximately 20&#x000a0;s per site.

with the control procedure. The sponsor allocated the treatments and specified the sequence of
treatments, using a computer-generated randomization list. At baseline, month 3, 6 and 9, each site
with PD &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm was treated.</p><p>Two clinicians performed all procedures involving a contact with the participants. The examiner
(RM) enrolled the patients, recorded the data and took microbiological samples. Treatment allocation
was concealed to the examiner. The operator (NM) opened a sealed envelope with the instructions for
subgingival debridement immediately before the therapy was to be carried out. With the exception of
the periodontal pocket chart, necessary to identify the pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm needing
treatment, she was unaware of previously recorded data.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical protocol</title><p>On the right and the left side of the dentition, in the region between the distal aspect of the
first incisor and the mesial aspect of the second molar, the site with the deepest PD on a vital
tooth was designated as the study site. Root hypersensitivity was assessed and microbiological
samples were taken at these two sites in each participant.</p><p>On six sites of all teeth, except third molars, the following clinical parameters were recorded:
Plaque Index (PlI; Silness &#x00026; L&#x000f6;e <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">1964</xref>), PD,
Bleeding upon Probing (BOP) and Recession (REC; positive if gingival margin located apical, negative
if located coronal to the cemento-enamel junction).</p><p>Root hypersensitivity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). A stream of air from the
three-way syringe was directed towards the tooth surface close to the gingival margin during
2&#x000a0;s. Participants were asked to place a mark on a horizontal line, 100&#x000a0;mm long,
labelled with &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; at one end and with &#x0201c;worst pain&#x0201d; at the other.
Within minutes after the test and control treatment the participants were asked to rate pain caused
by the respective intervention using a similar VAS. The oral hard and soft tissues, including the
lips, tongue, gingivae, sublingual area, inner surfaces of the cheeks, mucobuccal folds, hard and
soft palate, pharynx and the cervical area of all teeth were examined using a structured checklist.
Assessments included colour, texture, soft tissue abrasion and any irregularities or defects. All
adverse events reported by the subject, or observed by the examiner or operator, were recorded and
documented throughout the entire study.</p><p>In the enrolment visit the examiner recorded the medical history, obtained informed consent, and
selected the study teeth and the study sites. Two days before the first subgingival treatment (day
&#x02212;2) the examiner collected a subgingival plaque sample in the two study sites with one
sterile paper point inserted to the bottom of each pocket and left in situ for 10&#x000a0;s. On the
day of subgingival treatment the operator removed supragingival calculus, stain and plaque with hand
instruments in the entire dentition and instructed the subjects in proper oral hygiene during
5&#x02013;10&#x000a0;min (review of tooth brushing and inter-dental cleaning). Next, the randomization
envelope for the subject number was opened to reveal the treatment assignment. On the test side, all
pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm were treated with the air-polishing device, on the control side with the
ultrasonic device. Upon completion of either air-polishing or ultrasonic debridement in the first
half of the dentition, the operator noted the time elapsed from picking-up the air-polishing or
ultrasonic hand-piece to putting it back onto the instrument holder. The patient was asked to rate
the pain experienced on a VAS. Any other comments were recorded. Then the second half of the
dentition was treated with the other method. Time and pain were recorded once more.</p><p>The participants returned to the clinic after 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;month. At months 3, 6 and 12
the examiner collected subgingival plaque samples from the study sites. At all time points he
inspected the oral tissues, assessed root hypersensitivity at the study sites and recorded, PlI, PD,
BOP, REC at six sites of all teeth. Then the operator took over, giving instructions for improvement
of oral hygiene and removing supragingival soft and hard deposits. All sites with a PD
&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm were treated subgingivally, on the test side with air-polishing and on the
control side with the ultrasonic device. Each time the operator noted the time spent for the
subgingival debridement and asked the patient to rate the pain. At 12&#x000a0;month the participants
were only seen by the examiner who collected the final subgingival plaque samples and recorded the
clinical data.</p><sec><title>Microbiological procedures</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St.
Louis, MO, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time
PCR was performed to detect and quantify six specific bacteria (<italic>Porphyromonas
gingivalis</italic>,<italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>,<italic>Tannerella
forsythia</italic>,<italic>Treponema denticola</italic>,<italic>Prevotella
intermedia</italic>,<italic>Parvimonas micra</italic>) using species-specific primers (Shelburne
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Kozarov et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). SYBR Green (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used
as nucleic acid stain. Real-time PCR was carried out using an ABI Prism&#x000ae; 7900HT Sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Bacterial counts were calculated by
comparison with homologous reference. The detection limit was 1000&#x000a0;cells/ml.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Average scores were generated of the test and control side of each patient, at each examination,
by summing the scores and dividing by the number of sites graded on that side. The primary endpoint
was presence or absence of PD &#x0003e;4 after 12&#x000a0;months (persisting pockets
&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm are commonly perceived as needing continuous subgingival maintenance care in
clinical practice). Secondary clinical outcomes included changes in PD, BOP+, REC (clinical
attachment level CAL&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;PD&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;REC), presence or absence of
target microorganisms above &#x0003e;1000 (detection threshold) and &#x0003e;100,000&#x000a0;cells/ml
before and after 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months. The sample size was chosen based on the clinical
considerations. After 12&#x000a0;months of supportive periodontal care with subgingival debridement
mean PD changes of 0.37&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.15&#x000a0;mm have been reported (Heasman
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Assuming that the common standard
deviation of PD is 1&#x000a0;mm, a sample of 50 per group would provide 80% power to detect a
true difference of 0.4&#x000a0;mm between groups. The <italic>t</italic>-test was used to determine
differences between test and control. Longitudinal changes were analysed in all patients completing
the trial using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. Adverse events and observations
concerning oral hard and soft tissues were summarized by treatment group for all evaluable subjects.
One statistical program package (IBM SPSS Statistics 22; IBM Corporation, Somers, NY, USA) was used
for all statistical analyses. Adjusting for multiple comparisons, <italic>p</italic> values
&#x0003c;0.01 were accepted for statistical significance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty persons gave informed consent, were enrolled in the study and received treatment as

When called up to confirm the 3-month visit, one person reported that he had experienced malaise and
fever during the night after the first treatment that disappeared by itself within a few hours. The
average time required by the operator on the test side of the dentition, from picking-up the
hand-piece from the instrument holder, air-polishing all sites &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm, to putting the

hundred of them were treated with air-polishing and 195 with ultrasonic instrumentation. At month 9,
the examiner revealed 363 sites with a PD &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm. A total of 194 sites with a PD
&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm were treated with air-polishing and 169 with ultrasonic instrumentation. Over
the course of the year 284 sites were subjected to air-polishing: 112 sites had received one, 73
sites had received two, 60 sites had received three and 39 sites had received four rounds of
air-polishing. During the same period, 290 sites were subjected to ultrasonic instrumentation: 116

residual pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm over a period of 1&#x000a0;year. A within-subject parallel
design was chosen. This method has repeatedly been used in studies evaluating local treatments
(Wennstrom et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, intra-individual
comparisons have their limitations as local therapy may have systemic effects and hereby influence
outcomes in other sites in the same dentition (Antczak-Bouckoms et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>). Even if the risk for crossover effects appears minimal, as treatment was
provided to only a restricted number of sites, the design of the study needs to be considered in the
interpretation of the data. The primary endpoint, i.e. the reduction of sites with PD
&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm, was achieved to a similar degree by treatment according to both protocols: On
the test side the average number of sites decreased from 4.6 to 3.6 per person, and on the control
side from 4.8 to 3.9. To achieve this goal, sites were retreated variable numbers of times. Due to
the continued presence of PD&#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm, 55 sites assigned to ultrasonic instrumentation
were instrumented at all four treatment visits, whereas only 39 sites received four rounds of
air-polishing. The sample size for the study was chosen considering that mean PD changes in the
order of 0.4&#x000a0;mm may be expected in 12&#x000a0;months of supportive periodontal care with
subgingival debridement (Heasman et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Although
this is the largest trial on subgingival air-polishing conducted so far, the size of the sample may
still be insufficient to detect a difference in presence or absence of PD &#x0003e;4 after
12&#x000a0;months. However, the findings suggest that repeated subgingival air-polishing in residual
pockets was beneficial since the mean number of pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm per subject was
significantly reduced after 12&#x000a0;months (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).</p><p>In comparing these results with results from other trials it is important to note that the
treated sites had previously been subject to comprehensive periodontal therapy and subsequently may
have been exposed numerous times to mechanical debridement in the context of periodontal
maintenance. Conceptually, it is more challenging to obtain a further clinical improvement in such
residual lesions than in previously untreated pockets. It is important to understand moreover that
in the present study, according to common practice in supportive periodontal care, a decision to
treat was made for each individual site at each visit (treatment according to the pre-defined
protocol if PD &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm). Studies on the reproducibility of probing have shown that a
deviation in PD of &#x000b1;1&#x000a0;mm must be expected in about one-third of pockets that are
re-probed after 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;weeks (Isidor et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>, Mombelli et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). This means that
some sites with an initial PD in the 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mm range may have been treated only in the
second, third or fourth visit. Lastly, one should also consider that 19 subjects (38%) in
this trial were smokers. Long-term observations show the negative influence of tobacco smoking on
periodontal tissues (Bergstrom et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, Bergstrom
<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). The reduction of residual pockets, from 4.6 to 3.6 per
person in the area treated using air-polishing, compares favourably to the counts of residual
pockets in patients on long-term maintenance after periodontal therapy, for example from 4.1 at
completion therapy to 5.4 after 11&#x000a0;years of supportive care (Matuliene et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>).</p><p>The evaluation of pain yielded an average VAS score of 20.4&#x000a0;mm for the test and
48.6&#x000a0;mm for the control treatment, with a significantly better outcome for air-polishing. For
acute pain, the minimal clinically significant VAS change is 16&#x000a0;mm (Gallagher et&#x000a0;al.
<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). We noted no clinically visible changes of the hard
tissues and observed no signs of soft tissue damage. This trial confirms the findings of our
previous study testing the nozzle for subgingival air-polishing for the first time in patients
(Mo&#x000eb;ne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and the following trials on
the same procedure (Wennstrom et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, Flemmig
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Erythritol was, however, used in the
present study instead of glycine powder. The new powder has a finer grain size and may, therefore,
be even more tissue friendly. Erythritol, a sugar alcohol (polyol), is a non-toxic, chemically
neutral and water-soluble agent that is used as a food additive (Munro et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). The effects of air-polishing with erythritol powder on
dentine have been compared to sodium bicarbonate and glycine powder in vitro (Tocha <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Erythritol induced the lowest volume loss and defect depth
and produced the smoothest surface. In a two-species biofilm model erythritol showed inhibitory
effects on oral streptococci and <italic>P.&#x000a0;gingivalis</italic> (Hashino et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The effect of one round of subgingival air-polishing with
erythritol powder on BOP+ has been evaluated in 91 residual pockets in 40 patients
(H&#x000e4;gi et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). After 3&#x000a0;months, the
bleeding tendency was significantly lower, however, with no difference to the control treatment
(SRP). No adverse events were recorded and the patients tolerated the test better than the control
treatment.</p><p>Detection frequencies of the studied microorganisms at &#x0003e;1000 and
&#x0003e;100,000&#x000a0;cells/ml were not markedly different at the beginning and at the end of our
study. It has been shown in the past that bacterial biofilms can grow back rapidly after subgingival
instrumentation (Sharawy et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>) and that the
composition of the microbiota may reach pretreatment levels within months (Haffajee et&#x000a0;al.
<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The microbiological findings of our study, derived from
samples taken 3&#x000a0;months after previous treatment, may essentially mirror re-colonization. The
lower frequency of sites with counts of <italic>A.&#x000a0;actinomycetemcomitans</italic>
&#x0003e;1000&#x000a0;cells/ml, and the absence of sites with counts &#x0003e;100,000&#x000a0;cells/ml
in the test group may warrant further attention in future trials. Several studies have shown that
traditional mechanical debridement alone seems to have a limited effect especially on
<italic>A.&#x000a0;actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (Slots &#x00026; Rosling <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>, Sato et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>, Mombelli
et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">1994a</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). It is unclear to what extent this potential advantage may be attributed to the addition
of 0.3% chlorhexidine to the polishing powder. The manufacturer actually adds chlorhexidine
for the purpose of conserving the powder, not with the intention to have a therapeutic effect.</p><p>Time efficiency, high patient acceptance and minimal tissue damage are essential requirements for
treatments that are repeated many times in periodontal maintenance care. An additional aspect, not
evaluated here but that would merit a comprehensive comparative evaluation, is cost-efficiency.
Repeated subgingival cleaning of residual pockets with a new air-polishing device over a period of
12&#x000a0;month was safe, induced less pain and reduced the number of pockets &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;mm.
The findings regarding safety are limited to clinical examination and thus, to overt clinical
adverse events. Long-term effects of protocols for periodontal maintenance should be studied further
