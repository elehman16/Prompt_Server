PROMs can be assessed through a self-administered survey or by a third party. Use of mixed mode approaches where PROMs are completed using a single or combination of administration method is emerging. The aim of this study is to identify the most cost-effective efficient approach to collecting PROMs among three modes (telephone, postal service/mail and email) in a population-based clinical quality registry monitoring survivorship after a diagnosis of prostate cancer. This is important to assist the registry in achieving representative PROMs capture using the most cost-effective technique and in developing cost projections for national scale-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study will adopt an equivalence randomised controlled design. Participants are men diagnosed with and/or treated for prostate cancer (PCa) participating in PCOR-VIC and meet the criteria for 12-month follow-up. Participants will be individually randomized to three independent groups: telephone, mail/postal, or email to complete the 26-item Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) survey. It is estimated each group will have 229 respondents. We will compare the proportion of completed surveys across the three groups.</p><p>The economic evaluation will be undertaken from the perspective of the data collection centre and consider all operating costs (personnel, supplies, training, operation and maintenance). Cost data will be captured using an Activity Based Costs method. To estimate the most cost-effective approach, we will calculate incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A cost projection model will be developed based on most cost-effective approach for nationwide scale-up of the PROMs tool for follow-up of PCa patients in Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will identify the most cost-effective approach for collecting PROMs from men with PCa, and enable estimation of costs for national implementation of the PCa PROMs survey. The findings will be of interest to other registries embarking on PROMs data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

PROMs are an important measure of patients&#x02019; perspective of care outcomes as they provide insight into the impact of a disease and its treatment on daily lives. PROMs can assist clinicians to work with patients to achieve a level of care that meets their needs; this has been demonstrated to improve patient-provider communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>PROMs may be self-administered or administered by another person (third-party). Instruments used to collect PROMs should be validated for the mode with which they are being administered. Self-administration may include surveys that patients complete on paper or electronically (e.g. via links provided in an email address to an online form or through Applications (apps) that patients can download. Tools administered by another person may include those completed on paper or electronically with assistance or those administered over the telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. With the increasing number of Internet users, greater opportunities exist for collecting data, through mechanisms such as email and web-based surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. An emerging trend in health-related survey research is the use of a mixed-mode approach. In the mixed-mode method, individuals may respond using a single or combination of different modes, such as only telephone or mail followed by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Using a mixed-mode approach compensates for the weaknesses of each individual mode at affordable cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Survey mode, length and content of the survey and incentives will impact the response rates and the cost of data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The amount of clinical data being collected is growing exponentially; largely due to computer-based information systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Australia, the number of known registries collecting clinical data has risen from 28 in 2006-07 to 37 in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Clinical quality registries have received increasing attention as a means of improving quality and reducing the cost of health and medical care, through identifying variations in clinical practice and care, and assessing the uptake of effective treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A number of clinical quality registries collect PROMs and provide reports on outcomes to hospitals. Examples can be found in trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], joint replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and renal disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. PROMs are being developed by the American Society of Clinical Oncology to benchmark hospitals in relation to symptoms and functional status following cancer treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>For any individual research study, the mode of data collection is influenced by time, available resources and the population being targeted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. A number of studies have compared response rates using different modes of data collection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. A meta-analysis published in 2009 found that email surveys have lower response rates compared with mail surveys (20% vs 53% respectively) suggesting that, despite rapid growth of information technology, mail surveys appear to be superior to email in collecting survey data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. High response rates have been obtained when follow up attempts are intense and personalised. For example Steineck et all reported very high response rates of 89 to 99% across multiple time periods by following a regimen which included an introduction letter and a telephone call to establish contact prior to a survey being posted and a &#x0201c;thank you and reminder&#x0201d; card following return of the survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It is unclear whether such a labour-intensive approach is sustainable at a population level.</p><p>Response rates have been found to vary among study populations. Postal surveys with three reminders have shown demonstrably better response rates among general practitioners compared with a telephone survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A randomised control trial (RCT) of junior medical staff and faculty members comparing electronic and postal surveys found that response rates were similar, but the average response time for electronic surveys was shorter for the residents&#x02019; group compared with the faculty group (3.8&#x000a0;days vs 8.4&#x000a0;days, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by Rutherford et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] investigated whether the mode of PROMs administration introduced bias into the patient reported outcome results. Findings suggested that there was no bias associated with whether PROMs were collected electronically (computer including web, touch screen, hand-held device, video conference, computer assisted telephone interview), via paper self-completion (hard copy) or via assisted completion in clinics or home. The authors of the study recommended further research using experimental designs to measure the mediators of mode effects on data quality, measurement equivalence, reliability of assessment for individuals and the impact of setting and combination of data collection method over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>A cost-effectiveness study by Sinclair et al. (2012) found that postal survey costs were lower compared to both internet and telephone. The cost of a completed response using a personalised postal survey (24.75 Australian Dollars) was slightly higher than the generic postal survey, a generic internet survey and a personalised internet survey cost was almost double of a personalised postal survey and a telephone survey cost was highest among all methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another study conducted by the Australian national stroke registry, found that telephone follow up for patient with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack was more expensive but more effective in terms of completion rates than follow-up by postal mail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The Victorian Prostate Cancer Registry (PCOR-VIC) was established in 2009 to monitor treatment and outcomes of men diagnosed with prostate cancer in Victoria. PROMs are collected to assess the impact of prostate cancer diagnosis/treatment on urinary, bowel, hormonal, and sexual function and bother using the EPIC-26 survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The EPIC-26 survey has been validated for telephone and self-administered survey (paper or online) and is currently only administered by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The response rate has varied over time as modifications have been made to the registry and is currently at 85%. Alternative methods of PROMs administration have not been systematically assessed for their cost-effectiveness and feasibility. Although previous studies demonstrated lower response rates and in some cases increased costs of surveys delivered electronically, these were conducted several years ago and on a different population. As the PCOR-VIC is now contributing to a newly developed Prostate Cancer Registry-Australia and New Zealand, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] the aim of this project was to assess the most cost-effective approach for collecting PROMs in a prostate cancer population.</p><p>The current study protocol describes the design of an equivalence RCT to assess the cost-effectiveness of three different methods of PROMs data collection using the EPIC-26 survey for patients diagnosed with prostate cancer.</p><p>
<bold>The primary objective</bold> of the trial is to compare the completeness of survey data obtained using the three different data collection approaches for reporting on PROMs.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>Men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Victoria, contributing to the PCOR-VIC and who are interviewed by researchers to collect PROMS, will be invited to participate in this study. Since its establishment in 2009 the registry has expanded to 33 hospitals across the state, representing approximately 75% of the Victorian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Men are eligible for inclusion on the register if they have had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate cancer that is notified to the Victorian Cancer Registry by the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study design proposed for this evaluation is an equivalence RCT design. Participants will be individually randomized to one of three independent groups receiving the PROMs instrument by email, post or by telephone. Due to the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to blind the researchers or study participants.</p><p>To collect costing data we will use an Activity Based Costing (ABC) method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and structured questionnaires to estimate the cost of the operational activities of the three different methods of follow up. The ABC method is useful for understanding key activities of any programs and interventions and allows identification of (i) implementation levels and composition of costs; (ii) variations in how an intervention is implemented over time and associated cost implications; and (iii) resulting costs of increasing coverage of cost-effective data collection methods. This method is flexible, so its resulting estimates can be easily understood and adapted to measure the cost of data collection of the three different methods. Costs that will be considered include personnel cost, cost of supplies (e.g., envelopes, printing etc.), cost of training of data collectors and cost of operation and maintenance (e.g., telephone bill, internet bill, rent etc.) for each of the data collection methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment of patients</title><p>Recruitment of patients to the PCOR-VIC has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In summary, patients diagnosed in recruiting hospitals and notified by the hospital to the registry are sent details of the registry in an explanatory statement by mail. In the explanatory statement details on what data will be collected from the patient&#x02019;s medical record and directly from the patient and how a man can opt off the registry if he chooses not to participate are included. The explanatory statement also contains the contact details of both the hospital where the patient was diagnosed and the university conducting the research and hosting the registry. Clinical data are collected on men who do not opt out. A waiver of consent enables clinical details to be collected from men who have died after diagnosis.</p><p>Eligible men are contacted by centrally-located university call-centre follow up staff to confirm that clinical data are accurate and up-to-date. For data collection contact is made any time within a window period of 21&#x000a0;days on either side of the anniversary date for data collection (henceforth recorded as the &#x0201c;Anniversary Date&#x0201d;). This is 12&#x000a0;months from the date of the positive biopsy for patients who do not proceed to active treatment or only receive androgen deprivation therapy; or 12&#x000a0;months from the date on which final initial treatment, or course of treatment finished. This is also the date for surgery and low-dose rate (seed) brachytherapy procedure. For radiotherapy and chemotherapy this is the date that the last dose of therapy was provided as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Men will be included in this study if they are eligible and have been included on the PCOR-VIC, are aged &#x0003e;18&#x000a0;years and answer the telephone when contacted by data collectors in the 21&#x000a0;days leading up to and including their Anniversary Date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Men will be ineligible for inclusion in the RCT if they opt off the registry, have died in the period between being recruited to the registry and telephoned, do not speak English, are identified as being hearing or mentally impaired when contacted by data collectors to administer the PROMs, have been diagnosed by Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP) and their treating doctor has requested that we do not contact them for follow up, or if they answer the telephone after their Anniversary Date.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome of interest</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of interest will be effective successful follow up. Effective successful follow up is defined as providing a response to each of the 26 questions in the survey. Provision exists for patients to record &#x0201c;decline to answer&#x02019; on the electronic form and they are advised at the beginning of the phone call that they may chose not to answer if they wish. Responses will still be considered completed if the patient declines to answer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcome measures include time to complete an effective follow-up, and the number of occasions where answering a question was declined for each mode of survey administration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on an equivalence study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and the primary outcome measure (completeness of survey responses). Given the current follow up response rates from the PCOR-VIC we estimate that we will achieve a response rate of 90% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] when PROMs are administered by the telephone follow-up method. The study was designed to evaluate whether the completeness of survey responses in the &#x02018;mail/postal service group&#x02019; or &#x02018;email group&#x02019; was similar to the &#x02018;telephone&#x02019; group. Assuming that the equivalence margin is 10%, we will require 190 respondents per group. We have made an assumption that the 83% of who have internet access will also have an email account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The sample size was adjusted accordingly so the final number of respondents required in each group is 229 giving a total number required n&#x02009;=&#x02009;687 (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our sample size has been calculated to provide a level of significance at 5% with 80% power (2-sided test).

The first step after data collectors&#x02019; telephone to men is to confirm treatment and GP details and obtain the most recent PSA result. If the patient is contacted within the window from 21&#x000a0;days before the &#x0201c;Anniversary Date&#x0201d;, then they will be eligible for randomization. Randomization will be undertaken using random permuted blocks of sizes 3 and 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The investigator will have already generated the random blocks and provide those to the data collectors in sealed envelopes. Once the data collector has confirmed the patient&#x02019;s PSA result, GP details and eligibility for 12-month follow-up then s/he will proceed with selecting a random number from the sealed envelope to assign the method for collection of data by EPIC-26 survey. If a patient has been assigned to the email method but, when the data collector asks for an email address and the patient replies that he does not have one, the data collector will select the next and subsequent envelopes until either the telephone method (Intervention A) or mail/postal methods (Intervention B) is assigned.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart showing 3 different follow-up methods</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12913_2017_1981_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

</p><p>To estimate the most cost-effective approach, incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be estimated. This involves comparing the incremental/additional cost of one approach with the additional outcome achieved by using that approach. Outcome will be measured as completed surveys. The most cost effective approach will be the method which achieves the greatest percentage of complete surveys at the least cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].

Security is maintained using encryption of data, a managed and audited protocol for access, training and accreditation of personnel, role-based access and authentication of data. The database storing PROMs and costing data will be password protected and stored on a networked server that is backed up on a daily basis at Monash University.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Potential risks</title><p>As the participants are diagnosed with prostate cancer, they may experience distress when discussing the disease with follow up staff over telephone. There will be no pressure on the participants to divulge any information if they do not feel comfortable to do so. An offer will be made to terminate the interview if the participants exhibit any signs of distress. The interview will only be continued if the participants want to do so. As there will be no physical examination, biomedical tests (invasive/non-invasive) or use of hazardous material, this project is deemed to be a low-risk research activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>Through this economic analysis we will determine the most cost-effective means of capturing PROMs and completing follow up of prostate cancer patients through the PCOR-VIC using the EPIC-26 survey. Our primary aim therefore is to identify the value of different PROMS collection methods. Value is defined as outcomes relative to costs and encompasses efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The outcome we will be evaluating is response rates and representativeness of the various tools in assessing the quality of life. With knowledge of the cost of each completed survey, we will decide which approach to use as we expand data collection to obtain national coverage. Our primary objective is to assess the response rate across each data collection approach. Surveys will only be considered as completed if all relevant questions have been answered.</p><p>This will provide guidance to other registries undertaking follow up surveys of patients and it will also allow us to estimate the cost for collecting PROMs data within the Prostate Cancer Outcome Registry- Australia. Moreover we will be able to understand the quality of PROMs data collected by the three different methods. It may be that one method produces significantly higher rate of missing data or questions which patients decline to answer. We have to weigh the cost of data collection against completeness of surveys to determine the method which provides the greatest value at the end of the study. This decision will be made by the project steering committee and the funder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The aim of this study is to provide evidence on which method of PROMs follow up data collection is more cost-effective. Findings of this study will also help us in understanding the cost for national implementation of the prostate cancer quality of life questionnaire in Australia.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ABC</term><def><p>Activity Based Costing</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPIC-26</term><def><p>Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p>General Practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICERs</term><def><p>Incremental Cost Effectiveness Ratios</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention to Treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MGS</term><def><p>Monash Graduate Scholarship</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIPRS</term><def><p>Monash International Postgraduate Research Fellowship</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NHMRC</term><def><p>National Health and Medical Research Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCa</term><def><p>Prostate Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCOR-VIC</term><def><p>Prostate Cancer Outcome Registry- Victoria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPP</term><def><p>Purchasing Power Parity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PROMs</term><def><p>Patient Reported Outcome Measures</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSA</term><def><p>Prostate Specific Antigen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TURP</term><def><p>Transurethral Resection of The Prostate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>URL</term><def><p>Uniform Resource Locator</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr Arul Earnest, Associate Professor, Department of Epidemiology and Preventive Medicine School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine of Monash University for assisting us in calculating sample size and generating random numbers.

As per previous ethics approval for PCOR VIC Registry, once patient is diagnosed with prostate cancer, consent was taken for enrolment in the registry as well as consent for follow up data collection. A waiver of consent is provided to enable collection of diagnostic and treatment details on all men with prostate cancer for our study. For men who have not deceased, an opt-out approach is employed.
