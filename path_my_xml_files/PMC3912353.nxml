No previous study of the pharmacokinetics of topical bevacizumab has been performed in human eyes.

It is currently the most widely used anti-VEGF agent in ophthalmology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bevacizumab is administered intravitreally, most commonly for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of topical bevacizumab administration for the treatment of corneal neovascularization (NV) in both experimental animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and human patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>There are only a few pharmacokinetic studies on topical bevacizumab, and they were performed solely in experimental animal models. Nomoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reported minimal aqueous concentration (0.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.6&#x000a0;ng/ml) after 1&#x000a0;week of topical administration of 25&#x000a0;mg/ml bevacizumab 6 times daily in rabbit eyes. Yoeruek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] applied bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml drops every minute for 30&#x000a0;minutes to rabbit corneas, and the aqueous penetration after this mega-dose of bevacizumab was minimal, as demonstrated by the fact that the detected amount of bevacizumab was lower by a factor of over 1,000 compared with the initial dose. Dastjerdi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reported minimal penetration of topical bevacizumab in normal mice corneas. Others have shown that corneal penetration of bevacizumab was greater in mice with corneal NV and in those with denuded corneal epithelium, and that it can be detected in the aqueous, vitreous, serum, and even in the contralateral eye following subconjunctival injection in several animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] postulated that intraocular penetration of bevacizumab after subconjunctival injection occurs through the sclera and systemic circulation.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to conduct what, to the best of our knowledge, is the first evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of topical bevacizumab in human eyes. We also compared our findings on the pharmacokinetics of intravitreal bevacizumab injection to previously reported data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study subjects</title><p>The study protocol followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Tel Aviv Medical Center. All patients agreed to participate after a thorough explanation of the nature of the study, and gave their written informed consent to participate prior to study entry. This prospective study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology of the Tel Aviv Medical Center. All patients volunteered to participate in it, and were recruited from among patients scheduled for elective surgery at our department. They were divided into three groups according to bevacizumab treatment protocol and their subsequent surgery (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>): topical bevacizumab and subsequent cataract extraction (group 1), topical bevacizumab and subsequent pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) (group 2), and intravitreal bevacizumab and subsequent PPV (group 3). Control samples were obtained from three additional patients who underwent PPV and had never received any previous treatment with bevacizumab (group 4).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Bevacizumab treatment protocols, surgery type and sampling site for each study group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Group</th><th>n</th><th>Treatment protocol</th><th>Surgery</th><th>Sampling site</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>8</td><td>Topical &#x02014; four drops of bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml, one drop every 10&#x000a0;minutes 1&#x000a0;hour prior to surgery</td><td>Cataract extraction</td><td>Aqueous</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>8</td><td>Topical &#x02014; four drops of bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml, one drop every 6&#x000a0;hours 1&#x000a0;day before surgery, and another four drops, one every 10&#x000a0;minutes 1&#x000a0;hour prior to surgery</td><td>Pars plana vitrectomy</td><td>Vitreous</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>Intravitreal &#x02014; injection of bevacizumab 1.25&#x000a0;mg/0.05&#x000a0;ml</td><td>Pars plana vitrectomy</td><td>Vitreous</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>None</td><td>Pars plana vitrectomy</td><td>Vitreous</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>&#x02022; Serum samples were also obtained at the time of surgery in two patients from group 2 and one from group 3.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>All 22 patients were 18&#x000a0;years or older, and none had corneal neovascularization or epithelial defects prior to PPV or cataract surgery.

The group 1 patients were treated with topical bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml: they received a total of four drops, with 10-minute intervals between drops, 1&#x000a0;hour prior to cataract extraction surgery. The group 2 patients received four drops of topical bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml on the day before PPV surgery (once every 6&#x000a0;hours), and an additional four drops 1&#x000a0;hour prior to undergoing surgery at 10-minute intervals. Two patients in group 2 had been treated with intravitreal bevacizumab prior to their inclusion in this study. All group 1 and 2 patients were instructed to perform punctal occlusion for at least 60&#x000a0;seconds after instillation of the bevacizumab drops. The group 3 patients received an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab 1.25&#x000a0;mg/0.05&#x000a0;ml prior to undergoing PPV: the administration of bevacizumab was indicated as part of their treatment, since they all underwent PPV for the removal of vitreous hemorrhage (VH) secondary to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The time between bevacizumab injection and vitreous sampling differed between patients in group 3.</p><p>The topical and intravitreal bevacizumab administered in this study were prepared under sterile conditions in the pharmacy at our institution. Topical bevacizumab was administered from bottles containing 12 drops of bevacizumab 25&#x000a0;mg/ml. Syringes containing bevacizumab 1.25&#x000a0;mg/0.05&#x000a0;ml were used for intravitreal administration. Both preparations were refrigerated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for no longer than 5&#x000a0;days prior to use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surgical procedures and sampling</title><p>Cataract extraction surgery was performed by phacoemulsification using the Infinity Vision System (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA). All PPVs were 23-gauge, performed using the 23-gauge Constellation Vision System (Alcon Laboratories Inc., Fort Worth, TX, USA). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were encountered. Undiluted aqueous samples were drawn from the group 1 eyes through a paracentesis using a cannula prior to irrigation, while undiluted vitreous samples were drawn through a sclerotomy using the vitrector prior to irrigation in the eyes of the other three groups. Blood samples were also drawn at the time of surgery from three patients in group 2.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for bevacizumab</title><p>Samples obtained from groups 1&#x02013;4 underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for bevacizumab. All steps of the ELISA process were performed at room temperature. Nunc 96-well Maxisorp plates (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) were coated with 100&#x000a0;ul/well of hrVEGF (Prospec, East Brunswick, NJ) at 2&#x000a0;ng/ul overnight, followed by blocking at 0.5&#x000a0;% BSA in PBS for 1&#x000a0;hour. Aqueous samples were diluted 1:4, and vitreous and serum samples were diluted 1:2 in 1&#x000a0;% BSA in PBS with 0.05&#x000a0;% Tween 20, and incubated for 2&#x000a0;hours. The wells were then washed with 0.05&#x000a0;% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated for 30&#x000a0;min in goat anti-human IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA, USA) diluted 1:10,000 in 1&#x000a0;% BSA in PBS with 0.05&#x000a0;% Tween 20. The wells were then thoroughly washed before development with 100&#x000a0;ul/well of TMB substrate (Pierce Protein Biology, Rockford, IL, USA) for up to 30&#x000a0;minutes in dark conditions. Absorbance was measured using optical density (OD) values obtained from a microplate reader at 450&#x000a0;nm, with 620&#x000a0;nm as a reference. Bevacizumab concentrations were compared to standard curves generated with 1:2 serial dilutions from 400&#x000a0;ng/ml in 1&#x000a0;% BSA in PBS with 0.05&#x000a0;% Tween 20 with 10&#x000a0;% human serum. This method is very sensitive, and is capable of detecting bevacizumab from a minimal concentration of 6.25&#x000a0;ng/ml. The standard curve was generated from 6.25&#x000a0;ng/ml to 300&#x000a0;ng/ml, using nonspecific human IgG as a negative control in place of the bevacizumab. The detectable range of bevacizumab by this method was therefore between 6.25&#x000a0;ng/ml and 300&#x000a0;ng/ml. For quality control, all drawn samples were divided in two and analyzed separately. The results of both samples of each patient were then averaged.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis and pharmacokinetic calculations</title><p>Data were analyzed using SPSS for windows version 17. Values are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, unless otherwise specified. The bevacizumab concentration was multiplied by estimated volumes of 5.5&#x000a0;ml for vitreous samples and 5,000&#x000a0;ml for serum samples in order to calculate its mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

No pharmacokinetic calculations could be performed in the current study, since no bevacizumab was detected in eyes that were treated topically. However, our results demonstrate that topical bevacizumab is associated with virtually no penetration in human eyes with intact corneas, corroborating previous findings in experimental animal models.</p><p>It should be noted that corneal penetration has been demonstrated to be significantly increased when corneal NV or epithelial defects are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Several studies suggested that topical bevacizumab may impair corneal epithelial healing and cause stromal thinning after prolonged use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is also possible that the TWEEN buffer that is present in the commercially available bevacizumab preparation (Avastin&#x000ae;) acts as a detergent that can enhance intraocular penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Therefore, it may be assumed that its intraocular penetration will be higher in patients with corneal NV and epithelial defects treated for long periods of time with topical bevacizumab, but several studies have reported very favorable safety profiles for topical administration of bevacizumab in patients with corneal NV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An in vitro study demonstrated that the median inhibitory concentration of bevacizumab is 22&#x000a0;ng/ml, and that the minimal concentration that completely blocks all VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and hyperpermeability is 500&#x000a0;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Even if corneal NV and associated epithelial defects increase the risk of bevacizumab penetration, it is probably unlikely to achieve levels that can result in either effective intraocular activity or adverse events. The implications of these findings are encouraging, since corneal NV is an ocular surface disease, and topical administration of bevacizumab will achieve a high local therapeutic level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with minimal risk for intraocular or systemic adverse effects related to VEGF inhibition.</p><p>Two of our five patients who were treated with intravitreal injection of bevacizumab 1.25&#x000a0;mg/0.05&#x000a0;ml had also been treated with topical bevacizumab according to the group 2 protocol, but the contribution of the latter to the detected level in the vitreous was assumed to be negligible. The time between intravitreal injection and vitreous sampling during PPV and detected concentrations are specified in the Results section and Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>. Four of these eyes underwent PPV for the first time in this study. Clearance of bevacizumab was calculated to have a T<sub>1/2</sub> that varied between 2.5 and 7.3&#x000a0;days, with a mean of 4.9&#x000a0;days. These results are compatible with previous pharmacokinetic studies of intravitreal bevacizumab injection in non-vitrectomized human eyes, in which vitreal T<sub>1/2</sub> varied between 3 and 7.8&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. They are also comparable to previous studies on animal models that reported the T<sub>1/2</sub> of vitreal bevacizumab between 4.2 and 6.6&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>A serum sample was available for one of our patients who underwent intravitreal bevacizumab injection, and a systemic T<sub>1/2</sub> of 11.3&#x000a0;days was calculated. This value is comparable with a previous animal study that reported a T<sub>1/2</sub> of 12.9&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Bevacizumab was not detected in serum samples from two patients who were solely treated topically, demonstrating that topical administration with punctual occlusion is associated with virtually no systemic absorption of bevacizumab.</p><p>One eye included in our study had previously been vitrectomized. The detected vitreal concentration of bevacizumab following intravitreal injection in that eye resulted in a calculated T<sub>1/2</sub> of 0.66&#x000a0;days. This T<sub>1/2</sub> is significantly shorter than that found in non-vitrectomized eyes, both in our study and in reports by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is possible that the vitreous serves as a reservoir for injected bevacizumab, and that its absence allows more rapid clearance from the eye. The blood&#x02013;brain and blood&#x02013;retinal barriers express neonatal Fc receptor that binds to the Fc portion of antibodies and actively transports them into the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In vitrectomized eyes, bevacizumab may more readily be transported out of the eye by this mechanism. This is consistent with previous studies that demonstrated significantly reduced T<sub>1/2</sub> times after intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide in vitrectomized eyes in both animal models and human eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Our search of the literature failed to reveal any publications on the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in vitrectomized human eyes. This is a novel finding, which may have significant clinical implications. Bevacizumab is frequently injected into previously vitrectomized eyes in clinical practice, and its increased clearance may mandate more frequent injections. This concept is supported by an earlier study that reported a reduced effect of bevacizumab injections in vitrectomized eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>Several limitations of this study warrant consideration. First, topical bevacizumab was administered for only 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days, and it is possible that a regimen of more frequent applications for a longer period of time might have resulted in detectable intraocular bevacizumab levels. This is probably unlikely, since the corneal epithelium was intact in all of our studied eyes. Second, since no patients with corneal NV were included, it is not possible to predict the pharmacokinetics of topical bevacizumab in eyes with that pathology. Third, we acknowledge that the number of patients who received intravitreal bevacizumab was small, although there is a precedent to describe as few as two patients in pharmacokinetic studies in human eyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Fourth, we note that the presence of vitreal hemorrhage in eyes that received intravitreal bevacizumab injections may have altered its pharmacokinetics. However, this has not been established in any study, and since all eyes treated intravitreally had VH, we contend that comparing them is methodologically sound. Finally, fixed volumes were assumed when calculating bevacizumab amounts from vitreal and serum samples. Although estimating individual vitreal and serum volumes from individual patient&#x02019;s axial length and weight might have allowed more accurate calculations, their effect on T<sub>1/2</sub> calculation would have been very small and clinically insignificant.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that topical bevacizumab does not penetrate into the aqueous or vitreous following short-term use. Our intention was to perform pharmacokinetic calculations, but intraocular bevacizumab was not detected following topical administration. These results are consistent with previous studies, and support the growing body of evidence attesting to efficient and safe topical use of bevacizumab. Further studies of the pharmacokinetics in patients with corneal NV are warranted. Additionally, our results on vitreal and systemic T<sub>1/2</sub> following intravitreal bevacizumab injection corroborate previous studies. Finally, our study demonstrates for the first time that the T<sub>1/2</sub> of intravitreal bevacizumab in a previously vitrectomized eye is significantly reduced. More comprehensive studies of bevacizumab pharmacokinetics in previously vitrectomized eyes are warranted, and may lead to the formation of different treatment regimens for such patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Elad Moisseiev and Michael Waisbourd: equal contribution</p></fn></fn-group><ack><sec id="d30e1265"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>No author has any proprietary interest in the publication of this report.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1270"><title>Source of support</title><p>Ministry of Health, Office of the Chief Scientist, Israel.
