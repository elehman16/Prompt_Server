Two clinical constructs for identifying individuals at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes are prediabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Prediabetes is a state of dysglycemia defined by impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is estimated that 79 million Americans aged 20 years or older have prediabetes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with 25% of them progressing to type 2 diabetes within 3&#x02013;5 years (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Type 2 diabetes is associated with abdominal obesity and insulin resistance (diagnostic criteria were established by the Advanced Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program); MetS is a cluster of risk factors for cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Individuals with MetS are at a fivefold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Because IFG is one of the constituent traits used to identify MetS, overlap with criteria for prediabetes exists, and the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes is further increased in individuals who satisfy both sets of criteria (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Thus, effective treatment of these at-risk individuals is imperative for the prevention of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Sustained loss of 5&#x02013;10% of body weight in obese and overweight patients has proven to be effective in preventing progression from prediabetes (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and MetS (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) to type 2 diabetes. It also ameliorates the cardiometabolic disease process, as shown by an increase in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, achieving sustained weight loss at a clinically meaningful level sufficient to reduce risk remains a challenge for many patients (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The primary approach to treating obesity and its related complications involves lifestyle modifications, including reductions in caloric intake (by 500&#x02013;1,000 calories/day) combined with increases in physical activity (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Bariatric surgery can also be an effective weight loss option for patients meeting specific criteria (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and may reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), but the approach entails risks associated with surgery, nutritional deficiencies, and weight regain in some patients (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>In patients for whom lifestyle changes alone are insufficient and bariatric surgery is not an option, pharmacotherapies may be considered. Phentermine and topiramate extended release (PHEN/TPM ER; Qsymia; VIVUS, Inc., Mountain View, CA) have been shown to induce significant weight loss when combined with lifestyle modification in overweight/obese adults (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The CONQUER study assessed effectiveness of PHEN/TPM ER for weight loss in overweight/obese adults with two or more weight-related comorbidities over 56 weeks (clinicaltrials.gov, NCT00553787) (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and was followed by SEQUEL, a 52-week blinded extension study (NCT00796367) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In order to assess the ability of PHEN/TPM ER to reduce progression to type 2 diabetes and improve cardiometabolic parameters in patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes, we analyzed the subpopulation of patients meeting the criteria at baseline for prediabetes and/or MetS who elected to enroll in SEQUEL.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>SEQUEL was a 52-week extension of the 56-week, phase 3, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled CONQUER trial (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The selection process for the 36 SEQUEL sites was based on high initial CONQUER enrollment and subject retention. Subject outcomes and randomization remained blinded during this process. All subjects who completed CONQUER on treatment at this subset of 36 sites were eligible to enroll in the SEQUEL extension study (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). All subjects entering SEQUEL maintained their original randomized treatment assignment from CONQUER (in a 2:1:2 ratio, stratified by sex and diabetes status) of once-daily oral placebo, PHEN 7.5 mg/TPM ER 46 mg, or PHEN 15 mg/TPM ER 92 mg (placebo, 7.5/46, and 15/92, respectively), plus lifestyle modification counseling based on the LEARN (lifestyle, exercise, attitudes, relationships, and nutrition) program (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), for an additional 52 weeks, resulting in 108 weeks of treatment. A computer-generated algorithm had been used to randomize subjects to study treatment at the beginning of the CONQUER study. Investigators and subjects remained blinded to treatment assignment. Study drug compliance (assessed by count of capsules returned by subject) and lifestyle counseling were addressed at each study visit, conducted every 4 weeks. At baseline (CONQUER week 0), subjects were overweight or obese adults (aged 18&#x02013;70 years), with BMIs of 27&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and two or more of the following weight-related comorbidities: central adiposity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or type 2 diabetes. Subjects were actively managed to standard of care for their comorbidities, including the option to add, discontinue, or dose-adjust medications. The trials were approved by each center&#x02019;s institutional review board and overseen by an independent data safety review board. All subjects provided written informed consent. The first subject was enrolled into this study on 6 December 2008, and the last subject completed the study on 8 June 2010.</p><p>The subgroup analyses presented in this article were performed on the subset of subjects with prediabetes and/or MetS at baseline who elected to enroll in the SEQUEL study. Subjects with a medical history of type 2 diabetes at baseline were excluded from this analysis. The criteria for prediabetes were as defined by the American Diabetes Association: IFG (fasting glucose levels 100&#x02013;125 mg/dL [5.6&#x02013;6.9 mmol/L]) or impaired glucose tolerance (blood glucose 140&#x02013;199 mg/dL [7.8&#x02013;11.0 mmol/L] 2 h after 75-g glucose load during an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT]) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The diagnosis of MetS was made when three or more of the following five criteria were met: waist circumference &#x02265;102 cm in men or &#x02265;88 cm in women; triglycerides &#x02265;150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) or taking one or more lipid-lowering medications; HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) &#x0003c;40 mg/dL (1.0 mmol/L) in men or &#x0003c;50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women or taking one or more lipid-lowering medications; systolic blood pressure &#x02265;130 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure &#x02265;85 mmHg or taking one or more antihypertensive medications; and fasting glucose &#x02265;100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) or taking drug treatment for elevated glucose (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>The primary end point was percent weight loss from baseline, which was assessed after 108 weeks (or early termination) in the SEQUEL study. Prespecified secondary end points were assessed at baseline, week 56, and week 108 (or early termination) and included annualized incidence rate of progression to type 2 diabetes and changes in glycemia, lipid parameters, blood pressure, and waist circumference (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Remission of MetS (i.e., no longer meeting the diagnostic criteria as evidenced by satisfying only two or less of these criteria) at week 108 was also assessed. Finally, at week 56, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and fibrinogen, both of which are inflammatory markers associated with MetS, were measured, as was adiponectin, which is decreased in subjects with obesity and cardiometabolic disease (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>For analyses of glucose and insulin as measured by OGTT (75-g loading dose), the change in each parameter from the preglucose loading dose sample to the sample obtained 2 h after the glucose loading dose at each applicable visit was calculated. OGTT was measured at baseline, week 4, week 56, and week 108. Fasting blood glucose was measured at baseline and weeks 4, 16, 28, 40, 56, 48, 96, and 108. Subjects were considered to have progressed to type 2 diabetes if their blood glucose was &#x02265;126 mg/dL under fasting conditions during two or more consecutive measurements and/or &#x02265;200 mg/dL at 2 h after an OGTT.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>In this subanalysis, primary and secondary end points were assessed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population using ANCOVA with terms for treatment group and baseline value. To accommodate missing data, multiple imputation (MI) was applied to all end points where missing data were apparent using, specifically, a two-step imputation process with <italic>m</italic> = 5 imputations per step (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In the first step, data were imputed to create a monotone missing data pattern by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. In the second step, remaining missing data were imputed using Rubin regression method (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The complete imputed data sets were then analyzed by ANCOVA as described above, and the results from analysis of the separate imputed data sets were pooled into single estimates and tested as described by Schafer (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>).</p><p>The annualized incidence rate of type 2 diabetes was calculated as the number of newly diagnosed subjects divided by the number of subject-years of follow-up for each treatment group. The number of subject-years of follow-up was calculated as the sum of the number of days across all subjects from the randomization date in CONQUER to the onset date of type 2 diabetes or to the date of study completion or discontinuation (for subjects who did not develop type 2 diabetes) divided by 365.25. Absolute risk was calculated as the number of subjects progressing to type 2 diabetes divided by the number of subjects in each treatment group. The rates of progression to type 2 diabetes among the treatment groups were compared using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>Analyses of the primary and secondary end points were also performed on the ITT sample with last observation carried forward (ITT-LOCF), consisting of all subjects who were randomized, took one or more doses of the study drug or placebo, and had one or more postbaseline body weight measurements; protocol-prespecified statistical assessments have been described elsewhere (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 866 subjects who completed CONQUER at eligible SEQUEL sites, 675 (77.9%) elected to enroll in the SEQUEL extension study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-1518/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>) (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

In patients with prediabetes and/or MetS, PHEN/TPM ER was highly effective in inducing and sustaining weight loss and had a profound effect on prevention of type 2 diabetes, as measured by cumulative and annualized incidence rates. There was a 71 and 79% reduction in progression to type 2 diabetes among patients treated with 7.5/46 and 15/92 compared with placebo over 108 weeks. Additional studies are needed to determine whether weight loss associated with PHEN/TPM ER treatment will be maintained beyond 2 years or lead to sustained lower rates of progression to type 2 diabetes as compared with patients treated with placebo. However, most cases of type 2 diabetes in PHEN/TPM ER&#x02013;treated patients occurred in the first year of the study, whereas cases continued to accumulate into the second year in the placebo group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>); thus, the difference in cumulative incidence between the PHEN/TPM ER and placebo groups, and the relative degree of type 2 diabetes prevention, may continue to increase over time.</p><p>The ability to prevent type 2 diabetes was greatly dependent on the magnitude of weight loss, independent of randomization group. The annualized incidence rate for type 2 diabetes was progressively reduced as weight loss increased, with the lowest value realized at &#x02265;15% weight loss, suggesting that greater weight loss is associated with greater benefits. Previous studies of lifestyle intervention, such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), have also indicated that the degree of weight loss was a predominant determinant of type 2 diabetes prevention (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), although the Finnish Diabetes (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and Da Qing (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) studies demonstrated that both weight loss and exercise exerted independent effects. The DPP study, wherein patients achieved &#x0223c;6% mean weight loss at 2 years and &#x0223c;4% weight loss at 4 years in the lifestyle intervention arm, reported a progressive 16% reduction in type 2 diabetes risk with every kilogram of weight loss but without an indication that there was a threshold of weight loss for maximal type 2 diabetes prevention (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The current study is in agreement with the DPP, demonstrating that greater weight loss leads to greater reductions in the rate of type 2 diabetes. All categories with &#x02265;5% weight loss experienced greater reductions in cumulative type 2 diabetes incidence when compared with the weight loss category of &#x0003c;5%. Thus, although modest weight loss of &#x0223c;5%, as recommended by the ADA (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), is beneficial, greater degrees of weight loss appear to lead to greater prevention of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Although the current study was limited to 2 years, the DPP, Finnish Diabetes, and Da Qing studies all demonstrated that after changes in or discontinuation of active treatment, the incidence of new type 2 diabetes diagnoses remained reduced compared with placebo or usual care over longer periods of follow-up (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Based on these data, we theorize that reduced rates of type 2 diabetes may continue to be observed in the PHEN/TPM ER treatment arms compared with placebo, even after discontinuation of study drug. Of course, this is just speculation, but it does constitute a compelling consideration for future studies.</p><p>Importantly, weight loss and prevention of type 2 diabetes as a consequence of PHEN/TPM ER therapy were accompanied by an increase in insulin sensitivity, as manifested by reduced glucose and insulin values, and improvements in cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, waist circumference, triglycerides, and HDL-C). Furthermore, systemic inflammation, as measured by hs-CRP and fibrinogen at week 56, was reduced, and levels of the insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine adiponectin, at week 56, were increased. Since insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, inflammation, and dysregulated secretion of adipocytokines are all hallmarks of cardiometabolic disease, these findings are indicative of the potential reversal of this pathophysiologic process (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that in clinical trials assessing PHEN/TPM ER, all patients received advice on lifestyle modification, and the current benefits reflect the combination of PHEN/TPM ER and the lifestyle program (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The LEARN program is similar to the DPP lifestyle intervention in that it strongly emphasizes behavior modification; however, the LEARN program has a less stringent calorie reduction requirement (decrease of 500 vs. 750&#x02013;1,000 kcal in DPP) and encourages a progressive increase in exercise, rather than specifying a minimum amount of physical activity, as in DPP (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Although the differences between lifestyle intervention alone (placebo group) and PHEN/TPM ER with lifestyle intervention to promote weight loss and prevent type 2 diabetes were relatively small in the SEQUEL trial, treatment with PHEN/TPM ER should nevertheless be combined with lifestyle modification to realize the full clinical benefits demonstrated in this study. These findings have particular relevance to real-world treatment decisions, since maintaining clinically meaningful weight loss through lifestyle changes alone is challenging (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The robust clinical benefits observed with an effective pharmacologic agent combined with lifestyle modification thus may confer a significant advantage to improve outcomes in patients at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In general, PHEN/TPM ER was well tolerated, with no meaningful differences in safety in the prediabetes and/or MetS cohort during 108 weeks when compared with the overall SEQUEL population, and no differences between years 1 and 2 (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Given the high risk of type 2 diabetes, which confers extensive patient suffering and high societal costs, the potential benefit-to-risk ratio of weight-loss treatment could be particularly favorable in patients with prediabetes and/or MetS.</p><p>This study had certain limitations. SEQUEL was limited to high-enrolling centers with high patient retention from CONQUER, so not all patients were eligible for the extension (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Patients enrolled at sites eligible to participate in SEQUEL had slightly greater weight loss (&#x0223c;1% across treatment arms) at CONQUER end point than patients at non-SEQUEL sites. In addition, a higher percentage of PHEN/TPM ER&#x02013;treated patients elected to continue in the study, so the original 2:1:2 randomization ratio was not maintained in the SEQUEL trial. The overall enrolled population for the SEQUEL clinical trial was larger than the subset of patients evaluated in this subanalysis; even so, baseline demography, efficacy, and safety were similar to the overall population, suggesting continuity across populations (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Because patients with type 2 diabetes were excluded, there were some significant differences, mostly in glycemic parameters, between the cohort included in this analysis and those who were excluded (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-1518/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 5</ext-link>). Also, because the study involved active management to standards of care, changes in concomitant medications for treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia are likely to have affected related study variables, often narrowing the gap between PHEN/TPM ER&#x02013;treated patients and those taking placebo. However, active management was applied by treatment-blinded clinicians across placebo and PHEN/TPM ER treatment groups. Although these medication adjustments may affect some parameters, this also means that the study is largely representative of the type of care given in routine clinical practice, indicating that clinical benefits observed here may also be achieved in a real-world setting (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In a separate analysis of the overall SEQUEL population, including those with type 2 diabetes, the weight loss associated with PHEN/TPM ER treatment induced improvement in cardiometabolic parameters even as use of medications to treat dysglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was reduced as compared with placebo (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). This suggests that weight loss associated with PHEN/TPM ER may lead to reduced medication burden for the treatment of weight-related comorbidities. Lastly, although 2 years is longer than any registration studies, it would be beneficial to have longer-term data to add to our understanding of the benefits and risks of prolonged PHEN/TPM ER use.</p><p>This study demonstrates that PHEN/TPM ER plus lifestyle modification was generally well tolerated and produced significant weight loss through 108 weeks in patients with prediabetes and/or MetS at baseline. The ability of PHEN/TPM ER to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes was profound, with both PHEN/TPM ER treatment groups exhibiting statistically significant reductions in incidence rate in these high-risk individuals with prediabetes and/or MetS, with greater weight loss leading to greater reductions in progression to type 2 diabetes. Concomitant improvements in glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, and cardiometabolic disease biomarkers were also observed. These data indicate that adding PHEN/TPM ER to lifestyle modification may constitute a new and effective therapeutic approach in patients with obesity and cardiometabolic disease, even as an alternative to bariatric surgery, by virtue of the ability of PHEN/TPM ER to produce substantial weight loss and to reduce risk of progression to type 2 diabetes in patients at high risk.</p></sec>
