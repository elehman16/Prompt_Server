Using videotape and written feedback within a developmental framework, PLAY consultants coached caregivers monthly for 12 months to improve caregiver-child interaction. CS included speech/language and occupational therapy and public education services. Primary outcomes included change in parent-child interactions, language and development, and autism-related diagnostic category/symptoms. Secondary outcomes included parent stress and depression and home consultant fidelity.

PLAY is parent-mediated, developmental, and focused on social reciprocity.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> PLAY is based on Greenspan and Wieder's<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> developmental, individual differences, and relationship-based (DIR) theoretical framework. Greenspan's &#x0201c;affect diathesis hypothesis&#x0201d; maintains that when dyadic interaction is contingent, reciprocal, and affectively laden (i.e., enjoyable), the child's diathesis/inherent tendency is to progress through a series of increasingly functional (i.e., socially competent) developmental levels. PLAY operationalizes DIR through a structured approach that includes coaching, modeling, and video feedback. PLAY consultants make monthly 3-hour home visits; a 15-minute video of representative play interactions is recorded and analyzed. This analysis includes a written &#x0201c;PLAY Plan&#x0201d; describing methods, techniques, and activities that fosters parents' interactional abilities and play skills to promote their children's functional development.</p><p>PLAY addresses National Research Council recommendations for intensity by supporting parents in engaging their children for a minimum of 2 hours/day (15 hr/wk) in addition to usual community services. It was hypothesized that, compared with a control group, PLAY parents would improve in their interaction skills that would result in concomitant improvements in their children's interaction skills, language, development, and autism symptomatology.</p><p>Caregivers of children with ASD are at high risk for clinical levels of stress and depression.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Both parenting stress and depression are associated with the demands of caring for a child with ASD.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Since PLAY places more demands on caregivers, it was hypothesized that PLAY parents would experience more stress and depression than control parents. Finally, we assessed whether PLAY consultants showed fidelity to the model.

PLAY typically supplements existing services (e.g., special education, language and occupational therapies, and/or applied behavioral analysis/behavioral interventions) but has been implemented as a primary intervention for ASD in early intervention settings. The average cost of PLAY is between $3500 and $4500 per year per child.</p><sec id="s1-3-1"><title>Treatment Group</title><p>In this study, 6 PLAY consultants (1 occupational therapist, 2 speech and language therapists, and 3 special educators) were employed at the 5 ES study sites and had 2 to 5 years experience as PLAY consultants. All had been trained to certification by attending a 4-day training seminar followed by 12 to 18 months of supervision. Supervision involved submitting 20 video write-ups based on their clinical caseload to PLAY Project supervisors who evaluated their write-ups according to the PLAY Project fidelity manual.</p><p>PLAY services consisted of a 3-hour monthly home visit for 12 months (mean visits = 10.52; SD = 3.01). One week before the first visit, parents were encouraged (but not required) to review the PLAY Project DVD and written orientation materials. The 2-hour DVD introduced the parents to PLAY principles, methods, activities, and techniques through PowerPoint lecture slides combined with video examples. Written orientation materials (about 20 pages in total) described in detail the 6 functional developmental levels (FDLs) of Greenspan and Wieder's<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> developmental, individual differences, and relationship-based theoretical framework (see FEAS measure below) and provided descriptions and dozens of examples of PLAY techniques and activities based on the FDLs.</p><p>During the visits, the primary caregiver providing the majority of play interaction was targeted for instruction, but all caregivers were welcomed to attend monthly sessions. Consultants trained caregivers/parents through coaching, modeling, and video feedback. During <italic>coaching</italic>, consultants helped parents identify their child's subtle and hard to detect cues, respond contingently to the child's intentions, and effectively engage the child in reciprocal exchanges. Parents were taught to provide appropriate developmental challenges to promote progress in the child's FDLs.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> During <italic>modeling</italic>, consultants played for 15 to 30 minutes with the child to demonstrate PLAY methods and techniques. During <italic>video feedback</italic>, the home consultant obtained a 10-minute representative sample of parent play, and the parent obtained a 5-minute representative sample of the home consultant modeling. A <italic>written analysis of the video</italic>, sent between visits, reviewed the parent-child and consultant-child video interactions, summarized the child's developmental profile, and recommended methods and techniques. The program was revised to address the child's evolving developmental profile. For example, as children became easier to engage, the intervention emphasized increasing the <italic>length</italic> of engagement, waiting for more <italic>initiation</italic>, and expecting more <italic>reciprocal social exchanges</italic>, thus increasing the complexity of interaction and helping the child move up FDLs. Consultants were available between visits as needed by e-mail or phone. Families were encouraged to engage their child in 15- to 20-minute play sessions and throughout daily for a total of 2 hours/day.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3-2"><title>Control Group</title><p>Usual CS included special education public preschool services for 3 to 5 year olds that were free, typically composed of 4 to 5 half days of educational services and readily available in each of the study communities. The amount of these services was not consistently documented by parent report. Parents did report that on an average, they obtained approximately 100 hours/year (or approximately 2 hr/wk) of private speech and language therapies. After randomization, 2 families from the CS group chose to pay for PLAY services rather than participating in the control group and left the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Measures</title><p>Measures were collected before randomization and 12 months after PLAY intervention began. Easter Seals (ES) site administrators collected demographic data for the child and family at the screening visit. ADOS evaluators were trained to research reliability. The ADOS and Mullen were administered in ES offices, and evaluators were blinded as to intervention status. Other parent-report measures were completed by parents in the home, collected, and reviewed for accuracy at ES offices. ES management and staff were trained according to training manuals by the central administrative office in Ann Arbor to use the various evaluation instruments. All interactional observation measures were video-recorded in the home, then scored by raters blinded to group, and time assignment. Each measure was deidentified and copied at the grant's central administrative office before being sent to MSU for data analysis. All measures were prespecified by grant aims according to the original NIMH grant protocol.</p><sec id="s1-4-1"><title>Intervention Hours</title><p>Parents completed monthly logs of time spent using PLAY and other types of interventions. Consultants collected logs at the PLAY home visit. Participation in other intensive interventions (i.e., at least 10 hr/wk) made families ineligible because of the potential confound with PLAY; 1 family from each group was removed for this reason.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4-2"><title>Autism Diagnosis and Symptoms</title><p>The ADOS-generic<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> (ADOS-G) assesses social and communication behaviors representing ASD and was administered by independent assessors in ES offices.

Seventy participants were administered ADOS Module 1, and 26 participants were administered Module 2 at both pretest and posttest.

After 12 months of intervention, the following aims, using an intent-to-treat analysis, were demonstrated: On the Maternal Behavior Rating Scale, PLAY parents significantly improved in their abilities to sensitively respond and effectively engage their child; on the Child Behavior Rating Scale, PLAY children's interaction skills within the home improved with increased shared attention and initiation; and as measured by the Functional Emotional Assessment Scale, PLAY children's social-emotional development significantly increased. Autism symptomatology, measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G), also improved significantly with PLAY children more than twice as likely to improve in their autism diagnostic category. Although the interactional and functional developmental outcomes were robust, the ADOS findings must be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Other studies have used the ADOS as an outcome measure with equivocal or negative results.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> To our knowledge, this is the first larger scale, longitudinal (12 mo) controlled study using a parent-mediated model to show improvement in autism symptomatology as measured by the ADOS. These ADOS results, however, have lead to some incongruous results when interpreted clinically (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Forty-one percent of community service (CS) children and 53% of PLAY children in the &#x0201c;ASD&#x0201d; group improved significantly enough to be categorized clinically as no longer on the autism spectrum. Furthermore, 16% of CS and 31% of PLAY children categorized as being in the &#x0201c;Autism&#x0201d; ADOS category improved enough to move to the milder diagnosis of ASD. Finally, 24% of PLAY and 13% of CS children classified in the Autism category at pretest no longer were classified on the spectrum at posttest. This kind of dramatic improvement in 1 year is not in agreement with clinical experience.</p><p>The ADOS, according to the ADOS diagnostic manual, &#x0201c;is only one component of a full diagnostic evaluation for ASD&#x02026; information from this instrument should never be used in isolation to determine an individual's clinical diagnosis.&#x0201d;<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The ADOS-G has been revised to improve diagnostic accuracy<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> (after pretest data collection on the ADOS-G, the revised ADOS-2 instrument was published.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> This version includes an algorithm for a continuous calibrated severity score [CSS]. Since initial randomization was done using diagnosis from the original ADOS algorithms, replacing ADOS-G scoring with CSS algorithms resulted in participants being in different diagnostic groups for randomization or disqualifying them from the study, which would have invalidated the initial randomization. Thus, the continuous scores could not be used). Categorical cutoffs on the ADOS-G might have led raters to interpret the test items such that slight changes in score caused categories to be crossed leading to the incongruous results. Because of these concerns, the improvement of autism symptomatology in the PLAY group must be viewed very cautiously. Results need to be replicated in future studies and should include clinical correlation.</p><p>Parent-mediated intensive intervention models may present potential harms. Increasing demands on parents may add to parental levels of stress and depression.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> However, interventions that offer support and/or lead to improvement in children's symptoms have been shown to lower reported parental stress.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Consistent with this, PLAY parents' stress did not increase. Parents of children with ASD also demonstrate more depression than parents of typically developing children,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> yet PLAY parents showed a significant reduction in depressive symptomatology when compared with CS parents. These findings must be interpreted cautiously since improvement in depression resulted when established cutoffs (scores &#x02265;16) for depression were used, whereas analysis of continuous depression scores showed no significant findings. Nonetheless, our study is one of the first rigorous long-term studies to show a reduction in depression after intensive intervention.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p><p>Our study has limitations. Language, as measured by MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory, and developmental quotient, as measured by the Mullen, showed no differences between groups. These mixed findings improved parent-child interaction with less robust outcomes in language and IQ measures and are characteristic of the other RCTs of parent-mediated models.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Longer term studies with children carefully enrolled by cognitive/language level may be necessary. Also, the intervention group received similar CS as the control group, making it difficult to assess PLAY in isolation. Combining parent-mediated interventions with other locally available services, however, may improve the comprehensiveness of services and might be preferred for local autism treatment provision so that the burden on parents is shared.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Finally, parents in this study were better educated and of somewhat higher socioeconomic status than average, which may limit the generalizability of findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This study has implications for dissemination of ASD services. This was a community-based real-world implementation of the PLAY Project Home Consultation intervention for young children with ASD, adding 3 hours/month of home visitation within the context of usual CS. PLAY consultants showed fidelity in implementing the model, and parents consistently and effectively applied the program, providing about 2 hours/day of engaging interaction with their children. PLAY children made greater improvements in their interaction, functional development, and autism symptomatology than CS children. PLAY offers communities a relatively inexpensive effective treatment for children with ASD and their parents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Patricia Howlin, PhD for her critical review and Fei Chen for assistance with manuscript preparation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This investigation was supported by National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant (grant# 2 R44 MH078431-02A1).</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Disclosure: Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grants, sponsored by the NIMH, are administered through business entities to support research in technological innovation and dissemination.
