In a phase III trial, APF530 was noninferior to palonosetron in preventing acute CINV following single-dose moderately (MEC) or highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) and delayed CINV in MEC (MEC and HEC defined by Hesketh criteria).

Furthermore, once CINV is experienced, anticipatory nausea and vomiting may ensue during later cycles of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Uncontrolled CINV can also have economic effects, including an increase in unplanned office visits, hospitalizations, or hydration therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapeutic agents were first classified by Hesketh according to their emetogenic potential in the absence of antiemetic prophylaxis, with the risk of CINV being 31&#x02013;90&#x000a0;% in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC) and &#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;% in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Several antiemetic guidelines are available for the prevention of CINV in both the acute phase (occurring within 24&#x000a0;h after chemotherapy) and the delayed phase (occurring 24&#x02013;120 h after chemotherapy). Current antiemetic guidelines are similar with respect to the prevention of CINV after HEC, recommending a combination of a 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin 1 (NK-1) antagonist. For the prevention of CINV after MEC, guidelines differ somewhat depending on the chemotherapy regimen, but generally a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> antagonist plus dexamethasone (plus an NK-1 antagonist for some patients) is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, despite the availability of multiple antiemetic agents and treatment guidelines, there is still an unmet need for adequate prevention of delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC and HEC.</p><p>The effects of breast cancer and its treatment on quality of life in patients with breast cancer are well documented, and several quality of life instruments include measures of nausea and/or vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Most patients with breast cancer who are treated with chemotherapy receive, at minimum, a regimen classified as MEC, so many are at risk for experiencing CINV unless they receive adequate preventive therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Combination chemotherapy consisting of an anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide (AC) is commonly used for the treatment of breast cancer, with or without other agents. This combination was historically classified as MEC, but AC-based regimens were recently reclassified as highly emetogenic in the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) antiemetic guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Granisetron is a first-generation 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist commonly used to treat CINV, but its short half-life (8&#x000a0;h) makes it unsuitable for the effective prevention of delayed CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. APF530 is a novel formulation of 2&#x000a0;% granisetron and a bioerodible tri(ethylene glycol) poly (orthoester) (TEG-POE) polymer that is designed to provide slow, controlled hydrolysis, resulting in slow and sustained release of granisetron for the prevention of both acute and delayed CINV associated with MEC and HEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a previous trial, patients receiving MEC or HEC also received subcutaneously (SC) an abdominal injection of APF530 250, 500, or 750&#x000a0;mg (5, 10, or 15&#x000a0;mg granisetron, respectively). The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of granisetron administered in this formulation was ~24&#x02013;34 h, time to maximum plasma concentration (t<sub>max</sub>) was ~24&#x000a0;h, and APF530 elicited sustained therapeutic granisetron concentrations over 168&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subsequently, a phase III noninferiority trial (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00343460) was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of APF530 (250&#x000a0;mg and 500&#x000a0;mg) with the approved dose of palonosetron (0.25&#x000a0;mg intravenously [IV]) for the prevention of acute and delayed CINV following single-day administration of MEC or HEC in patients with cancer. APF530 was found to be noninferior to palonosetron in the control of acute CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC and in the prevention of delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC; however, it did not demonstrate superiority over palonosetron in delayed CINV with HEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

These were generally mild; no patients discontinued because of a treatment-related AE during cycle 1 in the APF530 250-mg and palonosetron groups, but 1 patient discontinued in the APF530 500-mg group because of drug hypersensitivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>The original analysis of this phase III trial using the entire study population demonstrated noninferiority of APF530 to palonosetron in the control of acute CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC, and in the prevention of delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In this post hoc analysis of the study breast cancer subpopulation, there were no detectable differences between APF530 250&#x000a0;mg and APF530 500&#x000a0;mg SC in within-cycle CR rates in any CINV phase for patients receiving MEC or HEC regimens. Complete response rates for the acute, delayed, and overall CINV periods were sustained across all 4&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy with MEC and HEC regimens and at each APF530 dose. Interestingly, CR rates with APF530 tended to increase with subsequent chemotherapy cycles, as was reported for the entire study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], although this could be related to the discontinuation of patients whose CINV was not adequately controlled. Comparisons with efficacy data from the entire patient population, which included patients with ovarian, breast, and lung cancers, revealed no notable differences between the breast cancer subset and the overall population in this phase III noninferiority study. Moreover, there were no notable differences in the safety profile of APF530 between the breast cancer population and the overall study population.</p><p>The main limitation of this study is that it is a post hoc analysis of a subpopulation from the original study; however, because the phase III trial was one of the largest CINV trials to date, the breast cancer subpopulation was sizeable, at over 600 patients. A possible confounding factor in evaluation of cycle 2&#x02013;4 results was that some patients had received palonosetron in cycle 1, whereas others had received APF530, prior to re-randomization to APF530 for cycle 2 onwards.</p><p>Since the completion of this phase III trial, the criteria used to classify chemotherapy regimens as MEC or HEC have been updated in the ASCO antiemesis guidelines. Importantly, AC-containing regimens, which were considered moderately emetogenic when the original study was conducted, are now classified as highly emetogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and although a NK-1 receptor antagonist and multi-day corticosteroid in addition to a 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist are now recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), ASCO, and the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) for patients receiving HEC, this trial was designed to compare APF530 versus palonosetron as the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> component. A post hoc subgroup analysis confirmed that reclassification of emetogenicity according to the newer ASCO criteria did not alter initial study conclusions for the overall population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As over 75&#x000a0;% of patients in the breast cancer subpopulation received an AC-containing regimen, this reclassification supports the value of APF530 in providing adequate control of CINV in patients receiving HEC.</p><p>Palonosetron is approved for IV administration at a dose of 0.25&#x000a0;mg, the dose used in the current study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and has been evaluated in patients with breast cancer. A phase III noninferiority study compared 3 doses of oral palonosetron (0.25, 0.50, and 0.75&#x000a0;mg) with the approved IV dose (0.25&#x000a0;mg) in patients receiving MEC, most of whom had breast cancer. Noninferiority to IV palonosetron was demonstrated by all 3 oral doses in the acute phase and the 0.50-mg oral dose in the overall phase, but none of the oral doses was noninferior in the delayed phase. Addition of dexamethasone generally improved CR rates with the oral doses in the acute and delayed phases. Complete response rates with IV palonosetron were 70, 65, and 59&#x000a0;% during the acute, delayed, and overall phases. These data suggest that the IV formulation of palonosetron is still the preferred option for control of acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC in this population of primarily breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similar CR rates (65, 68, and 55&#x000a0;%, respectively) were also seen in breast cancer patients receiving MEC in a phase II study of IV palonosetron plus dexamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Given the findings of the original APF530 phase III noninferiority trial and the current breast cancer subanalysis, in which CR rates for APF530 500&#x000a0;mg plus dexamethasone were 73, 48, and 45&#x000a0;% during the acute, delayed, and overall phases following MEC, and 73, 63, and 55&#x000a0;% during the acute, delayed, and overall phases following HEC, APF530 may provide a valuable treatment option for patients with breast cancer, particularly for the prevention of delayed CINV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, in this population of patients with breast cancer, APF530 and palonosetron provided similar activity in preventing acute and delayed CINV in patients receiving MEC or HEC, and both APF530 doses displayed persistent activity in the prevention of CINV across 4&#x000a0;cycles of chemotherapy. The single subcutaneous injection of APF530 may provide a convenient alternative to palonosetron IV for CINV prevention. Further post hoc analyses may provide additional insights into the efficacy and safety of APF530 SC, including the effects of sex, age, type of chemotherapy regimen, and prior therapies. Future studies may also investigate the potential value of APF530 in other clinical settings where sustained antiemetic activity is desired, such as in patients receiving multiday chemotherapy, in patients receiving radiation therapy, in patients who are unable to tolerate oral antiemetics, in combination with aprepitant and other NK-1 antagonists, and in the postoperative setting.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>5-HT<sub>3</sub></term><def><p>5-hydroxytryptamine type 3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AC</term><def><p>anthracycline (doxorubicin or epirubicin) and cyclophosphamide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ASCO</term><def><p>American Society of Clinical Oncology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CC</term><def><p>complete control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CINV</term><def><p>chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p>complete response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HEC</term><def><p>highly emetogenic chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p>intravenously</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MASCC</term><def><p>Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEC</term><def><p>moderately emetogenic chemotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mITT</term><def><p>modified intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCCN</term><def><p>National Comprehensive Cancer Network</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NK-1</term><def><p>neurokinin 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QTc</term><def><p>heart-rate corrected</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>subcutaneously</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub></term><def><p>half-life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEG-POE</term><def><p>tri(ethylene glycol) poly(orthoester)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>time to maximum plasma concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TR</term><def><p>total response</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Ralph Boccia has received clinic funding for the trial only.
