to decrease pain and increase the ability to balance by implementing visual feedback
during early rehabilitation after total knee arthroplasty. [Subjects and Methods] In this
study, 24 patients who receive a total knee arthroplasty were randomly and equally
assigned to a visual feedback training group (VFT group) and a visual disuse group
(Control group). They performed visual feedback training using the My Fitness Trainer
(MFT, Austria) for 20 minutes, three times per week for eight weeks. The patients&#x02019; balance
ability and pain was measured before and after the exercises. Pain was measured by the
visual analogue scale (VAS). To assess balance ability, the anteroposterior and
mediolateral directions on unstable ground was measured by using the MFT measurement
system. [Results] The VFT group showed a significant decrease in VAS and an increase in
balance ability within the group, as well as a significant increase in balance ability
between groups when compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Visual feedback training
during the rehabilitation of patients who received a total knee arthroplasty will be
useful in reducing pain and improving balance.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Total knee arthroplasty</kwd><kwd>Visual feedback</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a procedure that ameliorates pain in the knee joint and
restores its function<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance index
of patients who receive a TKA is affected by whether they receive balance training<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considerable research on the ability to
balance after TKA has been conducted; maintaining balance, proprioception, visual feedback,
a parallel sense system, and stabilizing the contraction of lower limb muscles are closely
related<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception plays an
important role in the rehabilitation that aims at recovering balance control. It has been
established that the efficacy of exercise is higher in an exercise regimen that combines
visual information with proprioception, rather than depending solely on proprioception<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Visual feedback contributes to posture control when it is combined with afferent
information that comes from the vestibular system and the somatic senses. Since visual
feedback helps decrease posture sway, it can improve the ability to control posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hatzitaki et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the subjects&#x02019; posture control ability improved
when the visual feedback mechanism was used. In addition, they stated that an intervention
including the balance exercise through visual feedback, when administered to degenerative
knee arthritis patients along with a surgical intervention, was helpful for the patients&#x02019;
joint ability and balance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although
numerous studies have examined the general rehabilitation for patients who receive a TKA,
few studies have investigated the visual feedback and proprioceptive training implemented
during the early stages after surgery.</p><p>This study attempts to discover how visual feedback applied to proprioceptive exercise
during the early rehabilitation process after TKA affects the patient&#x02019;s pain and balancing
ability and provides fundamental data concerning early rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Among the patients who received rehabilitation exercise after TKA, 24 patients who were
aware of the intent of this study and agreed to participate were chosen as subjects. Written
informed consent according to the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki was
provided by all subjects prior to participation, and all agree to participate in this study.
The subjects, who were capable of standing and weight loading on the affected side after
TKA, were randomly divided into an experimental group (n=12) and a control group (n=12). The
two groups received training three times a week for a total of eight weeks.</p><p>The My Fitness Trainer (MFT, Austria) balance board, which is manufactured in Austria, was
used for the experimental group and the control group. The equipment is comprised of a
circular foothold that moves freely in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions on
stable ground, a monitor that displays the movement of the foothold, and a computer that
processes the movements. The patients moved their trunks, which were marked with a cross at
the center of the target displayed on the monitor, while in a standing position with
slightly bent knees, maintaining the center position as long as possible. The members of the
experimental group, known as the visual feedback training (VFT) group, received training on
the MFT while using visual feedback by watching the monitor. To ensure identical conditions,
the control group trained on the same MFT used by the VFT group but did not receive any
visual feedback. Both the VFT group and the control group exercised for 20 minutes.</p><p>Pain was measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS) twice during the eight-week research
period for the members of the VFT group and the control group&#x02014;before the study began and at
the end of the eight weeks. The anteroposterior and mediolateral directions on unstable
ground was measured for 30 seconds by using the MFT measurement system. The time it took an
individual to balance his/her weight was marked on a target divided into five sections, from
the highest score of 0 to the lowest score of 5; the results were calculated as a ratio of
the delay time to the total measured time, which was given as a percentage. In both the VFT
group and the control group, balancing ability was measured before and after the experiment.
For the latter measurement, balance was determined after a 30-minute rest following the end
of the exercise to minimize fatigue.</p><p>This study used SPSS 18.0 for Windows to conduct the data analysis. A paired t-test was
used to test the within-group level of pain and balancing ability before and after the
experiment. A covariance analysis (ANCOVA) on the post-measured value was conducted by
setting the pre-value as the covariance to test the significance of the difference between
groups. The significance level &#x00251; was set at 0.05 for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of the general

and increase the ability to balance by implementing visual feedback during early
rehabilitation after TKA. The study showed that the VFT group exhibited a significant
difference in the level of pain and balancing ability.</p><p>Although the VFT group and control group showed significant decrease within-group
differences in the VAS after the eight-week training, there was no significant between-group
difference. Visual feedback training is reported to be very useful for reducing overall pain
and increasing the active range of motion<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, there was a significant within-group difference of pain
after TKA, although no significant difference was observed between the VFT group and the
control group when comparing them at the end of the experiment. We can say that pain
decreased as time passed, although not because of the eight-week training. This is
consistent with previous studies that report that almost all patients complain about pain in
the early phase after TKA; the pain ameliorates or disappears with time<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study measured the balance ability of a VFT group and a control group using MFT
equipment. Both groups&#x02019; balance ability in the anteroposterior direction and the
mediolateral direction significantly increased. Moreover, the VFT group showed a significant
increase compared to the control group in a between-group comparison after the treatment.
Consistent with this study result, Yu et al.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that the balance exercise, when applied to TKA patients, was
effective in increasing their balance indices; this is also consistent with the results of a
previous paper that studied the effects of visual feedback on knee joint diseases<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among the factors required for maintaining balance, proprioception
of the lower limb is 58%, visual information is 22%, and the vestibular system is 20%<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. As such, proprioception is extremely
important and it is necessary to engage in training that emphasizes the visual and
vestibular systems. The effects of visual feedback occur when neurological change occurs as
spinal cord and cerebral cortex areas are stimulated following the coordination of the nerve
root and the voluntary muscle contraction. The current study also assumed that visual
information was effective in improving the proprioceptive senses, which decreased after TKA
surgery, through postoperative rehabilitation.</p><p>Limitations of this study were that compensation actions of the upper extremities and trunk
were not prevented during the balance training, and the surgical sites of the subjects were
not consistent. Therefore, future research that improves these limitations is considered
necessary.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, we believe that proprioceptive training that uses
visual feedback during the rehabilitation of patients who received a TKA will be useful in
reducing pain and improving balance.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mandeville</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Osternig</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name><name><surname>Chou</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of total knee replacement surgery on gait
