The primary objective was 12-month safety, particularly endometrial; 12-week efficacy was assessed.

Most (88%) treatment-emergent adverse events with ospemifene were considered mild or moderate. Three cases (1.0%) of active proliferation were observed in the ospemifene group. For one, active proliferation was seen at end of study week 52, and diagnosed as simple hyperplasia without atypia on follow-up biopsy 3 months after the last dose. This subsequently resolved with progestogen treatment and dilatation and curettage. In six subjects (five ospemifene (1.4%), one placebo (1.6%)) endometrial polyps were found (histopathology); however, only one (ospemifene) was confirmed as a true polyp during additional expert review. Endometrial histology showed no evidence of carcinoma. Statistically significant improvements were seen for all primary and secondary efficacy measures and were sustained through week 52 with ospemifene vs. placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p> The findings of this 52-week study confirm the tolerance and efficacy of oral ospemifene previously reported in short- and long-term studies.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>VAGINAL EFFECTS</kwd><kwd>ENDOMETRIAL SAFETY</kwd><kwd>DYSPAREUNIA</kwd><kwd>MATURATION INDEX</kwd><kwd>EFFICACY</kwd><kwd>SAFETY</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="ss1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA) include dyspareunia, dryness, itching and irritation<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>. These symptoms are a consequence of physiological changes in the superficial cells, parabasal cells and vaginal pH, and are typically progressive and unlikely to resolve without treatment<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. VVA affects up to about 50% of postmenopausal women<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02212;9</xref></sup>.</p><p>It is well established that VVA is a consequence of menopausal hypoestrogenism<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Systemic or topical estrogen therapies are effective, although full relief of VVA symptoms is not obtained in all women<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Each of these therapies also has other limitations. Inadequately opposed estrogen increases the risks of hyperplasia, polyps and endometrial cancer<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. Unlike vasomotor symptoms, which tend to abate after several years, symptoms of VVA typically become more apparent and severe over time<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. When hormone therapy is considered for treatment of VVA, local vaginal estrogen therapy is generally recommended<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>. Still, many women have reservations about any estrogen use, even when given as a minimally absorbed vaginal treatment. Vaginal administration and dosing may also be inconvenient and unacceptable for some patients<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Recent results from the REal Women's VIews of Treatment Options for Menopausal Vaginal ChangEs (REVIVE) survey in postmenopausal women indicated that patient dissatisfaction with messiness and inconvenience of administration of vaginal over-the-counter (OTC) products may result in suboptimal management of VVA<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, an oral treatment alternative to current vaginal OTC and estrogen therapies would provide another pharmacologic option in the treatment of VVA symptoms<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Promising potential developments in therapy options for VVA include compounds known as estrogen agonists/antagonists (i.e. selective estrogen receptor modulators or SERMs). These compounds lack the steroid structure of estrogens<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and can elicit tissue-specific estrogenic responses, such as a positive effect in the vaginal epithelium with a neutral or minimal effect on other estrogen-dependent organs<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02212;21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Ospemifene, a novel tissue-selective estrogen agonist/antagonist, is a compound that has been shown in preclinical and clinical studies to exert positive effects on the vaginal epithelium and minimal effects on the endometrium<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02212;24</xref></sup>. An oral non-estrogen alternative, ospemifene has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of dyspareunia in women with symptoms of VVA due to menopause. It has a half-life of 26 h and is metabolized by CYP450 enzymes to 4-hydroxyospemifene, its major metabolite. At a daily oral dose of 60 mg, ospemifene has shown efficacy in the treatment of VVA symptoms, such as dyspareunia, and was well tolerated in several short-term and long-term studies in postmenopausal women with or without a uterus<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02212;28</xref></sup>. This placebo-controlled study assessed the 12-month safety and efficacy on physiological changes of ospemifene 60 mg/day for the treatment of postmenopausal women with VVA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The protocol, amendments and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) before study initiation (NCT00566982). The study, conducted in 23 sites in Europe, was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000), current Good Clinical Practice outlined in the International Conference on Harmonization for Good Clinical Practice (E6), and in compliance with local regulatory requirements. All subjects provided written informed consent on IEC-approved forms before study initiation.</p><p>This was a 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study that compared ospemifene 60 mg/day vs. placebo in postmenopausal women (40&#x02013;80 years of age) with VVA, which was defined as having a proportion of superficial cells &#x02264; 5% in the vaginal smear and a vaginal pH &#x0003e; 5. Patient advertisement was used as an aid to recruit subjects. Subjects had to have an intact uterus and normal findings (except for atrophic vaginal signs) on pelvic examination, breast palpation and recent mammogram. Subjects were not enrolled based on symptoms (i.e. vaginal dryness or dyspareunia). Subjects were excluded if they had an abnormal endometrial histology other than atrophy based on baseline biopsy, uterine bleeding of unknown origin or clinically significant abnormal gynecological findings. Women were randomized in a 6 : 1 ratio to ospemifene or matching placebo by sequential allocation of randomization number. Randomization was stratified by study center. Study visits included baseline (screening/visit 1), week 12, week 26, week 39, week 52 (end of therapy or early discontinuation) and week 56 (4-week post-treatment follow-up). Ospemifene (or matching placebo) was taken orally each morning with food.</p><sec id="ss3"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>A summary of the safety assessments is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. Endometrial thickness was measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) at baseline (screening/visit 1) and at weeks 12, 26 and 52/end of therapy. For consistency of data, ultrasound images and videos were read at the central laboratory. Endometrial biopsies were collected at baseline and week 52 and at weeks 12 and 26 if TVU demonstrated endometrial thickness &#x02265; 4 mm.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Summary of safety and efficacy assessments (maturation index, vaginal pH, and visual evaluation).

If there was disagreement about the endometrial histology, a third pathologist evaluated the samples. The final diagnosis was determined by concurrence between two of the three independent pathologists or was reported as the most severe histopathological diagnosis if there was no agreement among the three pathologists. Histology was classified according to Blaustein's criteria<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Per regulatory agency guidance, endometrial polyps were to be fully characterized histologically. Sites were asked to locally confirm polyps identified by TVU because views of suspected polyps identified by TVU that were sent for central reading were limited compared to the real-time dynamic views available locally. If confirmed, the subject was to be discontinued and a hysteroscopy was performed to obtain tissue for histological diagnosis. In addition, when available, tissue thought to represent a uterine polyp was sent for expert review.</p><p>A mammogram was performed at baseline if it had not been performed within 3 months before randomization. Subjects were eligible for the study if the mammogram was negative. A mammogram was also performed at the week-52 visit. Mammograms were read locally by radiologists at each study center.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy assessments were changes from baseline to week 12 (last observation carried forward, LOCF) in the percentages of superficial cells and parabasal cells (maturation index, MI) and in vaginal pH in the vaginal smear sample. Only these objective measures of efficacy were assessed in this study.</p><p>Secondary efficacy assessments were changes from baseline at weeks 12, 26 and 52 or end of therapy for observed cases of visual evaluation of the vagina (petechiae, pallor, friability and dryness or redness in vaginal mucosa) and serum hormones (estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)) in addition to the percentages of superficial cells and parabasal cells in the MI and in vaginal pH.</p></sec><sec id="ss5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The sample size was planned for 350 subjects (50 subjects to be treated with placebo and 300 to be treated with ospemifene 60 mg daily) to be randomized. The number of subjects was based on regulatory requirements to collect sufficient endometrial safety data at 12 months such that the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma was established to be &#x0003c; 1% with an upper limit of the confidence interval &#x0003c; 4. The sample size was chosen to provide evidence of sustained efficacy for the primary efficacy endpoints.</p><p>A 6 : 1 randomization ratio was chosen to meet the regulatory requirements to collect endometrial safety in subjects who were exposed to ospemifene for 12 months, while the placebo subjects were enrolled to monitor overall safety.</p><p>The method of analysis for the primary efficacy data was analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment and center as fixed factors and the baseline value as the covariate. If the assumptions of ANCOVA were not met, Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel (CMH) statistics with rank scores were used. The LOCF was used for primary efficacy analyses; secondary efficacy analyses used the observed-cases approach. Visual examination of vaginal characteristics was analyzed using the CMH statistics with rank scores and center as the stratification factor at weeks 12, 26 and 52.</p><p>Safety data were reported on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects who had taken at least one dose of the study drug. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were tabulated by system organ class and preferred term according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, Version 10), causality and severity of event. Adverse events were classified as mild, moderate or severe. Baseline and time point assessments were summarized by descriptive statistics for clinical chemistry and laboratory safety variables. A one-sided 95% confidence interval (upper limit) was calculated to assess serious endometrial outcomes (endometrial hyperplasia and/or cancer).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss6"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Subjects in both treatment groups were comparable in demographic details including age, race and body mass index (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Subject demographic and baseline clinical characteristics (intent-to-treat population).

An estrogen agonist/antagonist compound, ospemifene exerts stimulatory action on the vaginal epithelial tissue with minimal effect on endometrial tissue. These tissue-selective effects are consistent with other studies of ospemifene. In addition to the FDA approval of ospemifene, a non-estrogen alternative for the treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia due to VVA in postmenopausal women, these findings further support the potential of oral ospemifene for the overall treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank the study investigators and site staff for their participation in the study, including Anna-Maija Antila, Suomen Terveystalo, Tampere, Finland; Jan Blaak&#x000e6;r, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus N, Denmark; Marc Dhont, University Hospital of Gent, Gent, Belgium; Gilbert Donders, Heilig Hart Hospital Campus Mari&#x000eb;ndal, Tienen, Belgium; Agneta Ehrenborg, Qvinnolivet &#x02013; Specialistl&#x000e4;karna Kungsbacka S&#x000f6;dra, Kungsbacka, Sweden; Risto Erkkola, Turun Gynekologikeskus, Turku, Finland; Jorma Heikkinen, ODL Terveys Oy/Osteoporoosiklinikka, Oulu, and Suomen Terveystalo/L&#x000e4;nsi-Pohjan L&#x000e4;&#x000e4;k&#x000e4;rikeskus, Kemi, Finland; Astrid H&#x000f8;jgaard, Regionshospitalet i Randers, Randers, Denmark; Dirk Janssens, Gynaecologische Dienst, Turnhout, Belgium; Liisa Karinen, L&#x000e4;&#x000e4;k&#x000e4;rikeskus Gyneko Oy, Oulu, Finland; Philippe R.
