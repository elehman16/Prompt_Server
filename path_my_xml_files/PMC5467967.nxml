Since the time of discharge usually depends on walking ability, patients who start walking sooner can be discharged more quickly.</p><p>The hybrid assistive limb (HAL) is an exoskeletal robot suit developed in 1992 to provide the wearer with physical support during daily activities and heavy labor.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The HAL for the lower limbs was developed as a gait assistance system for individuals with difficulty in standing up, sitting down, and climbing stairs.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The HAL has two modes: a voluntary control mode and an automatic control mode. In the voluntary control mode, the suit provides support for physical activities based on weak bioelectric signals generated when the wearer makes a voluntary movement.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> These bioelectric potentials are detected by electrodes attached to the surface of the skin. In most cases, the electrodes are attached to the quadriceps femoris and gluteus maximus muscles in the area around the hip joint and the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris in the area around the knee. The assistive force generated by the HAL power unit is calculated based on the bioelectric potentials generated by the muscles. This approach is used to support and control movements.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> In the voluntary control mode, the HAL provides functional support for multiple joints of both legs simultaneously, which makes it suitable for use by individuals with leg disabilities as well as healthy individuals.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Accordingly, HAL training, which utilizes the wearer&#x02019;s own muscle activity, could enhance the feedback for inducing appropriate movements better than standard robotic training.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p>One study (a randomized controlled trial) assessed the use of the HAL in rehabilitation for improving locomotion in the recovery phase after cerebral stroke,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and several reports have documented its use in rehabilitation of patients with cerebral stroke and spinal cord injury to promote gait improvements.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> However, to our knowledge, there have been few reports on the use of HAL in rehabilitation after TKA only, both in terms of pilot studies<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and case reports.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>We hypothesized that, in addition to the effects demonstrated in previous studies, the HAL may also be useful for facilitating the recovery of leg function and gait function in patients after TKA. To test this hypothesis, we decided to assess the rate of change in walking speed rather than walking speed alone since the latter varies widely depending on the baseline values. In the present randomized controlled trial, we aimed to verify whether the HAL can be used in rehabilitation after TKA to promote functional recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section6-2050312117712888"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section7-2050312117712888"><title>Participants</title><p>All patients underwent primary TKA for knee OA at JR Tokyo General Hospital between September 2014 and August 2015.

The outcome measures were evaluated prior to surgery and on postoperative weeks 1, 2, and 3. The primary outcome measure was walking speed. For the assessment of walking speed, patients walked 10&#x02009;m on the ground at a comfortable speed. The secondary outcome measures included quadriceps strength and knee pain assessed using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Isometric contraction quadriceps strength of knee extension was measured used a hand-held dynamometer (&#x000b5;tas F-1). A pressure sensor was fixed to the belt worn around the ankle to record the maximum power. The maximum value from three trials was used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="section13-2050312117712888"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To ensure balanced randomization, we tested the differences between the HAL and conventional groups at baseline using the Fisher exact test for sex and unpaired t-tests for age, height, weight, body mass index (BMI), walking speed, and quadriceps strength. The primary outcome was the difference in the change of walking speed between the two groups between week 1 and week 2 or 3, which was assessed by a paired t-test. The change ratio was calculated using the following formula: ([follow-up]&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;[week 1])/[week 1])&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100.

We found that, compared to conventional rehabilitation, the use of the HAL during early rehabilitation after TKA efficiently improved locomotion and quadriceps femoris strength, while reducing pain.</p><p>In this study, walking speed was used as a measure of postoperative recovery. Walking speed has a low failure rate (&#x0003c;5%) in the elderly<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> and is a highly reliable indicator, with an intra-session correlation coefficient of 0.90&#x02013;0.98 and an inter-session correlation coefficient of 0.78&#x02013;0.94 among patients with knee OA.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Changes in comfortable walking speed reflect the ability to respond to conditions that occur during environmental changes and when crossing intersections and avoiding obstacles.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Moreover, walking speed has been found to be correlated with other indicators such as the Berg Balance Scale score<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and timed up and go (TUG) test results,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> both of which reflect the balance function. In a study by Cress et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> conducted in 200 elderly residents of a nursing home, walking speed was an independent factor reflecting physical function.</p><p>The change in walking speed after TKA is also considered an indicator of the effectiveness of rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> A study of post-discharge walking speed in 57 patients with knee OA who underwent initial TKA found that the mean post-discharge 10-m walking speed was 0.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.2&#x02009;m/s.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In general, the walking speed<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and TUG test results<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> decrease temporarily after discharge following TKA, followed by recovery over several months and improvement beyond the preoperative levels.</p><p>In this study, the rate of change in walking speed between weeks 1 and 2 after TKA was significantly better in patients who underwent rehabilitation with the HAL. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the rate of change in walking speed between postoperative weeks 1 and 3. These results suggest that the use of the HAL in rehabilitation after TKA is particularly valuable during the early part of the postoperative recovery phase, with the difference between HAL and conventional rehabilitation diminishing over time.</p><p>It was found that 44.4% of patients experience persistent severe pain 1&#x02009;month after TKA.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Pain affects functional recovery after TKA as it restricts walking and reduces walking speed. We used the NRS as a pain measure. A significantly greater number of patients who did not use the HAL had a high pain NRS score (&#x02265;6) at 1&#x02009;week postoperatively. However, there was no difference in the NRS scores between the two groups at 2&#x02009;weeks and 3&#x02009;weeks postoperatively, and the scores exhibited improvement over time in both groups. This suggests that the use of the HAL during the early postoperative period reduced pain during rehabilitation. This might have a beneficial effect on the recovery of walking speed.</p><p>The mechanism through which the use of the HAL improves gait function after TKA remains unclear. Quadriceps arthrogenic muscle inhibition (QAMI) may be one reason for the effectiveness of rehabilitation after TKA. QAMI is the phenomenon of inhibition of the quadriceps femoris muscle after surgery.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> It is believed to result from pain or swelling of the knee or damage to pressure receptors<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and may also occur because of swelling of the knee alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> At present, the suggested mechanisms for QAMI include possible inhibition of &#x003b1; motor neurons via the spinal reflex<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and involvement of pathways engaging upper motor neurons.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Concentrated repetition of specific tasks is also known to induce neural plasticity and promote functional recovery from paralysis following stroke or spinal cord damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="bibr28-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr29-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr30-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr31-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In this study, the rates of change in quadriceps strength between postoperative weeks 1 and 2 and between postoperative weeks 1 and 3 were significantly different between the two groups. These results suggest that the knee could be affected by the QAMI phenomenon after TKA, and the effectiveness of repeating specific tasks in combination with the feedback provided by the use of the HAL might promote neural plasticity, thus improving quadriceps function and enabling the recovery of gait function during the early recovery phase.</p></sec><sec id="section16-2050312117712888"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has certain limitations. First, fitting the HAL requires considerable time and effort, and adjustments are needed in the sites of attachment of the electrodes and settings such as the assistance level. Therefore, the level of familiarity of the physiotherapists with the HAL may have affected the results.</p><p>The second limitation concerns the device itself. The HAL used in this study was designed as an assistive device for both legs. To adapt the system for functional recovery after TKA, a model wore the HAL on only one leg, which reduced the weight of the device and allowed freedom of movement of the unaffected leg, thus increasing its efficiency.</p><p>The third limitation originates from the unique medical insurance system, in which medical procedures from surgery to discharge are fully covered. This study showed only that using the HAL facilitated functional recovery of patients after TKA. There is a possibility that early functional recovery after TKA promoted by the use of the HAL reduced the hospitalization time. The latter effect would be limited to Japan, where hospital stay is longer than in Western countries.</p><p>Furthermore, it was reported by Husted that fast-track knee arthroplasty has low morbidity and mortality, as well as high patient satisfaction.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2050312117712888" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Considering the short hospitalization period for fast-track knee arthroplasty in Western countries, using the HAL will not shorten the length of hospital stay. In Japan, the discharge conditions are much stricter than those in Western countries (i.e. more than 1&#x02009;m/s on 10-min walk test, visual analog scale &#x0003c;3). Thus, using the HAL can be feasible in Japanese patients given the longer hospital stay.</p></sec><sec id="section17-2050312117712888"><title>Clinical messages</title><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-2050312117712888"><list-item><p>This is the first randomized controlled trial of the use of the HAL for rehabilitation after TKA.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The use of the HAL during early rehabilitation after TKA efficiently improved locomotion and reduced pain compared to conventional rehabilitation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>It is necessary to improve the device by adapting it for use after TKA.</p></list-item></list></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical approval:</bold> The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the JR Tokyo General Hospital (No. H26-06).</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Informed consent:</bold> All patients provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Trial registration information:</bold> Trial registration number: UMIN000014974; date of registration: 8 September 2014; date of enrollment of the first participant in the trial: 20 November 2014.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2050312117712888"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
