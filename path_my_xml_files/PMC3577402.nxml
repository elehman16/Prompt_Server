It can lead to hip and spine fractures later in life. According to the National Osteoporosis Association of America in 1999, 28.5 million people in the USA, of whom 89% were women, had osteoporosis. In addition, 10 million people in the US were categorized as having low bone mass, exposing them to the risk of osteoporosis and osteopenia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] There are no specific statistics in Iran about the prevalence of osteopenia, osteoporosis, and related fractures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, Larijani, in a 2005 study of osteoporosis rates in Iran, reported an estimated 7 million of the 70 million people in Iran to be at risk for fractures. In addition, the Research Center for Endocrinology and Metabolism of the Tehran University reported that in the subgroup of people who are more than 50 years old, 70% of the women and 50% of the men are suffering from osteoporosis or osteopenia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Since bone density decreases with age, special consideration should be given to preventing this disease. Prevention of osteoporosis can be implemented at any age. However, because 40&#x02013;45% of the bone mass develops in early adulthood, prevention is most effective if done in childhood and adolescence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In addition, if people develop and commit to lifestyles that support strong bones when they are adolescents or young adults, they increase the likelihood that they will have healthy bones throughout their lives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Measures such as high-calcium diet and exercise among adolescents have been very effective in preventing osteoporosis, particularly among women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] However, helping young people develop a healthy lifestyle is a major challenge.</p><p>The Health Belief Model (HBM) is one of the most widely used frameworks for trying to understand health behavior. Developed in the 1950s by Godfrey Hochbaum,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Irwin Rosenstock,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and Rosenstock and Kirscht,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] the model has been used successfully for many decades to promote health behaviors such as seat belt use and the use of health screening.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] HBM is based on the premise that people are most likely to take health-related action (e.g., eat a healthy diet) if they feel that by doing so they can avoid a negative health condition. The model asserts that to plan a successful educational intervention, the individual or group's perceived susceptibility (e.g., to osteoporosis), perceived severity of the condition and its consequences, perceived benefits in taking certain actions to reduce risk, perceived barriers (e.g., costs of the advised action), and cues to action (strategies for activating the &#x0201c;readiness&#x0201d; to undertake health actions) are required. HBM is based on the domains of perceived susceptibility (to disease), perceived severity, perceived threat, perceived barriers, perceived benefits, cues to action, and health action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Familiarity to all of these factors is believed to be vital to the planning process for successful educational interventions [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The HBM framework was developed in the 1950s by Hochbaum (1958 and 1992), and Rosenstock (1974 and 1991) as a model for health educators. Use of this model has resulted in effective programs in which individuals experienced changes in beliefs that led to an increase in healthy behaviors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] This paper describes the results of a study that examines whether the application of the HBM can be used effectively to change the perception of middle school girls about their risk for developing osteoporosis and lead to a change in behavior for prevention of this disease later in life.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Theoretical model of relationships using the health belief model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-1-14-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was an experimental intervention study, the research population being 130 second grade middle school girl students who were randomly divided into groups, experimental (66) and controls (64). Sampling method in this research was multistage: From 5 districts in Isfahan, District 3 was selected districts in Isfahan was 5 and District 3 was selected by simple random sampling for study. The samples were selected from two schools by random sampling. The data gathering instrument was a three-part questionnaire; one part was used to obtain the demographic characteristics of the participants; the second part was a standard questionnaire which was HBM based that included: Knowledge (&#x003b1;=0/55), perceived threat [perceived susceptibility (&#x003b1;=0/78) and perceived severity (&#x003b1;=0/80)], benefits of calcium intake (&#x003b1;=0/77), barriers of calcium intake (&#x003b1;=0/70),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and healthy behavior action for osteoporosis prevention; and the third part was an FFQ questionnaire.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>To ensure clarity, pilot testing of the questionnaire was also performed using the coherence and consistency upon 30 students who were not included in the survey. Then, the questionnaire was modified based on their feedback. Education as an intervention factor was performed using lecturing and group discussion, brainstorming methods for girl students in four sessions (45&#x02013;60 minutes), in the experimental group.</p><p>The standard questionnaire based on HBM was completed three times (pre-intervention, post-intervention, and two-month follow-up); also, FFQ questionnaire was completed two times (pre-intervention and two-month follow-up) by students to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational interventional program. The students were informed that all data obtained from the questionnaires were to be used without personal identifiers and were, therefore, confidential.</p><p>SPSS 18 software was used to analyze the data. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM ANOVA), paired and independent-sample t-test were used to identify differences among the groups, pre- and post-test as well as for comparing variables such as knowledge, perceived susceptibility and severity, perceived benefits and barriers, and taking health action of two groups in pre-, post-, and follow-up in each group (with the level of 95% confidence).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, 130 middle school female students from Isfahan fully cooperated with the researchers. <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> compares the two groups&#x02019; mean scores in knowledge and in the HBM domains of perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits, immediately before, immediately after, and 2 months after the intervention.

The results of the study showed that prior to the intervention, all elements of the HBM were below average in the two groups. After the intervention, students in the experimental group showed significant improvement in the behavior assessed and students in the control group showed a slight improvement in this behavior. This supports our hypothesis that a health education program based on the HBM can be effective in promoting the adoption of behaviors by adolescent girls to prevent osteoporosis. Studies have identified several basic educational needs in participants, which increase their knowledge and change their intention for promoting preventive behaviors about osteoporosis. It was shown that the awareness of individuals about osteoporosis was low (35.80). Increasing the participants&#x02019; awareness on the need for osteoporosis prevention through educational campaigns is likely to improve the participants&#x02019; intention in healthy behavior (calcium intake). The awareness of individuals about osteoporosis significantly increased after intervention in the experimental group. The findings of this study are consistent with the observation of Gammage, who carried out a study on osteoporosis health beliefs and knowledge in college students,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and the findings of Brecher's study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The increase in awareness in this study is also consistent with the finding of Abbasi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and Hazavehei <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] the researches who observed the change and improvement in function of women.</p><p>Our findings showed that perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits about osteoporosis of participants were significantly increased after intervention in the experimental group. The results of our study about perceived susceptibility, severity, barriers, and benefits about osteoporosis are consistent with the findings of studies conducted by Brecher[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and Hazavehei <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>Mean scores on calcium intake of the experimental group were significant before and after intervention (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Many young females from a variety of cultures have low calcium intake.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] We used all components of HBM (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers) in order to better understand how the components influence the process of changing behavior to prevent disease and how educational interventions can influence each of these components. As a result of this study, we postulate that all components of the HBM are equally essential in inducing behavior change. It is paradoxical that as health researchers and educators become increasingly aware of the importance of good habits in nutrition in the prevention of a variety of chronic diseases, children and adolescents are adopting lifestyles that act counter to these. Diets in many developing as well as industrialized countries are moving toward foods that are poor in calcium and minerals. In order to reverse this trend, it is necessary to actively promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles to adolescents. School health education programs are critical opportunities for facilitating healthy lifestyles for youth. The HBM is one approach to school health education that is effective in producing at least short-term behavior changes in order to prevent osteoporosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The authors wish to express their thanks to all the students who participated in the present research and Deputy of Research in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mark</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Link</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reducing osteoporosis: Prevention during childhood and adolescence</article-title><source>Bull World Health Organ</source><year>1999</year><volume>77</volume><fpage>423</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10361760</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>National Osteoporosis Foundation</article-title><year>2006</year><date-in-citation>Last retrieved 2007 Feb 25</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
