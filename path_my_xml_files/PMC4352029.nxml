Recently, needles with the potential for double-blinding were developed, so we tested if acupuncture can be double-blinded in a randomized study of sixty-seven patients with acute pain &#x02265; 3 (0-10 scale following third molar removal) who received active acupuncture with a penetrating needle or placebo acupuncture with a non-penetrating needle. To test if acupuncture was administered double-blind, patients and acupuncturists were asked about perceived treatment allocation at the end of the study. To test if there were clues which led to identification of the treatment, deep dull pain associated with needle application and rotation (termed &#x0201c;<italic>de qi</italic>&#x0201d; in East Asian medicine), and patients&#x02019; pain levels were assessed. Perceived treatment allocation depended on actual group allocation (p &#x0003c; 0.015) for both patients and acupuncturists, indicating that the needles were not successful in double-blinding. Up to 68% of patients and 83% of acupuncturists correctly identified the treatment, but for patients the distribution was not far from 50/50. Also, there was a significant interaction between actual or perceived treatment and the experience of <italic>de qi</italic> (p = 0.027), suggesting that the experience of <italic>de qi</italic> and possible non-verbal clues contributed to correct identification of the treatment. Yet, of the patients who perceived the treatment as active or placebo, 50% and 23%, respectively, reported <italic>de qi</italic>. Patients&#x02019; acute pain levels did not influence the perceived treatment. In conclusion, acupuncture treatment was not fully double-blinded which is similar to observations in pharmacological studies. Still, the non-penetrating needle is the only needle that allows some degree of practitioner blinding. The study raises questions about alternatives to double-blind randomized clinical trials in the assessment of acupuncture treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Lene Vase is part of the Europain Collaboration, which has received support from the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking, under grant agreement no. 115007, the resources of which are composed of financial contribution from the European Union&#x02019;s Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007&#x02013;2013) and EFPIA companies&#x02019; kind contribution, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imi.europa.eu">www.imi.europa.eu</ext-link>.

However, most studies do not report the success of blinding, and even fewer studies apply adequate tests for double-blinding [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], thereby hampering the validity of the trial and questioning the inferred conclusions. Furthermore, a systematic review has indicated that blinding is reported less often in non-pharmacological than pharmacological pain trials, even when blinding was judged feasible, which non-pharmacological trials were less often [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Several attempts have been made to conduct blinded, randomized clinical trials of the often used non-pharmacological treatment acupuncture [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, most types of placebo acupuncture cannot be blinded for the acupuncturist [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], so double-blinding has been difficult. Lately, active and placebo acupuncture needles that appear to have the potential to be double-blinded have been developed. In short, the penetrating needle used for active acupuncture penetrates the skin, whereas the matched non-penetrating needle used for placebo acupuncture only presses against the skin without penetration. Previous studies have shown that healthy volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and in most instances also experienced acupuncturists [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], were unable to correctly identify penetrating from non-penetrating needles. Still, so far no randomized clinical trial involving patients has been conducted to systematically investigate if acupuncture treatment can be double-blinded.</p><p>To test if treatments are double-blinded, it is important to directly ask both the patient and the healthcare provider, in this case the acupuncturist, if they can identify the treatment allocation [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Also, it is helpful to assess if there are clues that may help the patient and the acupuncturist to identify the treatment allocation correctly [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. <italic>De qi</italic> is the Chinese expression for describing the sensation of acupuncture needling and includes feelings of distention, heaviness, tingling, numbness, or deep dull pain associated with the needle application and rotation [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, both the patient and the practitioner may experience <italic>de qi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Typically, the acupuncturist would perceive <italic>de qi</italic> as heaviness or tenseness about the needle he or she is stimulating, and the patient would perceive <italic>de qi</italic> as soreness, numbness, heaviness, and distention at the site of the needle placement in response to being punctured, although these sensations may spread to other parts of the body as well [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. <italic>De qi</italic> has been related to efficacy and may therefore influence the perception of whether active or placebo acupuncture is given [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Also, in a clinical trial setting, the patients&#x02019; experience of pain and possibly their expression of pain could influence their perception of the treatment allocation [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, it seems relevant to assess these two factors.</p><p>As part of a recently published randomized clinical trial [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], patients who had undergone surgical removal of mandibular third molars received active acupuncture with a penetrating needle or placebo acupuncture with a non-penetrating needle.

In the larger trial, 101 patients who developed pain of &#x02265; 3 on a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0&#x02013;10) after third molar surgery were randomized to receive active acupuncture (penetrating needles), placebo acupuncture (non-penetrating needles), or no treatment for 30 minutes. The patients&#x02019; perception of the treatment (active or placebo) and expected pain levels (VAS) were assessed before and halfway through the treatment. Looking at the actual treatment allocation, there was no specific effect of active acupuncture (difference in pain levels between active and placebo acupuncture; p = 0.240), but there was a large and significant non-specific effect of placebo acupuncture (difference in pain levels between placebo acupuncture and no treatment; p &#x0003c;0.001). Interestingly, however, looking at perceived treatment allocation, there was a significant effect of acupuncture (difference in pain levels between perceived active and perceived placebo acupuncture p &#x0003c;0.001), indicating that patients who believed they received active acupuncture had significantly lower pain levels than those who believed they received placebo acupuncture.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Patients and Surgical Treatment</title><p>Seventy patients who were referred for surgical removal of one mandibular third molar at the Section of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Oral Pathology, Department of Dentistry, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark, from September 2008 to July 2009 participated in the study. Only 67 of the 101 patients included in the larger trial were eligible for the current study, since it did not include a no-treatment condition.</p><p>In order to be included in the study, the patients had to have pain &#x02265; 3 on a mechanical visual analog scale (M-VAS, 0&#x02013;10) 4 hours after surgery [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], be &#x02265; 18 years of age and in good health defined as risk groups I (normal healthy patients), II (patients with mild systemic disease), or III (patients with severe systemic disease that is not incapacitating) according to the American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The indications for surgical removal of one semi-impacted mandibular third molar involving bone removal were: 1) recurring episodes of pericoronitis (&#x02265; 2 episodes), 2) caries or resorption of the second molar (distal surface), 3) unrestorable caries of the third molar, 4) progressive periodontitis of the second molar (distal surface) or third molar, or 5) other pathologic conditions related to the third molar.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they 1) had previous experience with acupuncture, 2) experienced pain below 3 (M-VAS, 0&#x02013;10) 4 hours after surgery as a VAS score of 3 is considered the demarcation between mild (&#x0003c; 3) and moderate pain (&#x0003e; 3) [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 3) had to take rescue medication during the study period, 4) had a pain disorder that might interfere with the measurement of pain, 5) were medicated 24 hours before the experiment, 6) were pregnant or breastfeeding, or 7) suffered from medical or psychiatric disorders that prevented them from participating in the study.</p><p>Prior to surgery, the patients received local analgesia with lidocaine (20 mg/ml) with adrenaline (12.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) (Xyloplyin Dental Adrenalin, Dentsply, Surrey, England). The standard dose was 2 ml for the inferior alveolar and lingual nerves, 1 ml for the buccal nerve, and 1 ml for infiltration buccally. If necessary, additional local analgesia was provided during the surgical procedure and the amount (ml) of additional analgesia was registered. The third molar was removed using a standardized surgical approach. In brief, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap was elevated, and buccal/distal bone was removed with a burr under sterile saline irrigation. The tooth was removed in one piece or several pieces after sectioning with a burr, also under sterile saline irrigation. Inflammatory tissue and sharp bony edges were removed before meticulous irrigation of the socket and the operation field. Finally, the flap was repositioned and sutured using 2&#x02013;3 resorbable sutures (Vicryl 4&#x02013;0, Ethicon, Norderstedt, Germany). Most teeth (96%) were removed by dental students under the supervision of oral and maxillofacial surgeons or dentists with special training in oral surgery. Few teeth (4%) were removed by oral and maxillofacial surgeons or dentists with special training in oral surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>All patients received oral and written information about the study and gave signed informed consent.

The acupuncturists performed acupuncture according to the Chinese tradition where needle rotation is considered a central part of the acupuncture, as this is the standard procedure in Denmark. Prior to the study, the acupuncturists, the research assistant (SB), and the principal investigator (LV) met to agree on and practice standardized ways of interacting with the patients [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Inspired by Kaptchuk and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], each interaction was structured according to content (3 points) and style (5 points). Content included a presentation of the acupuncturist including his/her experience with acupuncture as well as questions concerning the patients&#x02019; current symptoms and previous experiences with dental pain. Style included a warm friendly manner, active listening, expression of empathy, thought, and full silence while feeling the pulse and communication of confidence and positive expectation (&#x0201c;acupuncture has been shown to reduce dental pain&#x0201d;).

In specific, patients were able to correctly identify 61% and 68% of active and placebo acupuncture, respectively, whereas acupuncturists were able to correctly identify 83% and 81% of active and placebo acupuncture, respectively (Tables <xref rid="pone.0119612.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0119612.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). It should be noted, however, that especially for patients these percentages are not far from a 50/50 distribution. These findings are in line with pharmacological studies testing double blindness in clinical trials involving pain patients [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>To give an example, Turner and colleagues investigated if spinal cord injury patients and their study nurses/physicians were able to identify active pharmacological treatment (amiptriptyline) vs. active placebo (benztropine which gives similar side effects) by asking them to identify treatment allocation at the end of the trial [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In line with our results, this study found that approximately two-thirds of patients and three-fourths of study nurses/physicians were able to correctly identify treatment allocation. In specific, patients were able to correctly identify 70% and 55% of active and placebo treatments, respectively, whereas the study nurses/physicians were able to correctly identify 73% and 75% of active and placebo treatment, respectively. Turner and colleagues point out that the percentage of correct identification in their study was lower than in the studies typically reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is most likely due to the use of active placebos that induced side effects similar to the active treatment, which made it more difficult to distinguish between active and placebo treatment. Our study may also be seen as using an active placebo in so far as the non-penetrating needles give a sensation of the needle and may elicit <italic>de qi</italic> similar to the active treatment. The reason why the acupuncturists were slightly better than the study nurses/physicians to identify the treatment may be that needle handling gives more direct clues than pill administration.</p><p>In our study as well as in the study by Turner et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], there was no significant difference in the level of confidence when identifying active vs. placebo treatment, which suggests that patients and healthcare providers find it equally easy or difficult to identify active and placebo treatments. Noteworthy, both our study and the study by Turner et al. were part of a larger study testing the efficacy of active acupuncture and amitriptyline, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In these studies, the active treatments were not significantly more effective than the placebo treatments. Hence, although the blinding was not optimal in these studies, it did not lead to a statistically significant preference of the active over the placebo treatment. It is especially relevant to note that in the larger trial from which the current data are obtained [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], active acupuncture did not significantly reduce pain levels compared with placebo acupuncture when looking at the actual treatment allocation. Yet, looking at patients&#x02019; perceived treatment allocation, active acupuncture did significantly reduce pain levels (cf. the short summery of the trial at pages 4 and 5). Thus, although the results of the current study showed that the needles were not fully double-blinded, the patients&#x02019; perception of the treatment influenced the clinical treatment outcome (i.e. pain reduction) to a higher extent than the actual treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Clues to Perception of Treatment Allocation</title><p>In order to understand some of the factors which could contribute to correct treatment identification, <italic>de qi</italic> and pain levels were assessed.

In addition, a significant association between actual and perceived treatment allocation was found, indicating that clues in the actual treatment condition, not identified in our study, contributed to breaking the blinding besides the experience of <italic>de qi</italic>.</p><p>It may be considered controversial whether acupuncturists can experience <italic>de qi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Traditionally, <italic>de qi</italic> refers to the excitation of <italic>qi</italic> According to Traditional Chinese Medicine, both the administering acupuncturist and the patient may be able to detect signs of <italic>de qi</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In recent years, however, researchers have put more weight on the patients&#x02019; rather than the acupuncturist&#x02019; experience during needling, which may at least in part be due to new types of acupuncture, e.g. electro-acupuncture, where the stimulation is not delivered manually by the acupuncturist [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hence, it is well-known from the literature and clinical practice that both patients and acupuncturists may experience <italic>de qi</italic>. It is important to note that in our study the patients and the acupuncturist were not aware of each other&#x02019;s evaluation of whether <italic>de qi</italic> was experienced or not.</p><p>It can be speculated that the relationship between <italic>de qi</italic> and perceived treatment allocation is circular. Hence by telling patients about <italic>de qi</italic> one may influence whether they experience <italic>de qi</italic> and the patients who experience <italic>de qi</italic> may automatically assume that they have received active acupuncture. However, it is important to note that in the current study patients were not given verbal suggestions to the effect that they would experience <italic>de qi</italic>. They were simply informed about <italic>de qi</italic> and asked in a neutral manner whether they experienced <italic>de qi</italic> or not. To ask patients about <italic>de qi</italic> is the standard practice in randomized clinical trials of acupuncture [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Yet, in the current study it was found that 50% of the patients who perceived the treatment as active acupuncture reported <italic>de qi</italic> and 23% of the patients who perceived the treatment as placebo acupuncture reported <italic>de qi</italic>. Thus, it does not appear that all the patients&#x02019; who experienced <italic>de qi</italic> automatically assumed that they received active acupuncture. Still, given the current design it is difficult to deduce to which extent the experience of <italic>de qi</italic> is influenced by the verbal suggestions related to the description of <italic>de qi</italic> and to which extent it is influenced by needle application. Hence, it is important to be aware that both factors may influence patients reported experience of <italic>de qi</italic>.</p><p>Importantly, not only <italic>de qi</italic> contributed to breaking the blinding. It is possible that subtle non-verbal cues transmitted from the acupuncturist to the patients could play an important role as well or even underlie the findings related to <italic>de qi</italic>. Gracely and colleagues have shown that clinicians&#x02019; knowledge of the range of possible treatments (placebo or naloxone versus placebo or naloxone or fentanyl) may be transmitted to the patients in conventional double-blind studies, presumably in subtle non-verbal ways [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. It is possible that a similar phenomenon is taking place in the current study. Hence, during needle application, acupuncturists may be able to correctly identify treatment allocation, possibly due to extensive manipulation of the needle (see below), and this perception may be transmitted to patients in subtle non-verbal ways, thereby leading them to correctly identify treatment allocation. This hypothesis is in agreement with the finding that acupuncturists to a higher extent than patients correctly identified treatment allocation, although more subtle research designs are necessary to explore this further.</p><p>In so far as the questions concerning perceived treatment allocation were posed at the end of the session as it is often done in test of double blindness [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], it could be speculated that patients&#x02019; perception of treatment allocation was influenced by the experience of acute pain [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In other words, patients who had high levels of acute pain at the end of the session perceived the treatment as placebo acupuncture, whereas patients who had low levels of acute pain perceived the treatment as active acupuncture. This possibility was tested, but there was no association between patients&#x02019; level of acute pain and perceived treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Penetrating and Non-Penetrating Needles</title><p>The finding that the penetrating and non-penetrating needles were not fully blinded in the current study is in contrast to previous studies using these needles [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The different findings may be explained by methodological differences. In the previous studies, acupuncturists typically administered combinations of penetrating/penetrating, penetrating/non-penetrating and non-penetrating/non-penetrating into a single acupuncture point (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]), whereas in the present study acupuncturists administered the same needles, e.g. 5 penetrating or 5 non-penetrating needles, into 5 different acupuncture points, respectively. Also, in the previous studies, acupuncturists were able to report whether they believed the needle was penetrating, non-penetrating, or unidentified (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]), but in our study they were forced to choose between penetrating or non-penetrating needles and subsequently rate their level of confidence in the assessment. Importantly, our study involved patients as opposed to healthy volunteers and the acupuncture treatment was performed according to the Chinese tradition of acupuncture in which needle manipulation during needle insertion is a central element, which is not the case in Japanese acupuncture [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], in which the needles are developed and previously tested [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Hence, the more extensive manipulation of the needles in our study (rotation at the beginning, halfway through, and the end of the study as well as insertion into several points) may have contributed to the reported experience of <italic>de qi</italic> and thereby to the breaking of the double-blinding. Thus, the results may not only reflect the ability to blind acupuncture treatment but also the influence of different cultures style on acupuncture [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and it would therefore be relevant to test the needles in a randomized clinical trial performed within Japanese style of acupuncture.</p><p>Still, although the needles were not fully double-blinded, approximately one-third of the patients and nearly one-fifth of the acupuncturists were not able to correctly identify treatment allocation (<xref rid="pone.0119612.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In most studies, sham acupuncture is performed by superficial needling at non-acupuncture points (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]), by penetrating needling at non-acupuncture points (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]), or by placebo needles (e.g. [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]) that are identifiable to the acupuncturist [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hence, the penetrating and non-penetrating needles are so far the only needles that allow for some degree of practitioner blinding. Knowing which treatment is administered is probably not the same as identifying treatment allocation correctly at the end of a trial [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], so the possibility of applying a needle that can be blinded to some extent is likely to improve the validity of a study.</p></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Conclusion and Future Directions</title><p>It is difficult to fully double-blind both non-pharmacological treatments like acupuncture and pharmacological treatments. As the breaking of the double-blinding may hamper the conclusions that can be drawn from studies, it is important to pay attention to this issue [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As long as double blinding is not a reality, it is possible that, for example, acupuncture studies will find differences between active and placebo treatments that may erroneously be interpreted as an effect of the active treatment, which is in reality a non-specific placebo effect. Different strategies for improving double-blinding have been attempted, but our study shows that new approaches are needed. Although more advanced placebos that could improve the double-blinding may be developed, it may also be helpful to think about new approaches. Both expectations and emotional feelings have been shown to account for large amounts of the variance in placebo effect in acupuncture and pharmacological treatments [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], so an additional strategy may also be to assess the placebo component of treatments via these factors [<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119612.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Still, until new strategies have been developed, it seems warranted to always ask patients and acupuncturists/healthcare providers to identify treatment allocation in order to understand to which extent unblinding may have contributed to the obtained results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Professor Michael V&#x000e6;th and Associate Professor Bo Sommerlund for helpful discussions of statistical issues and secretaries Helle O.
