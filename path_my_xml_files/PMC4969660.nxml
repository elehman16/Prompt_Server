This research is designed to investigate the potentially protective effects of two separate exercise strategies against loss in skeletal muscle function and size, and other key indices of health, following 14&#x000a0;days of reduced physical activity in older men.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three groups of 10 older men (aged 65&#x02013;80 years) will undertake 2&#x000a0;weeks of reduced activity by decreasing daily steps from more than 3500 to less than 1500 (using pedometers to record step count). Two of the three groups will then undertake additional exercise interventions, either: 4&#x000a0;weeks of progressive resistance training prior to the step-reduction intervention (PT-group), or home-based &#x02018;exercise snacking&#x02019; three times per day during the step-reduction intervention (ES-group). The third group undertaking only the step-reduction intervention (control) will provide a comparison against which to assess the effectiveness of the protective exercise strategies. Pre and post&#x000a0;step-reduction assessments of muscle function, standing balance, anthropometry and muscle architecture will be taken. Pre and post step-reduction in postprandial metabolic control, resting systemic inflammation, adipose inflammation, oxidative stress, immune function, sleep quality, dietary habits, and quality of life will be measured. The stress response to exercise, and signalling protein and gene expression for muscle protein synthesis and breakdown following an acute bout of exercise will also be assessed pre and post step-reduction. Rates of muscle protein synthesis and adipose triglyceride turnover during the step-reduction intervention will be measured using stable isotope methodology. All participants will then undertake 2&#x000a0;weeks of supervised resistance training with the aim of regaining any deficit from baseline in muscle function and size.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aims to identify exercise strategies that could be implemented to protect against loss of muscle power during 2&#x000a0;weeks of reduced activity in older men, and to improve understanding of the way in which a short-term reduction in physical activity impacts upon muscle function and health.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02495727?term=reduced+physical+activity&#x00026;rank=2">NCT02495727</ext-link> (Initial registration: 25 June 2015)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Reduced activity</kwd><kwd>Step-reduction</kwd><kwd>Muscle</kwd><kwd>Strength</kwd><kwd>Atrophy</kwd><kwd>Inactivity</kwd><kwd>Resistance exercise</kwd><kwd>Recovery</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000835</institution-id><institution>University of Bath</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perkin</surname><given-names>Oliver J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The ageing process is accompanied by a progressive loss of muscle size and strength, and data from longitudinal studies suggests that muscle size is lost at 0.5&#x02013;1&#x000a0;% per year after the age of 50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With ageing, muscle strength is lost two to five times more rapidly than would be expected based on the rate of muscle mass loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and at twice the rate in the legs compared to the upper body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Muscle power is the product of force and velocity of movement, and it is evident that power decreases with age to an even greater extent than strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Power provides an indication of the neuromuscular component of muscle function and thus is considered to be a better predictor of functional status than muscle mass or strength alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Frailty is largely caused by this loss of muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], eventually resulting in the tasks of daily living becoming too physically strenuous to be managed safely, and independent living becoming untenable.</p><p>Physical activity has been shown to be vitally important for maintaining muscle mass and function. During periods of dramatically reduced activity, such as bed rest, the muscles of healthy individuals rapidly lose size, strength and power, most notably from the legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with older individuals seemingly more vulnerable to this complete &#x02018;disuse-induced&#x02019; muscle atrophy than younger individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a population of generally healthy older individuals, however, extended periods of bed rest are unlikely to occur unless accompanied by severe injury or illness that may cause muscle wasting independently. Periods of reduced activity in healthy older adults are more likely to be the result of minor injury or illness, or extended bad weather [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Scenarios such as these would result in a reduction in the number of steps walked on a daily basis for a short period of time, rather than total bed rest. The only previous investigation to focus on this step-reduction model of reduced physical activity in older people without any protective interventions demonstrated that reducing walking to less than 1500 steps per day for 2&#x000a0;weeks resulted in an average loss of around 4&#x000a0;% of leg muscle tissue, but with some participants losing up to 9&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In light of the estimated annual loss of 0.5&#x02013;1&#x000a0;% of muscle size this much larger loss due to step-reduction is a concerning observation, particularly with periods of reduced activity occurring more often in older age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, in the aforementioned study, muscle strength was not reduced by the period of step-reduction, which is surprising given that strength is typically lost more rapidly than muscle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It should be noted that muscle strength was measured by assessing unilateral isometric knee extensor torque using a dynamometer for which extensive familiarisation has been demonstrated to be crucial to obtain reliable results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, changes in muscle power cannot be inferred from isometric dynamometry. Given that the nervous system is shown to adapt to changes in physical activity levels more rapidly than the contractile structures of muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], muscle power may be more sensitive to periods of reduced activity than maximum-force-producing capabilities. An additional and critically important role of the neuromuscular system is to maintain postural balance. If the neuromuscular system is compromised after a period of reduced activity it could be hypothesised that balance would be affected leading to an increased risk of falling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>With only two studies previously investigating this topic specifically in an older population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], many questions remain as to the precise physiological mechanisms causing such marked response in muscle tissue to a seemingly benign and common scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Although there is a wealth of literature highlighting the importance of maintaining physical activity for many elements of healthy ageing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], relatively little direct evidence exists regarding the impact of acutely reducing activity in already healthy individuals. The physiological responses occurring when physical activity levels change are not confined to single tissues or organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and it is crucial to understand the interactions between tissues that result in negative health outcomes such as muscle loss, particularly in an older population. Gaining an understanding of the impact of short-term reductions in physical activity is also a crucial precursory step to identifying protective interventions with real-world applicability. Resistance exercise is widely regarded to be the primary countermeasure against &#x02018;disuse-induced&#x02019; muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In circumstances in which a period of reduced activity is scheduled but physical activity will subsequently be limited, for example, following to minor elective surgery, physical preparation through a concentrated period of resistance training may raise the &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; muscle function and health profile such that reduced activity-induced muscle loss is compensated for. This may present a strategy to improve recovery from reduced activity as performance tasks of daily living should be no more challenging than prior to the pre-training, thus potentially allowing return to previous habitual activity levels more quickly.</p><p>There may of course be circumstances in which reduced activity is unavoidable but capacity to exercise is not compromised, for example, during extended inclement weather. Devries et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] demonstrated that laboratory-based low-load resistance thrice weekly in fact increased leg lean tissue in older men during 2&#x000a0;weeks of step-reduction to less than 1500 steps/day. However, restricted access to resistance exercise equipment may render this exercise strategy infeasible; thus, home-based, body weight exercise may be a practical alternative to low-load resistance training. Previously, other health indices (e.g. metabolic health and mobility in frail older people) have been demonstrated to be improved by such exercise regimes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Again, this presents an opportunity to prevent decline in muscle function due to periods of reduced physical activity that may contribute to frailty, increased risk of falls, and their associated negative implications.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary aim is to determine the protective effects of two exercise interventions against the loss of lower limb skeletal muscle power in healthy men aged 65&#x02013;80 years undertaking 14&#x000a0;days of reduced physical activity (less than 1500 steps per day). The two exercise interventions are either: (1) undertaking 4&#x000a0;weeks of resistance training prior to the 14&#x000a0;days of step-reduction, or (2) home-based &#x02018;exercise snacking&#x02019; during the 14&#x000a0;days of step-reduction. Alongside this, the influence of the step-reduction intervention and potential protective effects of the exercise interventions on other indices of muscle function (strength and neural drive), standing balance, anthropometric measures, metabolic health, rate of muscle protein and adipose triglyceride synthesis during &#x02018;free-living&#x02019;, markers of inflammation and oxidative stress at rest and in response to exercise, immune function (e.g. lymphocyte cytokine production), dietary habits, sleep quality and quality of life will be assessed. Thereafter, the possible benefits of the exercise interventions on recovery of muscle function and size will be investigated. Once all elements of the study are completed, the acceptability of the interventions and feasibility of adhering to the approaches of the recommended exercise strategies will be assessed, and user-generated input for improvements to future follow-on work obtained.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The methods described herein have been approved by the National Health Service (NHS) South West Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee (REC) with an allocated REC reference number: 15/SW/0130. The project was subsequently registered as a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02495727). The Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist was completed.</p><p>The study will address the objectives by way of a three-group randomised control trial. One group will act as a &#x02018;control&#x02019; against which to compare the potential protective effects of exercise interventions insofar as this group will undertake step-reduction without either exercise intervention. Hypotheses: (1) reduced activity alone will result in loss of leg muscle power, (2) exercise pre-training will increase leg muscle power above baseline so any loss of muscle power due to the reduced activity period will be offset to such an extent that muscle power will remain above pre-training baseline, and (3) daily exercise snacking during the reduced activity period will attenuate the decline in leg muscle power due to reduced activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The study will be advertised on the University of Bath web pages, and on posters placed around the University of Bath campus and distributed to local community clubs for older people in the Bath area.

Participant and researcher blinding to group allocation is not possible, and screening and group allocation will be implement by the same researcher for all participants</p><p>The study is powered to detect the protective effect of the aforementioned exercise strategies against loss of leg muscle power during 14&#x000a0;days of reduced activity. Over 14&#x000a0;days of step-reduction a mean (SD) decrease of 3.9 (2.4&#x000a0;%) in lower limb muscle mass is anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], with measures of muscle power expected to decline at a similar or faster rate; thus, seven participants per group (95&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% alpha) will be required to observe changes in leg muscle strength. The decline in muscle power is expected to be the same in the pre-training group as in the control group, hence significant increases in leg muscle power prior to reducing physical activity are required. Significant increases in leg strength in older men with 4&#x000a0;weeks of pre-training could be observed using nine participants (95&#x000a0;% power and 5&#x000a0;% alpha) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and it expected that this would be equivalent in muscle power. It is difficult to predict the extent of the protective effect likely to be provided by the exercise snacking. Therefore, the sample size will be rounded to 10 participants per group to account for drop out and the potentially more subtle changes that might be observed in the secondary measures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Overview of study procedures</title><p>See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for a flow diagram of the study protocol. Following baseline assessment of habitual steps/day, to ensure familiarity with functional measures, all participants will attend two familiarisation sessions. Participants in the step-reduction intervention (PT-group) will then undertake 4&#x000a0;weeks of resistance exercise training. All participants will undertake a main trial the day before commencing 14&#x000a0;days of reduced activity by step-reduction to less than 1500 steps per day. On days 3 and 8 of the step-reduction protocol, a resting muscle biopsy sample will be taken. The day after the step-reduction period, a follow-up main trial will be conducted as per the first main trial, followed 3&#x000a0;days later by a final resting muscle biopsy. All participants will undertake 2&#x000a0;weeks of laboratory-based resistance re-training and a final assessment of leg muscle function and anthropometry, with the option of a follow-up qualitative interview of their experience of the trial. Thereafter, all participants will be offered a 3-month membership to the University of Bath Sports Training Village gym, gym classes, and swimming pool, and a personalised feedback sheet of their own data presented in lay terms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A flow diagram of the study timeline.

Those who are interested in participating will be sent information about the study requirements in writing. Interested participants will be asked to sign an informed consent form stating their willingness to undergo an eligibility screening with a member of the research team to ensure that participants do not exhibit any physiological condition that either poses undue personal risk or introduces bias into the experiment. During this screening, participants will undertake an objective assessment of physical function (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). Only participants scoring over 7 out of 12 without scoring 0 on any element of the SPPB will be eligible to participate. Balance scales and a stadiometer will be used to determine the participant&#x02019;s weight and height, recorded on inhalation of breath with the head positioned in the Frankfort plane position. BMI will subsequently be calculated. Participants will then be provided with a pedometer (CW600 Digi-Walker, Yamax, Tokyo, Japan) and instructed in its use, a physical activity monitor BodyMedia armband (Sensewear Professional 8.0, Pittsburg, PA, USA) and dietary record sheets. Participants will be asked to wear the pedometer and the BodyMedia armband for 7&#x000a0;days and to weigh and record all food and drink consumed for 3&#x000a0;days (including one weekend day) using a diet record sheet. The pedometer will record the daily step count and the reset step count at midnight each day. Only individuals who average 3500 steps per day or above will be invited to take part in the rest of the study, and at this point one of the investigators will describe the study verbally to them again and provide the opportunity for potential participants to gain clarification on any aspect of the study. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated to an experimental group by minimisation to limit difference in mean age, steps/day and BMI at baseline between groups. All further details of the elements of the study specific to the group will be provided. Written informed consent will be acquired at this stage in regard to each participant&#x02019;s understanding and willingness to take part in the rest of the study after group allocation. The investigator will also explain to the participants that they are completely free to withdraw from the study at any time without any repercussions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Familiarisation sessions</title><p>Participants will be asked to wear light clothes in which it is comfortable to perform exercise, and be given a thorough demonstration of all balance and strength tests, which they will then attempt.</p><p>Balance tests will assess postural sway with the participants&#x02019; eyes open and closed with them standing as still as possible on a force-measuring platform (AccuGait, AMTI, Watertown, MA, USA) with their feet side-by-side and heels 15&#x000a0;cm apart for 40&#x000a0;s, or feet together for 60&#x000a0;s. Participants will then practice the standard Y-balance test of single-leg balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], involving pushing their non-standing leg as far as they can forward, behind and to the right, and behind and to the left, whilst maintaining balance on the standing leg.</p><p>Leg strength assessments will be conducted on a pneumatic leg press machine (A420, Keiser&#x000ae;, Fresno, CA, USA), instrumented to measure the force applied to the foot pedals with the velocity the pedals moved at 400&#x000a0;Hz. Following a standardised warm-up, participants will complete one repetition maximum (1RM) tests on the leg press for single repetitions up to the greatest resistance at which one repetition can be completed, with self-selected rest and increments in force between repetitions. Determination of 1RM is commonly used in adult populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and is considered safe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], valid and reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in older populations. Following a recovery period of at least 5&#x000a0;min, the participants will then practice the incremental power test on the leg press that will be used in the main trials. In this test, participants will complete approximately 10 discrete repetitions of the leg press exercise, with the movement in each repetition performed as quickly as possible. The resistance will increase in each successive repetition, starting with very low resistance up to approximately the previously achieved 1RM, with increasing recovery periods between repetitions. Participants will then be asked to repeat a similar familiarisation and 1RM test on a pneumatic knee extension machine.</p><p>Finally, participants&#x02019; ability to generate their maximum possible force (i.e. neural drive) will be examined by maximal voluntary isometric calf muscle contractions, with concomitant surface-evoked twitch stimulation to produce maximal stimulated force. The participant will be seated on a custom-built device, with the ankle dorsi-flexed to 10&#x000b0; and the knee braced at 90&#x000b0; against a strain gauge to measure the force of isometric contraction of the plantar-flexor muscles. Stimulating electrodes will be attached to the skin surface of the calf muscle region, with the cathode and anode placed on the upper and lower thirds of the triceps surae respectively. Stimulation will be delivered with a DS7 stimulator (Digitimer, Letchworth Garden City, UK). Initially, the force of a maximum voluntary plantar-flexor contraction will then be obtained, followed by a maximum evoked from single twitches at rest. Thereafter, the participant will make three repeated attempts to match the previously obtained maximum voluntary force with a pulse of electrical stimulation (of the same voltage previously identified to evoke maximal twitch force) passed across the calf muscle to maximally stimulate the muscle at the point of maximum force. The difference between the maximum voluntary force and maximum twitch-evoked force will indicate the participant&#x02019;s ability to maximally stimulate their muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Main trials</title><p>The main trials will take place the day before the 14-day step-reduction (day 0) and the day after (day 15) (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Based on the previous studies, specifically implementing a daily step-reduction in older individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], it is expected that 14&#x000a0;days of reduced physical activity without protective interventions will have a significant physiological effect, with reductions in both muscle mass and insulin sensitivity. These changes, however, are reversible and participants will undergo re-training and assessments of muscle size and function will be made to ensure participants have returned to baseline (i.e. pre step-reduction). The step-reduction model and the exercise interventions incorporated into this study have been selected specifically because of their real-world applicability and high ecological validity. It is hoped that the exercise interventions will provide a proof of principle that even relatively modest exercise interventions may be effective countermeasures against reduced activity-induced muscle atrophy and decline in other health indices, and that these intervention can be further developed and optimised in future work. Given the limited previous literature using a reduced-activity model in older individuals it is hoped that inclusion of qualitative feasibility analysis may draw out questions of interest that may not have been previously considered, as well as considerations to improve future work in this field.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The findings of the present study will be inherently limited in applicability due to the inclusion of only healthy, non-smoking, non-obese, non-frail men, and the exclusion of more common clinical phenotypes for this age group. Moreover, the findings will hold limited generalisability to older individuals taking regular anti-inflammatory medication and to older women. A further limitation is that this study will not be able to inform on recovery from reduced activity when simply returning to habitual activity levels due to inclusion of the exercise re-training for all groups. It is also not possible to draw conclusions on the efficacy of the pre- and re-training programmes in altering any markers of health measured from tissue or blood samples, some of which may provide evidence as the mechanisms of change at the whole body level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>Participant recruitment for this study is ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>1RM, one repetition maximum; 10RM, 10 repetitions maximum; 4EBP-1, 4E binding protein 1; AKT, protein kinase B; ANOVA, analysis of variance; BMI, body mass index; CRP, C-reactive protein; D<sub>2</sub>O, deuterium oxide-labelled water; DXA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry; EDTA, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; ES-group, exercise snacking group; FOXO, forkhead box; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, hydrogen peroxide; HDL, high-density lipoprotein; HSP, heat shock protein; IL, interleukin; LDL, low-density lipoprotein; MAFbx, muscle atrophy F-box; mTOR, mechanistic target of rapamycin; MuRF-1, muscle RING-finger protein-1; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acid; P70S6K, 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1; pQCT, peripheral quantitative computed tomography; PT-group, pre-training group; SPPB, Short Physical Performance Battery; TNF&#x003b1;, tumour necrosis factor alpha; WHOQOL-BREF, World Health Organisation Quality of Life-BREF questionnaire.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge their appreciation to the University of Bath for providing financial support for this research.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KS conceived the study, KS, OP, RT, JG, JT, FG, CW, PM and DT contributed to the study design and contributed to the writing of the trial protocol.
