However, ACP uptake is low, with discussions often occurring late. This study assessed whether a systematic nurse-led ACP intervention increases ACP in patients with advanced respiratory disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>A multicentre open-label randomised controlled trial with preference arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>Metropolitan teaching hospital and a rural healthcare network.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>149 participants with respiratory malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Nurse facilitators offered facilitated ACP discussions, prompted further discussions with doctors and loved ones, and assisted participants to appoint a substitute medical decision-maker (SDM) and complete an advance directive (AD).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary measure was formal (AD or SDM) or informal (discussion with doctor) ACP uptake assessed by self-report (6&#x02005;months) and medical notes audit. Secondary measures were the factors predicting baseline readiness to undertake ACP, and factors predicting postintervention ACP uptake in the intervention arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At 6&#x02005;months, formal ACP uptake was significantly higher (p&#x0003c;0.001) in the intervention arm (54/106, 51%), compared with usual care (6/43, 14%). ACP discussions with doctors were also significantly higher (p&#x0003c;0.005) in the intervention arm (76/106, 72%) compared with usual care (20/43, 47%). Those with a strong preference for the intervention were more likely to complete formal ACP documents than those randomly allocated. Increased symptom burden and preference for the intervention predicted later ACP uptake. Social support was positively associated with ACP discussion with loved ones, but negatively associated with discussion with doctors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nurse-led facilitated ACP is acceptable to patients with advanced respiratory disease and effective in increasing ACP discussions and completion of formal documents. Awareness of symptom burden, readiness to engage in ACP and relevant psychosocial factors may facilitate effective tailoring of ACP interventions and achieve greater uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=365899">ACTRN12614000255684</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Advance care planning</kwd><kwd>advance directive</kwd><kwd>readiness</kwd><kwd>respiratory disease</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>medical decision-making</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This randomised controlled trial includes a patient preference arm, to more closely match the real-world clinical environment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Longitudinal follow-up enables assessment of multiple aspects of advance care planning uptake among a specific patient cohort at high risk of mortality.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A higher than expected number of patients who strongly preferred to receive the intervention means the study arms are unbalanced.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient attrition across the follow-up period and self-selection associated with the use of a preference arm complicate the interpretation of study data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A detailed description of characteristics associated with the facilitated advance care planning intervention provides implications for practitioners.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Advance care planning (ACP) is an ongoing process of discussion between patients, family, carers and health professionals aimed at clarifying goals for future care and facilitating decision-making in situations when a patient is unable to make decisions or communicate their own preferences.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> While ACP has traditionally been understood and measured in terms of the completion of a formal advance directive (AD) to specify preferences for medical treatments or nomination of a substitute healthcare decision-maker (SDM), there is growing awareness that such approaches do not capture the full breadth of the planning and discussion involved.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

A nurse facilitator was employed in each setting to coordinate recruitment, deliver the intervention and collect surveys. Both were senior nurses with extensive experience in communication with severely ill patients. Intervention fidelity was maintained across the study settings by research team participation in a full-day workshop delivered by an external consultant (using evidence-based resources adapted with permission from Respecting Patient Choices), a detailed study protocol and regular meetings between the nurse facilitators and the broader research team.</p><p>Participants assigned to the intervention were offered an appointment with the nurse facilitator to discuss their illness and prognosis, reflect on goals and values for future medical care, talk about these with loved ones and doctors, appoint an SDM, and/or formally document future treatment preferences in an AD.</p><p>In the metropolitan setting, the intervention typically occurred in an outpatient clinic, and in the rural setting this occurred in a GP room or in the participant's home. Follow-up meetings with the nurse facilitator were scheduled opportunistically, or by participant request. The date, length (minutes), location, people present and domains covered in each ACP discussion were recorded on a checklist. Any formal ACP documentation completed as part of the intervention was distributed to the participant, their family carer/s, regular GP and medical records department of the relevant hospital.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Measures</title><p>Participant age, gender, country of birth, religion and highest level of education attained were recorded at baseline.

First, participant interviews, administered at baseline, 3 and 6&#x02005;months postconsent, employed a validated survey tool to assess stage of readiness to engage in relevant aspects of ACP: (1) completion of a written AD, (2) documentation of an SDM, (3) discussion about life-sustaining treatments with loved ones and (4) discussion about life-sustaining treatments with doctors.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Second, at 12&#x02005;months after consent, time of death or study end point (whichever occurred first), participants' medical notes were audited from the time of consent to assess the presence of &#x02018;formal&#x02019; or &#x02018;informal&#x02019; documentation of patient preferences regarding future medical care. Inclusion of the notes audit meant that ACP uptake could be assessed for patients who had died or were lost to follow-up prior to the 6-month follow-up surveys. Medical notes audit was undertaken by the nurse facilitators using a structured audit tool.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The sections of the notes containing evidence of ACP uptake were scanned and de-identified, to allow inspection by the analysts in the research team (CS and SFE), who ensured that documentation met the definition of ACP uptake.</p><p>For the primary outcome, &#x02018;formal ACP uptake&#x02019; was defined as self-reported completion of a written AD (in WA, this means an &#x02018;Advance Health Directive&#x02019;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> or a &#x02018;My Advance Care Plan&#x02019; form<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>), or written nomination of an SDM (an &#x02018;Enduring Power of Guardianship&#x02019;<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) at 6-month follow-up.

There was an increased likelihood of having ACP uptake at 6-month follow-up (relative risk (RR) 3.65, 95% CI 1.70 to 7.85) among those assigned to receive the intervention (54/106, 50.9%), compared with those assigned to usual care (6/43, 14.0%). There was also increased ACP uptake at 6-month follow-up (RR 2.58, 95% CI 1.55 to 4.31) among those with a strong preference for the intervention (42/61, 68.9%) compared with those allocated randomly to receive the intervention (12/45, 26.7%). These results were confirmed with logistic regression analysis allowing an interaction between preference and assignment. Among those assigned to ACP intervention, those with a strong preference (Pref-ACP) had an OR of 6.1 (95% CI 2.6 to 14.3) of ACP uptake, compared with those allocated randomly (Rand-ACP). There was no difference between those allocated randomly to ACP and those assigned to usual care (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.5 to 5.8). Informal ACP uptake was significantly higher at 6-month follow-up (76/106, 71.7%) compared with baseline (33/106, 31.1%, p&#x0003c;0.001) for those assigned to the intervention, while those assigned to usual care did not show a significant difference in uptake over time (12/43, 27.9% vs 20/43, 46.5%, NS).</p><p>Among participants assigned to receive the ACP intervention (Pref-ACP or Rand-ACP) with baseline and 3-month follow-up data available (N=82), completion of ACP discussions about life-sustaining treatments with loved ones increased from baseline to 3-month follow-up (62% vs 77%, p&#x0003c;0.05). Among participants assigned to usual care (Pref-CON or Rand-CON) with baseline and 3-month follow-up data available (N=26), ACP discussions with loved ones showed a trend towards increase over time (50% vs 73%, p=0.06).</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013415F2">figure 2</xref>, the rate of self-reported AD completion at 6-month follow-up was higher in the Pref-ACP group (21/32, 66%) compared with the Rand-ACP group (7/33, 21%; RR 3.09, 95% CI 1.53 to&#x000a0;6.25, p&#x0003c;0.001) or compared with those assigned to either usual care group (1/24, 4%, p&#x0003c;0.001).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013415F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Self-reported &#x02018;readiness&#x02019; to complete an advance directive among participants assigned to different study groups over time.

The intervention was effective in increasing formal and informal ACP uptake, particularly among those with a pre-existing preference to receive the intervention.</p><p>The inclusion of a preference arm most likely increased participation and retention rates, and more closely reflects real-world situations, in which approaches to care are negotiated between clinicians and patients. In practice, there will always be patients who have strong attitudes about ACP and this trial design enabled recruitment of those who were unwilling to be randomised, potentially improving generalisability. The nature of the ACP intervention made it impossible to blind participants to their allocation, and hence a preference design may have avoided distress among those who wanted a particular type of care but were not offered it. The preference arm introduces a self-selection bias which should be considered when interpreting study findings.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><sec id="s4a"><title>Facilitated ACP intervention</title><p>The ACP intervention differed somewhat across the study sites due to practical factors. In the metropolitan setting, the intervention was delivered in outpatient clinics resulting in barriers to participation, particularly for participants with significant symptoms or mobility limitations. In the rural setting, the nurse facilitator was able to visit participants in a range of settings; this resulted in a tendency for multiple ACP discussions, often of shorter duration. Previous research has suggested that community-based ACP delivery can accommodate the needs of patients with heavy symptom burden and enable ongoing ACP discussion.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> However, in the current study, a lower than anticipated recruitment rate meant that it was not possible to stratify the data in order to assess the impact of the study setting on the primary outcome.</p><p>While the nurses routinely discussed participants' understanding of their illness, values, goals of care and perspectives on &#x02018;living well&#x02019;, discussion about prognosis and cultural, spiritual or religious beliefs occurred less often. This may reflect participant preferences for certain domains of discussion, or the nurses' preferences to avoid aspects of discussion that might be seen as the traditional domain of doctors or spiritual advisors.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>ACP uptake and readiness</title><p>The facilitated ACP intervention was associated with higher rates of formal and informal ACP uptake, particularly among those with a strong preference for the intervention, and those who engaged in multiple sessions with the nurse facilitator. Among those randomly allocated to receive the intervention, uptake was not significantly higher than among those assigned to usual care, suggesting that the intervention was particularly effective among those with a preference for ACP. However, it should also be noted that it was rare for patients to be excluded at the screening stage on the basis of prior formal AD completion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013415F1">figure 1</xref>). This suggests that a preference for ACP, on its own, does not necessarily lead to high levels of formal ACP uptake, in the absence of a facilitating intervention.</p><p>Most participants had discussed ACP with loved ones at baseline, with rates comparable to previous research in a healthy elderly cohort from the USA.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Discussion with loved ones at baseline was associated with social support,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> suggesting that supportive social networks may enable informal discussions outside of clinical relationships. Discussions with loved ones also increased across the follow-up period, regardless of assignment to the intervention. This cohort effect may be associated with disease progression, or may have been prompted by the inclusion of questions about &#x02018;ACP readiness&#x02019; in follow-up surveys.</p><p>Consistent with previous research, rates of ACP discussions with doctors were significantly lower than completion of formal ACP documents or discussion with loved ones.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The lower rates of discussion with doctors in practice contrast with those studies that suggest that patients prefer to discuss ACP with their trusted doctor.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> However, this paradox does seem to be overcome somewhat by the nurse facilitation process, as the rate of informal ACP uptake (documented discussion with doctor about preferences for life-sustaining treatments) did increase among participants assigned to the intervention, and was associated with having undertaken two or more nurse-facilitated ACP discussions. Similarly, higher rates of ACP discussions with doctors occurred among participants who had a family/carer involved in at least one of the facilitated ACP discussions. This implies that the presence of family/carers in initial ACP discussions prompts further follow-up with the doctor.</p><p>On the other hand, participants with lower social support were also more likely to have follow-up ACP discussions with doctors, perhaps as these participants are identified as potentially vulnerable and hence managed more proactively. Previous research has found that patients with more severe symptom burden and lower levels of social support influence GP decisions to initiate ACP discussions.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Social support is typically lower among patients with declining health status,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> and health professionals may need to proactively initiate ACP discussion among patients whose illness has led to losses in social support networks. The links between social support and ACP uptake require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study has a number of limitations to consider. Assignment to study arm was unblinded, and the preference design introduced a self-selection bias, which complicates interpretation of the data. There is additional complexity in the interpretation of ACP uptake over time due to attrition during the follow-up period (mostly associated with patients dying). This was addressed where possible by supplementing self-report measures with information obtained from follow-up medical notes audits. For measures in which self-report was the only source of data (eg, ACP discussions with loved ones), 3&#x02005;months was designated as the follow-up point, to minimise the impact of attrition. Where results are reported longitudinally (eg, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013415F2">figure 2</xref>), the sample is limited to those who were able to respond at all follow-up time points. Challenges to recruitment meant that the overall study sample was smaller than anticipated and data were collapsed across the two recruitment sites, preventing comparisons across sites. The same nurses who facilitated the ACP intervention also collected follow-up survey responses and undertook medical notes audits; this may be a source of bias. Despite this, high rates of survey (78% among surviving patients) and notes audit (98%) completion have yielded detailed data on ACP uptake among a specific cohort of patients with advanced respiratory disease. The authors suggest that the ongoing relationship between the nurse and participant contributed to the high rates of successful follow-up, and may also have facilitated high-quality ACP discussions. ACP interventions that occur outside an ongoing clinical relationship may be less effective, and may require more resources to build patient rapport.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications</title><p>This study has a number of implications for practice. A systematic screening process to identify patients with end-stage lung disease was found to be acceptable to clinicians and participants, and was sensitive in detecting patients at high risk of death in the coming year. Many participants expressed a strong preference to receive the ACP intervention, suggesting that assessing preference at the time of screening may enable effective tailoring of ACP interventions. Assignment to the facilitated ACP intervention was associated with large increases in ACP uptake, particularly among those with a pre-existing strong preference for receiving the intervention, and those who engaged in multiple sessions, or involved a family member or carer in the discussion. These findings suggest that facilitated ACP discussions with trained nurses are acceptable to patients with advanced respiratory disease, and effective in promoting ACP uptake.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Programmes aiming to promote ACP uptake may consider assessing patient social support, to identify preferred support people for participation in discussions and to flag patients who may require more intensive support in undertaking ACP.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the participating patients, carers, clinicians and healthcare facilities.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Craig Sinclair <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/csinclair28">@csinclair28</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> CS contributed to study design, grant writing, ethics application and site approvals, contributed to ACP training resource development and adaptation to the local context, conducted data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
