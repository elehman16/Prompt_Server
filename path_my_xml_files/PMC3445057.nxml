Treatment consisted of 20 minutes of heat, ice, or no modality applied to the hamstrings, followed by a 1-minute static hamstring stretch. Hip ROM increased for all 3 groups with no statistically significant difference among them. The researchers concluded that static stretching with a superficial modality provides no additional benefits.</p><p>This study had several potential weaknesses. First Taylor et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941738110374612">13</xref></sup> took hip ROM measurements after only a 1-minute single stretch. Current research suggests that a 2-minute stretch per day may increase ROM more so than a 1-minute stretch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr2-1941738110374612">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr4-1941738110374612">4</xref></sup> Lin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941738110374612">10</xref></sup> sought to determine the acute effect of a single 1-day stretch applying a hot pack to the knee before stretching, as followed by a 10-minute static stretch with either a hot or cold pack. Knee ROM increased for both groups, with cold therapy resulting in significant ROM gains. The researcher concluded that cold, combined with passive stretching, may increase ROM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1941738110374612">13</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, Brodowicz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941738110374612">1</xref></sup> examined the acute effect of a single 3-minute hamstring stretch with heat, ice, or no modality. The mean flexibility gains with ice were higher than those with heat or without a modality. The researchers concluded that short-term applications of ice during a static stretch may increase ROM more so than heat or stretching alone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941738110374612">1</xref></sup></p><p>Consequently, there is a lack of consensus regarding which modalities optimally enhance a static stretching program. What is not known is the cumulative effect of cold with a lengthy stretching protocol (ie, weeks rather than a single day). The lasting effects on ROM are not known, namely because the prior studies evaluated a single 1-day stretch with superficial thermal modalities.</p><p>Finally, because cold was simultaneously applied with the stretch time, it is likely that the analgesic effect may not have had sufficient time to influence the stretch action. Rather, it is reasonable to think that the cold should be applied in advance of the stretching, to improve the chance of an analgesic benefit.</p><p>The hypothesis for this study was that superficial precooling, combined with a static stretching program, will significantly increase ROM more so than static stretching alone over a 4-week stretching program. The second hypothesis was that superficial precooling will allow greater ROM retention following the cessation of static stretching, compared with static stretching alone.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section1-1941738110374612"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section2-1941738110374612"><title>Participants</title><p>The study and consent form were approved by our institution&#x02019;s Research and Ethics Institutional Review Board.

Participants in both groups gained ROM at a similar rate during the stretching phase of this study and lost ROM at a similar rate during the cessation phase of this study.</p><p>The results of this study conflict with those of Brodowicz et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1941738110374612">1</xref></sup> and Lin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1941738110374612">10</xref></sup> These studies both found cold to be effective at enhancing a single stretch. Reasons for these discrepancies may be that these researchers chose to evaluate a single 1-day stretch. They also applied the modality with the stretch, whereas in this study the modality was used before stretching. Lin used participants who had sustained a traumatic fracture of their lower extremities with secondary decreases in knee ROM. This study used only healthy individuals.</p><p>Clinically, the results of this study are relevant because icing the musculature during a treatment session may be an inefficient use of valuable treatment time. Precooling may still be beneficial when trying to increase the tolerance to stretch.</p><p>This study did have several limitations. First, it used a sample of convenience. The majority of participants were young and healthy physical therapy students. We cannot generalize these results to the elderly or to those with pathology or pain. Those with pain might respond differently to the analgesic effect of precooling. The activity level outside this study was not controlled; hence, it could be a confounding variable. In addition, compliance with the stretching protocol was not assessed. All participants were measured on a weekly basis, which may have improved compliance, although this was not measured. Another factor to consider is the large age range given the small sample size (18 to 48 years). Finally, this study examined only the effects of precooling on the hamstring muscle group. Most superficial muscle groups would likely yield similar results given the similar physiologic properties.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1941738110374612"><title>Clinical Implications</title><p>The results of this study indicate that superficial precooling before stretching does not produce greater gains in ROM or assist with the maintenance of ROM any more so than static stretching alone. Static stretching increases ROM regardless of whether the musculature is precooled. Superficial thermal modalities may increase one&#x02019;s comfort or tolerance to stretch, but they do not increase or maintain ROM.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>No potential conflict of interest declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1941738110374612"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
