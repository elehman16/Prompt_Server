Failure to cope with stress can have adverse effects that include increased incidences of anxiety and mood disorders as well as physical disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In South Korea, one study classified 73% of employees as a potential-stress group, 22% of employees as a high-stress group, and only 5% of employees as a non-stress group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies have demonstrated the stress relieving benefits of mind&#x02013;body therapy, such as progressive muscle relaxation, yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], autogenic training (AT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], Qigong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and meditation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. AT is effective for anxiety relief, mild to moderate depression, functional sleep disorders, mild to moderate hypertension, tension-type headache, migraine, coronary heart disease, asthma, Raynaud&#x02019;s disease, and somatoform pain disorder (unspecified type) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program can improve coping for individuals suffering from cancer and chronic pain, anxiety, depression, and stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Qigong is an ancient Chinese mind control exercise involving breathing methods and &#x0201c;vital energy&#x0201d;, which has a positive effect on health and allows the exerciser to gain control over Qi, the life-energy that flows in channels (meridians) in the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Qigong has been reported to be effective for depression, anxiety, perceived stress level, hypertension, fibromyalgia, pain, immune function, lipid metabolism, and hormonal variation in the sympathetic nervous system and/or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Cortisol is the major stress hormone in the human organism related to HPA axis and there were evidences by decreased cortisol levels following mind-body stress reduction interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Most common mind&#x02013;body interventions require a considerable commitment of time and money to complete the training.

The 10 items elicit information about feelings and thoughts during the past month and how often the respondent felt a certain way in a specific situation. The scoring system uses a five-point Likert scale with a maximum stress score of 40. The PSS has an internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;) coefficient of 0.85 and well-established validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Scores were imputed for participants missing one PSS item. Scores for these missing items were computed by calculating the mean score for the remaining nine of the 10 items.

It comprises two 20-item self-report subscales containing words descriptive of anxiety that are rated on a four-point Likert scale. Items on the state anxiety subscale deal with how the person is feeling &#x0201c;right now, at this moment&#x0201d;. Items on the trait anxiety subscale measure how the respondent is &#x0201c;generally feels&#x0201d;. The STAI scores were only calculated if at least 17 items (out of 20) were answered.

It is included in Culture-Bound Syndromes described in Appendix I in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th edition; DSM-IV). The syndrome is caused by suppression of anger and results in physical symptoms of chest discomfort and heartburn as well as feelings of humiliation and shame [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic> personality subscale comprises 16 items, and the <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic> symptoms subscale comprises 15 items, which are scored using a five-point Likert scale. The personality subscale assesses the degree to which suppression of emotion, interpersonal characteristics, stubbornness, and coping methods contribute to <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic>. The symptoms subscale assesses the psychological and physical symptoms of <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic>. The internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;) coefficient of the <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic> Scale has been reported as 0.92, with the <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic> personality subscale at 0.85 and <italic>Hwa-Byung</italic> symptoms subscale at 0.91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

The WHOQOL-BREF comprises 26 items and has been reported to show satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; ranging from 0.58 for the social domain to 0.77 for physical health). It also has adequate test-retest reliability (0.732&#x02013;0.799) and discriminant validity. Where an item is missing, the mean of other items in the domain can be substituted.

Salivary cortisol exhibits a diurnal rhythm and increases rapidly within 60&#x000a0;minutes after awakening in people experiencing high stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, saliva was collected 1&#x000a0;hour after awakening, between 7 and 9&#x000a0;a.m. No eating and no drinking except for water was allowed prior to saliva collection. The collected Salivettes were kept cold using icepacks during delivery to the hospital and were kept frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until assayed. Saliva samples were thawed and centrifuged at 3000&#x000a0;rpm for 15&#x000a0;minutes at room temperature. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Salimetrics) was used to determine cortisol levels.

During the four weekly sessions, material related to relaxation, meditation, and mind&#x02013;body connections and BQM instructions were given. Session groups of six to 10 participants were led by one of the authors (JWK) who has 20&#x000a0;years of Qigong training. BQM in this program took 15&#x000a0;minutes and consisted of three different techniques: 1) relaxed breathing, 2) relaxing the body, and 3) gathering Qi and self-healing. Relaxed breathing consisted of deep respiration with longer exhalation and abdominal breathing while counting down from 10. This was repeated three times. Relaxing the body involved passive concentration on bodily perceptions, especially focusing on feeling the weight and warmth of both hands. Gathering Qi and self-healing consisted of sensing Qi sensations and gathering Qi between both hands. Participants were also given a booklet, an MP3 player containing an audio BQM guide to aid them in their daily practice, and a meditation log in which they recorded the actual time spent in daily meditation and which they later handed in. Participants were required to engage in at least 60% of the daily practice recommended.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Previous research examining the effectiveness of Qigong training on reducing PSS scores using a wait list as the control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] revealed that at a significance level of 0.05 and desired power of 0.80, 21 people per group would be required to detect a significant difference between the intervention and control groups. Furthermore, we considered that, given a drop-out rate of 20%, 25 persons were needed per group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All analysis was done by Intent-to-Treat (i.e., as randomized) principle.

However, salivary cortisol levels did not change compared with baseline. It should be noted that all our subjects&#x02019; salivary cortisol levels were within the low-normal range for healthy older adults. Heterogeneity in age profiles may have attenuated the cortisol results for several possible reasons. Some people do not show typical diurnal cortisol secretion rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Furthermore, the PSS results may not correlate with perceived stress level and cortisol secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and it is debatable whether different relaxation techniques such as mindfulness meditation affect salivary cortisol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. As such, it appears that there was little opportunity for salivary cortisol values to be influenced by BQSRP training over the 4-week period. The salivary cortisol assay is non-invasive, making multiple sampling easy and stress-free. However, the testing parameters, saliva collection time, and heterogeneity of the group may have affected the results. There may have been a true lack of physiologic effect of this BQSRP intervention or a need for more sensitive measures of stress. Other markers such as salivary IgA or amylase may be more sensitive to the relaxation response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, the primary measure of this study was the perceived stress scores (PSS), so the sample size might have been inadequate to find out the change on the cortisol level.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>A limitation of this study was the restriction of results to the immediate post-intervention period. As this study was a wait-list control, the contact with the trainer might have influenced the outcomes. The wait-list control subjects were trained for 4&#x000a0;weeks, the same as the Qigong group. Therefore, the authors could not assess the difference between the two groups over time. Investigation of long-term outcomes is needed. In addition, salivary cortisol has a circadian rhythm and is ideally sampled more than twice a day at different time across 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days. Because of a limited budget, it was sampled only once in this study. Therefore, further study is warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>It is plausible that a 4-week BQSRP intervention is effective in reducing stress perception, anxiety, anger, and improving quality of life. Such a program may have advantages over more established programs in many situations, particularly in regard to length and cost of training.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>No competing financial interests exist.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EYH, SYC, JWK and MYS contributed to the conception and design of the study.
