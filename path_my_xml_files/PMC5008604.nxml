Several reports have investigated the effect of SPI on the consumption of opioids including remifentanil, fentanyl, and sufentanil during anesthesia, but there are no reports about oxycodone.

Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to achieve bispectral index values between 40 and 60. In the SPI group, oxycodone 1&#x0200a;mg was administered intravenously at SPI values over 50; in the control group, oxycodone 1&#x0200a;mg was administered intravenously at the occurrence of tachycardia or hypertension event.

In TIVA using propofol and remifentanil, SPI-guided opioid administration could reduce opioid consumption, and thus it could reduce extubation time.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Remifentanil has a rapid onset and ultrashort duration of action; in comparison, oxycodone has a relatively slower onset and longer duration times, similar to those of sufentanil or fentanyl.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, unlike TIVA, the effectiveness of SPI-guided analgesia during volatile-based anesthesia may not be valid.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we aimed to investigate the utility of SPI for analgesia with oxycodone during sevoflurane anesthesia as a clinical setting of balanced anesthesia, one of the most common anesthetic techniques.</p><p>The aim of this prospective randomized controlled study was to compare intravenous oxycodone consumption between SPI-guided analgesia and conventional analgesia practices during sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. We hypothesized that SPI-guided analgesia would decrease intraoperative oxycodone consumption and shorten extubation time without an increase in unwanted hemodynamic and somatic response events during sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The trial was registered in the UMIN clinical trials registry (unique trial number: UMIN000015683; registration number: R000018135; date of registration: November 13, 2014) and it was a single-site study performed at Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea from December 2014 to March 2015. All patients were recruited from the Department of Otolaryngology and Breast Endocrine Surgery, Korea University Guro Hospital. Patients were enrolled in the study upon admission to the hospital the day before surgery. After obtaining approval of the Korea University Guro Hospital Institutional Review Board and written informed consent from all the patients, we enrolled 48 patients (age 20&#x02013;65 years) undergoing thyroidectomy, with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification of I or II. Exclusion criteria were a history of cardiovascular disease, with the exception of well-controlled hypertension; renal, neuromuscular, or neurological disease; abuse of alcohol or illicit drugs; medication that may affect autonomic regulation (e.g., &#x003b2;-blocker, clonidine); and pregnancy.</p><p>All patients received intramuscular midazolam 2&#x0200a;mg for premedication 30&#x0200a;minutes before induction of anesthesia. For randomization, a computer-generated list that is in a website for randomization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">www.randomization.com</ext-link>) was used, and the random numbers were kept in opaque sealed envelopes. Generation of the random allocation sequence, enrollment of participants and assignment of participants to interventions were performed by a single investigator not involved in the anesthetic procedure and assessment of the participants during the study period. In the operating room, intraoperative monitoring devices (e.g., devices for noninvasive blood pressure measurement, electrocardiogram leads, pulse oximeters [CARESCAPE monitor B650, GE Healthcare Finland Oy, Finland] and bispectral index [BIS] monitors [BIS-Vista, Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA]) were attached to all patients, and the patients were randomized either to the SPI group (SPI-guided analgesia group) or the control group (conventional analgesia group). The SPI sensor was attached to all patients on an index finger. The baseline values for mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), SPI, and BIS were recorded before anesthesia induction.</p><p>All anesthetic procedures were carried out by 2 anesthesiologists. One independent anesthesiologist not involved in the study and not blinded to the group allocation performed anesthesia induction and maintenance and analgesic administration. The other blinded independent anesthesiologist assessed extubation time and postoperative pain in patients during the emergence and recovery phases.</p><p>Patients were preoxygenated for 5&#x0200a;minutes with 100% oxygen. Then, intravenous oxycodone 1&#x0200a;mg and thiopental sodium 5&#x0200a;mg/kg were administered for anesthesia induction. After loss of consciousness, each patient received rocuronium 0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg and the trachea was intubated. Ventilation was adjusted with 50% oxygen in air to maintain a partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide between 30 and 35&#x0200a;mm Hg. In all patients, sevoflurane was started initially with 2 vol% and adjusted to maintain a BIS value between 40 and 60.</p><p>The SPI was calculated using methodology described previously.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> SPI values range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher stress level. A value of 50 indicates a mean stress level during anesthesia, and an SPI range between 20 and 50 has been used to guide analgesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The guideline of analgesic administration in each group was as follows: in the SPI group, an oxycodone 1&#x0200a;mg bolus was given at a 5-minute interval, at each occurrence of an SPI value &#x0003e; 50 for more than 15 seconds. In the control group, an oxycodone 1&#x0200a;mg bolus was administered at a 5-minute interval&#x02014;based on the change in hemodynamic parameters&#x02014;at the occurrence of tachycardia or hypertension event. In both groups, a rescue medication (additional thiopental sodium 1&#x0200a;mg/kg) was applied when somatic movement such as coughing, grimacing, and effort of breathing occurred, despite BIS and SPI values within the predefined range during the surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup></p><p>Hemodynamic instability events were defined identically for both groups. Tachycardia was defined as HR of &#x0003e;90 beats per minute, if baseline HR was below 75 beats per minute, or as an increase of over 20% of the baseline HR, if it was &#x0003e;75 beats per min. Hypertension was defined as MAP over 100 mm Hg, if baseline MAP was &#x0003c; 83 mm Hg, or as an increase of &#x0003e;20% of the baseline MAP, if it was &#x0003e;83 mm Hg.</p><p>Bradycardia was defined as HR &#x0003c;45 beats per minute. Hypotension was defined as MAP &#x0003c;60 mm Hg. For the SPI group patients, labetalol 5&#x0200a;mg was administered at a 5-minute interval at the occurrence of tachycardia or hypertension event, despite an SPI value &#x0003c;50. For the control-group patients, labetalol 5&#x0200a;mg was administered if hypertension or tachycardia was persistent despite 3sequential oxycodone bolus doses (total 3&#x0200a;mg) within 15&#x0200a;minutes.</p><p>Rocuronium 5&#x0200a;mg was administered every 30&#x0200a;minutes until the removal of the thyroid gland was completed and neuromuscular monitoring was performed by using train-of-four (TOF) stimulation. After the end of skin suture, pyridostigmine 10&#x0200a;mg and glycopyrrolate 0.4&#x0200a;mg were administered for reversal of neuromuscular blockade after confirming TOF count of 4. In addition, sevoflurane was discontinued at the end of skin suture, and fresh gas flow was increased to 8&#x0200a;L/min. The extubation was performed when the respiration and consciousness of the patient were recovered, and extubation time was measured from the discontinuation of anesthetics to extubation by the investigator blinded to the patient's assignment.</p><p>All patients were transferred to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) after extubation. In the PACU, the same investigator who was blinded to the patient's assignment assessed the recovery score and pain score. A modified Aldrete score and numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain (0&#x02013;10) were recorded in each 10&#x0200a;minutes from arrival of PACU until 60&#x0200a;minutes. If NRS was &#x0003e;5, ketorolac 15&#x0200a;mg was administered and repeated at a 10-min interval. Postoperative nausea (none, slight, moderate, severe) and vomiting (yes, no) and other adverse events, including respiratory depression, also were monitored. Metoclopramide 10&#x0200a;mg was administrated when patients complained of nausea or when vomiting occurred. The total cumulative amounts of rescue ketorolac and incidence of rescue metoclopramide administration were recorded.</p><p>The primary endpoint of this study was to evaluate intraoperative oxycodone consumption; secondary endpoints were extubation time, the incidences of intraoperative hemodynamic events including hypertension or tachycardia, and somatic movement, trends of intraoperative SPI, BIS, a partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide, changes of the recovery score (a modified Aldrete score) and NRS for pain, total rescue analgesic consumption and incidences of rescue antiemetic administration and adverse events in the PACU.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary endpoint in this study was the oxycodone consumption administered during surgery. The sample size calculation was based on the results of a pilot study with 6 cases in each group. In the pilot study, intraoperative oxycodone doses (mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation) were 5.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.4&#x0200a;mg in the SPI group and 6.5&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;1.8&#x0200a;mg in the control group, respectively. Therefore, the effect size of 2-groups was 0.93. On the assumption that the allocation ratio of 2-groups was 1, a sample size for each group was 20, calculated by Student's <italic>t</italic> test, 2-sided test, a level of significance of 0.05, and a power of 0.8. Considering a 20% dropout rate, the sample size for final enrollment was 24 in each group (total 48 patients).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 18 software (SPSS Inc., IBM, Chicago, IL). Continuous data such as intraoperative total oxycodone consumption, extubation time, intraoperative labetalol dose, and total ketorolac consumption in the PACU were analyzed using the 2-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test (normally distributed data) or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (abnormally distributed data). Incidences of intraoperative hemodynamic and somatic movement events between the groups were compared using a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Postoperative nausea and vomiting and incidence of rescue metoclopramide administration also were compared by the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Trends of SPI, a partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide and BIS values during surgery, and changes of a modified Aldrete score and NRS for pain in the PACU were compared between the groups by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) factoring for time and group assignment. The data are expressed as the mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation, median [25; 75 quartiles], or number of patients (%). A <italic>P</italic> value &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>A total of 48 patients were enrolled in this study, and 3 patients were excluded for noncompliance with the study protocol.

These results suggest several important points about SPI-guided analgesia.</p><p>Firstly, in SPI-guided analgesia, intravenous oxycodone administration with an intermittent bolus dose as well as remifentanil infusion can be effective for titration of analgesia. Previously, analgesic drug administration during general anesthesia had been guided clinically by somatic or autonomic responses such as movement, sweating, lacrimation, increase of HR, or arterial blood pressure (conventional analgesic practices). However, the superiority of SPI to conventional analgesic practices has been demonstrated for managing the nociception-antinociception balance or detecting the intensity of both surgical stimuli and antinociceptor drug effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Until now, the studies on the clinical utility of SPI have been performed mainly in the settings of TIVA with propofol and remifentanil in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Those studies have shown that SPI-guided titration of remifentanil infusion during general anesthesia can reduce intraoperative remifentanil consumption without difference in postoperative pain intensity.<sup>25,</sup><sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> In contrast, there are few reports of studies of other opioids administered via the intermittent bolus method for titration of analgesia by SPI guidance.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Gruenewald et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> reported that SPI-guided intermittent bolus administration of sufentanil was clinically feasible but was not able to significantly reduce intraoperative sufentanil consumption. However, the present study demonstrated that SPI-guided administration of intravenous oxycodone with an intermittent bolus dose can reduce cumulative oxycodone consumption during anesthesia without an increase in postoperative pain, compared with conventional analgesic practices, in patients undergoing thyroidectomy.</p><p>Secondly, SPI-guided analgesia can be effective in general anesthesia using volatile anesthetics such as sevoflurane as well as TIVA. The study by Gruenewald et al<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> that used sufentanil as an analgesic and sevoflurane as a general anesthetic suggested that different anesthesia regimens have different impact on beneficial effects of SPI guidance, thereby raising questions over the efficacy of SPI guidance in anesthesia using volatile anesthetics in contrast to TIVA. In contrast, the present study indicated that SPI-guided oxycodone administration can provide effective analgesia during sevoflurane anesthesia.</p><p>Thirdly, a target range of SPI between 20 and 50 is adequate for titration of intravenous oxycodone. Previous studies on the utility of SPI all used the SPI target range of 20 to 50.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Some of these studies reported that the target range of SPI between 20 and 50 had been suboptimal for the analgesic titration.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>Fourthly, SPI-guided administration of intravenous oxycodone can reduce extubation time compared with conventional analgesic practices. Although we should consider many clinical aspects including the study patient group, types of surgery, and anesthetics&#x02019; effects on recovery times, several previous studies on the utility of SPI reported that SPI-guided analgesia could not reduce recovery times, as measured by extubation time or emergence time.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Lastly, SPI-guided administration of intravenous oxycodone can be safe with regard to postoperative adverse events associated with opioids. Intraoperative opioid bolus administration can cause overdose-related problems such as respiratory depression, sedation, bradycardia, and nausea or vomiting at an immediate postoperative period in a dose-dependent correlation.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The risk can be greater with the use of opioids with a quite long duration such as oxycodone (the onset time of 2&#x02013;3&#x0200a;minute after injection, a half-life: 4&#x0200a;hours 52 minutes<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>), whereas the surgical stress not attenuated with opioids also results in other complications in the long-term postoperative recovery period.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Our study suggests that SPI-guided bolus administration of oxycodone can titrate adequately the quantity of individualized oxycodone consumption, leading to favorable PACU outcomes.</p><p>A limitation in this study was administration of labetalol that may affect the SPI value. Labetalol has a long elimination half-life (&#x0003e; 5&#x0200a;h) as compared to shorter acting agents such as esmolol. It is conceivable that in some patients in whom labetalol was used, might not have demonstrated subsequent elevations of HR and blood pressure despite nociceptive perceptions, thus leading to fewer oxycodone dosing in the control group, where such dosing depended entirely on HR and blood pressure changes. Thus, we might have been better served using esmolol instead of longer acting agents such as labetalol, which might have been easier to titrate. Nevertheless, labetalol can attenuate MAP and HR via combined &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-receptor blockade (mainly via &#x003b2;-blockade at low dose) without analgesic effect.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Ahonen et al<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> reported that beta blockade does not affect SPI values because effects of beta blockade target only the beta receptors of the cardiovascular system, rather than exerting an effect of blunting nociceptive reaction. Furthermore, in this study, labetalol cumulative dose during surgery was small in both groups (median 5&#x0200a;mg, respectively) and it was not significantly different between the groups. Also, the administration of labetalol was essential for maintaining the patients&#x02019; hemodynamics stable. Considering these points, we suggest that labetalol might have little effect on SPI values, thus indicating that SPI values in the SPI-guided analgesia group could truly reflect the nociception during anesthesia.</p><p>Another limitation in the study was use of thiopental sodium bolus as a rescue medication of somatic movement occurred during the surgery. Although the incidence of intraoperative somatic movement events was not high in both groups and it was comparable between the 2 groups, barbiturates such as thiopental sodium sometimes appear to lower the pain threshold. Thus, it may be argued that this pharmacological effect of thiopental sodium might potentially have affected the use of incremental doses of oxycodone in patients who received thiopental sodium. In addition, barbiturates do not produce muscle relaxation, but some, such as methohexital, might produce involuntary muscle contractions.</p><p>In conclusion, intravenous oxycodone bolus administration by SPI guidance reduces cumulative oxycodone consumption during surgery and shortens extubation time without negative impact on pain scores and adverse events in the PACU, compared with conventional analgesia practices by clinical parameters, during sevoflurane anesthesia in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. We suggest that SPI guidance can be useful for analgesic titration with intravenous oxycodone during sevoflurane anesthesia as a clinical setting of balanced anesthesia, one of the most common anesthetic techniques.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ANOVA = analysis of variance, BIS = bispectral index, CI = confidence interval, HR = heart rate, MAP = mean arterial blood pressure, NRS = numeric rating scale, PACU = postanesthesia care unit, SPI = surgical pleth index, TIVA = total intravenous anesthesia, TOF = train-of-four.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Authorship: YJW&#x02014;patient recruitment, data collection, data analysis, and writing up of the first draft of the paper; BGL&#x02014;study design, data collection, data analysis, and revision of the first draft of the paper; SHL, SP, and HK&#x02014;study design, data analysis, and revision of the first draft of the paper; IOL&#x02014;patient recruitment, data collection, and data analysis; MHK&#x02014;patient recruitment and data collection.
