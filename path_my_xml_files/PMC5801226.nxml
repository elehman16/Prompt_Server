The broad definition of GV considers the intraday glycemic excursions, including episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.</p><p id="Par7">Glycemic variability is linked to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The relationship among these three important metrics is examined here specifically to show how reduction in both hypo- and hyperglycemia risks is dependent on changes in variability. For example, improvement in hyperglycemia risk is often accompanied by an increase in hypoglycemia including episodes of severe hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, glycemic variability has previously been identified to be associated with increased hypoglycemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The role of glycemic variability in achieving better glucose control without having to trade-off one glycemic risk for another is an important topic. Dunn et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] developed a clinical report that presents all three metrics: hypoglycemia risk, hyperglycemia risk, and glycemic variability. The purpose of the report is to underscore the importance of addressing variability when both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are high. Here we attempt to demonstrate the underlying mathematical relationship among the three measures in a graphical fashion.</p><p id="Par9">We introduce the glycemic risk plot, which shows all three measures of glycemic control in one plot, namely:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par10">Hypoglycemia risk: average minutes below 70&#x000a0;mg/dl per day (MB70).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11">Hyperglycemia risk: estimated HbA1c (eA1c).</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12">Glycemic variability: difference between the median and the 10th percentile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></list-item></list>

The details of the study are described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Briefly, the study consisted of type 1 and type 2 individuals on insulin therapy with two arms: (1) the intervention group utilized a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to assess daily glucose levels and (2) the control group relied on capillary glucose testing. After an initial 14-day masked CGM baseline period, the diabetes management intervention period was 85&#x000a0;days, with a masked 14-day CGM wear at the end of the study for the control group. The control and intervention groups had a total of 25 (10 T1DM, 15 T2DM) and 53 (25 T1DM, 28 T2DM) participants, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Glycemic Risk Plot</title><p id="Par19">The glycemic risk plot shows the relationship between estimated HbA1c % (eA1c) and minutes below 70&#x000a0;mg/dl (MB70) with superimposed constant-variability contours. While several measures of variability have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], variability here is defined as the difference between the median and 10th percentile of glucose values. A gamma distribution is obtained as per [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] for a range of glucose median and variability values. Dunn et al. used data from the JDRF-CGM trial to generate the gamma distribution parameters for various combinations of median and variability values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The contours were then calculated by holding the variability constant and determining the gamma distribution at various values of median glucose using these parameters. Once the glucose distribution is obtained for a given variability value, the MB70 values can be calculated by multiplying the number of minutes in a day by the probability of glucose&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;70&#x000a0;mg/dl defined by the distribution. The median goal is then converted to eA1c using the equation derived from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A single contour for each variability value is then generated by plotting the corresponding eA1c and MB70 pairs. An example of the plot is shown below in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Glycemic risk plot with glycemic variability (Var) contours.

The hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia metrics chosen here align with those reported by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Examples 2 and 3 show that if variability is not improved, individuals are likely to trade-off one glycemic risk for the other. Example 1 shows that if variability is improved, it is possible to achieve improvement in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia risk, or at least achieve improvements in one risk while maintaining the other constant. The plot also provides other valuable insights; for example, as the individual moves closer to the <italic>in target</italic> zone, a larger change in variability is needed to not increase the risk of hypoglycemia as is illustrated by the distance between the contours, which increases near the in target zone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data Analysis</title><p id="Par29">To verify the predictions of the glycemic risk plot, data were analyzed from a randomized control trial for evaluation of the Navigator QS Continuous Glucose Monitor combined with prototype informatics software used for clinical visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. As described above, the study enrolled individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who were on insulin therapy. Data from the intervention and control groups were pooled for this analysis, and comparisons were made between the baseline and final periods of the study.</p><p id="Par30">The data were analyzed by using two methods: (1) the glycemic risk plot and (2) modified glycemic risk plot.

</p><p id="Par33">Individuals who improve variability (and both hypo- and hyperglycemia risk) move across variability contours towards the lower variability contours, while individuals who worsen variability move across variability lines towards the higher variability contours. Individuals who show no change in variability stay on the same variability contour at the start and finish of the study. The variability contours illustrate the risk trade-off if therapy changes are made to address hypoglycemia risk or hyperglycemia risk without improving variability, which is typically attained by self-care behavior changes. This observation suggests that the availability of CGM data enables people to address hypoglycemia. However, if an effort is not made to reduce variability, this improvement in hypoglycemia risk will only result in increased hyperglycemia risk. Other tools may be needed to augment CGM to reduce glycemic variability by addressing self-care behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Modified Glycemic Risk Plot Analysis of CGM Data</title><p id="Par34">Modified glycemic risk plots for type 1 and type 2 individuals are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

</p><p id="Par35">For type 1 individuals (upper panel), a total of 28 individuals out of 35 (80%) showed at least one glycemic risk improvement during the course of the study. Twelve individuals showed an improvement in eA1c (from 8.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1% to 7.4&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1%, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), while 24 individuals showed an improvement in MB70 (from 118&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;min to 51&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;42&#x000a0;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0006). Of these, seven individuals (20%) showed improvement in both estimated HbA1c and MB70. Similarly, for type 2 individuals (lower panel), a total of 36 individuals out of 43 (84%) showed improvement during the course of the study.

For example, type 2 individual 4713 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>), who showed a large improvement in variability (by 52&#x000a0;mg/dl), had a corresponding large reduction in hyperglycemia, while only introducing a small amount of hypoglycemia risk.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Relationship among hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and glycemic variability is illustrated by the glycemic risk plot.

</p><p id="Par39">On the other hand, as individuals get close to their target, the glycemic risk plot tells us that the variability improvement needs to be larger to prevent increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. This was observed for type 2 individual 5505, who improved variability (by 27&#x000a0;mg/dl) along with a corresponding reduction in hyperglycemia, but with a substantially increased risk of hypoglycemia. For individual 5505 to maintain the same level of hypoglycemia risk and to achieve the decrease in estimated HbA1c desired, variability would need to be reduced by a larger amount. The individual&#x02019;s variability dropped to 38&#x000a0;mg/dl, but in order not to increase the risk of hypoglycemia, the variability would need to drop to 21&#x000a0;mg/dl as per the glycemic risk plot.</p><p id="Par40">A limitation of this analysis is the relatively small sample size, so these findings need to be validated with larger cohorts in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par41">The above results emphasize the importance of addressing variability to attain tight glycemic control. The glycemic risk plot tells us that it is important to reduce variability if the risk of both hypo- and hyperglycemia is to be improved. Without addressing variability, there will be a trade-off of improving either the risk of hypo- or hyperglycemia at the expense of the other. Analysis of CGM data confirmed this prediction by showing that simultaneous improvement in hypoglycemia risk and hyperglycemia risk was strongly correlated with reduction in variability. Graphical tools such as the glycemic risk plot can be used to educate patients about the importance of addressing glycemic variability and the magnitude of variability improvement needed to improve eA1c without introducing the risk of hypoglycemia. Other tools are needed to help patients identify and address therapy management issues and lifestyle choices that contribute to glycemic variability.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par36">One type 1 individual who showed an increase in variability (&#x00394;Variability&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;mg/dl) showed a significant reduction in eA1c (&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.7%) and a negligible reduction in MB70 (&#x02212;&#x000a0;1.5&#x000a0;min).
