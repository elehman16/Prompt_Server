Both pharmacological therapy and exercise training can improve exercise capacity; however, these are often not sufficient to change the amount of daily physical activity a patient undertakes. Behaviour-change self-management programmes are designed to address this, including setting motivational goals and providing social support. We present and discuss the necessary methodological considerations when integrating behaviour-change interventions into a multicentre study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>PHYSACTO is a 12-week phase IIIb study assessing the effects on exercise capacity and physical activity of once-daily tiotropium+olodaterol 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g with exercise training, tiotropium+olodaterol 5/5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g without exercise training, tiotropium 5&#x02005;&#x000b5;g or placebo, with all pharmacological interventions administered via the Respimat inhaler. Patients in all intervention arms receive a behaviour-change self-management programme to provide an optimal environment for translating improvements in exercise capacity into increases in daily physical activity. To maximise the likelihood of success, special attention is given in the programme to: (1) the Site Case Manager, with careful monitoring of programme delivery; (2) the patient, incorporating patient-evaluation/programme-evaluation measures to guide the Site Case Manager in the self-management intervention; and (3) quality assurance, to help identify and correct any problems or shortcomings in programme delivery and ensure the effectiveness of any corrective steps. This paper documents the comprehensive methods used to optimise and standardise the behaviour-change self-management programme used in the study to facilitate dialogue on the inclusion of this type of programme in multicentre studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards, Independent Ethics Committee and Competent Authority according to national and international regulations.

Programme variations, together with the level of care providers' expertise (eg, the case manager), can have a profound impact on treatment outcomes. Published studies provide little guidance, lacking the necessary details (eg, type, quantity, timing and method of delivery; tools used; quality-assurance methods) to replicate or inform adaptations of the intervention.</p><p>This paper presents and discusses new approaches for the implementation of a behaviour-change self-management programme into a multicentre study in COPD, with special attention paid to methodological issues (intervention design, delivery and surveillance/quality control). This is illustrated with the PHYSACTO study, a phase IIIb study designed to assess the effect of a new COPD maintenance bronchodilator therapy and supervised exercise training on exercise capacity (primary outcome as measured by the endurance shuttle walk test) and physical activity (secondary outcomes including the amount of physical activity (measured using the PROactive tool) and perceived difficulties). The inclusion of the behaviour-change self-management programme in all intervention arms (including placebo) provides an optimal environment for translation of improvements in exercise tolerance into increases in physical activity. The objectives with respect to the behaviour-modification programme are to explore the extent to which potential moderating variables (eg, motivation, self-efficacy, cognitive function, anxiety and depression, and external and internal barriers) could influence the increase in physical activity during everyday tasks. A self-management programme such as this, based on complex interactions, is associated with several specific challenges, which we will describe, including how to ensure the intervention is delivered consistently &#x02018;per protocol&#x02019; by intervention providers across this multicentre study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>PHYSACTO is a 12-week, randomised, partially double-blind, placebo-controlled, multisite, international, four-parallel group study (NCT02085161) in patients with a diagnosis of COPD.

Full inclusion and exclusion criteria are detailed elsewhere<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and will not be discussed here.

Most exercise-intervention studies in chronic diseases published to date have focused on targeting the patient via educational programmes, counselling or exercise programmes, in order to achieve changes in daily physical activity.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Our approach is designed to effect changes in patient behaviour by: building on the experience, training and effectiveness of case managers; standardising the content of the programme across sites; helping case managers adjust the programme based on patient responses using a standardised feedback process; and including quality-assurance steps throughout the programme. Because PHYSACTO is a multicentre study, we have to ensure that delivery of the behaviour-change self-management programme can be standardised across different locations, while also ensuring that individual patient needs, preferences and personal goals inform the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The Site Case Manager: selection and training</title><p>The Site Case Manager (SCM) is required to have a minimum of 2&#x02005;years' experience working with patients with COPD and recognised expertise in the area. To optimise the quality and impact of the behaviour-change intervention, we provide 3&#x02005;days of standardised training to the SCMs in evidence-based behaviour-change techniques (eg, motivational communication, goal setting, reinforcement and problem solving) that is supplemented by online tutorials (training reviews, case studies) and systematic feedback from the behaviour-modification team if performance is judged to be unsatisfactory. This training is based on the self-management educational programme &#x02018;Living Well with COPD&#x02019;,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> which is designed to help patients with COPD and their families cope with their disease on a daily basis, while a reference guide can assist the healthcare professionals in engaging with their patients and facilitating improved disease self-management.</p><p>The programme has been adapted for the current study by focusing on improving patient engagement in, and maintenance of, exercise and physical activity. An important element of the educational programme is training in the principles of behaviour change and methods to engage, motivate and build patient confidence. Basic training in motivational communication skills includes using open questions and building motivation to engage patients in more physical activity, using reflective listening to manage and overcome resistance, and providing information by offering, sharing and asking patients for feedback.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>The educational programme</title><p>The educational programme schedule for patients starts with an individual induction session at the beginning of the intervention period, followed by group sessions at weeks 2, 5, 8 and 11, with another individual session at follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010109F2">figure 2</xref>). The sessions are led by the SCM, who guides the patient in self-management behaviours that aid in achieving physical activity goals, while improving daily COPD management.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010109F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Overview of the behaviour-change programme. COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010109f02"/></fig><p><italic>Individual induction session</italic>: During the individual induction session, the SCM performs an assessment to determine the patient's current level of physical activity, functional limitations and any clinical barriers to physical activity (including motivation). The patient is also given a printed booklet from the &#x02018;Living Well with COPD&#x02019; programme, described further below. The patient's ultimate goal is defined at this stage as their desired achievements in work, home and leisure by the end of the programme. The SCM coaches the patient to define and reach their ultimate physical-activity goal (eg, what they will be able to do at the end of the programme, such as being able to play in the park with their grandchildren). This ensures that the patient remains engaged and motivated in the pursuit of their physical activity goals. This is followed by instructions on the use of the pedometer (including a demonstration by the patient to test competency), which is subsequently used during the study for setting intermediate goals (eg, number of daily steps before the next session). The educational materials provided to the patient specify an example of an objective for patients. These materials state: &#x0201c;Your first objective will be to add 1000 steps to your daily average. Maintain this level over a 1-month period. If you reach your goal, add another 1000 steps and maintain this for 1&#x02005;month. Keep increasing your objective in this way until you have reached 5000 to 6000 steps per day. If your condition allows it, you can keep increasing up to 10,000 steps per day.&#x0201d; The SCM records the patient's progress throughout the study using a patient worksheet (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> 1). For each session, there is also an itemised session evaluation that is completed by the SCM (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary appendix</xref> 2). Patient worksheets, session-evaluation forms and patient-evaluation/programme-evaluation questionnaires remain with the SCM throughout the study in order to track patient progress.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010109.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary appendix 1</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2015-010109supp_appendix1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010109.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary appendix 2</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2015-010109supp_appendix2.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p><italic>Group sessions</italic>: At the 90&#x02013;120&#x02005;min group sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010109F2">figure 2</xref>), the SCM explains the benefits of physical activity and setting physical-activity goals. Patients select and review their own personal goals and sign a &#x02018;learning contract&#x02019; as a symbolic gesture to formalise these goals (group session 2, week 5). Patients also receive education on their disease, healthy life habits, stress management, breathing techniques, exercise planning and how to distinguish normal from abnormal physical symptoms. In order to respond to the changing needs of individual patients, the educational programme is designed to allow for adjustment of the programme components, as required.</p><p>Group sessions are also used to identify any barriers that may have prevented patients from reaching their physical-activity goals, with patients regularly reflecting on their progress and reviewing their goals on paper. These sessions are supplemented with the &#x02018;Living Well with COPD&#x02019; programme booklet, which contains topics on promotion of physical activity, COPD and medication, breathing and energy-conservation techniques, stress and anxiety management, and improving health behaviours. Patients are assigned sections to read after each session, and each topic concludes with a series of questions to test understanding.</p><p>Patients' comprehension, attitudes and skills are assessed throughout the intervention to determine if they have met pre-established goals and objectives. Several methods are used to supplement information and correct misunderstandings in a constructive way, as well as reinforce newly acquired skills and behaviours. These methods include direct open questioning, problem-solving exercises, simulations (patients demonstrate a proposed technique, such as using an inhaler) and direct observation. Throughout the intervention, patients are asked to repeat key instructions and summarise in their own words what they have learned and understood. When patients do not achieve their goals and objectives, the educational plan is revised and other methods are used for education and building skills.</p><p><italic>Follow-up session</italic>: The inclusion of a follow-up session as part of the behaviour-change programme allows the SCM to review with the participants their motivation to continue to pursue their physical-activity goals. Barriers and facilitators to continuing physical activity and possible solutions are discussed. Finally, patients are thanked for their participation and encouraged to continue to apply the skills learned throughout the programme.</p><p><italic>Individualised interventions</italic>: In order to respond to the changing needs of individual patients with COPD as they progress through the study, the behaviour-change programme is designed to allow for adjustments. These adjustments are based on feedback from the participants to the SCM during the group sessions and analysis of the results of the change-programme process-evaluation tools completed by study participants at each intervention visit. These measures are described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Behaviour-change process measures</title><p>An important note in terms of patient evaluation is the difference between outcome measures and process measures (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010109TB1">table 1</xref>).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;34</xref> In clinical studies, outcome measures are used to test the effects of the intervention on the patient; in this case, exercise capacity, the difficulty and amount of daily activity, and other study end points described above. The SCMs are blinded to the outcome measures during the study.

Particular focus is directed towards the SCM, the patient (including patient evaluation), and defining and implementing quality-assurance activities. The incorporation of a behaviour-change self-management programme in this clinical trial aims to demonstrate that, with the use of long-acting bronchodilators and behavioural self-motivation interventions, there is potential to not only influence exercise capacity but also improve the amount and effort of physical-activity performance in patients with COPD. Self-management programmes have been proposed as the best way to assist patients in acquiring and practising the necessary skills to control their disease symptoms on a daily basis and to implement healthy behaviours.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The premise is that if patients receive effective self-management support, they can be empowered to adopt the behaviours needed to cope optimally with their disease, so that many of the poor outcomes related to chronic disease can be averted. However, studies have not been consistent in demonstrating benefits. From a recent literature review,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> significant improvements in physical activity in patients with COPD were shown in five out of eight evaluable studies. The five successful studies were based on theoretical models of behaviour change and included exercise interventions of approximately 30&#x02005;min, 3&#x02013;5 times a week. Behavioural interventions ranged from counselling and personal contact to educational pamphlets.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> This study builds on this insight by including and documenting a comprehensive, well-defined behavioural self-management intervention programme designed specifically to effect change in patients' physical activity.</p><p>The effectiveness of any complex intervention, such as self-management in patients with COPD, crucially depends on the healthcare professionals and the delivery of the intervention to the patient. Most studies published to date give little attention to personnel and processes. In our study, SCMs are required to have recognised expertise in COPD and at least 2&#x02005;years' experience in order to participate. In addition, SCMs are provided with 3&#x02005;days' training based on the self-management educational programme &#x02018;Living Well with COPD&#x02019;. SCMs are also supported through educational opportunities and feedback during the study by the CCMs and the GBC team.</p><p>There is still no accepted best practice for the level of qualification and training required for the SCM, and no evidence that training is effective. However, it is generally accepted that training in behaviour-change and self-management skills is needed. SCMs are likely to benefit from having at least basic training in the principles of behaviour change, as well as basic training in motivational communication skills, including methods to engage, motivate and build confidence in patients. However, one of the most important challenges to overcome is the gap between how the intervention is designed to be delivered and how the SCM actually delivers it. This gap is clearly underestimated or underevaluated in most behavioural studies, as well as in practice. Furthermore, being able to assess and provide feedback to the SCM is necessary to ensure best practice.</p><p>In our study, we planned and implemented several quality-assurance assessments to reduce the potential of failing to deliver the intervention in the way it was intended. All sessions between patients and SCMs are audio-recorded and randomly assessed for quality assessment and feedback, the programme delivery is assessed in a standardised way (including careful monitoring and recording of the use of motivational communication skills with patients) and feedback on SCM performance is provided and followed up to assess the effectiveness of any corrective steps. Evaluating whether the SCM intervention is delivered as intended is the most important part of quality assurance, and a crucial and novel methodological consideration in this study.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>The international, multisite design of this study is a significant challenge. Audio files of SCMs' performances have to be reviewed using a standardised data-extraction sheet by a CCM who acts as a country-specific cultural and language liaison. Finally, we have in place a GBC team that reviews all the data-extraction forms and provides systematic and timely feedback to the CCM.</p><p>Another very important methodological aspect of this study is the attention we give to relevant &#x02018;enablers&#x02019; for behaviour modification in attempting to effect change in patients' levels of physical activity, while acknowledging that physical activity is itself a behaviour. It is well recognised that it is important to equip patients with the proper techniques and skills (eg, knowledge and confidence) required to effectively self-manage their condition. Furthermore, enhancing patients' motivation to change and overcome ambivalence is crucial. This is best achieved using patient-centred, motivational communication techniques that encourage participants to express their intrinsic motivations to adopt certain health behaviours (eg, consistent with their values or life goals). Questionnaires to assess the process of change have been adapted for this study and are completed by the patient (with the SCM) at multiple time points to evaluate progress. These questionnaires assess motivation, perceived competency (confidence), readiness to change and expectancies of physical activity. The main purpose of these process measures is to inform the SCM of a patient's progress and to help direct and individualise the self-management intervention.</p><p>The results of these questionnaires inform the personalised delivery of the behavioural intervention to patients based on their readiness to change and progress in the programme. To date, most studies have limited assessments to trial outcome measures. By including process measures, the intent is to not only intervene more effectively during the course of the intervention but also gather information that could facilitate the interpretation of study outcomes.</p><p>To date, most published randomised clinical studies with behaviour interventions have not described the specific components of the intervention, nor have they included or described process measures to track changes in patients' behaviour and make individualised adjustments to enhance the effects of this therapy. As such, evidence of established processes and procedures for the implementation and monitoring of behavioural studies is lacking. Being able to better define and implement such a programme, and making it accessible in practice, would be highly valuable. However, this can only be accomplished by raising the standards and quality of evidence-based behaviour interventions and programmes. This multicentre study is a first step towards integrating a more coherent and careful plan at the patient, provider (health professional/case manager) and system or organisational levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This is the first study to use a multifactorial intervention to improve exercise capacity and physical activity in patients with COPD, incorporating pharmacotherapy, exercise training and behaviour change.
