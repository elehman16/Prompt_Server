This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of robot-assisted placement of SI screws compared with a freehand technique.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Thirty patients requiring posterior pelvic ring stabilization were randomized to receive freehand or robot-assisted SI screw fixation, between January 2016 and June 2016 at Beijing Jishuitan Hospital. Forty-five screws were placed at levels S1 and S2. In both methods, the primary end point screw position was assessed and classified using postoperative computed tomography. Fisher's exact probability test was used to analyze the screws&#x02019; positions. Secondary end points, such as duration of trajectory planning, surgical time after reduction of the pelvis, insertion time for guide wire, number of guide wire attempts, and radiation exposure without pelvic reduction, were also assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Twenty-three screws were placed in the robot-assisted group and 22 screws in the freehand group; no postoperative complications or revisions were reported. The excellent and good rate of screw placement was 100% in the robot-assisted group and 95% in the freehand group. The <italic>P</italic> value (0.009) showed the same superiority in screw distribution. The fluoroscopy time after pelvic reduction in the robot-assisted group was significantly shorter than that in the freehand group (median [Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>]: 6.0 [6.0, 9.0] s vs. median [Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>]: 36.0 [21.5, 48.0] s; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 13.590, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); no difference in operation time after reduction of the pelvis was noted (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 1.990, <italic>P</italic> = 0.158). Time for guide wire insertion was significantly shorter for the robot-assisted group than that for the freehand group (median [Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>]: 2.0 [2.0, 2.7] min vs. median [Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>]: 19.0 [15.5, 45.0] min; <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 20.952, respectively, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

It was first described by Routt and has steadily gained popularity, with advantages of minimal invasion to compromised soft tissue, limited blood loss, and decreased infection rates, compared to conventional open techniques.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, it requires detailed knowledge and experience to accurately correlate the sacral osseous landmarks with their corresponding fluoroscopic images and find a secure screw corridor using rotating inlet, outlet, and lateral fluoroscopic views,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] because incorrect placement of SI screws may result in implant-related and neurovascular complications.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Statistically, the rates for malposition of the screw under fluoroscopic guidance have been reported to range from 2% to 15%,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] with an incidence of neurologic injury between 0.5% and 7.7%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Given this, fluoroscopy and computer-assisted techniques have been widely used to achieve an accurate screw placement. Currently, the conventional freehand fluoroscopy technique is very common for intraoperative visualization realized via image intensifier, which is possible in only one plane at a time, meanwhile requiring complex hand-eye coordination.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] As such, it is a highly demanding and challenging operative technique. Recently, computer-assisted orthopedic surgery, which potentially increases the accuracy and efficiency of percutaneous targeting, has utilized image navigation systems and purpose-built robots. The two-dimensional (2D) or 3D-fluoroscopy-based navigation system makes it possible for simultaneous representation in up to four planes, which means a substantial improvement for the operator.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moreover, this advantage reduces the time of repeated C-arm movements during surgery and optimizes precise and simultaneous visualization of the surgical instruments in relation to the patient's anatomy in all the desired image planes. However, navigation does not solve the problem of precise manipulation of guide wire insertion and calculate the screw trajectory, which can be expediently alternated with a robot application. Robot-assisted orthopedic surgery is believed to potentially improve the precision of implant placement and decrease radiation and operative time. Several manufacturers research and produce hardware and software products for orthopedic surgery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Notably, TiRobot&#x02122; is an orthopedic surgery robot which can be used for implantation of SI screws, especially useful in SI screw fixation for unstable pelvic injury. The method, studied in cadaver and cohort studies, has shown a high accuracy. To date, there has been no report describing a direct comparison of robot assistance with the freehand technique. This study is designed to evaluate the accuracy of robot-assisted placement of SI screws in comparison with the freehand conventional technique.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The ethics committee of Beijing Jishuitan Hospital Ethics Committee approved the present clinical study (No. 20150504).

A multidisciplinary team of professionals made the diagnosis. Each patient included in this study had to fulfill the following criteria: (1) aged older than 18 years, (2) indication for posterior pelvic ring stabilization using SI screws, and (3) informed consent to participate in the study. Patients were randomized to conventional fluoroscopy-assisted freehand SI screw placement or robot-assisted SI screw placement in a 1:1 ratio (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02890043).</p><p>Three experienced trauma orthopedic surgeons familiar with both techniques, that is, conventional freehand SI screw implantation and the robot-assisted implantation, performed the surgical procedures in equal proportions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Study design</title><p>Based on random, open, parallel-controlled design, this study adopted an electronic interactive web response system for central randomization to separate the participants into a robot-assisted group and a freehand group.

The surgical record covered the duration of surgeries and planning, radiation exposure, number of guide wire attempts, and other indicators. Another experienced surgeon, who did not attend this study, carried out the review process, based on the screw's position in the image after the surgery.

The upper posterior quadrant, forming an intersection between a line parallel to the femoral diaphysis and another line perpendicular to the anterior superior iliac spine, was the site of insertion. Under imaging control, a guide wire was passed from the lateral edge of the ilium, perpendicular to the SI joint toward the body of the first sacral vertebra. Lateral views of the sacrum were taken to confirm the correct positioning of the guide wire within the safe zone, avoiding the placement of an &#x0201c;in-out-in&#x0201d; screw, as described by Routt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A 7.0-mm cannulated screw was then inserted and directed perpendicularly to the SI articulation while chondral surfaces were avoided.

The optical tracking device locates the spatial position of the robot arm and the patient through the robot tracker and patient tracker correspondingly. The calibrator is used for acquiring mapping relation between the imaging space and the surgical space through fluoroscopic images&#x02019; matching coordinates in the calibrator images.

At the beginning of the surgical procedure, the patient was prepared through positioning, sterilizing, and draping. The patient tracker was fixed on the contralateral anterior superior iliac spine of the surgical side and a C-arm was placed on the same side of the patient. All parts of the robot were placed on the distal side of the patient, while the robot tracker and calibrator were assembled at the distal end of the robot arm. After the calibrator was fixed, pelvic inlet, outlet, and lateral intraoperative fluoroscopic images were taken. The fluoroscopic images were automatically imported into the planning and controlling workstation. Based on these fluoroscopic images, the surgeon planned the surgical trajectory for SI screw insertion and generated spatial positioning orders for the robot arm. The arm was moved automatically according to orders from the surgical planning and controlling workstation and completed the surgical trajectory positioning.</p><p>During the positioning process, the surgeon controlled accuracy through adjusting the screw trajectory on the fluoroscopic image, as necessary. When the positioning accuracy was &#x0003c;1.00 mm, the guide wire was placed into the sleeve. The instrumentation was then concluded through implantation and fixation of the SI screw over the guide wire without the assistance of the robot. Following the implantation, the surgeon verified accuracy through a comparison between the inserted screw's position and the intraoperative planned screw's position through fluoroscopy.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Study parameters</title><p>The primary end point of the study was the position of the SI screws, assessed using a postoperative computed tomography (CT) scan.

As a result, the future of these devices is unpredictable. The most common application of computer-assisted orthopedic surgery in trauma is in the placement of iliosacral screws. Pelvic fixation &#x0201c;opportunity tunnels&#x0201d; are narrow and multiplanar images are necessary to avoid damage to vulnerable nearby neurovascular structures, such as the L5 and S1 nerve roost, cauda equina at the level of the first sacral vertebra, and the crossing of the femoral vein and artery superior to the superior pubic bone.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Pelvic ring injuries that are treated with iliosacral screws, using image-guided navigation, show 96% of well-placed screws in postoperative radiographs and CT scans,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but a medical robotic system has not yet been established for percutaneous iliosacral screw placement. In contrast to navigation, robots not only allow the surgeon to know the alignment of the guide wire in real time corresponding to intraoperative fluoroscopy, but also guide or assist the surgeon to perform the operation. Medical robotic systems for orthopedic surgery have been developed, but most studies about robot-assisted iliosacral surgery are based on studies using cadavers.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In this prospective study, in terms of a relatively large number of patients, we aimed to determine whether the percutaneous iliosacral screw implantation could be optimized, through evaluating the grade of position and whether the intraoperative radiation exposure could be reduced using a robot-assisted technique.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The central finding of this study is that the accuracy of the robot-assisted technique was superior to the conventional freehand technique. Furthermore, intraoperative radiation exposure was reduced with robotic assistance. Surprisingly, the operation time after pelvic reduction was not different between the groups. This finding indicates that the setup of the TiRobot&#x02122; navigation system is not cumbersome or tends to take up too much additional time, (usually only 5 min), which we propose is an acceptable amount of time for a new technique. Moreover, the time for guide wire implantation was significantly shorter in the robot-assisted group than in the freehand group, owing to a reduced number of guide wire attempts and an increase in stable, precise manipulation in the robot-assisted group. As proven in the current study, for S1 and S2 instrumentation, robot-assisted navigation can increase the accuracy of the implant position and reduce intraoperative radiation exposure. In addition, the robot-assisted navigation system has the advantages of avoiding: (1) multiple false passages that may be of potential harm to patients (e.g., an error in positioning the sacral passage could result in nerve root damage); (2) multiple drill holes that may lead to screw loosening; and (3) joint penetration through inaccurate measurement and positioning of the implant. Therefore, several aspects may have contributed to the superior results of our study.</p><p>The most important safety aspect of TiRobot&#x02122; was derived from the electro-optical camera and the robot arm, based on a specific biplane orientation algorithm to realize a high-precision and stable operation. The novel biplane algorithm can calculate the screw trajectory, depending on two intraoperative fluoroscopy images. According to the calculated surgical trajectory, the robot arm moves automatically to the right position and maintains a precise and steady sleeve. During the robot arm movement, the electro-optical navigation system can monitor the sleeve over the planning trajectory in real time. Therefore, an excellent intraosseous screw position was found in most complete cases with TiRobot&#x02122; assistance, which is likely due to fluoroscopy-based navigation in combination with the semi-active robot guide. Another safety aspect of using the applicable and modularized design of the robot structure is avoiding complications in the assembly process, which lead to reducing the setup time of the TiRobot&#x02122;. Generally, it is not necessary to repeatedly verify the surgical trajectory using intraoperative fluoroscopy. The high precision of the specific biplane orientation software, based on two intraoperative fluoroscopy images, could explain the reduction of radiation exposure to the robot-assisted group.</p><p>Most studies reporting robot use in pelvic trauma were performed on saw bone or cadaveric bone. That is a different scenario from real life, with no soft-tissue tethers. The safety and accuracy of robot-assisted orthopedic surgery, measured through the number of drilling attempts, screw positioning, and radiation time, have been shown to be superior to conventional techniques. However, there are some disadvantages with the robot-assisted navigation system: (1) the surgeon must be constantly aware of the position of the navigation machine and should avoid the path between the trackers and the detector. Blocking the field of view of these cameras will cause loss of tool reference, which might be frustrating, but is not critical for the operation; (2) inserting trackers in the iliac spine for registration is an extra step that must be undertaken. It carries minimal risk but definite discomfort to the patient. It has to be undertaken so as not to be on the placement site of the implant and also it has to be placed for the navigation machine to detect it at all times; and (3) using a robot-assisted navigation system adds to the cost of the surgery, including the cost of the machine, the cost of the personnel responsible to operate the machine, and the cost of replacing trackers when they have decreased sensitivity. However, the technology may be already implemented in other hospital service lines, such as neurosurgery or arthroplasty, and a transfer to orthopedic use is likely to be less demanding in that case.</p><p>There are some limitations to this study. We demonstrate a comparative study between a robot-assisted technique and a conventional freehand technique. However, the required image-aided navigation technique has not been involved in the present study. The second limitation is the lack of long-term functional outcome results. Our study does confirm the superior accuracy and efficiency of the TiRobot&#x02122; system in SI screw fixation for unstable pelvic injury, thus warranting future studies to further define its potential clinical role.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. F010401) and the National Key Research and Development Program of China during the 13<sup>th</sup> Five-Year Plan Period (No. 2016YFC0105802).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank Mr. Zhen-Dong Guo from the Medical Robotic Engineering Laboratory for assistance in providing the photographs of the TiRobot&#x02122;.
