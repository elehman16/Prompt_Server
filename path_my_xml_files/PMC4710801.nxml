This represents a substantially higher level of depression than that found in the general population, where estimates are typically 5.0% [<xref rid="kev306-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Additionally, 25.1% of RA outpatients screen positive for anxiety, according to the 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7 [<xref rid="kev306-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) questionnaire [<xref rid="kev306-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and 16.3% of RA patients screen positive for both anxiety and depression [<xref rid="kev306-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Not only are prevalence levels of depression and anxiety high, but an analysis of the Early Rheumatoid Arthritis Network sample found that 12% of RA patients report persistently high levels of distress throughout the first 10 years after diagnosis [<xref rid="kev306-B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Depression and anxiety in RA have been shown to be associated with increased pain [<xref rid="kev306-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and fatigue [<xref rid="kev306-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], reduced quality of life [<xref rid="kev306-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and increased service use [<xref rid="kev306-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], disease activity [<xref rid="kev306-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and disability [<xref rid="kev306-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Depression in RA can also increase the risk of premature mortality [<xref rid="kev306-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The mechanism for the association between mood and disease outcomes is uncertain and probably bidirectional [<xref rid="kev306-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. There are several pathways through which psychological distress may impact health outcomes: distress can interfere with the stress response and produce glucocorticoid resistance [<xref rid="kev306-B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref>]. Additionally, depression/anxiety in RA may also reduce adherence to medication [<xref rid="kev306-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and inflate the reported severity of subjective symptoms such as pain, joint tenderness and physical dysfunction [<xref rid="kev306-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, depression/anxiety also impact on physical behaviour and may result in reduced movement, a deconditioning of the body, loss of natural endorphins and increasing levels of pain [<xref rid="kev306-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>There is systematic review evidence to suggest a downstream relationship between distress and disease outcomes, with depression increasing pain and disease activity, and decreasing short- and long-term treatment efficacy [<xref rid="kev306-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However the authors noted that the quality of the included research studies was low, with poor sampling and recruitment strategies, small sample sizes, inadequate adjustment for confounders and lack of information regarding randomization, measurement blinding and attrition rates. More research is needed to resolve these issues, which are of considerable clinical relevance because pharmacologic and psychological treatments could be used more widely to treat depression in RA if it is a substantial driver of disease activity.</p><p>This study aims to fill these gaps in the evidence by undertaking a secondary analysis of an existing randomized controlled trial in patients with early RA. We assessed three interrelated hypotheses: more symptoms of depression and anxiety at baseline status will predict increased DAS-28 and HAQ outcomes over a 2-year follow-up period; patients with persistent symptoms of depression and anxiety will show increased DAS-28 and HAQ outcomes over a 2-year follow-up period than will patients without such symptoms; and depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline will be associated with restricted treatment response to glucocorticoid treatment, measured via the HAQ and the DAS-28.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study comprised a secondary analysis of data collected as part of a factorial randomized controlled trial of glucocorticoids and combination DMARDs in patients with early RA: Combination Anti-Rheumatic Drugs in Early Rheumatoid Arthritis (CARDERA) [<xref rid="kev306-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This paper reports findings from a secondary data analysis only, and required no additional ethical approval.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in the trial were 467 consecutively recruited patients from rheumatology outpatient clinics across 42 centres in England and Wales. The inclusion criteria for enrolment were: ability to give informed consent; aged over 18 years; and active RA (determined by the ACR criteria) for &#x0003c;2 years, with three of the following: &#x02265;3 swollen joints; &#x02265;6 tender joints; morning stiffness for &#x02265;45 min; ESR of &#x02265;28 mm/h. Patients were excluded according to the following criteria: other inflammatory arthropathies; current use of oral glucocorticoids; serious physical comorbidities; women with the possibility of pregnancy; contraindications for drug trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>Detailed summaries of the intervention content are provided in the original trial article [<xref rid="kev306-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In short, patients were randomly allocated to receive one of four treatment options: (i) MTX (commencing 7.5 mg weekly, increasing incrementally to 15 mg/week target dose); (ii) MTX and ciclosporin (started 3 months after MTX, commencing 100 mg/day, increasing incrementally to 3 mg/kg daily target dose); (iii) MTX and prednisolone (started alongside MTX, commencing 60 mg/day, reduced to 7.5 mg at 6 weeks, 7.5 mg daily between 6 and 28 weeks, and stopped by 34 weeks); and (iv) MTX and ciclosporin and prednisolone. Of the 467 randomized patients, 88 were lost to follow-up and 132 discontinued the intervention, spread relatively evenly across treatment groups.</p><p>The primary outcome of the original trial was the development of new erosions in X-rays of hands and feet; however, several secondary outcomes were also collected at baseline and at 6-monthly intervals for the duration of the 2-year trial. Secondary outcomes in the original trial included function, quality-of-life, disease activity and adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Symptoms of depression/anxiety</title><p>Rheumatology trials do not measure mood systematically using diagnostic interviews, or typically even with validated symptom severity scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 [<xref rid="kev306-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. We therefore relied upon patients&#x02019; responses to the depression/anxiety item of the EuroQoL (EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup>; [<xref rid="kev306-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). The EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> asks patients to respond to five health domains (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression) according to how they are feeling today. The depression/anxiety domain provides three answer options: I am not anxious or depressed; I am moderately anxious or depressed; or I am extremely anxious or depressed. Patients&#x02019; responses to this domain of the EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> at baseline were used to categorize patients into one of three baseline mood categories: no depression/anxiety; moderate depression/anxiety; extreme depression/anxiety. Although not a validated method of identifying mood disorders, there is evidence to suggest good sensitivity of similar one-item measures. Meta-analysis evidence from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests that one-item mood screening questionnaires have 84% sensitivity and 65% specificity [<xref rid="kev306-B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. We can be fairly certain that we have identified patients with depression/anxiety; however, there may also be patients with subthreshold psychological distress included in our groups. Therefore, rather than indicating the presence of a diagnosed mood disorder, we have used responses to this tool to quantify levels of general psychological distress in participants that, for the purposes of this study, we refer to as depression/anxiety symptoms.</p><p>The persistence of depression/anxiety symptoms throughout the course of the trial was also established using the responses to the EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup>. To examine the impact of persistent depression/anxiety symptoms on physical health outcomes, patients were categorized into four mutually exclusive groups, according to their EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> scores across all measurement time points: never reporting depression/anxiety symptoms; reporting depression/anxiety symptoms &#x0003c;50% of the time; reporting depression/anxiety symptoms &#x0003e;50% of the time; reporting depression/anxiety symptoms at every time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>Our primary outcomes are DAS-28 and HAQ [<xref rid="kev306-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The DAS-28 is the gold standard for measuring RA disease activity: it is recommended by all major RA guidelines; it is easily calculated, and widely accepted as a high-quality indicator of the value of treatment [<xref rid="kev306-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The HAQ [<xref rid="kev306-B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is a self-reported measure, recommended by clinical guidelines to measure functional ability [<xref rid="kev306-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Both the DAS-28 and HAQ are used widely, both as outcomes in clinical trials and in clinical practice, and were therefore selected as primary outcomes for the current analysis [<xref rid="kev306-B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="kev306-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Secondary outcomes of interest are the components of the DAS-28: tender joint count (TJC), swollen joint count (SJC), ESR and patient global assessment (PGA). We also examined the relationship between depression/anxiety symptoms and the odds of reaching clinical remission at the study end point. This was assessed through establishing the number of patients scoring &#x0003c;2.6 on the DAS-28 at 2-year follow-up [<xref rid="kev306-B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These were included in the current analysis as secondary outcomes, and were all measured at 6-, 12-, 18- and 24-months following baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Multilevel models were used to examine hypotheses 1 and 2, pooling across the CARDERA 2-year treatment arms. Multilevel modelling is designed to handle hierarchically nested data, allowing for missing outcome data, and accounting for variation both between participants and within patients over time. These models were estimated using Stata (version 11.0), which provides parameters in the form of unstandardized maximum likelihood estimates (<italic>b</italic> coefficients), which estimate magnitude and direction of changes in outcome variables associated with differences in predictor variables (in this case, depression/anxiety). All models included random intercepts to account for variation in the outcome variable across individuals. Assessment time was included as a dummy coded variable, with a random time slope to allow for variation in change in the outcome over time across individuals. Alongside the <italic>b</italic> coefficients, confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic>-values, we also calculated standardized mean difference effect sizes, to provide an estimate of the standardized effect size of depression/anxiety status on physical health outcomes.</p><p>Multilevel linear models for hypotheses 1 and 2 were created in two stages for continuous outcome variables at the post-intervention assessments. First, unadjusted models including only depression/anxiety status and time were estimated; second, adjusted models were estimated that additionally included age, gender, disease duration, time, baseline level of physical health, the type of treatment received and RF status. Additionally, in models of DAS-28 outcomes, HAQ scores were adjusted for; in models of HAQ outcomes, DAS-28 scores were adjusted for. Additional logistic regression models, adjusting for the same variables, were created to assess whether baseline depression/anxiety and persistent depression/anxiety predicted clinical remission at 2 years.</p><p>To assess hypothesis 3, a multiple regression model was created, examining the interaction between baseline depression/anxiety status and the receipt of steroidal treatment on physical health outcomes over the initial 6 months of treatment. Follow-up responses were limited to the first 6 months of treatment due to the step-down treatment regime utilized [<xref rid="kev306-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and in order to examine the short-term treatment response that is appropriate for this medication type. The regression model for hypothesis 3 was adjusted for age, gender, disease duration, baseline physical health and RF status.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participant characteristics</title><p>Of the original 467 participants randomized in the CARDERA trial, 379 (81.2%) completed the trial and were included in this secondary analysis. <xref ref-type="table" rid="kev306-T1">Table 1</xref> shows the baseline demographic, clinical and psychological variables for participants.

After adjusting for age, gender, disease duration, time, treatment type, baseline level of disease activity and HAQ scores, patients with extreme baseline depression/anxiety showed significantly increased levels of follow-up DAS-28 in comparison with patients with no depression/anxiety at baseline.

Examination of the components of the DAS reveal that the subjective elements of TJC and PGA are those most consistently associated with mental health, although strong effect sizes were found for SJC outcomes in relation to persistent depression/anxiety symptoms. These results support previous systematic review findings that depression/anxiety influences long-term disease activity. Rathbun <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s [<xref rid="kev306-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] systematic review concludes that longitudinal assessments of the relationships between depression/anxiety and downstream physical health outcomes are limited by small sample sizes, poor recruitment strategies, a lack of control of confounding variables and a lack of information regarding randomization, measurement blinding and attrition levels. The strength of this paper is that it directly addresses these limitations: we had a larger sample size than all but one of the studies included in Rathbun <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s [<xref rid="kev306-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] systematic review, recruited consecutively from outpatient clinics from multiple centres across the UK; we adequately controlled for many potential confounders, including demographic and clinical variables; and full information about the randomization process and attrition levels are available in the original RCT paper [<xref rid="kev306-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We were also able to assess the impact of depression/anxiety on a range of both subjectively and objectively reported outcomes.</p><p>Our results suggest that symptoms of depression/anxiety may reduce the body&#x02019;s ability to respond to glucocorticoid treatment. This association was significant for only one outcome, the HAQ measure of physical disability, although moderate effect sizes were found for several other outcomes, including DAS, TJC, PGA and ESR. Our failure to find this relationship in patients taking ciclosporin tentatively supports the evidence suggesting that depression/anxiety may induce a state of glucocorticoid resistance [<xref rid="kev306-B14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref>], and reduce response to steroidal treatments specifically.</p><p>More consistent relationships were found between depression/anxiety and subjectively measured components of the DAS-28: TJC and PGA. However, we found large and near-significant effect sizes when assessing the relationship between persistence of depression/anxiety over time and SJC. The adjustment made for baseline physical health in the analyses and the time points at which predictor and outcome variables were measured would imply the depression/anxiety status preceded the worsened physical health outcomes; however, we cannot claim the significant associations reported here to be causal relationships. Further research using time-lagged analysis or randomized controlled trials would allow confirmation of the direction of causality.</p><p>The limitations of the current study are as follows. First, the method of measuring depression/anxiety is suboptimal. The EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> is a generic measure of quality of life, and its one-item assessment of depression/anxiety is a far from ideal method of identifying depression/anxiety status [<xref rid="kev306-B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Rather, responses to this item may reflect a more general level of psychological distress, and the overlap between symptoms of depression and the somatic symptoms of RA may result in overestimating the number of patients with depression/anxiety. Despite this, the proportion of patients indicating a constant state of depression/anxiety in the current research are similar to prevalence estimates of depression/anxiety in RA, and the percentage of patients reporting extreme depression/anxiety at baseline are substantially lower than those prevalence estimates [<xref rid="kev306-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="kev306-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, although not a validated measure of depression/anxiety in RA, the number of patients identified via the EQ-5D<sup>TM</sup> may reflect an underestimation of the number of patients who would be classified as having probable depression/anxiety when measured with a more robust measurement tool, resulting in a reduction in effect size. Thus, the fact that we still found significant associations despite this indicates that further research is needed to replicate these findings using a validated measure for identifying depression/anxiety symptoms.</p><p>An additional concern is the representativeness of the sample for the wider RA population. People from a low socioeconomic status (SES) are less likely to participate in medical research, resulting in research samples that tend to represent higher SES groups [<xref rid="kev306-B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Low SES is associated with increased susceptibility to RA [<xref rid="kev306-B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and depression [<xref rid="kev306-B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and with worse disease activity, physical health and quality of life in RA [<xref rid="kev306-B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Patients&#x02019; SES was not measured as part of this study, making it impossible to establish the extent to which our results reflect patients from low SES groups, who are more at risk of experiencing poor health outcomes in RA. SES was not measured in the original clinical trial; therefore, we were unable to examine or control for it in our analysis. Future research would benefit from taking into account the SES levels present in the sample, controlling for this in any analysis, and attempting to replicate these results in a clinical rather than research sample.</p><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that both baseline and persistent symptoms of depression/anxiety predict several subjective and objective rheumatological outcome measures, after controlling for pertinent demographic and disease characteristics. These findings have several implications. First, mental health should be routinely measured in rheumatological randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohorts. Regardless of direction of causality, the association between rheumatological outcomes and depression/anxiety is strong, particularly for patient-reported outcomes such as PGA and TJC. Whatever the underlying mechanisms, we suggest that measuring depression/anxiety is an easily collected and significant psychomarker of rheumatological outcome.</p><p>Second, mental health status should be measured both before commencing treatment and throughout the course of treatment. There is substantial evidence that depression/anxiety is highly treatable in patients with co-existing physical disease [<xref rid="kev306-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="kev306-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], and even if treating depression/anxiety has no impact on rheumatological outcome, we suggest that given the high frequency of depression/anxiety in this context, identification and treatment of depression/anxiety might well be considered part of routine care, in line with the NICE guidelines [<xref rid="kev306-B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Third, research is required to determine whether treating depression/anxiety leads to improved rheumatological outcome, given that DAS-28 scores are used to make crucial treatment decisions and the relationships we report between increased baseline depression/anxiety and persistent depression/anxiety and increased disease activity suggest that the detection and management of depression/anxiety in clinical environments may be necessary for effective disease management [<xref rid="kev306-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Such an approach has been used with success in diabetes and coronary heart disease [<xref rid="kev306-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our results suggest the need for an RCT examining whether the treatment of depression/anxiety in RA impacts physical health outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>F.M. and M.H. receive salary support from the <funding-source>National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)</funding-source>
