</xref> Medications with significant antihistaminergic effects, such as diphenhydramine and certain antipsychotic agents, are commonly associated with daytime sleepiness. Previous studies have suggested that daytime sleepiness can impair cognition, including concentration and alertness, and may interfere with daily work and task performance.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>&#x02013;</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> In addition, daytime sleepiness may impair driving skills and increase risk for accidents. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) estimated that on average, 80,000 U.S. drivers fall asleep while driving every day, and up to 20% of all serious car crash injuries are associated with driver sleepiness, independent of the other major factor of driving under the influence of alcohol.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> The adverse impact of daytime sleepiness on personal health, performance, and well-being is therefore substantial, and translates into significant economic loss for both individuals and society.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

Subjects were evaluated for eligibility during a screening period of up to 14 days, during which all psychotropic medications were tapered off in a manner consistent with labeling recommendations and conventional medical practice. Subjects then completed a 3- to 7-day placebo washout period. At baseline (Day 0), subjects who continued to meetall study entry criteria were randomly assigned via an interactive voice response system (in a 1:1:1:1 ratio) to 1 of 4 treatment arms: lurasidone 80 mg/d (N = 125), lurasidone 160 mg/d (N = 121), quetiapine XR 600 mg/d (N = 119), or placebo (N = 121). Study medication was administered once daily in the evening with a meal or within 30 minutes after eating. Subjects assigned to lurasidone 80 mg/d started treatment at their target dose. Subjects assigned to lurasidone 160 mg/d started treatment at a dose of 120 mg/d for 2 days and were then increased to their target dose. Subjects assigned to quetiapine XR 600 mg/d were started at a dose of 300 mg/d for 2 days and were then increased to their target dose. The quetiapine XR dose of 600 mg/d was selected for use in this study because it is at the mid-point of the therapeutic dose range (400&#x02013;800 mg/d) for this agent, and has been shown to be effective and generally well-tolerated in the treatment of patients with acute schizophrenia.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">

The parameters of the mediation regression models were estimated separately for each of these outcome measures. The effects of ESS change scores on mediating changes in the outcome measures (agitation, cognitive, and functional performance) were estimated by a series of analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models, which included terms for baseline score, center, terms for main and interaction effects of ESS change scores, and treatment groups. The direct effect of treatment on change in ESS total scores (mediator) was estimated by ANCOVA, which included terms for baseline, center, and treatment. Because cognitive and UPSA-B assessments could be affected by cultural differences, analyses were performed for subjects in all sites as well as the subgroup recruited from U.S. sites.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>1</sup>
</xref> This approach may be limited by the ability and willingness of investigators to elicit and patients to report such adverse effects. In addition, we evaluated the effects of daytime sleepiness on key measures of treatment outcome, including severity of agitation, cognition, and functional capacity.</p><p>Change in the ESS total score was similar for lurasidone (at fixed daily doses of 80 mg and 160 mg) and placebo over 6 weeks in this study, with both groups showing a reduction in sleepiness from study baseline. Quetiapine XR (at a fixed daily dose of 600 mg) was associated with a significant mean increase in daytime sleepiness when compared to placebo or either dose of lurasidone. This effect persisted over the course of the study (6 weeks), which suggests that this adverse effect did not habituate over time. Markedly high daytime sleepiness (ESS total score &#x0003e;10) occurred significantly more often in the quetiapine XR group (19%) compared to placebo (13%) or either dose of lurasidone (10&#x02013;12%). These findings indicate that high levels of daytime somnolence occur in association with lurasidone and placebo at comparable rates, but are observed more frequently in association with quetiapine XR treatment. These results are consistent with differences in the rates of treatment-emergent somnolence reported as an adverse event in this study (lurasidone, 5.3%; quetiapine XR, 13.4%; and placebo, 0.8%).<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>We note that several prior studies have specifically examined sedating effects of quetiapine in patient populations. In a previous 1-day, crossover study of clinically stable patients with bipolar disorder, a single dose of quetiapine led to significant decrements in cognitive test performance and increased somnolence and daytime sleepiness compared to risperidone treatment.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> The increased rates of sedation observed in quetiapine XR&#x02013;treated patients in the current study are consistent with these observations.</p><p>Our findings that lurasidone is associated with lower levels of daytime sleepiness than quetiapine may be expected, based in part on the differential receptor pharmacology of these agents. Specifically, quetiapine is associated with high affinity at the H<sub>1</sub> receptor where it acts as an antagonist<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>

<sup>25</sup>
</xref> and has not been associated with impairments in cognition or high levels of sedation in prior studies. The relative propensity to induce sedation among multiple antipsychotic agents has been examined by Leucht etal<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref> in a multiple-treatments meta-analysis. Lurasidone was ranked as 6 and quetiapine as 11 out of 15 antipsychotic agents (higher number indicates greater sedation).<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>26</sup>
</xref>
</p><p>In this 6-week study, both lurasidone 80 mg/d and 160 mg/d dose groups, as well as quetiapine XR 600 mg/d, were associated with comparable and significant reductions in agitation, as assessed using the PANSS-EC subscale. However, using mediator regression modeling, daytime sleepiness associated with quetiapine XR treatment was found to be a mediator of change in agitation for quetiapine XR, but not for either dose of lurasidone. These results suggest that reduction in agitation may be accounted for, in part, by induction of sleepiness in patients treated with quetiapine XR, but not lurasidone.</p><p>An analysis of evaluable neurocognitive testing scores in the current study (using the CogState computerized cognitive battery) found that lurasidone 160 mg/d was superior to both placebo and quetiapine XR in cognitive performance at week 6.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> While the mechanistic basis for these observed improvements in cognition is not well understood, it is possible that the serotonin 5HT-7 receptor subtype (where lurasidone binds with high affinity and acts as an antagonist) plays a significant role in mediating these effects.<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>27</sup>
</xref> The change in the ESS total score associated with both lurasidone 80 mg/d and 160 mg/d dose groups, and quetiapine XR 600 mg/d, was not a significant mediator of change in the cognitive composite performance score. However, analysis of the ESS item scores showed that an increase in the ESS item score 6 (&#x0201c;propensity to doze when talking to someone&#x0201d;) was found to be associated with a worsening of cognitive performance in the quetiapine XR group compared to the lurasidone 160 mg/d group. These results suggest that cognitive performance may be adversely affected by specific types of soporific effects, as characterized by selected ESS items. This finding is consistent with the psychometric basis for the ESS, where items were intended to assess the level of sleepiness in situations known to vary in their soporific qualities.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> We note that the ESS composite score, which incorporates subjects&#x02019; impression of the likelihood to doze off or fall asleep while engaging in mostly passive activities, may not be a sufficiently sensitive correlate to cognitive performance. Among the 8 different situations, the ESS item &#x0201c;dozing while talking&#x0201d; is the only activity that involves the kind of attention, alertness, and active engagement required in social interactions. These results suggest that sleepiness experienced in specific situations, particularly sleepiness related to higher-level cognitive or social interactive tasks, may exert more influence on cognitive performance than other forms of somnolence.</p><p>Both the lurasidone 80 mg/d and 160 mg/d dose groups as well as the quetiapine XR 600 mg/d group were associated with comparable and significant improvement in functional capacity, as assessed using the UPSA-B. Daytime sleepiness associated with quetiapine XR treatment was found to be a mediator of change in functional capacity for quetiapine XR among subjects from U.S. sites, but not for either dose of lurasidone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, this relationship was not observed in non-U.S. subjects (or in the full study sample). It is possible that cultural differences make the UPSA-B less sensitive to change in functional capacity in non-U.S. regions.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> Our findings from the U.S. sites suggest that quetiapine XR&#x02013;associated daytime sleepiness may lead to impaired functional performance; this relationship between daytime sedation and functional capacity change was not observed for lurasidone or placebo, perhaps due to the lack of soporific effects induced by these treatments.</p><p>Some limitations of these findings should be noted. The fixed-dose design of the placebo-controlled trial from which these data were derived did not permit investigators an opportunity to individualize treatment and therefore optimize tolerability for each agent, including with regard to the level of daytime sleepiness or sedation. Although several studies have reported that ESS total scores correlated significantly with laboratory measures of mean sleep latency, such as the MSLT, in patients with various sleep disorders,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>28</sup>
</xref> Since patients with schizophrenia may have reduced insight, this could have reduced the accuracy of patient report regarding perceived levels of daytime sleepiness; however the differences observed among the treatment groups in this study suggest that the ESS is sensitive to change in this patient population. The regression model used for analyzing the mediating effect of daytime sleepiness on various treatment outcomes involved a statistical interaction term for treatment and change in the ESS total score. It is possible that the absence of a mediating effect for some ESS items may have been due to a lack of statistical power and limited range of the variables. Further studies are warranted to verify these exploratory analysis findings utilizing other antipsychotic agents to determine the generalizability of these results. The effect of lurasidone and quetiapine XR on measures of daytime sleepiness in longer-term treatment will be reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings underscore the observation that second-generation, atypical antipsychotic agents have distinct efficacy and adverse effect profiles, and hence are not easily interchangeable.<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> In this study, treatment with fixed-dose lurasidone 80 mg or 160 mg, administered for 6 weeks once daily in the evening, was associated with a reduction in daytime sleepiness, of similar magnitude to placebo, while treatment with quetiapine XR 600 mg was associated with a significant increase in self-reported daytime sleepiness compared to placebo. Our findings suggest that daytime somnolence may have a significant impact on cognitive and functional outcomes. In addition, these findings support the use of the ESS as a brief and practical tool for the assessment of daytime sleepiness in patients with schizophrenia and provide evidence for its sensitivity to change during treatment with antipsychotic agents.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Disclosures</title><p>This work was supported by Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc.</p><p>Dr. Siu has received payment for consulting from Pfizer Inc., Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., and the Center for Addiction and Mental Health at the University of Toronto.
