Such observations could help inform clinical decision-making following treatment withdrawal for either safety or efficacy-related reasons. In the 1-year double-blind period of ATTEST, although a greater proportion of patients achieved ACR20 at month 1 with infliximab versus abatacept, by month 3 responses were similar. Both biological agents demonstrated comparable efficacy compared with placebo at 6 months; further improvements were observed with abatacept over 1 year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> there were numerically fewer serious adverse events (SAE) and serious infections with abatacept versus infliximab over 1 year.</p><p>Here, we report the efficacy and safety from the 1-year open-label long-term extension (LTE) of ATTEST, in which all patients received open-label abatacept, regardless of double-blind treatment or treatment response.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>Patients had an inadequate response to methotrexate with active disease at randomisation, as previously described.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> Patients were randomly assigned (3:3:2), using a double-dummy regimen,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> to receive intravenous abatacept (&#x0223c;10 mg/kg based on weight range), infliximab (fixed-dose 3 mg/kg) or placebo, plus background methotrexate. Placebo-treated patients were switched to abatacept at month 6. At month 12, patients from each treatment group could enter the open-label LTE, during which they received abatacept every 28 days. For patients switching from infliximab, there was no washout period before the first abatacept infusion. Patients were monitored monthly, at each study visit. During the open-label LTE, physicians could add a non-biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drug and adjust corticosteroid and methotrexate doses. The active-controlled ATTEST trial, requested by the authorities, was initially powered to detect reductions in disease activity with abatacept versus placebo over 6 months. Although not powered for, comparisons in safety and efficacy between abatacept and infliximab were prespecified. The primary objective of the open-label LTE, however, was to evaluate safety in patients who remained on treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>Clinical efficacy was a secondary objective of this study, and results are presented at 6-month intervals during the open-label LTE for patients originally randomly assigned to either abatacept or infliximab, who received at least one abatacept infusion in the LTE; data for patients randomly assigned to placebo are not shown.

In the original abatacept group, improvements in disease activity achieved by the end of the double-blind period were maintained with continued abatacept treatment through the LTE. For patients switched from infliximab to abatacept at year 1, clinical efficacy benefits were maintained or increased following the switch. Observed efficacy benefits are supported by good retention rates, consistent with previous abatacept experience in this population.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>The majority of individual patients who switched to abatacept improved or maintained their treatment response or disease activity level at year 2, regardless of the initial response to infliximab. Many patients who had not achieved a response, or were still in high/moderate disease activity after 1 year of infliximab, achieved a response or improved their disease activity state with abatacept. In addition, the majority of patients achieving ACR 70 responses or DAS28 remission with infliximab maintained this response or state when switched. These data reassure the clinician that a patient treated with infliximab, who has experienced a good clinical response, may expect to have a continued good response with consistent safety if they are switched to abatacept; an important clinical consideration if patients are switched because of safety concerns.</p><p>Abatacept was generally safe and well tolerated during this study. Transitioning patients directly from infliximab to abatacept without a washout period did not result in higher overall frequencies of SAE or infections after switching medication, relative to previous double-blind infliximab treatment over 1 year; in particular, incidence rates of serious and opportunistic infections were lower after patients switched to abatacept. These data support previously published findings that demonstrated that switching directly from an anti-TNF to abatacept without a washout period was generally safe and well tolerated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref></p><p>The findings presented here should be considered within certain limitations. Efficacy data are based on as-observed analyses, which are vulnerable to dropouts; however, discontinuation rates were relatively low and, therefore, the findings probably provide an accurate representation of the randomly assigned population. It should be noted that the patient-level results reported here are post-hoc analyses, and caution should be used with such data. During the 1-year double-blind period, the infliximab dose could not be increased beyond 3 mg/kg, the recommended dosing regimen at the time of trial design. In the current clinical setting, many physicians use approved higher doses, although there has been extensive debate over the efficacy benefits of such dose escalation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> and reports of an increased incidence of infections with higher doses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> However, the objective of the current study was to assess safety and efficacy in patients who switch to abatacept, regardless of treatment response, and, thus, included patients responding to treatment with infliximab. Therefore, the fact that dose escalation of infliximab was not permitted in the double-blind period should not detract from these findings.</p><p>The definition of an &#x02018;inadequate response&#x02019; to therapy is changing, with clinical remission a clear therapeutic goal and LDAS an acceptable alternative in patients with long-standing, established disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> As such, patients and clinicians now have ever higher expectations of treatment. Physicians may consider switching patients who have achieved only moderate clinical improvements, such as an ACR 20 response or MDAS. The findings presented here suggest that abatacept is a viable treatment option for such patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Eve Guichard, Medicus International, for editorial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding</bold> This study was sponsored, and editorial support funded, by Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests</bold> MS, MD and MK have received grant support and consulting fees from Bristol-Myers Squibb.
