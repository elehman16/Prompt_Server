Multiple well-designed trials have confirmed that laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication (LNF) compares favorably with its open counterpart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>However, a small but significant number of patients (12% at 5 years in our initial experience) have persisting or recurrent GERD symptoms after antireflux surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. When a surgical complication has been ruled out, poor patient selection, psychological disorders associated or mimicking GERD (i.e. somatization, anxiety or depressive disorders), can play a role. Pre-operative identification of such psychological disorders could help orient patients to a psychological therapy instead of surgery.</p><p>The aim of this study is to identify psychological factors associated with poor surgical outcomes after antireflux surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This is a single institution prospective controlled trial, comparing patients undergoing a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication for GERD (LNF Group, n = 17, 13 females and 4 males) to patients undergoing an elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy for biliary colic (Control Group, n = 10, 9 females and 1 male). Patients were prospectively recruited between March 2002 and May 2003, from the outpatient consultations of a University Medical Centre (Centre for Minimal Access Surgery, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario).</p><p>The LNF Group was recruited among patients who were considering surgical treatment for the management of classical symptoms of GERD. All patients had pre-operative 24-hour pH monitoring, with GERD defined as a percentage time with pH&#x0003c;4 greater than 4% during 24 h, and a Demeester score greater that 14.3. Preoperative workup also included esophageal manometry and esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy.</p><p>A detailed questionnaire was used to assess GERD specific symptoms (heartburn, pain, regurgitation, dysphagia and fullness) and non-GERD symptoms (vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, loss of appetite and cough). Each symptom was scored as a product of severity (0 = none, 3 = severe) and frequency (0 = none, 4 = daily), for a GERD symptoms score ranging between 0 and 72 and a non-GERD symptoms score ranging between 0 and 48. This symptom score has been validated previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Patients with post-operative GERD symptoms score above 12 at 6 months (LNF Poor outcomes Group) were compared to the rest of the LNF Group (LNF Good outcomes Group). A score of 12 was chosen based on our previous experience with the GERD symptoms score (SS)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The SS showed a high responsiveness index, after LNF, which indicate that the instrument is highly sensitive. The minimal clinically important difference is about seven scale points. A 12 points score (on a 0 to 72 points scale) was considered to be a good cut-off point to consider that patients have ongoing or recurrent GERD symptoms.</p><p>The Control Group consisted in patients with typical biliary pain with radiologic evidence of cholelithiasis. This group represents patients with a specific disease entity that is expected to be cured with a surgical treatment.</p><p>Patients with known psychiatric or psychologic disorders were excluded, as well as patients with chronic pain syndrome.</p><p>The two groups had the same psychological assessment one month before surgery, at 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The following tests were administered:</p><p>- Symptom CheckList-90-R, somatization subset (SCL-90-R): a 12-item questionnaire that measures a current point-in-time somatization symptom complex as outlined in the DSM IV-R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale (0 to 4). A raw score can be calculated by dividing the summed total score by the number of items. That score is then referred to gender-appropriate norms for conversion to standard t-score, which may alternatively be expressed as a percentile. T-scores equal to or greater than 63 (90<sup>th </sup>percentile) for the global score index (on the 90 items) or in any two symptom dimensions warrants clinical workup. In this study, the summed total score was used for evaluation of somatization level.</p><p>- Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS): a 21-item instrument for distinguishing between features of depression, physical arousal, and psychological tension and agitation in clinical and non-clinical groups. It has acceptable to excellent internal consistency and concurrent validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Clinical range, based on normative data, is defined as scores of 16.57 or above for stress, 12.75 or above for anxiety, and 9.26 or above for depression.</p><p>- Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI): a 16-item self-report questionnaire measuring fear of anxiety-related symptoms. Each item is scored using a five point Likert type scale with endpoints of "very little" (0 points) and "very much" (4 points). The ASI yields a total score obtained by summing the rating across all items, with higher scores reflecting higher level of fear and concern regarding physical symptoms of anxiety. Psychometric data is available for community and clinical samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>];</p><p>- Illness Attitude Scale (IAS): a 29-item questionnaire that measures attitudes, fears and beliefs associated with the psychopathology of hypochondriasis and that of abnormal illness behavior. All items are self-rated on 5 points Likert scales, with endpoints of "no" (zero points) and "most of the times" (four points). The scores on the two subscales (Health Anxiety and Illness Behaviour) appear to differentiate between general medical outpatients (mean of 10.9 and 9.0 respectively), general practice patients (11.3 and 6.8) and subjects from the general population (9.1 and 4.7) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>- Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI): a 21-item scale designed to measure clinical depression, shown to have excellent psychometric properties. The original authors recommended cut-off scores for non depressed (&#x0003c;10), mildly depressed (10&#x02013;14), moderately depressed (15&#x02013;22) and severely depressed (23 +) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Ethic Board approval was obtained to collect these data.</p><p>A similar technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy or laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was used in all patients. In short, the surgical technique of LNF consisted in a 2 to 3 cm, 360 degree wrap with selective division of short gastric vessels and crura repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The technique of laparoscopic cholecystectomy included the dissection of Callot's triangle, identification and control of the cystic duct and cystic artery and retrograde dissection of the gallbladder bed.</p><p>Data were entered in an electronic database and results are expressed as a Mean &#x000b1; Standard Deviation. Statistical analysis was performed using a Student T tests and statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results of the pre-operative and 6-months psychological tests are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.

The influence of psychological factors in gastroesophageal reflux is unknown. Some studies suggest that both acid secretion and gastric motility are affected by emotions or stress, with some personality traits associated with labile basal acid secretion rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. McDonald et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] also showed that relaxation training can alter esophageal acid exposure and reflux symptoms reports in patients with GERD.</p><p>Baker et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] did a psychological assessment in 51 patients with GERD and in 43 age-matched controls. His results suggested that although most patients with GERD were psychologically similar to patients without GERD, a subset of psychologically distressed patients (depression, somatization, anxiety and intensity of reporting symptom distress, n = 15) were more likely to be found among patients with GERD. Similarly, Johnson et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] reported a greater rate of phobia, obsessionality and somatization disorders in patients who seek medical attention for heartburn, than in those who do not consult. Kamolz et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] evaluated the outcomes of laparoscopic antireflux surgery in patients with known anxiety disorders. In that study, surgery improved the quality of life and corrected the acid reflux with however less symptoms relief in some of the patients.</p><p>These results suggest that psychological factors can influence the perception and/or the severity of GERD. In this specific study, there was no significant difference in the preoperative psychological assessment between patients suffering from GERD and the control group. However, a subset of patients experienced ongoing GERD symptoms and this specific group had a significantly higher level of somatization, as demonstrated by a higher SCL-90-R, somatization subset score.</p><sec><title>GERD and somatization disorders</title><p>Somatoform disorders are defined as psychiatric disorders in which one or more <italic>unexplained </italic>physical symptoms are the central defining feature of the disease. They frequently have abdominal manifestations, occurring in 17% to 28% of patients with irritable bowel syndrome[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. They can also influence the surgical outcomes, by altering the patient's perception of pre- and post-operative symptoms and pain[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Clouse et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] demonstrated that patients with esophageal motility disorders score high on scales of somatic anxiety, depression and somatization. Baker et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also found that somatization disorders are more likely to be found among patients with GERD.</p><p>In this specific study, the SCL-90-R, somatization subset was used to assess somatoform disorders. It is a self-report questionnaire, developed by Clinical Psychometric Research in 1976[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is a reliable tool designed to reflect psychologic symptom patterns of individuals. The somatization subset used in this study measures somatization symptoms complex. Patients who experienced ongoing GERD symptoms after surgery had a significantly higher score on the somatization scale, compared to both the rest of the LNF Group and the Control Group.</p></sec><sec><title>GERD and depression disorders</title><p>Depression is one of the most frequent psychological disorder in the general population. As a result, its impact on GERD and surgical outcomes has been evaluated before. Kamolz et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] compared GERD symptoms in patients who had both GERD and major depression to a control group, before and after laparoscopic fundoplication. Atypical GERD symptoms (chest pain: 81.6% vs 37.4% and bloating: 92.2% vs 37.4%) were more predominant and graded as much more severe among patients with major depression. Also, all symptoms but dysphagia significantly improved after laparoscopic antireflux surgery in both groups but patients with major depression had a significantly higher rate of chest pain, bloating, and dysphagia. Power et al[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], in a series of 131 patients who had a laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, identified preoperative psychiatric history (major depression but also any psychogenic stressor) as an accurate predictor of LNF failure. Psychological history, especially with patients who have severe or refractory GERD symptoms, a positive review of systems or disrupted quality of life is thus essential. Patients with refractory GERD symptoms who have psychological issues and impaired quality of life may benefit more form integrated psychological care than referral to procedure oriented specialist[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In this specific study, there was no significant difference in the scores of Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Beck Depression Inventory between any of the groups. However, five patients in the LNF group had abnormal Beck depression inventory's scores that could suggest depressive disorders. Three patients normalized their BDI score 6 months after surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, the SCL-90-R Somatization Subset, measuring the level of somatization in a patient, may be useful to predict poor outcomes after antireflux surgery. Cognizance of psychological disorders could improve the selection of an optimal treatment for GERD and help reduce the rate of ongoing symptoms after LNF. Larger studies are however required to confirm these results.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The study was presented to the Society of American Gastroenterologist Endoscopic Surgeons, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in April 2005.</p></sec></ack><ref-list><ref id="B1"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nilsson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnsson</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Randomized clinical trial of laparoscopic versus open fundoplication: evaluation of psychological well-being and changes in everyday life from a patient perspective</article-title><source>Scand J Gastroenterol</source><year>2002</year><volume>37</volume><fpage>385</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11989827</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1080/003655202317315999</pub-id></citation></ref><ref id="B2"><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lostarinen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Virtanen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Matikainen</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dysphagia and oesophageal clearance after laparoscopic versus open Nissen fundoplication.
