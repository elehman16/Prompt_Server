Briefly, eligible participants completed baseline assessments of cognitive (i.e., memory, reasoning, and speed of processing) and functional abilities (i.e., self-report and performance-based measures of functional abilities) and were randomized (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>). Memory training focused on instruction and practice in strategy use for verbal episodic memory. Reasoning training focused on instruction and practice in strategy use related to problem-solving and serial patterns. Speed training focused on computerized, visual-perceptual exercises designed to increase the amount and complexity of information quickly processed. Each training arm consisted of ten 60&#x02013;75&#x000a0;minute sessions over 5 to 6&#x000a0;weeks, delivered to small groups of participants. A subset of participants completing at least 80% of the training sessions was randomly selected to receive booster training (four 75-minute sessions) at 11 and 35 months after completion of the initial training. Thus, the total &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d; of each type of training could range from 0&#x02013;18 sessions. Outcome assessments occurred immediately after training and at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10&#x000a0;years after training.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Measures</title><p id="p0055">The measures are detailed elsewhere <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, with brief descriptions of those relevant to analyses provided here.

The reasoning composite included Letter Series, Letter Sets, and Word Series. The speed composite included the four subtests of the Useful Field of View, reverse-scaled so that higher scores indicated better performance. Participants' vocabulary scores were also considered.

Descriptive statistics are presented using means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and proportions for categorical variables. The effect of cognitive training on dementia risk was evaluated using Weibull regression analyses for interval-censored data, as markers of dementia were only known within discrete intervals of time. Accelerated failure time analysis using Weibull regression model was used to estimate training effects while controlling for confounding effects of potential risk factors <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. We determined whether randomization to cognitive training lowered dementia risk by comparing each of the training groups to the control arm. Second, we examined whether there was a relationship between dementia and number of sessions attended for each training arm. Training sessions ranged from 0 to 18 and were treated as a time-varying covariate in the model. The approach proposed by Sparling et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> was used to handle the time-varying covariate for interval-censored data.</p><p id="p0095">Unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) of risk factors were first estimated, and those significant at the .05 level were then included in a multivariable model via a backward elimination procedure.

In addition, we examined the dementia criteria previously applied <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which included institutionalization and deactivation from the study due to family refusal. These results were compared with the primary results to examine whether the effects were dependent on the dementia definition.</p><p id="p0105">To further evaluate the effect of training sessions attended, three sets of sensitivity analyses were performed. The first set examined the effect of dementia criteria on the relation between number of sessions attended and dementia risk as detailed above.</p><p id="p0110">The second set of sensitivity analyses for the effect of training sessions attended examined whether unmeasured participant characteristics associated with invitation to booster training may account for the relation between training sessions and dementia risk as there could be differences between participants who completed fewer/more training sessions. Restricting the analysis to two subgroups of more homogeneous participants, who initially completed at least eight sessions of training and were or were not randomized to booster training, we examined the adjusted effect of training sessions on dementia risk and compared results to the primary analysis. The goal was to determine whether the relation between training and dementia risk was evident in these two subgroups of participants.</p><p id="p0115">The third set of sensitivity analyses examined the effect of different patterns of attrition on the relation between training sessions and dementia risk. Utilizing the ideas of pattern mixture models, we restricted the analysis to three subgroups of participants by dropout patterns: early dropouts (those who dropped out of the study before 5&#x000a0;years), late dropouts (those who dropped out of the study after 5&#x000a0;years), and completers (those who remained in the study at 10&#x000a0;years). The adjusted effect of training sessions on dementia risk was estimated and compared to the primary analysis to determine whether the relation between training sessions and dementia risk was of similar magnitude in these three subgroups of participants.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Demographics</title><p id="p0120">Demographics, health characteristics, and attrition were similar by training arm (<italic>p</italic>s&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;.05, see <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>).

There are of course limitations to these criteria, for example, self- and proxy-reports of dementia diagnosis are not infallible, MDS-IADL function was self-reported and thus biased, low MMSE is not a sensitive dementia marker, and overlap among the dementia criteria was low. A definitive study of the efficacy of cognitive training on dementia requires a clinical diagnosis as the primary outcome. That said, our approach to approximating a clinical diagnosis of dementia is reasonable and yielded a similar proportion of cases with dementia as prior research <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Our criteria were based on standard diagnostic criteria and published quantitative cut points. The psychometric criteria tie directly to the definition of dementia from the National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer's Association-loss of cognitive function associated with impairment in activities of daily living <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Furthermore, results confirmed that known risk factors for dementia (e.g., age, education, CHF, and diabetes) were similarly associated with our dementia criteria <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Finally, sensitivity analyses systematically examined variations in the dementia definition and found effects of similar magnitude with every variant.</p><p id="p0185">Attrition always presents a challenge when the sample comprises adults over age 65, and the follow-up interval is long. Typically, such studies see attrition rates of 2.5&#x02013;9% per year <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The overall attrition rate in ACTIVE of 5.5% per year over a 10-year-period falls within this range. Importantly, in ACTIVE, there was no differential attrition by training arm, either quantitatively or by reason for participant loss. Finally, our sensitivity analyses comparing effects of early dropout, late dropouts, and completers consistently indicated similar magnitude of speed training effects on dementia risk reduction regardless of timing of dropout. Thus, the results are robust and are likely a valid indication of the influence of speed training on dementia.</p><p id="p0190">A design limitation in ACTIVE was the method of assigning participants to booster training after the initial training was completed. Participants were randomized to booster, but invitation to complete booster was conditioned on initial training adherence. While this helps to assure delivery of the treatment, it also opens the range of interpretation of booster effects. One of the sensitivity analyses we conducted examined if participant factors related to completing 8+&#x000a0;initial sessions and hence being eligible for booster training could explain the dementia risk reduction. The relation of increased training exposure to lower risk of dementia was detected in each group to the same degree; therefore, differential participant characteristics linked to booster assignment is likely not responsible for our pattern of findings.</p><p id="p0195">We have shown that a specific form of cognitive training, speed of processing, reduced the risk of dementia in initially well-functioning older adults followed up to 10&#x000a0;years. This is the first report of an intervention significantly reducing dementia risk. Future research should examine ways to increase the potency of this form of training intrinsically (e.g., increasing dose) and possibly by adding other putative protective interventions (e.g., exercise and diet). Replication of results using clinical diagnosis of dementia as a primary outcome is needed. Further examination to elucidate mechanisms of action is also warranted.<boxed-text id="dtbox1"><caption><title>Research in Context</title></caption><p id="p0200"><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="o0025"><label>1.</label><p id="p0205">Systematic review: We conducted systematic literature reviews in Pubmed and PsychInfo to identify randomized clinical trials of cognitive training among healthy older adults.
