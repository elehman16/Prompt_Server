This was a quasi-experimental study in an intervention group and a control group. It was carried out in two rice farming communities, in which most people are rice farmers with similar socio-demographic characteristics. Multistage sampling was employed, selecting one person per rice farming household. The intervention group was 62 randomly selected rice farmers living in a rural area; another 55 rice farmers served as the control group. A structured face-to-face interview questionnaire was administered to participants to evaluate their safety behaviors in four areas: equipment use, pesticide use, ergonomics, and working conditions. The 2-week intervention program consisted of four elements: 1) health education, 2) safety inspection, 3) safety communication, and 4) health surveillance. Data were collected at baseline and 4 months after the intervention (follow-up). We used a general linear model repeated-measures analysis of variance to assess the mean difference between baseline and follow-up occupational safety behavior points between the intervention and control groups. Pesticide safety behaviors significantly increased in the intervention group compared with the control group. Ergonomics and working conditions points also increased in the intervention group, but not significantly so. The equipment use score decreased in the intervention group. It is necessary to identify and develop further measures to improve occupational safety behaviors. Some methods, such as effective risk communication, could be added to increase risk perception.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>occupational safety behaviors</kwd><kwd>rice farmers</kwd><kwd>safety program</kwd><kwd>injury and illness prevention program</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Thailand is a Southeast Asian country in which occupational health and safety issues are important. High-risk occupations exist in both agricultural and industrial sectors.<xref rid="b1-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Rice farming has historically been, and is still today, the main occupation of Thai agriculturists. Nowadays, rice farmers use rice cultivation methods that differ from those in the past. Technologies have been implemented to find ways to replace human and animal labor with machines. In response to higher competition and a different environment, larger volumes of pesticide are used, equipment use can be unsafe, and ergonomic conditions at work are poor.<xref rid="b2-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Previous studies have found injury and illness among rice farmers.<xref rid="b6-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Three major occupational health and safety problems have been found among farmers: symptoms from pesticide exposure, musculoskeletal problems during various processes, and injuries during various processes.<xref rid="b6-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A third of the injuries that cause rice farmers to miss work are sprains and strains, and a quarter are back injuries.<xref rid="b6-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In addition, work-related health conditions have been documented in agricultural workers, including musculoskeletal and traumatic injuries, respiratory conditions such as allergies and asthma, dermatitis, pesticide poisonings, and heat-related illnesses.<xref rid="b6-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Occupational health and safety problems among rice farmers may result from unsafe behaviors and unsafe acts or practices of workers resulting in incidents that can cause injuries. At present, rice farmers tend not to change their safety behaviors, despite knowing that inappropriate behavior can affect their health.<xref rid="b6-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These behaviors are related to agrochemical exposure, such as the use of faulty spraying equipment or lack of attention to safety precautions.<xref rid="b11-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In addition, studies on programs that encourage improved occupational safety behaviors in these farm workers are limited. The findings of previous studies may not cover all types of occupational hazards. Therefore, we developed an intervention program to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses, and to improve appropriate safety behavior. The intervention program was based on the theories of accident causation,<xref rid="b12-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and was modified as appropriate for the specific study setting. Moreover, many intervention programs are provided by research teams with no interaction between participants or between participants and study personnel. Thus, this program used a participatory approach in the community. Four elements were covered: 1) health education, 2) safety inspection, 3) safety communication, and 4) health surveillance. It was expected that this program could offer rice farmers an effective and efficient approach to improving safety behavior and their work environment. In 2010, Nakhon Nayok Province reported a morbidity rate of 6.8&#x02013;10.2 per 100,000 population as a result of pesticide poisoning.<xref rid="b17-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Few studies have been conducted to explore the prevalence of injury and illness among rice farmers. Causes of injury and illness include cuts/pinches from sharp equipment/machinery, dizziness after using pesticides, and bites or stings from venomous animals. Hospital visits for this condition are increasing.<xref rid="b19-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an injury and illness prevention (IIP) program on the occupational safety behavior among rice farmers in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted in two communities in Ongkharak district, Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand. This district is surrounded by irrigation canals and a national irrigation system that enables the cultivation of rice and other crops all year long.<xref rid="b20-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The district comprises 61,874 households, 26,656 (43.1%) of which are agricultural households, and most of these are rice farmers.<xref rid="b21-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Study participants were rice farmers from two communities. A total of 145 participants were calculated with power and sample size calculations<xref rid="b22-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and developed from a previous study,<xref rid="b23-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> increased by 10% to account for dropouts. Of these, 117 (80.7%) completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-rmhp-7-051">Figure 1</xref>). We selected one person per rice farming household. The inclusion criteria were rice farmers involved in all processes to do with growing rice, including: 1) land-preparation processes, 2) soaking and scattering of seed/application of fertilizers, 3) mixing and spraying of pesticides, 4) sowing of fertilizer, and 5) harvesting of rice. All participants had lived in the study area for at least 6 months. The recruited farmers were willing to participate in this research and provided informed consent. A total of 62 rice farmers participated in the intervention and another 55 served as the control group. A structured face-to-face interview questionnaire was administered. All participants were interviewed face-to-face, to characterize their occupational safety behaviors at work. Seven community health workers, known in Thailand as village health volunteers (VHVs) participated in the research. The selection criteria for VHVs were education level equal to or higher than high school (grade 9) and no communication problems. Their duties were to inspect workplace safety and to visit the home once a month. During a home inspection, if the health volunteers found inappropriate behavior or unsafe working conditions that might cause damage, village health volunteers were to suggest ways by which the situation could be improved, to the rice farmer.</p><p>The study was conducted in three phases: 1) preliminary data, 2) development and intervention implementation, and 3) program evaluation.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Phase 1: preliminary data</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We carried out a literature review of occupational injuries and illnesses among rice farmers in Thailand, and included research, reports, and statistics related to occupational injury and illness.

The aim was to determine occupational safety behavior points before the intervention program and at follow-up 4 months after the intervention. The questionnaire included 36 interview items, covering four aspects of occupational hazards: 1) equipment use, 2) pesticide use, 3) ergonomics, and 4) working conditions.

Central Thailand is the main producer of rice, so this was where we located the study site. The irrigation technology in most villages has been updated, and the rice cultivation lasts for 4 months (rice is harvested 3 time per year). We planned that data would be collected for baseline characteristics and at follow-up 4 months after the intervention program. In addition, we applied a safety inspection model, mostly in factories, by replacing the factory foreman with VHVs involved in the study. Community radio is an accessible media that enables the villagers to distribute information; we used this tool to distribute safety information in the morning and afternoon. As some rice farmers were not able to read or understand the questionnaire, we collected the data via face-to-face interview. The objective of the program was to reduce work-related injuries and illnesses and to contribute to improved safety behavior and an improved working environment. The intervention program consisted of four elements over 2 weeks: 1) health education, 2) safety inspection, 3) safety communication, and 4) health surveillance.</p><sec><title>Element 1: health education</title><p>We applied health education methods to encourage risk perception and to teach correct safety behavior in rice farming. We aimed to empower those rice farmers with long-term conditions to take greater ownership and responsibility for their care and to have more control over the management of their long-term condition. This strategy was divided into two methods: group health education and individual health education. Group health education was delivered in 2 days in the first week of the intervention period, and included training on ergonomics, work-related injury and illness, safety and health care at work, pesticide use, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), material handling and storage, machine safety/equipment use, and working conditions. Individual health education was conducted in the second week by delivering a 2-hour session in the participants&#x02019; homes in the intervention group. We selected specific issues such as working conditions or safety behavior that needed to be modified in rice farmers.</p></sec><sec><title>Element 2: safety inspection</title><p>Effective safety and health inspections are one of the most important incident/accident prevention tools. This narrow focus tends to ignore other causes of incidents, such as unsafe actions and personal factors.<xref rid="b27-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> We provided 2 days of training for seven VHVs. After training, the VHVs inspected workplace safety and visited the participants&#x02019; homes once a month. The inspection summary form was divided into four parts with 30 items, including equipment safety, pesticide use, work organization, and working conditions. In this way, VHVs could identify inappropriate behaviors and working conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Element 3: safety communication</title><p>We informed rice farmers about occupational hazards, how they affect their health, and ways in which to protect themselves via an applied risk communication process.<xref rid="b28-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Community broadcasting, a safety manual, and safety posters were used in this study. We provided a program for broadcast in the early morning and afternoon (5 pm) for 10 days. There were ten audio broadcasts related to safety at work, each 3&#x02013;6 minutes long. In addition, we provided two safety manuals and one safety poster for the participants, when visiting their home. The contents of the safety communication was divided into four occupational hazard sections: equipment use, pesticide use, ergonomics, and working conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Element 4: health surveillance</title><p>Rice farmers who were injured or became ill at work were required to report the injury or illness immediately to VHVs and health staff, and to follow these procedures as appropriate for the situation: 1) obtain medical attention, 2) complete the medical treatment form, and 3) when incidents occur at work, an investigation must be completed to identify the root cause and contributing factors that led to the incident. Health staff were required to complete any repairs and implement procedural changes to correct actions or conditions contributing to the incident. This may lead to the prevention of similar injury or illness incidents in the future.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) for Microsoft&#x000ae; Windows version (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis.

Of these, 117 (80.7%) completed the study (62 in the intervention group, 55 in the control group). Slightly more females (51.3%) than males (48.7%) took part. The mean age was 50.9&#x000b1;12.3 years, and most participants were married (82.2%). Most rice farmers (76.1%) had graduated from primary school. Mean monthly family incomes were on average 12,028 Thai baht or $US404; 23.1% of participants were current smokers. Their mean (&#x000b1;SD) risk perception score was 246.6&#x000b1;59.2 or &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; level. The duration of rice farming was 27.4&#x000b1;13.1 years, and working hours were 7.7&#x000b1;12.3 hours per day. Farm sizes were 37.1&#x000b1;18.9 rai or 14.8 acres. The mean duration of pesticide use since they became rice farmers was 20.5&#x000b1;10.5 years, and daily hours working with pesticides was 2.7&#x000b1;1.1 hours.

Post-intervention, mean occupational safety behavior points had increased to 88.77 points in the intervention group and decreased slightly to 82.06 points in the control group. After focusing on specific occupational safety behaviors (equipment use, pesticide use, ergonomics, and working conditions), results relating to equipment use showed mean safety behavior points in the intervention group (23.04) were higher than in the control group (21.09) at baseline. At follow-up, points had decreased slightly to 22.91 in the intervention group and increased to 22.25 points in the control group. For pesticide use, baseline safety behavior points in the intervention group (29.60) were higher than in the control group (29.14). Post-intervention, points in the intervention group had increased to 30.70, while they had decreased to 27.12 in the control group. For ergonomics and working conditions, the results were similar: safety behavior points at baseline in the intervention group were higher than in the control group. At follow-up, points were increased slightly in the control group. Unadjusted and adjusted intervention effects on occupational safety behavior scores were similar (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-rmhp-7-051">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We tested the effects of the IIP program on occupational safety behavior points, expressed as absolute magnitudes and proportions of baseline mean points.<xref rid="b30-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> The IIP program had effectively improved some occupational safety behaviors in the intervention group at follow-up compared with the mean score at baseline: for overall occupational safety behavior, the intervention program had effected an increase from baseline score of 3.8% in the adjusted model and of 4.5% in the unadjusted model at follow-up. The largest proportional benefit of the intervention, expressed as percentage of baseline score, was observed for pesticide use (10.5% in the adjusted model, 10.9% in the unadjusted model). Working conditions and ergonomics were also increased from the baseline score (6.6% and 1.8% in the adjusted model, respectively).

In addition, safety communication, safety inspection, and health surveillance concepts were applied in this program. We combined these concepts to encourage discussion among rice farmers in their groups, letting them know their missing points, such as, that they were less concerned about their health than they were about economics, and were not aware of safety at work. In these cases, we emphasized the importance of safety awareness to good health. The program was developed with the aim of changing behavior and empowering the rice farmers to plan for health and safety at work. Differences in behavior were found between rice farmers who had and who had not participated in the program. The improvement in pesticide safety behavior points among rice farmers suggests that rice farmers who received the IIP program changed some safety behaviors (eg, do not spray pesticides under windy conditions, wear gloves while mixing or touching pesticides, clean all tools thoroughly after using pesticides, and store residual pesticides separately from other implements). Our findings were consistent with those of Raksanam et al,<xref rid="b11-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> who found that, post-intervention, the rice farmers in the study group had significantly higher points in behaviors regarding agrochemical exposure, and an in-home pesticide safety assessment. This is also consistent with the findings of a health promotion program in Thai farmers for the safe use of pesticides.<xref rid="b32-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The results showed that this program changed the behavior of farmers to more appropriate use of pesticides (eg, wear long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and always take a bath, and wash their hair with soap and shampoo after spraying). Similarly, a previous study by Sam et al,<xref rid="b33-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> who conducted an educational program to promote pesticide safety among pesticide handlers via individual home visits, safety material, and training, showed that their program could improve practice scores for safe pesticide handlers. Stave et al<xref rid="b5-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> conducted an intervention for occupational safety in farming. The intervention approaches were to encourage leaders to help participants analyze the risky incident, and to stimulate the participants to reflect on their own and possible preventive measures in connection to concrete events. The results revealed a significant increase in the safety activity of participants.</p><p>One relevant study by Aksorn and Bonaventura<xref rid="b34-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> was not performed in the agricultural sector. The concept of safety inspection and accident investigation were similar to this study, which was to find out what was causing the problem and try to solve the cause of work-related injury. The study by Aksorn and Bonaventura indicated that unsafe acts (careless throwing or dropping of objects from a height, not wearing PPE) and unsafe conditions (working surface is not clean and tidy, insufficient level of light) were improved by the implemented safety program, which entailed accident investigation, jobsite inspections, control of subcontractors, and safety incentives.</p><p>Rice farmers use large amounts of pesticides, and rice farmers may be especially concerned with health-related pesticide issues. That is, in the intervention program, they paid more attention to pesticide-related contents than to the other parts. In addition, the increase in pesticide safety behavior points might be affected by increasing risk perception, due to risk perception playing an important role in encouraging rice farmers to be aware of their occupational hazards. The change in risk perception among rice farmers might influence their safety behaviors. This is similar to a previous study in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand, which found that occupational risk perception positively influenced occupational safety behavior.<xref rid="b35-rmhp-7-051" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> For other occupational safety behaviors, working conditions and ergonomics increased from baseline score but did not significantly improve safety behaviors. At the beginning of study, very few participants understood the important concept of ergonomics. Their understanding increased as a result of our group education sessions. Even so, the awareness of ergonomics probably remains limited. Similarly, they might also think that working conditions-related injury and illness were not as serious as those related to pesticide use. They may be less concerned with hazards from unsafe working conditions. This might be why they did not change some safety behaviors.</p><p>In this study, rice farmers were exposed to unsafe working conditions, such as work areas not maintained safely (ie, walkways clear, materials and tools organized), and there were farmers who did not display appropriate safety behavior (keeping sharp equipment in the same place as other equipment, not wearing PPE while working with pesticides, carrying heavy weights a long distance without support equipment). It is necessary to identify and develop further measures to protect and reduce risk-related behavior. Regarding equipment use, working conditions, and ergonomics, some methods such as effective risk communication should be added to increase risk perception. In addition, future studies should maximize connections with local health services to employ complete and accurate records of work-related accidents, injuries, and illnesses. Findings from such studies can be used to develop improved intervention programs to promote occupational health and safety.</p><p>The following study limitations should be noted. We did not directly observe the safety behavior of rice farmers. The information was collected via a questionnaire administered in a face-to-face interview. We did not directly observe the safety behavior during farming. Moreover, we evaluated the effects of the intervention program by measuring and comparing changes in mean behavior points 4 months after the intervention. The results might differ with a longer follow-up time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The improvement in occupational safety behavior points among rice farmers suggests that the pesticide safety behaviors of rice farmers who received the IIP program positively changed. A combined approach, comprising health education, safety inspections, safety communication, and health surveillance, in which rice farmers receive interventions, may be the effective way to improve some safety behaviors among rice farmers. This study was carried out among rice farmers in the agricultural sector. In our opinion, the findings can reasonably be generalized to rice farmers with similar characteristics, especially in the central region of Thailand.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the 90<sup>th</sup> Year Chulalongkorn Scholarship (Ratchadaphiseksomphot Endowment Fund), Graduate School, Chulalongkorn University, Thailand and the Higher Education Research Promotion and National Research University Project of Thailand, Office of the Higher Education Commission (AS581A-56 and AS1148A) for partial research grant support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-rmhp-7-051"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Siriruttanapruk</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Anantagulnathi</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Occupational health and safety situation and research priority in Thailand</article-title><source>Industrial Health</source><year>2004</year><volume>42</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>135</fpage><lpage>140</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15128162</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-rmhp-7-051"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumphon</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pesticide poisoning 2009.
