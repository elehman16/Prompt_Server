Patients above 18 years scheduled for elective surgery, under general anaesthesia with PLMA were enrolled in the study. All the patients were examined in the preanaesthesia room and were informed about the questionnaire related sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia. Patients with hiatus hernia, gastro-oesophageal reflux and procedures were excluded from the study.</p><p>A random number table for 120 patients to be divided into four groups was generated using computer software and sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes were prepared [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. To maintain the blinding, an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study opened the envelope just before the administration of general anaesthesia and prepared the appropriate gas-filled syringe according to the code to inflate the cuff and did not take part in management and observations. For Group A, room air was filled in 50 ml syringes. Gases of different composition were prepared just before induction in the pre-operative room by an anaesthesiologist not involved in the study. Ventimask tubing was attached to fresh gas outlet of Drager anaesthesia work station (Primus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for desired composition of gas for different groups (air [Group A], O<sub>2</sub> :air [50% O<sub>2</sub>] [Group OA], O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O [50% O<sub>2</sub>] [Group ON] or 100% O<sub>2</sub> [Group O]) according the group. The other end of the tubing was attached to 50 ml syringe via three-way assembly. The fresh gas flow was set at desired concentration and gas mixture at 5 L flow. Once desired gas is filled in the syringe, three-way was put in off position towards syringe and disconnected from the tubing.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-60-566-g001"/></fig><p>In the operating room, routine monitors were attached to the patient. The size of the PLMA was decided according to the manufacturer guidelines. The PLMA cuff was checked for any leak. General anaesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and propofol 1.5 mg/kg. After confirming adequate bag mask ventilation, atracurium 0.5 mg/kg was administered and ventilation was performed with 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 5 L fresh gas flow for 3 min. A fully deflated PLMA was inserted by a single anaesthesiologist with more than 1 year of experience of PLMA insertion. The PLMA cuff was inflated by the specified syringe to obtain a cuff pressure of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O with the help of aneroid cuff pressure manometer (Endotest<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Rusch, Germany), attached to the pilot balloon. The volume of gas inflated was noted. Successful insertion was assessed by chest expansion and capnography. At cuff pressure of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O, oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP) was checked by closing adjustable pressure limiting valve at fixed gas flow of 3 L/min. The airway pressure at which leak was heard (by stethoscope) was noted.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Volume controlled ventilation was initiated and initial ventilatory settings were adjusted to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 35 and 45 mmHg.</p><p>Fresh gas flow composition was changed to O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O (50:50) with isoflurane (1 minimum alveolar concentration) at 3 L for initial 5 min, then subsequently, flow was reduced to 1 L/min (500 ml O<sub>2</sub> :500 ml N<sub>2</sub> O). Attempts for PLMA insertion, use of Guedel's airway (due to difficult mask ventilation or to relieve post-operative upper airway obstruction), volume of gas injected in the PLMA cuff, initial tidal volume (inspiratory/expiratory), respiratory rate (RR), peak inspiratory airway pressure and EtCO<sub>2</sub> were noted after the insertion of PLMA. The cuff pressure and ventilator parameters were noted every 5 min for the first 30 min and then every 10 min till N<sub>2</sub> O was switched off and 100% O<sub>2</sub> was given to the patient.</p><p>At the end of surgery, when the patient was awake and following commands, PLMA was removed, inflated. The presence of blood stain on the cuff was noted. Gas from the PLMA cuff aspirated and the volume noted. Oral suction was avoided as far as possible and if done was noted. The patient was shifted to the post-anaesthesia care unit.</p><p>Postoperatively, sore throat, dysphonia and dysphagia were assessed by a questionnaire at 1, 2 and 24h. Sore throat was defined as constant pain or discomfort in the throat independent of swallowing, dysphonia; as difficulty in speaking or pain on speaking, and dysphagia; as difficulty or pain on swallowing.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The primary outcome was to compare the changes in cuff pressure intraoperatively with different gas composition used to inflate PLMA by cuff pressure monitor. The secondary outcome was to compare the effect of PLMA cuff pressure change on intraoperative ventilator parameters and post-operative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity. A pilot study with five patients in each group was conducted before the study. The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation cuff pressure till 30 min was 74.6 &#x000b1; 6.4, 79 &#x000b1; 8, 43.6 &#x000b1; 6, and 33.2 &#x000b1; 4 cmH<sub>2</sub> O in Group A, Group OA, Group O and Group ON, respectively. Twenty-seven needed to be enrolled in each group to have &#x003b1; of 5% and power of 90%. Thirty patients in each group were enrolled in this study to allow 10% dropout, i.e., exclusion from the study.</p><p>The statistical analysis was performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS&#x02122;), Windows version 15.0 (South Wacker Drive, Chicago, IL, USA). The results were analysed using one-way ANOVA for continuous variable and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical significance between the groups was analysed using post hoc comparison (multiple comparisons) by Bonferroni's method. Apart from univariate analyses, potential predictors of sore throat were analysed with a step-wise logistic regression.

This increase was more in Group A in comparison to Group OA and O. Although cuff pressure remained fairly stable in Group ON, the final aspirated volume was also decreased in Group ON. LMA silicon cuff acts as a semi-permeable membrane which results in diffusion of different gases between the cuff and inspired air. The amount and direction of the diffusion depend on the partial pressure gradient.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There was a continuous increase in PLMA cuff pressure in Group A from 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O to final mean cuff pressure of 109 cmH<sub>2</sub> O. The blood gas coefficient of N<sub>2</sub> O is 0.46, which is thirty times greater than nitrogen, present in the air. It is therefore possible that N<sub>2</sub> O diffuses inside the cuff quickly, whereas nitrogen diffuses out slowly.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The increase in cuff pressure when the air is used for inflating the cuff was documented both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> from 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O to 80 cmH<sub>2</sub> O in 60 min.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It was also observed that the mean cuff pressure started increasing within 5 min of N<sub>2</sub> O exposure to reach a plateau after 45 min till 115 min.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The continuous increase in cuff pressure from 20 to 200 cmH<sub>2</sub> O at 350 min with N<sub>2</sub> O anaesthesia has also been demonstrated.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In Group ON, decrease in cuff pressure was observed at 15 min which again gradually increased to near initial pressures. Studies have revealed decrease in cuff pressure when mixtures of N<sub>2</sub> O, O<sub>2</sub>, halothane or enflurane or isoflurane have been used to inflate the cuff during O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> O anaesthesia, as diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> O inside the cuff is prevented.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] When PLMA cuff is inflated with 50% N<sub>2</sub> O, it creates a pressure above the atmospheric pressure at 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O which leads to a pressure gradient between the inside and outside of the cuff resulting in the diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> O out of the cuff resulting in an initial decrease in pressure and volume.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In Group OA, cuff pressure increased till 30 min and then gradually decreased. There has been no study till date to evaluate the effect of O<sub>2</sub> and air mixture on cuff pressure with N<sub>2</sub> O anaesthesia. We hypothesize that the decrease in concentration of nitrogen due to dilution of air with 50% O<sub>2</sub> may lead to lesser degree of diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> O inside the cuff resulting in more gradual rise in cuff pressure than that of air only.</p><p>In Group O, increase in cuff pressure up to 61 cmH<sub>2</sub> O was observed. Since N<sub>2</sub> O is more soluble than O<sub>2</sub>, there is diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> O inside the cuff. <italic>In vitro</italic> study showed O<sub>2</sub> diffusion across the cuff is &#x0003c;10% of N<sub>2</sub> O.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] N<sub>2</sub> O being more permeable than O<sub>2</sub> and nitrogen could have led to the rise in cuff pressure in this group. However, increase is lesser than that of air and air: O<sub>2</sub> mixture because of relatively lesser permeability of N<sub>2</sub> O with O<sub>2</sub> in comparison to nitrogen.</p><p>In this study, fresh gas flows were kept constant in all the patients. The rate of diffusion of N<sub>2</sub> O across the cuff is affected by the area available for diffusion, the cuff material and the number of time LMA is autoclaved.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The change in cuff pressure and volume can occur with the warming of gases inside the cuff.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The LMA size, position and head manipulation might also influence the cuff pressure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] To avoid this bias, in this study head of the patient was kept at the neutral position and cuff pressure recording was started after positioning the patient.</p><p>We inflated PLMA cuff till 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O as lower cuff pressures result in a better seal, optimal fibreoptic position, optimal functioning and efficacious positive pressure ventilation.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] OLP was between 23 and 25 mmHg in all the groups and the mean calculated leak volume was &#x0003c;10 ml. The change in the cuff pressure in different groups did not affect ventilatory parameters and leak volume. Higher leak volume was observed with cuff pressure of 60 cmH<sub>2</sub> O (0.65 ml/kg) than 40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O (0.42 ml/kg) and 20 cmH<sub>2</sub> O (0.51 ml/kg), but it was not associated with air leakage in any patient.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the post-operative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity was comparable in all the groups. The incidence of post-operative sore throat with LMA ranges from 17.5% to 45.6%.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] LMA cuff pressure rise has been implicated as a primary reason for post-operative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, in this study, PLMA cuff pressure had no correlation with the incidence of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity. This could be attributed to the initial low cuff pressure (40 cmH<sub>2</sub> O). Therefore, even with the pressure up to 110 cmH<sub>2</sub> O in some cases, the duration was not prolonged enough to cause decrease in mucosal perfusion. No difference in post-operative sore throat was observed with cuff pressure of 30 mmHg and 180 mmHg during O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O anaesthesia (50% vs. 42%).[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Increase in cuff pressure (35 vs. 50 mmHg) also had no correlation with post-operative pharyngolaryngeal complications.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Low incidence of post-operative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity in this study may be due to the administration of neuromuscular blockers. Higher incidence of sore throat have been reported with spontaneous ventilation in comparison to controlled ventilation, owing to increased pharyngeal muscle tone.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the volume of gas inflated was also less than the maximum recommended volume (50-70% less) for PLMA size, which could be the additional factor for decreased pharyngolaryngeal morbidity in the studied patients. Brimacombe <italic>et al</italic>. also reported reduced pharyngolaryngeal morbidity at 18-24 h postoperatively with low cuff volume than higher volume (20% vs. 42%).[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Other causes of pharyngolaryngeal morbidity are anaesthesiologist's skill, the level of insertion difficulty, the number of insertion attempts, the LMA size, dry and cold gas, the duration of anaesthesia.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In this study, there was a significant correlation of sore throat with more than one attempt of PLMA insertion. Nott <italic>et al</italic>. also quoted that multiple insertion attempts can lead to sore throat.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Prolonged duration of anaesthesia also had a positive correlation with sore throat. This could be due to the pressure on the pharyngeal mucosa for a prolonged period, leading to decreased mucosal perfusion.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The presence of blood on PLMA and use of oral suction were also significantly related to sore throat in the post-operative period. This may be due to oropharyngeal trauma.</p><p>Limitations of the study were exact composition of gas mixture was not analysed before inflation of cuff and the correct position of the LMA were not confirmed by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Analysis of gas composition after deflation of cuff might have provided information regarding the diffusion of different gases through LMA cuff.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O (50% O<sub>2</sub>) mixture provides a relatively stable cuff pressure in comparison to air, O<sub>2</sub> :air (50% O<sub>2</sub>) and 100% O<sub>2</sub> during O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O anaesthesia.
