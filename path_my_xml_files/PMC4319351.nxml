Advanced instrument designs including noncutting tips, radial lands, different cross sections, and varying tapers have been developed to improve working safety, to shorten working time and create a greater flare of preparations.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Radiographic examination is essential in diagnosis and treatment planning in endodontics.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Conventional radiographic technologies provide two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional (3D) objects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] To overcome the shortcomings of conventional radiographs, advanced digital imaging modalities were introduced in dentistry, one of which is cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT).</p><p>Computed tomography was initially used in endodontics to confirm the diagnosis of root fractures, to analyze root canal walls and pulp chamber anatomy.

The primary goals that an endodontist must achieve with root canal treatment are complete disinfection of the canal space, elimination of the progression of the periradicular tissue inflammation and thereby creation of favorable conditions for periradicular healing. This can be achieved using a proper chemo-mechanical preparation which is essential for successful endodontic treatment.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>However, traditional hand instruments often failed in achieving these objectives. Most canals are curved, whereas endodontic instruments are manufactured from straight metal blanks. This results in uneven force distribution in certain contact areas and a tendency of the instrument to straighten itself inside the canal. Consequently, apical canal areas tend to be overprepared toward the outer curve or the convexity of the canal, whereas more coronal areas are transported toward the concavity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Various studies have investigated the efficiency of Ni-Ti rotary instruments, but few have examined the ability to increase root canal area.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the present study, three Ni-Ti rotary systems namely ProTaper, i-RaCe, and Revo-S were used to investigate the canal area increase before and after instrumentation.</p><p>Varieties of rotary systems are available commercially, but one has to choose tactfully considering each canal morphology as unique in order to avoid untoward iatrogenic errors. According to Peters, an important mechanical objective is to leave as much radicular dentin as possible so as not to weaken the root structure, thereby preventing vertical fractures. Although no definitive minimal radicular thickness has been established, 0.2 mm is considered critical.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, a crown down instrumentation sequence was performed as recommended by the manufacturers for the three rotary systems. According to Schafer <italic>et al</italic>., this technique is mandatory to reduce intracanal friction and thus minimize the risk of instrument separation.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, ProTaper showed a greater amount of dentin removal compared to i-RaCe and Revo-s especially for the middle and coronal thirds. The greater cutting ability of ProTaper in the middle and coronal parts has been confirmed by Paqu&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>. This could probably be related to the sharp cutting edges of the convex triangular cross-sectional design and its flute design that combines multiple tapers within the shaft up to 19%.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>The i-RaCe instruments have alternating cutting edges, and this design is alleged to have two functions: (i) To eliminate screwing in and blocking in continuous rotation and (ii) to reduce the working torque. In the present study, Revo-S and i-RaCe seemed to remove the less dentin from both middle and coronal portions compared to ProTaper, which is statistically significant and in accordance with previous studies.</p><p>Revo-S (Micro-Mega, France), another Ni-Ti rotary system was developed with a distinctive asymmetric cross-section intended to decrease the stress on the instrument. Revo-S showed less dentin removal than ProTaper and i-RaCe at all the different thirds. This is in agreement with the previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>No file separations occurred in the present study. However, studies have showed that ProTaper systems are more prone to file separation.</p><p>In endodontics therapy, the quality and quantity of the information obtained from radiographic examinations are very important, because they affect the diagnosis, treatment planning, and prognostic stability.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Volumetric or CBCT, a relatively new diagnostic imaging modality has been used in endodontic imaging.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A review of digital and 3D applications for endodontic uses published by Nair and Nair summarized the CBCT portion by stating that such technology has proved useful for localization and characterization of root canals, treatment planning of periapical surgery and detection of root fractures in extracted teeth.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we have used CBCT, which provided a practical and nondestructive technique for assessment of canal morphology before and after shaping according to Gluskin <italic>et al</italic>.</p><p>Cone-beam computed tomography image analysis software was used which allowed pre- and post-instrumentation measuring of root canal area increase. Under the circumstances of this current <italic>in vitro</italic> study, it suggests that ProTaper showed maximum canal area increase in middle and coronal thirds of the root canal compared to i-RaCe and Revo-S systems which were statistically significant. On the other hand, i-RaCe had removed the least dentin compared to ProTaper and Revo-S systems. Moreover, the mean percentage of area increase showed that ProTaper achieved the most followed by Revo-S and i-RaCe systems. Further research is needed in order to confirm and elaborate on its canal transportation, uninstrumented surface area, and preservation of dentin thickness which affects the prognostic stability of the teeth.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
