At plasma concentrations achieved after ingestion of common dietary sources, caffeine exerts its psychoactive effects through blockade of the A1 and A2 adenosine receptors in the brain, promoting the release of a range of neurotransmitters that positively affect cognitive function.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref></sup> Studies have demonstrated favorable effects of caffeine on arousal state (attention, alertness, and reaction time) at doses from 32 to 300&#x02009;mg.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Effects are generally dose dependent, with low doses associated with improvements in mood and a reduction in anxiety, especially in highly fatigued subjects, while high doses may overstimulate, leading to difficulty falling asleep and increased anxiety and nervousness.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>With caffeine so widely available and consumed, the impact on consumer health has been extensively studied. Side effects of excessive caffeine intake may include anxiety, agitation, restlessness, and insomnia.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Single doses of up to 200&#x02009;mg caffeine are not considered to give rise to safety concerns<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and consumption of 400&#x02009;mg caffeine per day is generally safe in healthy adults, not being associated with any adverse cardiovascular, behavioral, reproductive, acute, or bone status effects.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In pregnant women, metabolism of caffeine is altered and effects are longer lasting; current evidence suggests that daily doses of 200&#x02009;mg<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> to 300&#x02009;mg<sup>2</sup> in healthy pregnant or lactating women do not pose safety concerns for the developing fetus or infant.</p><p>The vast majority of studies investigating the safety of caffeine, upon which the above conclusions are based, were conducted following exposure to known doses of caffeine administered as food, beverages, or oral medications for which the kinetics of intestinal absorption are well characterized. Caffeine is absorbed rapidly and essentially completely from the small intestine within an hour of ingestion<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and diffuses rapidly into other tissues, including the brain, with the maximum observed plasma concentration at &#x0223c;0.5 to 2 hours postdose.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The pharmacokinetics (PK) has been shown to be dose proportional at doses up to 750&#x02009;mg.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></sup> Caffeine is predominantly metabolized by cytochrome p450 (CYP) 1A2 in the liver and has a half-life of &#x0223c;2 to 12 hours, with sources of variation including concomitant smoking, food intake, disease, drug usage, and pregnancy, as well as gastric emptying speed.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Recently, new formulations for delivery of caffeine have been developed, including caffeine-containing chewing gum, which represent a convenient and portable source.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, because administration of caffeine by gum also could entail the absorption of caffeine through the mucosal membranes of the mouth, the PK of which is less well characterized compared with intestinal absorption, it is unclear whether the safety findings of specific doses delivered by ingestion may be applied to equivalent doses delivered by gum. Absorption through the buccal cavity may be increased due to the high level of vascularization and lymphatic drainage compared to the intestine, combined with the avoidance of first-pass metabolism and presystemic elimination.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Actual exposure to caffeine contained in gum may also be influenced by factors such as the rate of release from the gum, chew rate, and saliva production.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>This study compares the PK of caffeine administered as a chewing gum pellet containing &#x0223c;50&#x02009;mg caffeine with that following consumption of a marketed caffeinated beverage (instant coffee) at approximately the same strength per serving.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Study population</title><p>The study was conducted at Covance Clinical Research Unit, Inc. (Daytona Beach, Florida), in accordance with the standards of the International Council for Harmonisation guidelines, commonly known as Good Clinical Practices, which are consistent with the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol, protocol amendment, advertisement, and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by Midlands Independent Review Board (Overland Park, KS). A written consent form was signed by each enrolled subject.</p><p>A total of 16 subjects met the study screening criteria and were enrolled in the study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s004">Study Design and Treatments</xref> section below). The design was set up to obtain an initial comparison of PK of caffeine from a chewing gum and beverage. Any statistically significant difference could then be used to power a study, if desired, to test the significance of statistical difference. All subjects were required to be nonsmoking healthy males or females between the ages of 18 to 50 years with a body mass index of 18.0 to 29.9&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Subjects were in good health as determined by the absence of clinically significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic, dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, neurological, or psychiatric disorders, or clinically relevant findings from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, physical examination, and clinical laboratory tests. Females were required to be nonpregnant, nonlactating, or postmenopausal for at least 1 year or surgically sterile for at least 90 days at the time of screening. All premenopausal females were required to have a negative pregnancy test. Restrictions were placed on the use of prescription medications, hormonal contraceptives, and over-the-counter nonprescription medications. Subjects were required to have a history of caffeine consumption and had to be willing to chew gum and drink black coffee. In addition, subjects had to be willing to abstain from consuming caffeine-containing food or beverages from the time of check-in (day &#x02212;2) until discharge (day 4), except for study products provided by qualified clinical staff during confinement at the clinical site.</p></sec><sec id="s004"><title>Study design and treatments</title><p>This single-center, open-label, randomized, two-period crossover, controlled clinical study compared the PK and safety and tolerability profiles of a new caffeinated chewing gum product to a currently marketed caffeinated beverage (instant coffee), each containing &#x0223c;50&#x02009;mg caffeine (see investigational product details below). Before the administration of the first caffeine product in Period 1 (day 1), subjects were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequences (test product followed by reference product or reference product followed by test product). With a crossover design, subjects received a single dose of each of the two caffeine products, chewing gum and beverage, with a washout period of &#x0223c;48 hours between product administrations. Following the administration of each caffeinated product, blood samples were collected at specific time points and used to analyze the PK profiles of the caffeine products. Each caffeine product was administered to subjects in a fasted state on day 1 (Period 1) and day 3 (Period 2). Caffeine products were administered to subjects following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours from food (not including water) and each administration was followed by a fast from food (not including water) for at least 2 hours. In addition, subjects were required to consume &#x0223c;240&#x02009;mL (8&#x02009;fl. oz.) of water within 5 minutes before the administration of each product.</p><p>The investigational product (test product), pellets of caffeinated chewing gum (Lot No. 081315 SMA002080008; CSPC Pharmaceutical Group Limited), was manufactured and supplied to the clinical site by the Sponsor (Mars Wrigley Confectionery, Chicago, IL). Subjects were required to chew the gum for 10 minutes, after which the subject discarded the gum. The chewed gum cud was collected and analyzed for the remaining caffeine content by the Sponsor. The amount of caffeine remaining in the gum cud was used to calculate the actual dose of caffeine released during chewing for each subject. The caffeinated beverage (instant coffee; Lot No. 5230209120036) was prepared at the clinical site and was dispensed at a temperature of 125&#x000b0;F (52&#x000b0;C) &#x000b1;5&#x000b0;F (3&#x000b0;C). Subjects were required to consume a 4&#x02009;fl. oz. cup of the prepared coffee within a timeframe of 1 minute or less. Samples of the caffeinated beverage were collected and analyzed for caffeine content by Covance Laboratories, Inc. (Madison, WI). The estimated caffeine content administered by the single serving of prepared coffee was used to calculate the actual caffeine dose each subject received from the caffeinated beverage.</p><p>Safety was assessed at specific time points during the study and included the incidence of adverse events (AEs), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, and physical examinations.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>Sampling and analytical procedures</title><p>Blood samples (6&#x02009;mL) were drawn through an intravenous catheter and/or direct venipuncture and collected into K<sub>2</sub>EDTA Vacutainer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> tubes on day 1 and 3 before the administration of each product (&#x0223c;10 minutes before product use); at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, and 90 minutes from the start of gum chewing or coffee drinking; and at 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 hours from the start of gum chewing or coffee drinking.

There were no discontinuations due to AEs for any of the healthy subjects participating in this study. A total of two AEs (near syncope and leg pain) were reported during the study. Following the administration of caffeinated chewing gum, one subject experienced near syncope, which occurred &#x0223c;16 hours after administration of the caffeinated chewing gum, followed by leg pain &#x0223c;23 hours after dose administration. Both events were recorded as mild in intensity and resolved by the end of the study. Near syncope was considered not applicable to product administration and leg pain was considered unlikely to be related to the product. Overall, there were no clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory evaluations, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, or physical examinations during the study and no differences were observed in the tolerability profile between the two caffeine products.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s011"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to compare the PK of a single 50-mg dose of caffeine after delivery using caffeinated chewing gum (test product) or a marketed instant coffee (reference product) in healthy adult volunteers. The results indicate that there is no marked difference in the PK profile of caffeine delivered by the two products. While the differences in exposure (DN AUC<sub>0-t</sub>, AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) might suggest a more efficient absorption of the caffeine from the gum, the differences were not significantly different between the delivery methods and the 90% CIs for the ratios of AUC, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> fell within the recommended range for product bioequivalence suggested by the FDA.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Caffeine was absorbed rapidly following administration using both gum and beverage with slightly lower exposures achieved after administration using the caffeinated gum compared to the caffeinated beverage (14% and 9% lower for AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, respectively). However, this difference in exposure is likely to be a result of the amount of caffeine made available for absorption from the two matrices, with the 50&#x02009;mg caffeine dissolved in the beverage being optimally available and easily controllable during preparation by clinical staff, whereas that released by gum for absorption was reliant on the chewing process. Measurement of caffeine remaining in the discarded gum cud after chewing showed that the mean actual dose of caffeine released by the caffeinated gum, and therefore available for absorption, was &#x0223c;18% lower than the intended 50-mg dose. Between-subject variation in the actual dose available from caffeinated gum was high (actual mean dose 40.81&#x02009;mg; SD 3.206) compared to caffeinated beverage (actual mean dose 50.65&#x02009;mg; SD 0.496) and is likely a reflection of the difference in factors such as mastication rate and saliva production between subjects over the 10-minute chewing period, which in turn may influence both the rate and total amount of caffeine release. To account for the differences in actual dose administered between the two caffeine products, the PK parameters were DN to allow statistical comparison and determine relative bioavailability. This was considered appropriate given that the actual doses achieved were well within the range at which the PK of caffeine has been shown to be dose proportional when administered as a caffeinated beverage<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> or caffeinated gum.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Although between-subject variation in exposure to caffeine was moderate, the study was carried out in a crossover manner to account for differences in dosing occasion and to allow a within-subject comparison of administration methods.</p><p>Based on the ratios of geometric LS means, DN AUC<sub>0-t,</sub> AUC<sub>0-&#x0221e;</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, were 7%, 9%, and 12% higher, respectively, following administration of caffeinated chewing gum compared to caffeinated beverage. However, although the criteria were not set a priori and the study was not statistically powered for concluding bioequivalence, the calculated 90% CI fell within the industry accepted bioequivalence limit of 80% to 125%,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and therefore caffeine delivered using chewing gum appeared bioequivalent to that delivered using beverage. In addition, the actual (non-DN) caffeine plasma concentration versus time profiles were similar for the two caffeine products and there were no statistically significant differences in the <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> or <italic>k</italic><sub>a</sub>. These findings are, in part, supported by those previously reported by Kamimori <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> who found that at doses of 50 to 200&#x02009;mg, caffeine administered by chewing gum gave a comparable exposure to that delivered by capsule. However, they observed an increased absorption rate with caffeinated gum, which was not observed in this study, and may be due to a slower release of caffeine from a capsule than the beverage used in this study.</p><p>The two caffeine products were well tolerated by subjects who participated in this study. No product-related AEs were reported following caffeine administration by either gum or beverage, which was expected given that the dose administered and exposures achieved were well within the published safety limits for single doses.</p><p>The intent of this study was to provide initial insights into what, if any, differences in PK profiles occur when similar levels of caffeine are ingested by chewing caffeine out from gum or by drinking a caffeinated beverage. From these data, it could be possible to estimate how to power a study if further and more granular comparison of the PK parameters were desired. One potential source of variability is the mastication rate in the chewing gum group. Differential mastication rates, both within and between subjects, could have contributed to the variation of release rate of caffeine from the chewing gum matrix, and therefore resulting in variation of PK data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the PK profiles of caffeine administered by the chewing gum and beverage were similar, suggesting that the body of scientific literature on caffeine, which is mostly based on data from caffeinated beverages, can be leveraged to support the safety of caffeine delivered by chewing gum. Furthermore, the current maximum safe dose advice for caffeine issued by health regulatory authorities should be applicable whether the dose is administered by chewing gum or oral administration of caffeinated food or beverages.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s013" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Mars Wrigley Confectionery.
