With time, an evolution in size and shape of fixation devices has taken place. Michelet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in 1973 introduced the miniplate osteosynthesis and Champy <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] further developed Champy's concept and described ideal lines of osteosynthesis for placement and fixation of plates in various regions for mandibular fracture. These miniplates are available in different designs, sizes, shapes, number of wholes, and they are fixed by screws of different sizes. There are reports which indicate that leaching of metal takes place in the adjacent tissues of plates as well as peripheral organs after osteosynthesis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Thus, the size of hardware should be optimized not only to resist the masticatory stresses, to provide sufficient stability to the bone segments and restoration of normal masticatory function but also to leaching of metal.</p><p>Evans <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] performed their studies and suggested the role of miniplates and microplates in treatment of mandibular and midfacial fractures.</p><p>Feller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] performed biomechanical studies and suggested that a combination of miniplate and microplate provided sufficient stability for complication-free healing of fractures. Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] studied the bite forces with such combination and confirmed the findings of the Feller. This was, in fact, an effort to advocate the minimum use of hardware. This effort must have minimized the metal leaching also.</p><p>Available data indicate that bite forces are reduced in traumatized mandible and biting, and masticatory forces are severely compromised as the tissue environment is significantly altered,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] thus affecting the biting force. In such situation, a combination of 1.5 mm microplates may be adequate to bear the masticatory stresses and must provide sufficient stability as tensile forces at which permanent deformation takes place in these plates are much higher than the bite forces to which these plates are exposed in the healing phase of bone.</p><p>On the basis of available data of masticatory forces in fractured mandible, we gave a null hypothesis that microplates, if used in mandibular fractures would be sufficient to provide stability to fractured bone and resist masticatory forces.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aims and objectives of the study were to compare bite forces generated in patients treated with 2.0 mm miniplates or 1.5 mm microplates in symphyseal and parasymphyseal fractures at postoperative interval of 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 6 weeks and to compare the efficacy of these plates in the treatment of mandibular fractures.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>aterials and</sc> M<sc>ethods</sc></title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study sample collection</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee and was conducted at Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Dr. Ziauddin Ahmad Dental College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh. To perform the study, data for maximum voluntary bite force in control group were collected on young volunteers of different age group among which were dental students and employees of dental college. The exclusion criteria included volunteers which were (1) partially or completely edentulous, (2) medically compromised, and (3) with preexisting dental pain or myofascial pain.</p><p>The patients in study Group I were treated by open reduction and rigid internal fixation (ORIF) using 1.5 mm microplates and in Group II using 2.0 miniplates.

The equipment consisted of metallic fork covered with disposable cushioned adhesive tape which was meant for force application. The equipment was connected to 250V electrical supply for charging backup of equipment. The consistency and accuracy of bite force were reaffirmed by doing detailed laboratory and clinical testing on fifty individuals.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bite force recorder with biting fork</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="NJMS-7-39-g001"/></fig><p>The participants in the study were fully made aware of bite force recording equipment and then mechanism of recording. The pressure fork was covered with sterile adhesive tape which was soft and had cushioning property and gave a feeling of comfort on biting on it. The fork was covered with sterile gloves for further sterility. After every patient, the fork was cleaned, adhesive tape changed, and then covered in sterile gloves. The patients were asked to bite on the fork from anterior as well as left and right molar teeth. The findings were recorded in specially designed format, and results were statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Data collection</title><p>The bite force was recorded by asking the participant to bite on fork by maximum pressure from front teeth and by occluding the molars. Each volunteer/patient was asked to sit erect and relaxed keeping the head in Frankfort horizontal plane parallel to ground floor.

It was noticed that the incisor bite force was significantly reduced in the first 6 weeks after ORIF when it was compared with the patients after the 6<sup>th</sup> postoperative week and the controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

There was a progressive improvement in bite forces with elapse of time which indicated the repair of soft tissues as well as healing of the bone.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Complications</title><p>Within the two study groups, of twenty patients each, who were treated according to Champy's principle and by ORIF. Overall complications were recorded in five patients (12.5%) in both study groups. One patient required revision surgery, two patients had occlusal disturbance, one had abscess in fracture line, and one had dehiscence. Altogether 35 patients (87.5%) were treated successfully without any complication. The occlusal disturbance was corrected by occlusal grinding; abscess was simply managed by standard methods treating infection and did not require plate removal. However, the case in which there was wound dehiscence exposing plate was treated by plate removal followed by intermaxillary fixation; the overall success may be said as 38/40, i.e., 95%. Hence, it may be said that overall success rate was 95%. Hypoesthesia was not seen in Group I cases whereas it was seen in only case in Group II. Disturbed occlusion was seen in Group II and none in Group I. Majority of the complications were managed by routine OPD procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>iscussion</sc></title><p>The measurement of bite forces has been remained a matter of interest among researchers. However, there is inconsistency in the findings and maximum value of bite forces presented by different authors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The reasons of this variation may be many. The device used to record the bite force, its sensitivity, comfort of the volunteer, and psychological state of volunteer. In addition, genetic and ethnic, food habits, and geographical factors may be also responsible for this variation. Individual neuromuscular mechanism may itself be also an important factor for this difference.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>There is individual variation in masticatory forces or bite force. Maximum bite force is the greatest force that an individual can generate by voluntary clenching of teeth in the occlusal position. We measured the maximum bite in young men and women healthy volunteers which was taken as control to compare with patients in the study group. We found that the bite forces in control group in incisor region were 16.3 kg, right molar region 50.6 kg, and left molar region were 52.1 kg. These forces are generated due to interaction of masticatory muscle forces and must be overcome by desired treatment.</p><p>In a similar study, Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that voluntary bite force in a healthy adult was on the order of 15.4 kp in the incisor and 48.3 and 49.2 kp in the left and right molar regions, respectively. Our findings are much closure to findings of Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] which may be due to volunteers belong to same geographical location and had similar food habits.</p><p>In our study, it was noticed that preoperative forces were highly significant in molar regions of study group [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. These values may be just by chance and practically bear no clinical significance. However, the bite forces progressively increased in each study group, and their comparative value remained insignificant throughout the phase of recovery [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">7a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T10">c</xref>]. However, by the end of 6<sup>th</sup> weeks, patients in either group regained 60% in molar region and 75% in anterior region. This pattern of recovery can be attributed to psychological state of patient as if they themselves avoid applying heavy chewing forces due to fear of refracture of jaw or any disturbance in normal healing. This can be also inferred that 60% of maximum bite force is usually sufficient for comfortable chewing.</p><p>It has been suggested that the amount of force used during functional activity is much less than the voluntary bite force. It is further reduced in trauma affairs. Therefore, the fixation requirements based on the maximum voluntary bite force in noninjured participants may be more there for the monocortical fixation has been used successfully.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The reason for reduced bite force after treatment by open reduction and rigid fixation is injury to not only bone but also investing periosteum and associated muscles in the adjacent area. Formation of hematoma in the region itself may affect the movement. In addition, surgical trauma to muscles and periosteum may also restrict the normal function of the body until healing has taken place. Intra- or extra-oral placement of fixation hardware necessitates the placement of incision, reflection of mucoperiosteal flap and in selected cases incising the muscle fibers as well. All these reasons of trauma are responsible for compromised masticatory function until healing is completed.</p><p>Our findings are important to recommend the use of 1.5 system microplates for treatment of mandibular fractures. As there is no significant difference in the bite force generated when microplates are used, in comparison to miniplates, and they provide adequate stability to fractured segment, their use may be recommended for routine use. Another important aspect is minimization of metal leaching in the adjacent tissues. This is perhaps first study, in which bite forces have been compared with miniplate and microplate. On the basis of our findings, we recommend that microplates should be preferably used for mandibular fracture.</p><p>Kumar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] observed that patients treated with locking plate/screw system postoperatively generated more bite force compared to those treated with conventional miniplate screw system. However, they have not highlighted the significance of their findings in statistical terms. The increase in bite force may be due to mechanical advantage provided by locking plate.</p><p>On the basis of available data, we are able to demonstrate that major complications were rare (5%) using microplate and miniplate osteosynthesis. This furthers proves that microplates are equally good as miniplates as far as linear fractures are concerned. However, for comminuted fractures, more rigid plates should be used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>On the basis of our study we conclude that 1.5 mm microplates are rigid enough to provide adequate stability to the fractured segments which is comparable to miniplates in the isolated fractures of mandible and should be preferred over miniplates. In addition the bite forces should be considered for the assessment of clinical union of bone as well as studies pertaining to selection of hardware for rigid internal fixation.</p><sec
