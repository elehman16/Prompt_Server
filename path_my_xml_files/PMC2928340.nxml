In this pilot study we investigated if oral glutamine could ameliorate hypoglycemia during exercise and in the nighttime after exercise in children with type 1 diabetes.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Written consent was obtained after approval by the Wolfson Children's Hospital Institutional Review Committee. Ten adolescents (five boys and five girls; mean [SD] age 15.2 &#x000b1; 1.4 years) with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy were recruited. Mean diabetes duration was 6.2 &#x000b1; 3.3 years; A1C, 6.9 &#x000b1; 0.9%; with normal BMI, 76.9 &#x000b1; 12.2 percentile. Subjects were on no other medications or dietary supplements.</p><sec><title>Design</title><p>Regular dietary intake was maintained for at least 3 days prior to each admission to the clinical research center (CRC) and diabetes was managed as routine. Subjects were admitted mid-day, an intravenous line was placed, and blood glucose was titrated (mid 100 mg/dl) prior to 3:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> exercise. Children were randomized to receive a drink containing glutamine or placebo (PL, calorie- and nitrogen-free) before exercise and at bedtime (0.25 g/kg/dose). Patients and CRC staff were blinded to the type of drinks consumed. Sessions consisted of four 15-min treadmill cycles (heart rate &#x0223c;140 bpm) with 5-min rest breaks when blood glucose concentrations were checked for a total of 75 min. If blood glucose was &#x0003c;60 mg/dl, subjects consumed 15&#x02013;30 g of carbohydrate and were not allowed back on the treadmill until blood &#x0003e;70 mg/dl. Insulin basal rates were continued during exercise. Afterward, subjects ate a snack and then dinner. Blood glucose was monitored hourly overnight from 8:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> to 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> Blood glucose &#x02264;60 mg/dl prompted treatment with an oral carbohydrate; treatment was repeated as needed until &#x0003e;80 mg/dl. Fasting glutamine and ammonia concentrations were measured 16-h post-exercise the following morning. Subjects were discharged after breakfast and returned within 3 weeks for an identical study with either placebo or glutamine. The caloric/protein intake of the two CRC days was identical<bold>;</bold> visits were randomized crossover.</p></sec><sec><title>Assays</title><p>Blood glucose concentrations were measured with a Freestyle meter (Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA) and by glucose oxidase methods with a Beckman glucose analyzer (Beckman, Brea, CA). Plasma glutamine concentrations were measured by gas chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry and ammonia using an automated chemistry analyzer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>During exercise, hypoglycemia was considered if blood glucose was &#x02264;70 mg/dl<bold>;</bold> if treated, the most recent previous blood glucose was carried forward 1 h in the calculations. Repeated-measures regression models were performed to compare glutamine concentrations and glucose values prior to exercise and the percentage drop during exercise, the overnight mean glucose, and the percentage of the hypoglycemic values of each visit. Rank scores (van der Waerden) were used to normalize skewed distributions. The proportions of subjects developing hypoglycemia during exercise on both visits were compared using a permutation test as was the time from 10:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> until the first laboratory glucose value &#x02264;70 mg/dl on the 2 days; all analyses were controlled for a visit effect. SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and two-sided <italic>t</italic> tests were used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Plasma glutamine concentrations were &#x0003e;50% higher the morning after glutamine administration (316 &#x003bc;mol/l) as compared with placebo (200 &#x003bc;mol/l, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><sec><title>Exercise</title><p>Mean blood glucose concentrations prior to exercise were comparable on the glutamine and placebo day (143 &#x000b1; 31 mg/dl vs. 162 &#x000b1; 54, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.44) with a similar percentage drop from baseline during exercise of 52 &#x000b1; 15% glutamine versus 52% &#x000b1; 9% placebo (<italic>P</italic> = 0.84).

It is possible that glutamine is low due to increased use in gluconeogenesis or use as a buffer or due to increased cortisol secretion, which enhances splanchnic glutamine utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). This relative glutamine depletion after exercise requires further study.</p><p>In our study, glutamine did not affect blood glucose levels during exercise but increased the cumulative probability of nighttime hypoglycemia post-exercise. Indirect evidence suggests glutamine may indeed enhance insulin sensitivity in other experimental and clinical situations associated with insulin resistance including in the intensive care unit with trauma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and in children with cystic fibrosis on growth hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Glutamine increased insulin signaling/sensitivity in skeletal muscle in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and oral glutamine increased nonoxidative glucose disposal in healthy exercising subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Our pilot study, however, has several limitations including its small sample size, the low concentrations of glutamine achieved, and no direct measurement of insulin sensitivity. These results are nonetheless intriguing as the investigation of nutritional, nonpharmacological avenues to improve diabetes control is important and deserves further study, particularly in teenagers who have increased insulin resistance. In the aggregate, these data are congruent with the positive effect of glutamine on insulin sensitivity.</p><p>In conclusion, oral glutamine administration was associated with a higher incidence of nighttime post-exercise hypoglycemia as compared with placebo in a pilot group of adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Whether glutamine supplementation affects peripheral and/or hepatic insulin sensitivity requires further study in children with type 1 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges.
