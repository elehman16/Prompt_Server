Psychosocial treatments that effectively reduce self-harm in adolescents have only recently emerged. Such treatments seem to be characterised by a sufficient dose of treatment and family involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Repeated self-harm is resource-demanding, as it involves a broad range of health services for shorter or longer periods of time. Resources are, however, always limited, and there is a strong consensus that our clinical priorities should be made on the basis of the severity of the disorder, expected benefits of the treatments, and assessment of the relationship between costs and effects. Studies of cost-effectiveness involve the systematic measurement of the inputs (treatment costs) and outcomes (health) of two alternative treatments, commonly the new experimental treatment and standard treatment. The subsequent comparative analysis provides decision-makers with information on between-treatments differences with respect to costs and health effects. The results thus form the basis for evaluating whether the new treatment produces a better health effect to a lower or similar cost compared to standard treatment, alternatively that a higher cost is acceptable for added health effect. In the present study the cost-effectiveness of DBT-A is analyzed based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), given by the ratio of between-group differences in costs and effects.</p><p id="Par19">Several trials have shown that dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) is effective in reducing self-harm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Two previous RCT studies, both comparing DBT with treatment as usual (TAU) over a period of 12&#x000a0;months, have included an economic evaluation. A study with female adult patients (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;44) showed that DBT treatment incurred significantly higher psychotherapy costs, but lower inpatient care and emergency room costs than TAU over a period of 12&#x000a0;months. However, the results indicated no statistically significant differences in total treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Another economic evaluation of DBT (age&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;16 years, N&#x02009;=&#x02009;40), yielded a similar result as it showed no significant differences in total treatment costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a review of the cost-effectiveness of treatments for people with borderline personality disorder (BPD), treatment studies were included by estimating cost data on the basis of available resource use data thus enabling analyses of cost-effectiveness. The authors conclude that none of the reviewed treatments, including DBT, were cost-effective, but that DBT has a potential for being cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A shortened version of DBT, delivered in the outpatient setting, has been adapted for adolescents (DBT-A). With a strong focus on teaching distress tolerance skills and enhancing family functioning, the treatment is expected to use more resources in the outpatient setting than usual care, one of the aims being to reduce the need for hospitalizations. Recently, we have shown that DBT-A is more effective than enhanced usual care (EUC) in reducing frequency of self-harm episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To our knowledge, no study has conducted an economic evaluation of DBT-A. It is important to establish whether such a relatively brief intervention with intensified use of resources would lead to reduced needs for resources in the longer term, and particularly whether DBT-A is associated with a reduced need for hospitalizations, thus, reducing treatment costs substantially. The aims of the present study were: to assess the total treatment costs of DBT-A compared to EUC, both over the treatment trial period of 19&#x000a0;weeks and over a subsequent follow-up year of 52&#x000a0;weeks, and to evaluate in a health care perspective the cost-effectiveness of DBT-A compared to EUC, with number of self-harm episodes and global functioning as health outcomes. To examine the economic impact of the intervention after the relatively short trial period the cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted on the entire observational period from treatment start to follow-up assessment, altogether 71&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">Methods have been described in separate papers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The core issues relevant to this cost-effectiveness study are presented below. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NTC00675129).</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par21">Participants were randomised to receive either DBT-A or EUC, stratified according to the presence of major depression, suicide intent at the most severe self-harm episode in the 4&#x000a0;months prior to enrollment, and gender.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par22">A total of 77 adolescents (39 to DBT-A and 38 to EUC) were enrolled, from June 2008 to March 2012, mainly from child and adolescent psychiatric outpatient clinics in the Oslo area. Inclusion criteria were repeated self-harm (two or more episodes, the last episode within the past 4&#x000a0;months), age 12&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years, and meeting at least three criteria of borderline personality disorder (assessed by SCID-II). The study was approved by the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics, South-East Norway. All patients and parents provided written informed consent prior to inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Treatments</title><p id="Par23">All participants received 19&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (trial period) in one of the publicly funded child and adolescent outpatient psychiatric clinics in the Oslo region/Norway. As is all publicly funded health care in Norway, treatments were free of charge for the participants in both treatment conditions.</p><p id="Par24">The patients allocated to DBT-A received treatment according to the adolescent version of DBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The programme consisted of 19&#x000a0;weeks of weekly sessions (60&#x000a0;min) of individual therapy and weekly sessions (120&#x000a0;min) of skills training in a multifamily format. Family therapy sessions and telephone coaching were provided as needed according to the DBT-A protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. After 19&#x000a0;weeks, DBT-A treatment was ended and in cases where further treatment was needed, patients were referred to standard outpatient treatment (non-DBT) in one of the participating clinics. EUC was non-manualized, but was mainly psychodynamical or cognitive behaviour-oriented therapy, enhanced for the purpose of the trial through providing all therapists with training in suicide risk assessment and management and implementing a patient safety protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Furthermore, EUC therapists were required to provide weekly treatment over a period of a minimum of 19&#x000a0;weeks. The termination of EUC-patients&#x02019; treatment was decided by each therapist, so that outpatient treatment was continued beyond 19&#x000a0;weeks when needed. In the follow-up period (week 20&#x02013;71) the participants in both groups received standard outpatient treatment as needed, which would be of different length and frequency. Some of the patients did not receive any outpatient treatment (23% of the DBT-A patients and 14% of the EUC patients).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Health outcomes</title><p id="Par25">The participants were clinically assessed before treatment-start, at the end of the trial (19&#x000a0;weeks), and at a follow-up assessment 52&#x000a0;weeks after end of the trial, so that the entire observational period was 71&#x000a0;weeks. The clinical outcomes were evaluated by using the Lifetime Parasuicide Count (LPC) interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] for number of self-harm episodes (from treatment start to follow-up assessment), and the researcher rated Children&#x02019;s Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] for global functioning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Costs</title><p id="Par26">Data on outpatient treatment resources (number of individual therapy sessions, family therapy sessions, group sessions, telephone consultations and the amount of medication) were collected from clinical records for the intervention period (week 0&#x02013;19). Additionally, we monitored use of other health services due to self-harm or risk of self-harm (in the results section referred to as emergency treatment), which included inpatient treatment, emergency room visits, and general practitioner (GP) consultations. These data were collected from the adolescents on the basis of both interview and self-report, as well as from registry data obtained from the National Patient Registry (NPR). In the follow-up period (week 20&#x02013;71) data on outpatient treatment and inpatient treatment were obtained from the NPR and from self-report questionnaires and interview. Data on GP consultations and emergency room visits were based on self-report and interview for this period.</p><p id="Par27">The National Patient Registry (NPR) contains information on specialized treatment in psychiatric outpatient clinics and inpatient hospitalizations (psychiatric and somatic). The registry provides reliable records of resource use per patient, since the accurate registering of treatment contacts is mandatory and is the basis for funding of the clinics.</p><p id="Par28">The data on the use of health service resources were collected over a 4-year period. The costs per resource unit were estimated on the basis of cost information from the financial year 2012. Costs are presented in EUR, converted from NOK by the average exchange rate of 2012. The mean total cost per patient in each group was estimated for the trial period (week 0&#x02013;19) and for the follow-up period from end of trial period to follow-up assessment (week 20&#x02013;71). Total treatment costs for the entire observational period from baseline to follow-up assessment (71&#x000a0;weeks) were calculated on the basis of these estimates. The estimation of cost for one specific resource unit, e.g. one individual therapy session in an outpatient clinic, was based on an approach that includes all actual costs that were required to produce the total number of individual therapy sessions within a given time period, divided by the number of sessions that were produced during that period. Thus, the cost for a resource unit includes wages for staff (clinical/administrative), equipment, IT, house rent, etc. Data on these costs were obtained from annual accounts from the participating clinics.</p><p id="Par29">The specific costs related to DBT-A include the cost of telephone coaching (implying availability after regular working hours) and weekly therapist team consultations. The average cost per patient for telephone coaching was estimated on the basis of an annual extra fee which each therapist in the participating DBT-A teams received, and was added to the total outpatient cost (week 0&#x02013;19) for each DBT-A patient. Similarly, the average cost per patient for DBT-A therapist team consultation was estimated and added to the outpatient cost (week 0&#x02013;19) per DBT-A patient. Since there was no available data on supervision received by the EUC therapists, we have assumed that supervision received by EUC therapists was less resource-intensive compared to DBT-A by a factor of 0.5 (based on a previous economic evaluation of DBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]), and added this average cost to all EUC patients.</p><p id="Par30">The average unit cost of one general practitioner (GP) visit (due to self-harm or risk of self-harm) was estimated based on information from the Norwegian Health Economics Administration (HELFO), and is the sum of what each patient pays the GP for the consultation, the amount of health insurance reimbursement the GP on average receives per consultation, and the average annual reimbursement the GP receives from the municipality per consultation. Data on the use of medication was collected for the trial period, and costs per patient were estimated on the basis of price per tablet for a specific psychotropic drug used by the patient (cf. records of Norwegian Medicines Agency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) and assumed number of tablets used, i.e. the patient&#x02019;s days of receiving medication treatment and recommended daily dosage, as per The Norwegian Pharmaceutical Product Compendium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par31">Analyses were carried out on an intention-to-treat basis.

A proportion of 89.7% of the simulated ICERs falls into the quadrant where a reduction in self-harm is achieved by DBT-A for less cost compared to EUC.

With a zero threshold, i.e. no willingness to pay, the probability of DBT-A being cost-effective is 89.8% (the proportion of the simulations below the x-axis). With increasing threshold values, the probability of DBT being cost-effective increases, since a proportion of the simulated ICERs in the quadrant above the x-axis is added to the proportion considered cost-effective. The probability of DBT-A being cost-effective increases to 97.5% with a threshold value of &#x020ac; 400, and up to a ceiling probability at approx. 99.5%, at a threshold of &#x020ac; 1400.</p><p id="Par46">As noted above two long inpatient admissions in the EUC group substantially affected the total mean costs of the EUC patients.

When cost data were analysed together with our previously published outcome data showing that DBT-A was superior to EUC in reducing self-harm over the relevant time interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we found that DBT-A had a probability of being cost-effective increasing from 89.8% with no willingness to pay extra for extra health gains, up to a ceiling probability at approximately 99.5% with increasing willingness to pay up to a threshold of &#x020ac; 1400. Thus, given the data, DBT-A had a high probability of being cost-effective compared to EUC.</p><p id="Par49">DBT-A had higher outpatient treatment costs during the 19&#x000a0;weeks trial period, whereas EUC had higher outpatient costs during the follow-up period. It is an important finding that the intensified use of resources during the intervention period was followed by a subsequent reduced need for treatment in the follow-up period for the DBT-A group. Our efficacy study showed that DBT-A resulted in a more rapid improvement during the intervention period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The finding that DBT-A improved health at 19&#x000a0;weeks and that there were no statistically significant between-group differences in outpatient treatment costs at 71&#x000a0;weeks, suggests that the initial extra use of resources in the DBT-A group gave good value for money.</p><p id="Par50">Two previous studies have shown higher outpatient psychotherapy costs for DBT compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In these studies, the original DBT program for adults was used, so that the intervention had longer duration. The patients in these studies were mainly adults, and although comparison between adult and adolescent samples should be done with caution, our findings suggest that a shorter DBT intervention period may be favourable both from an effect- and a cost-perspective.</p><p id="Par51">There were no between-group differences with respect to emergency intervention costs other than hospitalization. The EUC group incurred considerably higher costs for hospitalizations due to two long inpatient stays. When including the costs of hospitalization, the total treatment costs were higher for EUC for the entire period, but the difference did not reach statistical significance, partly because the impact of long hospitalization costs are ruled out in the rank-order test (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>). DBT-A has a specific focus on reducing hospitalization, and some previous studies have pointed in the direction that DBT may reduce the need for such hospitalization compared to the control treatment, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] although this finding has not been replicated by other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The observed differences in our study are difficult to interpret with respect to between-group differences due to the limited number of hospitalizations. It would not be possible to conclude whether the higher incurred costs in the EUC group were due to treatment differences or a result of mere chance.</p><p id="Par52">The relatively small proportion of patients receiving inpatient treatment in the present study contrasts what has been observed in studies with adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. It is, however, important to note that psychiatric hospitalisation of adolescents has in general a much higher threshold in most countries, since such measures are regarded as very drastic in this age group, since most adolescents have a base for care in their own family, and clinicians will normally seek to deliver crisis interventions in an outpatient fashion. To be able to observe analysable differences, a study with more patients and/or longer duration of follow-up would be required.</p><p id="Par53">In this study treatment was free of charge for the participants. Provided that the way treatment is funded in other health care systems does not lead to substantial between-group differences in total treatment costs, we suggest that the findings of the study would generalize to systems where treatment is not publicly funded. However, we may assume that certain factors could affect the costs of DBT-A compared to standard treatment, e.g. the extent to which frequency of inpatient admissions differ across systems, whether one of the treatment methods is more or less available dependent of the healthcare setting, and/or the possibility that the ratio of cost per resource unit for outpatient treatment and inpatient treatment differ across systems. It is beyond the scope of this article to fully examine this complex issue of generalizability.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par54">Our sample was of limited size for a cost-effectiveness study. A larger sample combined with a longer observation period would have provided a stronger basis for detecting possible group differences, on both clinical and cost variables. Most importantly it would facilitate analysis of the use of crisis services, as mentioned above, which is a highly relevant issue for this patient group. Furthermore, we have limited the cost analyses to direct treatment costs and not included societal costs. It would be expected that productivity losses due to, e.g. parents&#x02019; extra care for their adolescents, would result in indirect costs for this patient group. The adolescents&#x02019; absenteeism from school would also be a relevant indirect cost unit to study. Although difficult to value within a limited time perspective, this would be relevant to follow-up into adulthood since non-completed education may have an impact on the ability to maintain employment, with substantial indirect costs to society. Finally, quality adjusted life years (QALYs) are commonly included in cost-effectiveness studies as a generic measure of health outcome; but this was not used in the present study, since it was not initially planned as a cost-effectiveness study. Instead we chose CGAS as a measure of global health effect.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par55">The liberal inclusion criteria and the delivering of treatments in a community mental health setting with patients recruited from a defined catchment area strengthen the external validity of the findings.</p><p id="Par56">The validity of the findings is increased by the randomised trial design and the rigorous procedures for data collection, providing high-quality data for health outcome measures. A further strength is the high participation rate with only two participants (one in each treatment condition) lost to follow-up at 71&#x000a0;weeks. Finally, the calculation of costs is based on detailed and reliable data for the most resource-intensive treatment categories (outpatient treatment and inpatient hospitalizations), directly derived from records of the clinics where the patients received treatment, as well as from the Norwegian Patient Registry. The data regarding costs for GP consultations and emergency room visits due to self-harm or risk of self-harm were based on self-report and interview, and may be less accurate because of recall bias. However, collecting the data from different sources made it possible to cross-check information, thus minimizing the effect on data quality.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par57">The findings that DBT-A had a higher probability of being cost-effective compared to EUC, and that DBT-A was superior in reducing self-harm at a similar cost, support the choice of DBT-A as a treatment for adolescents with repeated self-harm. The limited sample size and low number of inpatient admissions in our study sample call for further studies to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of DBT-A.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BPD</term><def><p id="Par6">borderline personality disorder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p id="Par7">cost-effectiveness acceptability curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par8">confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGAS</term><def><p id="Par9">Children&#x02019;s Global Assessment Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBT-A</term><def><p id="Par10">dialectical behaviour therapy for adolescents</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EM</term><def><p id="Par11">expectation&#x02013;maximization method</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EUC</term><def><p id="Par12">enhanced usual care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par13">general practitioner</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICER</term><def><p id="Par14">incremental cost-effectiveness ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LPC</term><def><p id="Par15">Lifetime Parasuicide Count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCID-II</term><def><p id="Par16">Structural Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAU</term><def><p id="Par17">treatment as usual</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EH coordinated data-collection, drafted the manuscript and analysed and interpreted the data.
