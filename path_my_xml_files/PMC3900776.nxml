The intervention group participated in supervised exercises once a week for 12 months and in home-based exercises. The exercise program consisted of various exercises related to flexibility, muscle strength, balance, and aerobic performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 12 months of exercise training, the intervention group had significant improvements in lower-limb strength and on the sit-and-reach test; these effects were not observed in the control group.

Moreover, the number of adults aged 75 and over (the old-old) will exceed that of adults aged 65&#x02013;74 years by 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r01">1</xref></sup> Due to this situation, a public long-term care insurance system was started in April 2000 in Japan, which is the first and only insurance system in the world that provides help in the daily lives of elderly people with disabilities. After the implementation of this system, however, the number of elderly people who were certified for long-term care grew from 2.2 to 4.1 million (1.9 fold) in only 5 years. In particular, people requiring limited care (support only or Level 1 care) increased steeply (2.4 fold), and accounted for half the total certified population in April 2005. Most people requiring this limited support or care have been classified with disuse syndrome (inactivity syndrome).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup></p><p>To slow the progression from minor disability to moderate or severe disability, the public long-term care insurance system was transformed to a more prevention-oriented program in April 2006, because a demographic shift in the severity of disabilities in elderly persons would financially overburden the system. The new system emphasizes improvement of physical fitness, nutrition, and oral function, as well as the prevention of withdrawal, dementia, and depression. Under this revised program, a physical exercise program has been implemented as an optional service that targets those who require only limited support or care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r02">2</xref></sup> The actual content of the exercise program is determined by local health care providers, who are tasked with developing an effective and safe training program that is appropriate for their particular setting.</p><p>There is limited evidence on the effects of exercise training for very elderly people with disabilities. Two research groups have examined the effects of an exercise intervention, lasting approximately 12 months, among frail elders aged 70 years or older at facilities such as nursing homes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup>; one group reported that tai chi training, as compared to a wellness education program given to a control group, significantly improved the ability to stand up when sitting in a chair; it also improved body mass index, systolic blood pressure, resting heart rate,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r03">3</xref></sup> and the fear of falling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> The second study demonstrated that a strength and flexibility program using simple, portable, and inexpensive equipment had a significantly more beneficial impact on the timed up-and-go test, physical performance test, mini-mental status examination, and the Berg balance scale than did recreational therapy for a control group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r05">5</xref></sup> In contrast, a 4-month randomized trial of 1-on-1 physical therapy (ie, exercises emphasizing range-of-motion, strength, balance, transfer, and mobility) for very frail nursing home residents showed no significant improvements for any of the outcomes, except mobility, when compared to a control group with no exercise intervention.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r06">6</xref></sup> This might have been due to the short intervention period. Thus, it is necessary to conduct longer intervention studies of very frail elderly people, and to include a control group who maintain their usual daily activities.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine whether a 12-month multicomponent exercise program for very elderly people with minor disabilities, including those who use day services (eg, receiving assistance in taking a bath, eating meals, and rehabilitation) offered by the public long-term care insurance system, can improve physical performance, daily physical activity level, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This prospective, nonrandomized, intervention study comprised an intervention group from one nursing home and a control group from another nursing home. The 2 nursing homes (the intervention facility in Taku City and the control facility in Ogi City) were located in central Saga Prefecture, in Japan. The facilities were selected because of their understanding of the study purpose. In April 2004, the subjects were selected from the users of day services in both nursing homes. The eligible subjects comprised elders certified to receive long-term care in the form of support only or Level 1 care. Level 1 care certification is granted when an elderly person experiences instability when standing up or walking and requires partial care in bathing and managing the household budget. In addition, the intervention group had to be able to visit the day service facility on Thursdays, when the exercise classes took place. The maximum number of subjects who could be accepted in the exercise class was approximately 30. A total of 33 elderly subjects (6 men and 27 women) aged 74 to 96 years met these criteria in the intervention facility. Next, we recruited an approximately equal number of control subjects, and attempted to ensure that their distribution by sex and the level of required care would be as close as possible to that of the 33 candidates for intervention. A total of 37 subjects (6 men and 31 women) aged 77 to 96 years were chosen from the control facility. Among the total of 70 candidates, 2 in the intervention group and 3 control subjects could not participate in the baseline measurements and thus were excluded. Ultimately, 31 subjects (6 men and 25 women) in the intervention group and 34 control subjects (6 men and 28 women) participated in the present study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). All participants gave their written informed consent to participate in the study after being informed of all risks, discomforts, and benefits associated with the procedures to be followed in the study. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee at the Faculty of Medicine, Saga University. This study was conducted under the aegis of the long-term care insurance system and was supported by a local organization that assisted in administering the system (the area-wide association of central Saga Prefecture).</p><fig id="fig01" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The trial profile</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="je-20-021-g001"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>From May 2004 through June 2005, the intervention group participated in a 12-month multicomponent exercise program, which comprised both supervised and home modules. The class-based module consisted of a weekly 90-minute supervised exercise session; there were 55 sessions in total. These sessions substituted for the functional training usually provided in day services. The exercise program consisted of various activities related to flexibility, strength, endurance, balance, aerobic performance, body awareness, and rhythm. Each session was led by a trained fitness instructor who was certified by the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America and had 13 years of experience in guiding exercise training. One of the authors was also available to support the instructor. The group was divided into several subgroups each comprising 5 to 6 participants, and 1 staff member from the facility supervised each subgroup. All exercises in the program were performed slowly to ensure the safety of the subjects, and emphasis was placed on good posture, as well as on social interaction and enjoyment. The supervisors did not force any participant to perform an exercise if he/she felt anxious about doing so. Each exercise session began with gentle movements while seated on a chair (approximately 10&#x02013;30 minutes) to improve mobility of the upper and lower body, followed by the specific exercises described below and in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl01">1</xref>. The session ended with a cool-down period on a chair (approximately 10&#x02013;20 minutes), which allowed for relaxation and stretching. The intensity of each component exercise was estimated by using the guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r07">7</xref></sup> and the compendium of physical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r08">8</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="tbl01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Exercises included in

metabolic equivalents [METs]). The exercises, which attempted to increase flexibility and aerobic capacity, were accompanied by music and began with continuous movement of the legs and trunk and intermittent movement of the arms. Then, strength exercises were performed with a rubber band, a ball, or the participant&#x02019;s body weight. Specifically, these exercises involved movements of the shoulder (abductors, adductors, and rotators), elbow (flexors and extensors), trunk (flexors and extensors), hip (flexors, extensors, abductors, and adductors), knee (flexors and extensors), and foot (ankle dorsal and plantar flexors).</p><p>During the next 3 months, standing exercises using a chair as support (ie, rise from a chair, half-squats, rise to a tiptoe position, knee raise, and hip extension) were begun as strength exercises. In addition, the duration and intensity of aerobic and strength exercises in the above chair-sitting exercises were gradually increased on an individual basis. Walking for approximately 3 to 6 minutes was also added as an aerobic exercise. The intensity of each component exercise ranged from approximately 1.8 to 3.0 METs. After 6 months, the duration and intensity of the aerobic and strength exercises were further increased, and balance exercises (eg, 1-legged standing with a chair as support and sitting on a soft ball with a stable posture) and combined exercises were introduced.</p><p>The exercises in the home-based module were very similar to those of the in-class regimen. Participants in the intervention group received a weekly 1-page handout that illustrated and explained the physical exercises, which consisted of stretching and strength exercises using body weight and a towel. We recommended that the participants do the home exercises for 10 minutes every day except Thursdays, when the supervised exercise sessions were held. The intensity of the exercises was gradually increased, and dynamic and combined exercises were gradually introduced. Compliance with the home regimen was checked by examining the training diary that was completed by each subject.</p><p>No specific intervention was conducted for the control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of physical performance, walking ability, and HRQOL</title><p>At baseline (May-June 2004) and 12 months later (May-June 2005), the subjects who had not dropped out were examined for body mass index, physical performance, walking ability, and HRQOL. Physical performance measurements included muscle strength (lower-limb and grip strength), balance (timed 1-legged standing with open eyes), flexibility (sit-and-reach test), and aerobic endurance capacity (6-minute walking distance). Walking ability measurements were estimated by analyzing movement, and comprised walking speed and stride length, as well as knee joint angle, trunk angle, and thigh angle upon heel contact.

Each subject sat on a pedestal with a strap placed around the leg just proximal to the ankle joint, and was asked to kick forward with maximal force. Grip strength was assessed with a digital squeeze dynamometer (YDM-110D, YAGAMI. Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan). For these 2 measurements, 2 test trials were completed on each side of the body. The final score was the average of the best right- and left-side scores. In timed 1-legged standing, each subject conducted 1 practice trial and 1 test trial on each side, and the average of the values from the right and left sides was used in the analysis. For the sit-and-reach test, each subject completed 1 practice trial and 2 test trials, and the best score was used. For the 6-minute walking test, 1 test trial was performed. For measurement of walking ability, the neck, elbow, waist, knee, ankle, and sole of the foot of the subjects were marked with colored balls. Then, each subject completed 10 meters of ordinary walking, which was videotaped with a digital video camera recorder (DCR-PC 120, SONY Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) at a sampling rate of 60 Hz. Kinematic analysis of the walking was done using a computerized system. The authors prepared a manual for these measurements beforehand and instructed the examiners (ie, graduate students at Saga University, staff members of the facility, and the fitness instructor) in how to conduct the measurements. The HRQOL measurements were obtained by means of an interview conducted by trained nurses with at least 5 years of experience in a related field.</p></sec><sec><title>Monitoring daily physical activity</title><p>A single-axis accelerometer (Kenz Lifecorder EX, Suzuken Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), which measures vertical accelerations at the hip, was used to evaluate daily physical activity.

Six control subjects could not participate in the reassessment because 2 were hospitalized, 3 were homebound, and 1 declined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). There were no significant differences in baseline data between the individuals who failed to complete the reassessment and those who completed it (data not shown). Furthermore, there were missing data on outcome measures, due to the subjects' poor physical condition, absence from assessment, unwillingness to participate, and measurement error. The respective numbers of intervention group and control group subjects who had measurements before and after the intervention period were 24 and 23 for physical performance, 16 and 17 for walking ability, 21 and 17 for daily physical activity, and 23 and 26 for the HRQOL measurements. The low amount of data on walking ability was mainly due to failures in video recording (eg, out-of-focus recordings) and subject absences.</p><p>The attendance rate for the 55 supervised exercise sessions ranged from 54.5% to 100%, with a median of 89.1%. The subjects in the intervention group reported a median of 2.4 home exercise sessions per week. No accidents or medical complications related directly to the exercises were observed.</p><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl02">2</xref>
shows the baseline characteristics of the study subjects who attended the baseline survey (including those who could not participate in the reassessment after the 12-month intervention period). The median age was 85 years in the intervention group and 84 years in the control group, and women accounted for 82% of all subjects. No significant differences at baseline were present between the intervention and control groups in anthropometric measurements, level of long-term care required, physical performance, walking ability, daily physical activity, or HRQOL measurements (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl02">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table

In addition, grip strength, 6-minute walking distance, walking speed, and stride length significantly decreased in the control group, whereas these measurements remained constant in the intervention group, which suggests that the current exercise program protects against age-related deterioration of these aspects of physical fitness in very elderly people with minor disabilities.</p><p>Exercise programs for frail elderly people should be acceptable to and safe for such a population. The average rate of attendance at our supervised exercise program was high (median, 89%), and no injuries were observed in the program. In contrast, a randomized trial of treadmill walking, bicycling, weightlifting, and tai chi training for residents of long-term care facilities had a low adherence rate (mean, 40%) and no treatment effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref></sup> In addition, a high-intensity resistance exercise program led to an increased risk of musculoskeletal injury among frail older people.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref></sup> Our exercise program did not require any special machines and consisted of multicomponent exercises whose intensity was gradually increased. In addition, all exercises were taught so as to be interactive and enjoyable. These properties may explain the high compliance and safety of this study.</p><p>High-intensity strength training has been reported to improve lower-limb strength, even among the old-old.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref></sup> However, a Japanese study found no significant change in lower-limb strength or flexibility among elderly subjects (median age, 77 years; long-term care Level 1 or 2) after 12 weeks of power rehabilitation using a weight training machine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref></sup> It should be noted that few studies have examined the effects of low-intensity, multicomponent, exercise training for very elderly people with physical disabilities or functional limitations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup> Worm et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref></sup> reported that a 12-week low-intensity, multicomponent, exercise program had a significantly favorable effect on balance, muscle strength, walking function, and self-assessed functional ability in community-dwelling, frail, older people. Similarly, the intervention group in the present study experienced improvements in their lower-limb strength and sit-and-reach test score, even with low-intensity training.</p><p>Lower-limb strength and grip strength were inversely related to the risk of death in 75- and 80-year-olds.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup> In addition, walking speed and stride length were inversely associated with the risk of mortality, dependency, and institutionalization in Chinese elders aged 70 years or older.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref></sup> A slow walking speed was predictive of the risk of death among 75- and 80-year-olds,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref></sup> and was associated with the onset of functional dependence in a population of Japanese elders (especially those aged 75 years or older).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref></sup> We believe that is important to point out that the intervention group in the present study, in comparison to the control group, either improved or maintained their levels of physical performance (ie, lower-limb strength, grip strength, walking speed, and stride length).</p><p>One unexpected finding of this study was that daily physical activity significantly decreased in both the intervention and control groups after 12 months. The subjects in this study were very sedentary and seldom went out, as shown by the baseline total steps per day (medians: 1068 and 914 for the intervention and control groups, respectively). Therefore, simply encouraging the intervention group to walk may not have motivated them sufficiently to alter such extremely low activity levels. Moreover, many of the subjects had some form of cognitive impairment, as indicated by the initial MMSE score (medians: 22 and 23 points for the intervention and control groups, respectively),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref></sup> which may have limited their understanding of the advice regarding walking. Because daily physical activity is known to influence physical fitness and the incidence of certain chronic diseases in older adults,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref></sup> further studies are required in order to develop intervention methods that are effective in increasing daily physical activity among the old-old.</p><p>One of the main goals for an effective program to prevent disability has been improved HRQOL, which appears particularly important for elders receiving nursing care, as they are likely to have lower HRQOL than those not receiving nursing care.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref></sup> Although several studies have shown beneficial effects of exercise on HRQOL in the very old,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref></sup><sup>&#x02013;</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref></sup> this study failed to demonstrate such an effect for any measure of HRQOL except the Falls Efficacy Scale (<italic>P</italic> for the difference between the two groups = 0.06). A longer follow-up period and a larger sample size may be necessary to examine these effects.</p><p>In the revised long-term care insurance system of Japan, preventing a shift in the elderly from minor to moderate or severe disabilities is a major concern. We observed that a multicomponent exercise program may prevent an increase in the need for long-term care in the intervention group subjects (OR = 0.56), although the effect was not statistically significant. This suggests the need for larger studies with longer exercise intervention durations.</p><p>There are several limitations in this study. First, the subjects were not randomly allocated to the exercise intervention. This study was conducted under the auspices of the long-term care insurance system, which mandated that the exercise program had to be provided almost equally to all elderly residents of a single facility. This explains why we could not establish a randomized controlled trial design. However, the baseline characteristics of the 2 groups of study subjects were almost identical. Another limitation is that approximately 20% of the subjects dropped out after the baseline survey. Sattin et al<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r04">4</xref></sup> reported that 30% of transitionally frail participants did not complete a 48-week trial, which is a rate similar to that of the present study. Such drop-outs are perhaps inevitable in an intervention trial of the very old. If drop-outs related to the outcome measurements (eg, lower-limb strength) were occurring differentially due to the presence or absence of the exercise intervention, the relevant results may have been biased. However, no material differences in the rate of or reason for drop-outs were observed between the intervention and control groups. Third, in addition to our concerns regarding drop-outs, there were additional missing data on outcome measurements, which could lead to both selection bias and type II errors due to the small sample size. Regarding selection bias, there was no significant difference in the rate of or reason for such missing data between the 2 groups. Due to possible type II errors, however, insignificant results (eg, regarding the Falls efficacy scale) should be accepted with caution. Fourth, the assessors were not blinded to the group assignment. Although we did our best to standardize the testing procedures, as described in the Methods, there could have been some subjective assessments that may have led to measurement bias.</p><p>Despite the above limitations, our findings suggest that the present 12-month multicomponent exercise program may improve or maintain physical performance in elderly people with minor disabilities (long-term care Level 1 in the insurance system of Japan). The exercise program required no special training machines, and therefore might be cost-effective for an insurance system whose budget is likely to increase due to the rapidly growing target population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by research grants from Saga Medical School (Y.H.).
