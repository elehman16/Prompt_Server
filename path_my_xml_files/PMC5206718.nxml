Epidemiological studies indicate that lifestyle factors, e.g. physical, cognitive and social activities, correlate with reduced dementia risk; moreover, positive effects on cognition of physical/cognitive training have been found in cognitively unimpaired elders. Less is known about effectiveness and action mechanisms of physical/cognitive training in elders already suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a population at high risk for dementia. We assessed in 113 MCI subjects aged 65&#x02013;89 years, the efficacy of combined physical-cognitive training on cognitive decline, Gray Matter (GM) volume loss and Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) in hippocampus and parahippocampal areas, and on brain-blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activity elicited by a cognitive task, measured by ADAS-Cog scale, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) and fMRI, respectively, before and after 7 months of training vs. usual life. Cognitive status significantly decreased in MCI-no training and significantly increased in MCI-training subjects; training increased parahippocampal CBF, but no effect on GM volume loss was evident; BOLD activity increase, indicative of neural efficiency decline, was found only in MCI-no training subjects. These results show that a non pharmacological, multicomponent intervention improves cognitive status and indicators of brain health in MCI subjects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The world is experiencing a substantial increase in the proportion of elderly adults in the population. With an aging society comes the increase in age related frailties, which may lead to cognitive impairments and to dementia, mostly in the form of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (AD). Age is indeed the major risk factor for dementia: the age-specific incidence rates for AD demonstrate a doubling of incidence for about every six years of added life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. The number of people with dementia worldwide was 35.6 million in 2010 and that is estimated to increase to 65.7 million by 2030 and 115.4 million by 2050 unless effective means of reducing the incidence of this disease are introduced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>.</p><p>Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated that modifiable lifestyle factors, such as practicing physical exercise, being engaged in stimulating cognitive activities, maintaining an active social life into old age, and controlling nutrition, are correlated with maintaining good brain functioning, specifically in the elderly, and with reduced risk of developing dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. Norton <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> estimated that around one third of AD cases worldwide might be attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors which include several lifestyle habits. Interventions based on cognitive training<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, diet<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> or physical activity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> have indeed been found to produce positive effects on cognitive status in cognitively unimpaired adult or elderly subjects. Potential mechanisms underlying the effects of cognitive and physical activity on cognition, suggested also by studies in animal models, include increased hippocampal neurogenesis, increased Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF), and enhanced brain plasticity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>An important point that has recently emerged both from the human and animal research, is that enhanced physical and cognitive activities seem to have additive effects on brain plasticity and age related cognitive decline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In this line, a very important study is the FINGER trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, in which 1260 subjects, aged 60&#x02013;77 years, with cognition in the mean level for age and elevated Dementia Risk Score, were randomized to a 2 year multidomain intervention of diet, exercise, cognitive training, and vascular risk monitoring, showing that cognitive performances improved more in the intervention than in the control group.</p><p>Less is known about the effectiveness of exercise or cognitive training interventions on cognitive decline in older individuals already suffering from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or dementia and on the underlying mechanisms of action (see recent review papers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). MCI is characterized by objective deficits in one single domain (e.g. memory) or multiple domains of cognition, which do not yet configure as overt dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. MCI subjects are considered a population at high risk for dementia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>, a large proportion of them proceeding indeed towards it. Therefore, they are a promising target of interventions aimed at reducing the incidence of dementia.</p><p>Here, we have undertaken a Randomized Control Study in a group of 113 MCI subjects to assess the efficacy of the combination of multidomain cognitive training and physical exercise in a social setting in reducing cognitive decline, in reducing Gray Matter (GM) volume loss, in increasing Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) in hippocampus and parahippocampal areas, as well as in ameliorating task-related brain activity.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>The flow chart of the study is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>. The eligible population for the study included elderly subjects aged between 65 and 89 years with Mild Cognitive Impairment confirmed at the neurological examination according to the current guidelines.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were neurological pathologies, moderate or severe dementia (CDR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1), clinical evidence for depression (GDS&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;9) or other psychiatric disorders, advanced neoplasia, severe aortic stenosis, obstructive hypertrophic cardiomiopathy, severe chronic renal insufficiency (glomerular filtration rate (GFR)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;35&#x02009;ml/min), severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uncompensated type II diabetes, arteriopathy class III Leriche-Fontaine, epilepsy, drug addiction, recent cranial trauma, sensory-motor deficits preventing participation to cognitive assessment and training or pathologies or orthopedic problems barring or limiting participation to the aerobic physical training program.</p><p>Subjects gave written informed consent for participation in the study. Study design and protocol, including subject privacy and sensitive data treatment, have been approved by the Regional Ethical Committee for Clinical Experimentation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier is NCT01725178 (November 8, 2012). All methods included in the protocol were carried out in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Subject recruitment was performed using a two-phase scheme. A first screening phase was performed to select potentially eligible subjects from the general population. These potentially eligible subjects underwent a second phase of clinical confirmation, which also provided the baseline (T0) cognitive status.

We used the term MCI to refer to symptomatic predementia phase. MCI is a syndrome defined by clinical, cognitive and functional criteria. We recruited in the study subjects from the general population who displayed cognitive deficits in performing complex functional tasks. These subjects came to the screening phase because they had experienced a decrease in their cognitive performance with respect to the past; however, they maintained their independence of function in daily life, with minimal need for aid or assistance.</p><p>For the MCI diagnosis, the diagnostic criteria proposed by European Consortium on Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Working Group on MCI<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> were applied. A comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tasks was chosen to assess performance in several cognitive domains (see online additional Method section). Moreover, a questionnaire concerning demographic, occupational and social data, education, medical history, pharmacological drug use and lifestyle habits (tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, recreational and physical activity) was filled in. A final clinical diagnosis had to be confirmed by the results of both the neuropsychological examination and the clinical evaluation.</p><p>Of the 288 subjects entered in the phase of clinical confirmation, 157 did not receive an MCI diagnosis (136 had a normal cognitive profile and 21 resulted sufficiently impaired, cognitively and functionally, to meet National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for mild AD) and 131 received an MCI diagnosis.

Each cycle was structured in sessions aimed at stimulating the following main functions: acoustic attention, visual attention, visual memory, imagination, orientation and spatial memory, personal and temporal orientation, verbal memory, lexical abilities, memory for terms and meanings, affective memory, memory for texts, memory for faces and names, logic. Each cycle began with a theoretic-strategic lesson given by the cognitive trainers and focused on specific cognitive processes, such as memory, learning, attention, meta-cognition.</p><p>During the various sessions, there was an alternation of paper and pencil tests, social games, and multimedia-computer exercises, and the cognitive training was based on a balanced alternation of sessions for single cognitive modality and sessions focused on multimodal activities. There was no overlap between any paper and pen test and any of the neuropsychological tasks employed for cognitive assessment. All paper and pen exercises have been purposefully designed to train cognitive functions employing tasks never included in any of the cognitive tests.</p><p>Single modality sessions were aimed at intensively stimulating specific cognitive domains, such as memory, attention and executive functions. Multimodal activities were aimed at reconstructing a more ecological environment for the enrolled subjects, in order to favour socialisation and interpersonal exchanges in an enriching context. Alternation between the two types of sessions allowed maintaining an active participation in the enrolled subjects, stimulating their curiosity and attention and reducing levels of anxiety and potentially negative stress factors. Moreover, an alternation between sessions for single cognitive modality and multimodal activities was also aimed at avoiding habituation processes and at favouring diffuse and generalised brain stimulation, in order to maximise the chance to positively impact on the subject everyday life.</p><p>Once a month, a session of movie watching and discussion (Cineforum) was given to all classes together.</p><p>Once a week, subjects of each class attended together a session of 1&#x02009;h music therapy, during which they were both involved in listening activities and also directly engaged in singing, musical instrument playing and rhythmic movements.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Physical training</title><p>Supervised 7-month aerobic exercise training was performed in a Fitness Centre within the structure built on purpose within the National Research Council Area of Research in Pisa.

The training was relatively intensive, three mornings each week, and all activities were supervised. Epidemiological studies suggested the possibility that unsupervised, subject-choice physical or cognitive activities might also be beneficial in reducing age related cognitive decline. However, since no study was available, when the study was undertaken, directly investigating the effects of a combined physical and cognitive training in MCI subjects, we felt the need to provide supervised, reproducible activities. In addition, the presence of psychological supervision contributed to the high compliance for the training exhibited by our subjects. The fact that training activities were inspired by everyday activities made possible for each participant to find matching daily-activities. The choice of a supervised, small group training received <italic>a-posteriori</italic> support by the review of Gates and Sachdev<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> on the effects of cognitive training in preclinical and early AD and commenting that supervised small group multi-domain training providing the greatest benefits.</p><p>The intervention was safe and well received, as shown by the very low drop out rate in the MCI-training group. This high compliance underscores the advantage of a multi component training in terms of motivation; indeed our intervention not only combined physical and cognitive training but provided a variety of activities, included music therapy, aiming to stimulate social interactions and to reduce adaptation and decline of interest. The social component is often neglected in interventions, but being engaged in social activities resulted a protective factor in the Yaffe <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> study and there is evidence that mental, physical and social stimulation equally contribute to decrease dementia risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Thus, including social components in future interventions might prove advantageous.</p><p>Our primary outcome was the extent of cognitive decline from cognitive baseline and the end of 7 months of training/usual life, with the general hypothesis that the training would reduce the extent of cognitive decline with respect to controls. Our results show an effect of the training stronger than hypothesized: indeed, 7 months of training significantly improved global cognitive status, as assessed with ADAS-Cog score, while control subjects show a significant decline during the same period. Thus, it appears that the intervention does not simply restrain cognitive decline, but causes an improvement with respect to baseline cognitive status. The effect size for the improvement is at the upper limit of the small effect size range; it is therefore bigger than effect size found in either physical only or cognitive only training interventions in MCI subjects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Compared with the only other combined physical and cognitive intervention performed in an MCI population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>, the effect size of the improvement in training subjects is similar; however, the cumulative effect size is larger in our study, since performance of our control MCI subjects significantly declined over the training period, while in (56) it did not. This could be due to the fact that in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref> the control group received both sham cognitive and sham exercise interventions, such as watching 5 short National Geographic videos followed by a set of 15 questions regarding the presented material, while our MCI-no training group continued with their usual life.</p><p>Our results are also in line with the results obtained in a large population of cognitively unimpaired elders by the FINGER study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, a multicomponent intervention administered for two years. In this study both the intervention and non intervention groups showed an improvement in cognitive performance, with the intervention group showing a significantly larger improvement in global cognition than the control group. Here it is more difficult to compare effect size of interventions, since our population of subjects is MCI and the population of FINGER is not. In addition, the FINGER control group received regular health advice on healthy diet and physical, cognitive, and social activities beneficial for management of vascular risk factors and disability prevention, which our MCI control group did not receive.</p><p>Even taking into account differences in intervention protocols, these studies and our study suggest that combined physical and cognitive interventions might indeed be particularly effective in improving cognitive performance both in non MCI and in MCI subjects.</p><p>Cognitive improvement was evident also at the level of single cognitive domains and in particular for phonemic verbal fluency. Thus, the Train the Brain combined intervention has beneficial effects both on global cognition and on cognitive domains of relevance for everyday activities.</p><p>Concerning the secondary outcomes, the general hypothesis was that the training would: reduce the Gray Matter (GM) volume loss in hippocampus and parahippocampal areas, modify Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF) in hippocampus and parahippocampal areas, as assessed by MRI, and modify task-related brain activity as assessed by fMRI.</p><p>Gray Matter volume loss turned out to be the same in MCI-training and MCI-no training subjects, indicating that our training had no effect on this outcome. Therefore, the beneficial effects of training on cognitive status cannot be attributed to an effect on hippocampal atrophy, which was the same in MCI-training and &#x02013;no training subjects. This is reminiscent of data from animal models of neurodegenerative disorders<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref> which show that increasing physical and cognitive activity can ameliorate cognitive performance without reducing brain atrophy, acting instead on factors involved in brain functional plasticity. In the human literature, hippocampal volumetry has been connected with complex cognitive activity in aging by Valenzuela <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, who determined whether individual differences in lifespan complex mental activity are linked to altered rates of hippocampal atrophy. They found that high level of complex mental activity across the lifespan was correlated with a reduced rate of hippocampal atrophy. However, in a more recent study on post mortem samples from subjects with a 14 years follow up, coming from a large cohort of subjects aged&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;65 years (United Kingdom Medical Research Council Cognitive Function and Ageing Study), Valenzuela <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref> found no evidence for hippocampal neuroprotection in subjects with high levels of complex cognitive activity. Instead, men and women both exhibited significantly greater neuronal density, as well as correlated increases in cortical thickness in prefrontal area 9 linked to cognitive lifestyle, consistent with a compensatory process. Lifespan complex cognitive activity may therefore protect against dementia through multiple biological pathways.</p><p>As for physical exercise effects on hippocampal volumetry, data are available for non MCI elders: Erickson <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>, in a randomized controlled trial in cognitively normal older adults, showed that aerobic exercise training leads to improvements in spatial memory and is accompanied by a 2% increase in anterior hippocampal volume, which reverses age-related volume loss. They also demonstrated that increased hippocampal volume is associated with greater serum levels of BDNF. BDNF is a mediator of neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus in response to physical exercise and EE but also a well know synaptic plasticity factor (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>As for the other two secondary outcomes, data of MRI and fMRI show that beneficial effects of intervention were evident on brain CBF and neural processing efficiency, suggesting an improvement of cerebral function and, possibly, a direct action on dementia pathogenesis. Transition from healthy aging to MCI to AD seems to be accompanied by a complex pattern of changes in the pattern of CBF (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). Arterial Spin Labelling MR offers a non invasive method to assess Cerebral Blood Flow and is an emerging biomarker for MCI and AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>. Diminished CBF reduces brain supply of oxygen, energy substrates and nutrients, impairs the clearance of neurotoxic molecules, and this is known to contribute to neuronal dysfunction found in neurodegenerative disorders, which are of early appearance in Medial Temporal Lobe regions. Our results show that MCI subjects respond to training with an increase in Medial Temporal Lobe CBF, particularly evident in parahippocampal regions, strongly involved in non verbal, spatial information processing (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that reduced CBF might directly contribute to brain beta-amyloidosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>. Indeed, in animal models, mild chronic brain hypoperfusion results in increased brain A-beta presence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>. Therefore, the increase in CBF caused by the Train the Brain intervention might not only indicate a more physiological perfusion state, with a reduction of neuronal dysfunction, but might also affect brain A-beta burden.</p><p>An effect of lifestyle factors such as cognitive activity on A&#x003b2; is also suggested by human epidemiological studies. Landau <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref> assessed whether the level of cognitive and physical exercise was associated with the extent of A&#x003b2; deposition in healthy elders; A&#x003b2; burden was determined using the 11&#x02013;labeled Pittsburgh Compound B and positron emission tomography. The subjects were followed for 6 years. The results showed that lower A&#x003b2; burden was found in subjects more engaged in cognitively stimulating activities, particularly during early and middle life. A recent study suggests that greater levels of physical activity in MCI subjects is associated with lower A&#x003b2; plaque and tangle deposition, estimated by PET<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>. Thus, there seems to be a correlation between cognitive/physical activity and A&#x003b2; burden.</p><p>A recent finding in animal models of AD, which has been shown also in human patients, is that age-related cognitive impairments correlate with the presence of diffuse, low-weight A&#x003b2; oligomers, which are sufficient to impair synaptic plasticity and memory performance also when acutely administered to young normal animals (see ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>), and are currently hypothesized to be the first pathogenic agents in AD. It has been shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref> that early exposure to increased levels of physical and cognitive activity in social setting (Enriched Environment, EE) completely prevented A&#x003b2; soluble oligomers extracted from human AD patient cortex from damaging hippocampal synaptic plasticity in young normal animals. Thus, physical and cognitive activity could not only reduce A&#x003b2; in the aged brain, but also make age-vulnerable brain structures, such as the hippocampus, resilient to A&#x003b2; negative effects.</p><p>An indication of an effect of the combined physical and cognitive intervention on brain functional plasticity comes from the fMRI data, suggestive of an effect of training on neural efficiency. Indeed, while performance levels remained equal between T0 and T7 in both groups, MCI-no training subjects showed an increase of BOLD signal between T0 and T7, an indication of reduced neural efficiency; on the contrary, neural efficiency seems to be preserved in MCI-training subjects, who achieved the same behavioural performance accuracy engaging less neural resources.</p><p>A point of weakness of this study is the reduction we experienced in the sample of subjects undergoing MRI, and in particular the fact that this reduction was larger for MCI-no training than for MCI-training subjects. This may have reduced the benefits of the initial randomization and could weaken the conclusions which can be drawn from MRI data. However, the MCI-training and -no training groups which underwent MRI did not significantly differ for any of the baseline variables between themselves and did not differ from the respective total cohort, suggesting that in these smaller groups distribution of baseline data respects the one in the original, randomized groups. Nevertheless, the differential drop out remains a point of weakness and, in a future work, it would be necessary to program supervision also for the controls to maintain motivation, interest and high compliance for the entire duration of the study, reducing their drop out. We cannot exclude that, even if not significant, imbalance in an important parameter such as education between MCI-training and &#x02013;no training group which underwent MRI might have contributed to an imbalance in MRI results. However, MRI results refer to a change following intervention, and therefore one should further hypothesize that cognitive reserve affect training effects. In a next work, it will be important to explicitly investigate the possible role played by education in terms of training effectiveness.</p><p>One final consideration on our data is that in this paper we report acute training effects on cognition, CBF and brain functional activation, assessed immediately after training end. Follow up data, which are underway, will tell us if and how these effects decay with time and will allow a better understanding of the clinical relevance of our results in terms of dementia onset delay.</p><p>In conclusion, a non pharmacological, combined physical and cognitive training in a social setting improves cognitive status of MCI subjects and improves indicators of brain health. The improvement is a small effect size. However, as pointed out by Ngandu <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>, even small size effects in these initial stages may result in considerable gains in terms of public health. This underscores the importance of interventions aimed at multiple lifestyle factors as possible strategies to reduce or delay dementia conversion in MCI subjects, thus reducing dementia incidence.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Maffei, L. <italic>et al</italic>.
