Overnight operations pose a challenge because our circadian biology inhibits cognitive performance at night. Yet how the circadian system modulates cognition over multiple days under realistic shift work conditions remains to be established. Importantly, because task-specific cognitive brain regions show different 24-h circadian dynamics, we hypothesize that circadian misalignment impacts cognition task-dependently. Using a biologically-driven paradigm mimicking night shift work, with a randomized, cross-over design, we show that misalignment between the circadian pacemaker and behavioral/environmental cycles increases cognitive vulnerability on sustained attention, cognitive throughput, information processing and visual-motor performance over multiple days, compared to circadian alignment (day shifts). Circadian misalignment effects are task-dependent: while they acutely impair sustained attention with recovery after 3-days, they progressively hinder daily learning. Individuals felt sleepier during circadian misalignment, but they did not rate their performance as worse. Furthermore, circadian misalignment effects on sustained attention depended on prior sleep history. Collectively, daily circadian misalignment may provide an important biological framework for developing countermeasures against adverse cognitive effects in shift workers.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">We live in an &#x0201c;around-the-clock&#x0201d; 24/7 society, to the extent that ~10% of Americans work at night, on fixed, rotating, or irregular schedules<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and these numbers are only likely to increase. Epidemiological data suggest that up to a third of night shift workers meet the minimal diagnostic criteria for shift work disorder (SWD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, defined by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) as a major circadian rhythm sleep disorder (CRSD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The consequences of working beyond our biological capabilities include symptoms ranging from wake-time sleepiness to disorders of sleep and cardiometabolic function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Shift work increases the risk for human operational errors, such that drowsiness due to shift work has contributed to key industrial disasters, including Space Shuttle Challenger, Chernobyl and Alaska Oil Spill disasters<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Overnight operations challenge our circadian biology, which promotes daytime vigilance and nocturnal sleep<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, thus resulting in a misalignment between the internal circadian (biological) rhythms and the required society demands for sleep/wake times<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Importantly, our endogenous circadian system inhibits cognitive performance in the biological nighttime hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, although it remains to be fully established whether this increased cognitive vulnerability extends in a similar way across multiple cognitive domains or it is cognitive-domain specific<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that fMRI-BOLD cognitive brain responses exhibit different 24-h circadian dynamics specific to a given task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, which highlights the task-dependent nature of the circadian deterioration in nighttime performance.</p><p id="Par3">Translating the putative role of circadian dynamics on human cognition from circadian protocols into shift work settings remains challenging. Firstly, the influence of circadian misalignment on cognition is derived from study paradigms that do not simulate night shift work conditions. For instance, in circadian constant routine protocols study participants are kept awake for more than 24&#x02009;hours while kept in a constant posture under very low light conditions, and circadian forced desynchrony protocols involve recurrent fixed sleep-wake cycles under dim light conditions with cycles that are much shorter or longer than the typical 24-h cycles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Furthermore, most of our current understanding of cognitive vulnerability at night builds mostly upon dynamics <italic>within a single</italic> 2<italic>4-h period</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, whereas the effects of circadian misalignment on cognition in shift work are typically experienced <italic>over multiple days</italic>, which limits the translation of these circadian protocols into real-life settings. Secondly, most controlled simulated night work studies have primarily tested cognitive function within a single domain, which is attention resources<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, while in shift work many different cognitive domains are being taxed, dependent on specific components of the work, including cognitive flexibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Given that task-specific cognitive brain responses show different 24-h dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, it is unlikely that all cognitive domains will be (equally) jeopardized over 24-h and with repeated night work. Therefore, one may hypothesize that circadian misalignment, which is typically experienced in night shift workers, impacts cognition task-dependently. Collectively, these gaps of knowledge highlight the need to better understand how the combination of simulated night work (biologically driven by circadian misalignment) and task specificity impact on cognitive performance across multiple work shifts. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine to what extent the misalignment between the endogenous circadian timing system and behavioral/environmental cycles (i.e. wake/sleep, feeding/fasting, light/dark cycles)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> - typically experienced by night shift workers - modulates cognition <italic>task-dependently over multiple days</italic>. To address this aim, different cognitive tests were carried out during scheduled wakefulness (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) to assess sustained attention, cognitive throughput, information processing, visual-motor performance and declarative memory, which are exquisitely sensitive to increased sleep pressure and circadian phase, and required for optimal performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Within-subject, randomized, cross-over study design.

Importantly, circadian misalignment differentially affected cognitive performance, such that basic sustained attention was acutely impaired and gradually recovered upon repeated exposure to circadian misalignment. Conversely, cognitive throughput, information processing and visual-motor performance during misalignment lost the daily improvements during circadian misalignment that were observed when the same individuals were under circadian alignment. Lastly, declarative memory performance was not substantially affected.</p><p id="Par9">Previous forced desynchrony data indicate an increased rate of deterioration in sustained attention (PVT performance) across wakefulness, particularly during the circadian &#x0201c;night&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Similar to those circadian paradigms, our simulated shift work design points to a larger misalignment-induced decline in sustained attention 11&#x02009;h after scheduled awakening (6AM), as compared to 7&#x02009;h (2AM). Putative mechanisms include the stronger circadian sleep-promoting signal (6AM vs. 2AM) and homeostatic sleep pressure load (11&#x02009;h vs. 7&#x02009;h after scheduled awakening)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Cognitive vulnerability is known to be maximum during the early morning hours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, and in real-life settings, these sensitive hours correspond to when most operational failures and motor vehicle crashes seem to happen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Neurobiological mechanisms for higher cognitive vulnerability during overnight wakefulness may include increased nocturnal cortical excitability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and a relative increase of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. Thus, the neuronal milieu during the night may favor sleep by increasing a &#x0201c;GABAergic tone&#x0201d;, potentially leading to cognitive decline. Furthermore, repeated exposure to circadian misalignment was associated with daily dynamic changes in the deployment of basic attention resources, with acute cognitive deterioration and subsequent amelioration over days of misalignment. The dual effects of circadian misalignment and acute sleep loss have been shown to impair sustained and selective attention on the first night of simulated shift work (subsequent to an extended wake period of more than 24&#x02009;h)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. In a similar vein, our data indicate that sleep efficiency significantly predicts sustained attention, such that following the first day of misalignment, lower sleep efficiency predicted slower reaction times in PVT performance. Subsequent recovery in vigilant attention across days of misalignment (see Figs&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>) may be due to lower homeostatic sleep pressure during the scheduled nocturnal wake period due to improved daytime sleep (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>) and/or the circadian system becoming slightly more appropriately aligned with the daytime sleep opportunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Brain mechanisms accounting for the effects of acute sleep loss (e.g., sleep before test day 2) on sustained attention include adenosine and functional A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor (A<sub>1</sub>AR) availability, which are posited to mediate sleep&#x02013;wake regulation and cognitive performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Indeed, recent Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data in humans indicate that extending wakefulness into the circadian night may result in a higher A<sub>1</sub>AR availability in the human brain with concomitant detrimental effects on sustained attention performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par10">Our current understanding of cognitive vulnerabilities in shift work paradigms comes from data on vigilant attention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.

To our knowledge, it is unknown if cognitive abilities including cognitive throughput, information processing, visual-motor performance and declarative memory are hindered by multiple days of simulated shift work. As these cognitive domains heavily depend on the effects of sleep pressure and circadian phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, we investigated the impact of circadian misalignment to tasks associated with these cognitive processes. Here we show that, within a single 24-h period, performance on these tasks [including visual-motor task (TKT)] is fairly stable between both circadian conditions, but that across multiple days of circadian misalignment, performance does not progressively improve as observed during circadian alignment. Previous forced desynchrony data indicated increased vulnerability of cognitive throughput (ADD) and information processing (DSST) when individuals perform during the circadian night<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, and that, across multiple days of circadian misalignment, performance does not improve as compared to when individuals are under circadian alignment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Inherent to the study design of these previous studies and the current study, it is not possible to distinguish whether the impaired improvement across multiple days of misalignment is due to a lack of learning, or that they were unable to express benefits gained from learning. This distinction only becomes visible during recovery. In sleep restriction studies, neurobehavioral deficits (e.g., DSST) induced by consecutive nights of sleep restriction improved with acute recovery sleep, reaching baseline performance levels<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Although it may be difficult to rapidly both sleep debt and realign the multi-oscillator circadian system following circadian misalignment, as compared to after &#x02018;simple&#x02019; sleep restriction, future studies are needed to test whether the inability to improve cognitive throughput and information processing performance during days of circadian misalignment is restored to baseline levels following sleep recovery and circadian realignment.</p><p id="Par11">Declarative memory performance remained relatively stable across days for both circadian alignment and circadian misalignment, which could be due to a myriad of factors. Any circadian/sleep homeostatic effects on cognitive performance heavily rely on the intrinsic properties/parameters of a given task [e.g., duration of task, speed, timing of when task is administered, &#x0201c;difficulty&#x0201d; (e.g., speed response vs. recall of learned content), and so forth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the impact of circadian/sleep homeostatic effects seems to differ across cognitive domains, with more prominent effects of extended wakefulness into the circadian night on basic sustained attention as compared to working memory performance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. These cognitive domain-specific effects may be due to the tasks tapping onto different underlying brain regions, which are themselves differentially affected by circadian misalignment/sleep loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Indeed, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI-BOLD) cognitive brain function seems to be under local modulation of cerebral circadian phase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. These data suggest that the circadian rhythmicity imposed by the master clock, located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, can be locally altered in cortical and subcortical regions partially due to task-specific requirements, such as task complexity. In other words, not all cognitive brain regions associated to a given task show similar 24-h dynamics. Therefore, one may hypothesize that circadian misalignment impacts cognition task-dependently, as suggested by our differential circadian misalignment effects on basic sustained attention and daily improvement for cognitive throughput, information processing and visual-motor performance.</p><p id="Par12">Potential limitations of our study include the limited number of cognitive tests during each individual&#x02019;s scheduled wakefulness, as metabolic and cardiovascular measurements were also conducted throughout the study in order to test separate hypotheses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. Given that we only had a limited number of circadian phases and times awake, we may not have captured the combination of highest homeostatic sleep pressure and worst circadian phase. Thus, the circadian misalignment-induced cognitive vulnerability may be even larger than observed. Despite our robust cross-over study design, the relatively low study sample may limit generalizations to a broader population. Lastly, while our study mimicked what shift workers may typically experience daily, it included only 4 days of circadian alignment/misalignment. Thus, the long-term effects of repeated exposure to circadian misalignment on cognitive function remain to be fully established.</p><p id="Par13">Misalignment between behavioral cycles and the internal circadian timing system occurs in many occupational groups in our 24-hr society, including &#x02013; but not limited to - emergency medical and safety personnel, transportation, and industrial power plants. This misalignment occurs mostly because the internal biological timekeeping system of humans is evolutionary conserved to optimally perform during the day and to support sleep at night. This scenario is at odds with nighttime work<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>, and poses a risk for reduction in productivity and an increased likelihood for accidents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. This risk could also be further worsened by a discrepancy between an individuals&#x02019; objective performance on tasks versus how they subjectively rate their performance and sleepiness. Attention processes are discussed in light of the interrelationship of subjective perception of alertness and objective attention, such that if an individual experiences impaired objective attention, subjective alertness may or may not also be impaired<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. For instance, under chronic sleep restriction, individuals who rate themselves as alert and competent can exhibit clear attention deficits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Conversely, observational data using subjective sleepiness scales and measures of vigilant attention indicate that shift workers display substantial sleepiness levels and decrements in vigilant attention while working consecutive 12-h shifts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Here we observed that, while individuals felt progressively sleepier under circadian misalignment albeit rating their performance as unchanged, it did not predict performance impairments across diverse cognitive tasks, similar to that shown during repeated partial sleep restriction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. This discrepancy between deterioration of objective performance and a lack of self-awareness in operational settings may pose additional risk for human operational errors. A single exception in our data was that subjective ratings of sleepiness significantly predicted decrements in sustained attention (but no other cognitive function measure), suggesting that participants at least seemed to be aware that they were sleepier when misaligned. Interventions could perhaps target this self-awareness to help workers become attentive to potential impairments.</p><p id="Par14">As nontraditional work schedules beyond the 9AM-5PM timeframe are becoming ever more common, it becomes increasingly important to understand who may be at risk of unintended work-related cognitive impairment, and why. From that knowledge, employers, workers, and practitioners can better craft practical, effective interventions. In this context, our current findings indicate that daily circadian misalignment may help to explain cognitive vulnerabilities experienced by night workers beyond differences in work conditions, and provide a biological framework for the development of countermeasures against adverse cognitive effects in vulnerable shift work populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">Different aspects of this study, which was designed to test separate hypotheses, have been published previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par16">Volunteers provided written informed consent and received financial compensation.

This approach allows for also stabilizing the variance, e.g., the log transform when the SD is proportional to the mean. PROC TRANSREG iterates until convergence, alternating between 1) finding least-squares estimates of the parameters of the model given the current scoring of the data (that is, the current vectors) and 2) finding least-squares estimates of the scoring parameters given the current set of model parameters. This transformation approach was applied to each subjective scale and cognitive test separately, thus considering the linear or non-linear nature (e.g., skewness) of each data set, which would have been substantially overlooked if applying a single transformation type (i.e., log-transformation) across all variables of interest. The relevance of applying this transformational approach is that each cognitive task may vary in their distribution, and using an identical transformational approach may assume that all cognitive tasks have the same statistical nature under a given study paradigm, which may not necessarily be the case. Importantly, appropriate transformation of data prior to the statistical analyses (e.g., mixed-model analyses of variance) significantly minimizes false-positives. Thus, we applied a TRANSREG approach to each cognitive task, which allowed for the detection of the best fit provided by this approach &#x02013; one of the key outputs of the TRANSREG approach corresponds to a specific lambda coefficient indicating which type of data normalization is required thereafter. Accordingly, the cognitive data were normalized as follows: PVT analyses on reciprocal transformed slowest reaction times, ADD analyses on the ratio of number of correct responses per minute, DSST analyses on the log-transformed ratio of number of correct responses per minute, TKT analyses on the log-transformed number of losses, PRM analyses on log-transformed number of correctly recalled word pairs. For the subjective scale normalization, KSS analyses were performed on the square-root transformed subjective sleepiness data, and PEERS analyses on the raw data of performance ratings. To examine the time-course of cognitive performance and subjective scales, comparisons were made with mixed-model analyses of variance for repeated measures (PROC MIXED, SAS), with main factors &#x0201c;circadian alignment/misalignment condition&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;test day&#x0201d; (BAS1, BAS2, T1, T2, T3 and T4) and &#x0201c;time since scheduled wake&#x0201d; (PVT and PRM: 7-h and 11-h, ADD: 5-h and 9-h, and TKT, DSST, KSS and PEERS: 5-h, 7-h, 9-h and 11-h), and their two and three-way interactions. For the PVT data, we also included a main factor &#x0201c;time-on-task&#x0201d; (first 3&#x02009;min, second 4&#x02009;min and last 3&#x02009;min of the 10-min PVT as for<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>) although no significant effects were observed for this factor and its interaction with the other main factors described above. &#x0201c;Participant&#x0201d; was included as a random factor. Contrasts were assessed with the LSMEANS statement. Because no significant effects were observed for the three-way interaction, but rather for the interaction of &#x0201c;circadian alignment/misalignment condition&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;test day&#x0201d;, we then computed post-hoc multiple comparisons test for this specific interaction, which was adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni corrections on &#x003b1;&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05. Order of circadian alignment/misalignment conditions was included as potential covariate factor, and it did not significantly predict the dynamics of any cognitive task used in this study design. Linear regression models were applied to investigate potential changes across days of circadian alignment/misalignment condition on the dynamics of cognitive performance and self-evaluations of sleepiness and performance (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>; <italic>p</italic>-values with significance set as&#x02009;&#x02264;0.05). We also tested if subject ratings of sleepiness and performance may predict cognitive performance. To that end, covariance analyses (PROC MIXED covtest, SAS) on normalized data were used with factors &#x0201c;subjective rating&#x0201d; (KSS or PEERS), &#x0201c;circadian alignment/misalignment condition&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;test day&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;time since scheduled wake&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par25">Sleep stage data expressed as percentage of time in bed for subsequent data analyses, using mixed-model analyses of variance with main factors &#x0201c;circadian alignment/misalignment condition&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;night&#x0201d; [night 1 (before T2) and night 2 (before T4], and their two-way interaction. To determine the effects of circadian alignment and misalignment on the probability of occurrence of sleep stages, longitudinal local regressions were applied for each sleep stage (PROC LOESS, SAS). Local regressions allow for the implementation of a nonparametric method for estimating local regression surfaces, by performing iterative reweighting to provide robust fitting. In the LOESS method, weighted least squares are used to fit linear or nonlinear functions of the predictors at the centers of neighborhoods. The radius of each neighborhood is chosen such that the neighborhood contains a specified percentage of the data points. The fraction of the data, called the smoothing parameter, in each local neighborhood controls the smoothness of the estimated surface. Thereof, data points in each local neighborhood are weighted by a smooth decreasing function of their distance from the center of the neighborhood. Subsequently, four separate plots were generated to visualize the regression prediction for the cumulative sleep-stage probabilities during circadian alignment and misalignment during nights 1 and 2, and time-course analyses were performed using mixed-model analyses of variance (PROC MIXED, SAS). Lastly, we tested if the individual ability to sleep (sleep efficiency) predicts cognitive performance under both circadian conditions by using covariance analyses (PROC MIXED covtest, SAS) with factors &#x0201c;sleep efficiency&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;circadian alignment/misalignment condition&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;night&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;time since scheduled wake&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data availability</title><p id="Par26">The datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec11"><p>
