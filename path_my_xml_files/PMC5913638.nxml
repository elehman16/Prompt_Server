</p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RA-BEACON was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of baricitinib, an oral highly selective Janus kinase 1 and 2 inhibitor, in patients who had moderately to severely active RA, an insufficient response or intolerance to at least one biologic TNF inhibitor and were taking background conventional DMARD (cDMARD) therapy with or without MTX (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01721044) [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This study enrolled a high proportion of patients (more than one-third) with an inadequate response to or unacceptable side effects associated with both TNF inhibitor and non-TNF inhibitor biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs); only a minority of the studied individuals (&#x0223c;40%) had failed solely one bDMARD. Thus our study population had particularly refractory disease, having mostly received multiple previous biologic therapies [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At week 12, the time of the primary endpoint, baricitinib-treated patients had significantly better functional and clinical responses, including attainment of low disease activity, than placebo-treated patients [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Achieving low disease activity is the major therapeutic target today in patients with established RA [<xref rid="kex489-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="kex489-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A substantial percentage of patients with established RA have utilized many DMARD therapies and failed to achieve a low disease activity state. Clinical trials have similarly revealed that response rates to all currently used agents decrease with increasing cDMARD and bDMARD experience [<xref rid="kex489-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Trials in patients who have failed previous bDMARDs are of particular importance because this population is progressively increasing and has the greatest unmet need within the realm of RA. The extent to which patient characteristics, such as past use of specific bDMARDs, age, disease duration or serological status influence the response to baricitinib was not previously assessed in the RA-BEACON study [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These important questions are addressed in the present analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population and design</title><p>Patients were &#x02a7e;18 years old, with moderately to severely active RA (&#x02a7e;6/68 tender joints and &#x02a7e;6/66 swollen joints; serum high-sensitivity CRP level &#x02a7e;3 mg/l) and must have previously received one or more TNF inhibitor and discontinued treatment because of either insufficient response or intolerance. The protocol did not otherwise place restrictions on the number or type of prior bDMARDs used. All bDMARDs must have been discontinued &#x02a7e;4 weeks prior to randomization (&#x02a7e;6 months for rituximab). At study entry, patients must have had regular use of one or more cDMARD at stable doses and continued cDMARDs as background therapy. The full results of the RA-BEACON study have been previously described [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines and was approved by each centre&#x02019;s institutional review board or ethics committee. All patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>Qualifying patients were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to once-daily placebo or baricitinib at a daily dose of 2 or 4 mg for 24 weeks. Two strata were incorporated into randomization, geographic region and the number of prior bDMARDs used (categorized as less than three or three or more). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients achieving a 20% improvement in ACR criteria (ACR20) for baricitinib 4 mg <italic>vs</italic> placebo at week 12 [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Rescue (baricitinib 4 mg) was assigned at week 16 to patients who did not have at least a 20% improvement in tender and swollen joint counts at weeks 14 and 16. After week 16, patients could receive rescue treatment at the investigator&#x02019;s discretion on the basis of joint counts.</p></sec><sec><title>Subgroups</title><p>The current subgroup analysis was undertaken to evaluate the effect of prior bDMARD history, last bDMARD used, number and type of bDMARD ever received, baseline demographics and clinical characteristics on the efficacy and safety of baricitinib in this population of patients, a large proportion of whom (more than one-third) had a history of an inadequate response to or intolerance associated with both TNF inhibitor and non-TNF inhibitor bDMARDs. The primary study population had high disease activity at baseline with 28-joint DAS based on high-sensitivity CRP level (DAS28-CRP) mean scores of &#x0003e;5.1 and HAQ&#x02013;Disability Index (HAQ-DI) mean scores of &#x0003e;1.5 [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Prespecified subgroups included baseline demographic and clinical characteristics such as age, weight, geographic region, disease duration, seropositivity (RF or ACPA positive; both RF and ACPA negative), corticosteroid use and the number of prior bDMARDs (less than three or three or more).</p><p>Additional subgroups were defined <italic>post hoc</italic> to further evaluate the effect of prior bDMARD use on efficacy and safety: the number of prior TNF inhibitors (categorized 1, &#x02a7e;2); the number of prior non-TNF inhibitors used (categorized 0, &#x02a7e;1); among patients na&#x000ef;ve to non-TNF inhibitor, the number of prior TNF inhibitors used (categorized 1, &#x02a7e;2); specific prior bDMARDs and the last bDMARD used prior to randomization. To explore the influence of baseline disease activity on response, efficacy was also evaluated <italic>post hoc</italic> by baseline Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score tertiles. To further investigate the impact of baseline serostatus, efficacy was evaluated by all four possible combinations of RF and ACPA.</p><p>Efficacy between strata in various subgroups was assessed at week 12 (the time of the primary endpoint assessment) and week 24 by the percentage of patients who had an ACR20 response and/or low disease activity measured by a CDAI &#x02a7d;10. The CDAI &#x02a7d;10 efficacy analyses were conducted <italic>post hoc</italic>. Safety assessments included adverse events in patients treated with one or more than one TNF inhibitor and less than three or three or more bDMARDs. In this subgroup, analyses data are provided for both the baricitinib 2 and 4 mg groups, with the primary focus on baricitinib 4 mg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analysis methods for the overall study have been previously described [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In the current subgroup analysis, comparisons between each baricitinib group and placebo group were performed across subgroups at weeks 12 and 24 on the modified intention-to-treat population, which was defined as all randomized patients who received at least one dose of study drug. Subgroup analyses based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics (excluding the CDAI tertile) for the ACR20 efficacy measure were prespecified while the rest were <italic>post hoc</italic>.</p><p>For the categorical outcomes, non-responder imputation was used in the analysis for patients who received rescue therapy or discontinued from the study or study treatment. A logistic regression model (treatment group + subgroup + treatment by subgroup) was used to detect significant interactions between treatment and subgroups. An interaction <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.10 was considered statistically significant. When the sample size requirements were not met (less than five responders in any treatment group for any subgroup), the interaction <italic>P</italic>-value was not calculated. Within a subgroup, odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs are from a logistic regression model: treatment group. When the sample size requirements were not met (less than five responders in any treatment group), the <italic>P</italic>-values from the Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used instead of the OR and 95% CI.</p><p>Interpretation of subgroup interaction analyses that had a <italic>P</italic>-value &#x02a7d;0.10 began with an examination of the direction (same as or opposite to overall treatment effect) and then the magnitude of the treatment effect across the strata. Interactions are characterized as quantitative (treatment effect is consistent in direction, but not magnitude, in all strata) or qualitative (effect is beneficial in some, but not all, strata). More weight was given to interactions that were evident at both weeks 12 and 24 to minimize overinterpretation of any difference that could be due to chance.</p><p>Some subgroups included strata with small numbers of patients (such as evaluation by last bDMARD used and by prior specific bDMARD use). Although these subgroups did not have a sufficient sample for formal statistical comparisons, data within each subgroup were summarized to provide information for this refractory patient population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Full details of the randomized, double-blind RA-BEACON trial design have been reported previously [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Data are presented for the baricitinib 2 and 4 mg treatment groups compared with placebo, although the primary comparison is for the 4 mg dose compared with placebo.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Demographics and disease-related clinical characteristics were similar among treatment groups at baseline [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Patients were predominantly female (&#x0223c;82%) and Caucasian (83%), with a mean age of &#x0223c;56 years, RA duration of 14 years, CDAI of &#x0223c;41 and DAS28-CRP of &#x0223c;5.9 [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 82% of patients had concomitant MTX use [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>Patients had been previously treated with at least one TNF inhibitor for study entry and many had a history of treatment with multiple TNF inhibitors (59, 31 and 9% for one, two or three or more TNF inhibitors, respectively) [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Etanercept, adalimumab and infliximab were the most commonly used prior TNF inhibitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table S1</xref>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> online). Six patients (1%) had not received a prior TNF inhibitor (protocol deviation). Looking at all prior bDMARDs, a patient could have been treated with one or more TNF inhibitors and none, one or more than one non-TNF bDMARD. The percentages of patients treated with one, two or three or more licensed bDMARDs (TNF inhibitor or non-TNF inhibitor) of any kind were 42, 30 and 27%, respectively [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This means that although 59% of patients had received only one prior TNF inhibitor, a smaller percentage&#x02014;42%&#x02014;had received only one prior bDMARD. The difference of 17% indicates that these patients treated with only one prior TNF inhibitor were also treated with a prior non-TNF inhibitor. The percentage of patients who had reported prior use of one, two or three or more licensed non-TNF inhibitor bDMARDs was also notable: 24, 8 and 6%, respectively [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Abatacept, tocilizumab and rituximab were the most commonly used licensed non-TNF inhibitor bDMARDs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Table S1</xref>, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> online). In addition, nearly 10% of the patients had previously received a non-approved investigational drug, including fostamatinib, tabalumab, ocrelizumab, ofatumumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, olokizumab, canakinumab, IFN and sarilumab.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Primary study results</title><p>As previously described, the primary objective in the RA-BEACON study was met: statistically significantly more patients achieved ACR20 response at week 12 with baricitinib 4 mg compared with placebo (55% <italic>vs</italic> 27%; <italic>P</italic> &#x02a7d; 0.001) [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Significantly more patients also achieved ACR20 response with baricitinib 4 mg than placebo at week 24. The percentage of patients with a CDAI &#x02a7d;10 was statistically significantly higher for baricitinib 4 mg than placebo at weeks 12 and 24 [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Additionally, comparing baricitinib 2 mg to placebo, significantly more patients achieved an ACR20 at week 12 (49% <italic>vs</italic> 27%; <italic>P</italic> &#x02a7d; 0.001) and week 24 and significantly more patients achieved a CDAI &#x02a7d;10 at week 12 but not week 24 [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy by baseline characteristics</title><p>Clinical efficacy outcomes as measured by ACR20 and CDAI &#x02a7d;10 by patient baseline demographics and clinical characteristics at week 12 are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="kex489-F1">Figs 1 and 2</xref>, respectively. No significant interactions were consistently noted for age, weight, seropositivity or corticosteroid use for ACR20 or CDAI &#x02a7d;10 between baricitinib 4 mg and placebo or baricitinib 2 mg and placebo at weeks 12 or 24 (among the CDAI &#x02a7d;10 subgroups with sufficient sample size to produce interaction <italic>P</italic>-values) (week 24 data in supplementary Figs S1 and S2, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> online). A large majority of seropositive patients (83%) were positive for both RF and ACPA; analyses by all four possible individual combinations of RF and ACPA for ACR20 and CDAI &#x02a7d;10 did not change conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Fig. S3</xref>A&#x02013;D, available at <italic>Rheumatology</italic> online).

population with prior inadequate response or intolerance to one or more approved TNF inhibitors [<xref rid="kex489-B5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref>], but fewer also included prior use of non-TNF inhibitors [<xref rid="kex489-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. With increasing therapeutic options and strategies for the treatment of RA, we have seen that the majority of patients achieve at least some level of improvement in their disease activity. However, not all patients achieve or maintain adequate responses. The most troubling group remains those patients with active disease despite the use of TNF inhibitors or other biologic agents. Clinicians face the challenge of identifying whether one subgroup of patients is more or less likely to respond to the next therapeutic option prescribed.</p><p>The RA-BEACON trial was carried out in patients with active RA despite receiving conventional DMARD therapy and prior treatment with at least one TNF inhibitor and often with experience with several other bDMARDs. On a group level, baricitinib was able to demonstrate meaningful benefit in this difficult-to-treat RA population [<xref rid="kex489-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, to better understand the potential utility of baricitinib, population subgroup analyses were performed across a variety of patient demographic, clinical characteristic, regional origin and prior drug exposure domains. To minimize overinterpretation of a difference observed at any one time point, which could be due to chance, weight was given to variables with significance at both weeks 12 and 24.</p><p>The forest plots provide a visual representation of the likelihood of benefit across a range of subgroups treated daily with baricitinib 2 or 4 mg or placebo as demonstrated using both ACR20 and CDAI &#x02a7d;10 (low disease activity) as outcome measures of change in disease activity at weeks 12 and 24. In virtually all the subgroups assessed we saw the ORs favouring the use of baricitinib over placebo (with background cDMARDs), regardless of the number or type of bDMARD ever received. Published literature indicates that RA patients who are serologically positive for autoantibodies respond better to rituximab than those who are seronegative [<xref rid="kex489-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and that bDMARD-na&#x000ef;ve patients who are seropositive respond better to abatacept than those who are seronegative [<xref rid="kex489-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, comparatively few patients were seronegative in this study and, importantly, no consistently statistically significant treatment &#x000d7; subgroup interactions were observed in the seropositivity subgroup (RF<sup>+</sup> or ACPA<sup>+</sup>, RF<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and ACPA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). Interestingly, we saw ORs favouring the efficacy of baricitinib independent of the number of TNF inhibitors previously used or the number of non-TNF inhibitor bDMARDs previously used. This differs somewhat from other bDMARDs, since decreasing responses were observed with higher numbers of prior TNF inhibitor failures for abatacept [<xref rid="kex489-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], golimumab [<xref rid="kex489-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and rituximab [<xref rid="kex489-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Similarly, we see efficacy demonstrated independent of the last bDMARD that the patient used, which illustrates the broad nature of subgroups benefiting from therapy in this study and is particularly relevant given the unmet need for effective treatment in patients with inadequate disease control despite prior treatment with one or more biologic agents of differing types. It is also of interest that baricitinib appeared similarly efficacious in patients refractory to the IL-6 inhibitor tocilizumab as in those with prior use of other bDMARDs, a finding consistent with the concept that baricitinib exerts its efficacy through mechanisms that are broader than simply IL-6 pathway inhibition [<xref rid="kex489-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Efficacy is important, but adverse events are equally important in this study population with longstanding disease. Consistent with their increased exposure to prior immunosuppression, a small numerical increase in selected adverse event rates is observed in the patients with prior experience of three or more bDMARDs compared with patients with less exposure to multiple biologic agents. However, this was seen for placebo as well as for baricitinib, without a consistent increase in between-treatment group adverse event rate differences for the most extensively pretreated patients.</p><p>There are limitations to both this study and the types of analyses performed. The time frame for interpretation of safety data is limited to 24 weeks. The seronegative population is much smaller than the seropositive group, which resembles real-world patterns. The lack of radiographic endpoints limits the ability to draw conclusions regarding the capacity of baricitinib to slow the rate of structural joint damage across the subgroups included in this analysis. Perhaps most importantly, in this analysis we studied multiple subgroups and as such we have relatively small numbers on which to base any assumptions. We have not adjusted for multiple comparisons, but we did note that significant interaction <italic>P</italic>-values were observed infrequently and inconsistently, indicating minimal treatment heterogeneity across subgroups, including those defined by prior bDMARD use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this exploratory analysis of prior bDMARD use in the TNF inhibitor inadequate responder population of patients with RA, a beneficial treatment effect for baricitinib 2 or 4 mg compared with placebo was observed across subgroups irrespective of the number or nature of prior bDMARD use and, in general, a consistent treatment effect was observed across the strata with no evidence of any qualitative interactions at weeks 12 and 24. Because the population of RA patients who are TNF inhibitor inadequate responders is increasing, this finding may be clinically relevant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
