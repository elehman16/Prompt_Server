Low levels of physical activity (PA), together with sedentary behavior and poor diet are preventable causes of childhood obesity, besides possible genetic determination (<xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">EPIGCHRCA, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Youth overweight incidence is stabilizing in several countries, with approximately 10% of children and adolescents in overweight condition and 2&#x02013;3% in obesity condition (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Cole &#x00026; Lobstein, 2012</xref>). Several regions and countries have particularly high rates of pediatric obesity: more than 30% of children and adolescents in the Americas, while approximately 20% in Europe are overweight or obese. More than 30% of Italian children are overweight or obese (<xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Nardone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Spinelli et al., 2015</xref>). The survey conducted by the Italian Surveillance system <italic>OKkio alla Salute</italic> reported that levels of physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors in Italian children are high (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Spinelli et al., 2011</xref>). Specifically, the survey revealed that only 18% of children were engaged in structured PA or sport for more than 1 h a week, while about 35% of children spent their time in sedentary activities (television viewing and playing video-games) for more than 2 h a day (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Spinelli et al., 2011</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute">http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute</uri>). Moreover, the same survey highlighted the prevalence of inappropriate eating habits such as skipping breakfast, consuming abundant mid-morning snack and sugary drinks, consuming irregularly fruit and/or vegetables which can lead to weight gain among children (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Spinelli et al., 2011</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute">http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute</uri>). Specifically, 8% of children skipped breakfast; 31% of children ate unbalanced breakfast in terms of carbohydrates and proteins; 52% ate a mid-morning snack too abundant; moreover, 22% of parents declared that their children consumed irregularly daily fruits and/or vegetables. Finally, 44% of children habitually consumed sweet drinks (<xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Spinelli et al., 2011</xref>; <uri xlink:href="http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute">http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute</uri>). Interestingly, regular practice of PA and relative physical fitness level of children and adolescents have declined in the past few decades (<xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr">Tremblay et al., 2010</xref>). Low levels of PA in childhood, tracking into adulthood, combined with a non-correct diet (specially, fruit and vegetables low consumption) are associated with adverse health outcomes, including greater adiposity, increased cardio-metabolic risk factors, poorer bone mineralization, behavioral problems, low self-esteem, and also, poorer academic attainment (<xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Kipping et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, overweight and obesity prevention should require a combined intervention in order to control all modifiable factors which contribute to childhood and adolescence obesity. Educational interventions to obtain changes in life habits during childhood could be a key strategy, since it is more difficult to establish healthy habits during adulthood rather than during childhood (<xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Llargues et al., 2011</xref>). A recent study highlighted the importance of planning integrated and multi sectorial actions in school-based programmes to promote correct dietary and motor habits and for the control of body weight (<xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Sacchetti et al., 2015</xref>). In this perspective, school might be a crucial setting to obtain changes in obesity related behavior and to induce positive effects on eating habits, PA level and sedentary behaviors in children (<uri xlink:href="http://www.a-g-a.de">http://www.a-g-a.de</uri>; <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Kavey et al., 2003</xref>). The school environment seems to be the ideal setting for the promotion of PA, providing to a great number of children and adolescents opportunities to be physically active during physical education (PE) classes (<xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr">Wechsler et al., 2000</xref>; <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Verrotti et al., 2014</xref>). School also provides a valid possibility to train in an appropriate manner. Moreover, since children usually consume one/two meals per day in school (<xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Khambalia et al., 2012</xref>), it could promote appropriate consumption of food. Although studies focused on a single intervention strategy, involving PA or dietary component or reducing sedentary behaviors, showed positive effects on adiposity outcomes (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Amini et al., 2015</xref>), multidisciplinary interventions seem to be more successful in preventing, managing, and treating pediatric obesity (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Amini et al., 2015</xref>) and, importantly, its comorbidities (<xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Bryan et al., 2011</xref>), encouraging children to establish a long-lasting healthy habits. However, systematic reviews of combined school-based PA and nutritional interventions reported controversial results about the efficacy of comprehensive intervention including diet and exercise to manage and prevent children&#x02019;s obesity (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Brown &#x00026; Summerbell, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Kelishadi &#x00026; Azizi-Soleiman, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Amini et al., 2015</xref>). <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr">Plachta-Danielzik et al. (2011)</xref> showed that one-year health-promotion intervention had positive effects on BMI but not on lifestyle habits of primary school children. <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Fairclough et al. (2013)</xref> proposed the project &#x0201c;CHANGE!&#x0201d;, a school-based PA and healthy eating intervention of 20 weeks, which induced positive changes on body size of 10&#x02013;11 years-old children, and no effects on PA level, sedentary time and food intake. Contrarily, <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Rausch Herscovici, Kovalskys &#x00026; De Gregorio (2013)</xref> reported that a six-month obesity prevention program positively improved dietary intake and food consumption of 9&#x02013;11 years-old children but did not affect their anthropometric measures. Finally, <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Bacard&#x000ed;-Gascon, P&#x000e9;rez-Morales &#x00026; Jim&#x000e9;nez-Cruz (2012)</xref> reported favourable effects of a six-month intervention on lifestyle (food consumption and PA) and obesity of 2nd and 3rd grade elementary school children.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different PE programs, in combination with a nutritional intervention, on schoolchildren&#x02019;s healthy habits. We compared body composition, PA level, sedentary time and eating habits of primary school children before (pre) and after (post) three different five-month PE interventions in combination with the same nutritional intervention. These PE interventions were as follows: experimental intervention 1, conducted by a specialist PE teacher and structured according to the ministerial programs of PE for primary school (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy of 16 November 2012, 2013</xref>); experimental intervention 2, conducted by a specialist PE teacher and focused on highly varied activities aimed to contribute to a multilateral development of coordinative abilities (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Roth, 1982</xref>); and finally control intervention, conducted by the generalist teacher and structured according to the ministerial programs of PE for primary school (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy of 16 November 2012, 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that a multidisciplinary intervention could allow children to establish healthy habits, positively affecting their PA and dietary patterns. In this perspective, quality PE could act as the groundwork for a lifelong engagement in PA and sport. The learning experiences offered to children through PE lessons could help them to acquire psychomotor skills, cognitive understanding, social and emotional skills that they need to lead a physically active life. In spite of this overwhelming evidence, only 60% of Italian primary schools offer at least two hours per week of PE (<uri xlink:href="http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute">http://www.epicentro.iss.it/okkioallasalute</uri>). The PE lessons are conducted during curricular time by generalist teachers who do not have specific expertise in PE teaching. For this reason, we proposed professionally guided PE interventions to allow children to participate in well-structured PA programs conducted by specialist PE teachers. We also hypothesized that experimental intervention 2 could be more effective in inducing children&#x02019;s active lifestyle. The specialist PE teacher, articulating enjoyable, developmentally appropriate and varied experiences of PA, provided children a variety of opportunities that could meet their personal interests and individual differences (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2014</xref>). Therefore, the school practice of new and unusual activities that provide more choice of activities could encourage PA participation (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Lewis, 2014</xref>) in out-of-school settings, reducing sedentary behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study was designed as a cluster-randomized controlled intervention in all classes (from Grade 3 to Grade 5) of three primary schools in the rural area in the north of the city of Rome (Italy).

Sixteen classes with a total of 230 children between 8 and 11 years of age volunteered to participate in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of schools and allocation to intervention</title><p>The study focused on schools located in a rural area about 50 km north of the city of Rome (Italy). The area was included in a 5 km radius circle from a central reference point in order to obtain a sample with comparable environmental characteristics. This comprised a total of five schools. Eligibility criterion for the schools was the participation to the European School Fruit Scheme. This EU-wide voluntary scheme provided school children with fruit and vegetables, aiming to encourage good eating habits in young people (European Commission Agriculture and Rural Development: School Fruit Scheme; <uri xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sfs/">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sfs/</uri>). We further excluded those schools that were already engaged in PA programmes/interventions. The remaining three schools were invited and agreed to participate in the study. The schools were the experimental units that received the intervention and therefore were the units that were either randomized to intervention or control group (<xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr">Thomas, Nelson &#x00026; Silverman, 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The classroom demographics broke down to 88 Grade 3 children (8&#x02013;9 years of age), 72 Grade 4 children (9&#x02013;10 years of age) and 70 Grade 5 children (10&#x02013;11 years of age). After cluster randomization, 78 participants (33 girls and 45 boys) were in the experimental group 1 (ExpG1), 83 participants (38 girls and 45 boys) in the experimental group 2 (ExpG2), and the remaining 69 (29 girls and 40 boys) participants in the control group (CG).</p><p>Children were also classified into three groups: under fat (UF), normal fat (NF) or overweight/obese (OB) children based to their body fat mass percentage (FM%) according to the McCarthy&#x02019;s age-sex specific cut-offs (<xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">McCarthy et al., 2006</xref>). Specifically, children were subdivided into UF: under fat (FM% &#x0003c; 2nd centile); NF: normal fat (2nd centile &#x0003c; FM% &#x0003c; 85th centile); OB: overweight/obese (FM% &#x0003e; 85th centile). Therefore, 21 UF, 36 NF and 21 OB children were in the experimental 1 group, 23 UF, 40 NF and 20 OB children were in the experimental 2 group, 29 UF, 28 NF, 12 OB children were in the control group.</p><p>The University Ethical Committee approved this investigation (Rif 3502 Prot. 1883/15).

It is a self-administered, 7-day recall instrument. The questionnaire consists of nine questions about sports and games, physical activities at school, and those during leisure time, including the weekend.

A researcher was present in the classroom to answer to any children&#x02019;s questions.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthy nutrition intervention</title><p>The nutritional intervention lasted 5 months and was designed to increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, by improving nutritional knowledge. It was based on the nutritional program &#x0201c;European School Fruit Scheme&#x0201d; of the European Commission of Agriculture and Rural Development (<uri xlink:href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sfs/">http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/sfs/</uri>). The program was launched in the 2009/10 school year (<xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Watson, 2008</xref>). The intervention consisted of topics like fruit and vegetables characteristics, nutritional values, biodiversity, seasonality, and territoriality. The topics were taught monthly through methodologies that are linked to children&#x02019;s system of learning (short lectures/talks, games and sensory workshops). Topics, such as, health/nutrition (eat well to stay healthy), science (I know what I eat), affective and sensory (use and enjoy my senses), environmental (contact with nature and conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity), social (knowledge of territorial identity) were also covered. All topics were taught by the generalist teachers who had previously attended a training course by specialists (e.g., nutritionist, dietician) from the CRA&#x02014;NUT (Council for Research and Experimentation in Agriculture&#x02014;Research Center of the Foods and Nutrition) (<uri xlink:href="http://www.fruttanellescuole.gov.it/">http://www.fruttanellescuole.gov.it/</uri>). In addition, a properly trained staff provided one free piece of fresh fruit (or vegetable) to children each school week, as a snack at mid-morning or mid-afternoon break to increase their consumption of fruit and vegetables in order to establish healthy eating habits. Every child consumed fruits or vegetables at least 36 times during the program, and at least ten different kinds of fruit or vegetable. Finally, an information campaign targeted at parents was conducted by producing and distributing informative material and by creating a specific web site section (<uri xlink:href="http://www.fruttanellescuole.gov.it/contenuti/frutta-casa-0">http://www.fruttanellescuole.gov.it/contenuti/frutta-casa-0</uri>) to prolong the effect of encouraging consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Physical education intervention</title><p>The intervention period lasted 5 months. Experimental interventions differed in type and mode of physical activities in which children were engaged but they were equivalent in structure, overall duration and intensity, and consisted of two 1 h sessions per week. The exercise intensity of both programs was monitored using an OMNI scale (<xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Utter et al., 2002</xref>) to avoid possible differences in intensity between the two types interventions. <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Rice et al.

The specialist PE teacher proposed exercises without high coordinative demands with the main goal of developing children&#x02019;s physical characteristics (<xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Gallotta et al., 2015</xref>), (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app-1">Appendix</xref> for full protocol description).</p><p>The <italic>experimental intervention 2</italic> was focused on improving the coordination and dexterity of the participants. It provided complex movements involving multiple degrees of freedom and interactions between different body parts or with different objects (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Egan, Verheul &#x00026; Savelsbergh, 2007</xref>) to develop psychomotor competence and expertise in movement-based problem solving considering various tasks that involved decision-making behaviours. Thus, accurate timing, temporal estimations, temporal production, and spatial adjustments were essential parts of the experimental requirements (<xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">Busc&#x000e0; et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, it provided children the opportunity to experience and to learn various sports and unusual activities that are often gender biased. It was organized in four different didactic modules lasting 5 weeks each one. Each module focuses on specific coordination abilities found in sports games, rhythmic activities, gymnastics and/or fitness activities. These activities were previously published by our lab (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">Gallotta, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr">Gallotta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-20" ref-type="bibr">Gallotta et al., 2015</xref>). The capacities requested were: static and dynamic balance, combination, kinesthetic differentiation, spatial orientation, rhythm and reaction.</p><p>The <italic>sport-games module</italic> allowed children to recognize and manage the characteristics of traditional sports games and/or pre-sports (e.g., handball, mini-volleyball, mini-basketball). The educational proposals focused on specific aspects of games: rules, roles, spaces, times and strategies.</p><p>The rhythmic activities module (cursive) was planned to specifically develop rhythmic and time perception abilities. Exercises or movement sequences were proposed, with or without tools, using wide execution variability in relation to the perception of some concepts such as &#x0201c;before,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;after,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;contemporary,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;next,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;slow,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;fast&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;cadence.&#x0201d; Sounds and/or music tracks were used.</p><p>The <italic>gymnastics module</italic> was characterized by a general movement development. Children were able to become aware of their movement patterns. Therefore, activities were proposed to allow children to be able to manage and vary the movement patterns as a function of spatial and temporal parameters, in executive situations of growing complexity.</p><p>The <italic>fitness activities module</italic> was planned to develop children&#x02019;s strength, endurance, speed and flexibility.</p><p>The intensity of experimental intervention 2 gradually increased in terms of complexity and degree of difficulty (concerning movement time, precision, amplitude, size of the target). The intervention was based on the systematic variation of practice by making task demands progressively more difficult (see <xref ref-type="app" rid="app-1">Appendix</xref> for full protocol description).</p><p>The <italic>control group</italic> continued to follow the traditional PE school curriculum given by the generalist teacher using traditional PE programmes (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy of 16 November 2012, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All results were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD.

However, the lack of positive effects on children&#x02019;s adiposity status confirmed that primary school-based interventions could produce psycho-physical and physiological benefits (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Dobbins et al., 2013</xref>) but they might have limited effectiveness in the reduction of body weight, BMI and FM% (<xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr">Verrotti et al., 2014</xref>). Specific amounts of PA would be necessary to obtain beneficial changes for skeletal health, aerobic fitness, muscular strength and endurance, and also to reduce adiposity (<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Strong et al., 2005</xref>). Specifically, guidelines for school health PE programs to promote healthy behaviour among children recommended participation in 60 min or more of moderate-to-vigorous enjoyable, developmentally appropriate and varies PA (<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Strong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2009</xref>). Evidence suggested that school-based PE programs of moderately intense exercise 30&#x02013;60 min in duration, 3&#x02013;7 days per week, with a length of training at least three weeks led to a reduction in total body and visceral adiposity in overweight children and adolescents (<xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr">Strong et al., 2005</xref>). Although we respected in both experimental PE interventions the prescribed exercise intensity (MVPA), the overall duration of each lesson (60 min) and the length of training (five months), we did not fully comply these PA guidelines for reasons linked to the scheduling of school activities. Therefore, we supposed that a greater amount of PA in terms of weekly frequency would be necessary to achieve beneficial effects on children&#x02019;s body composition. In our study, children&#x02019;s anthropometric values increased after intervention. Growth and maturation processes that occurred during the five months of intervention induced a significant increase of height and also a parallel increase of body weight of children participating in the study. Moreover, the increase of weekly PA level after intervention could have induced a significant increase of lean body mass, and consequently the increase of body weight. Indeed, muscle loading during PA practice increased lean body mass. This increase was due to muscle contraction during physical exercise that acted as a source of mechanical loading and seemed to be beneficial to muscle mass (<xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr">Nogueira, Weeks &#x00026; Beck, 2014</xref>). <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr">Alberga et al. (2013)</xref> reported that resistance training increased leg lean mass and leg strength in obese prepubertal youth and positively affected overall PA and health although no changes in fat mass percent were found.</p><p>Our results reported that BMI <italic>z</italic>-score did not change after intervention. Even though BMI <italic>z</italic>-score is optimal for assessing adiposity on a single occasion, it is not necessarily the best scale for measuring change in adiposity, as the within-child variability over time depends on the child&#x02019;s level of adiposity (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Cole et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, our results emphasized the limitations of BMI <italic>z</italic>-score as a marker of adiposity among children, supporting the use of FM% to track adiposity changes. Nevertheless, we observed an increase of fat mass percentage in children.</p><p>According to previous studies (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">Aburto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr">Van Grieken et al., 2012</xref>), our results revealed that children reduced their sedentary activities and increased the time spent engaged in PA after the intervention period. However, obese children of all three groups appeared to be refractory to change their sedentary behaviour. Previous study showed that obese adolescents fail to conduct an active life because they find limited pleasure in such behaviour (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Lindelof, Nielsen &#x00026; Pedersen, 2013</xref>). Therefore, obese children and adolescents need to learn through everyday life a positive attitude toward PA that can lead them to become more active and less sedentary. School-based PE could be a vehicle to provide pleasant and enjoyable experiences for obese children, improving their attitude toward PA, and encouraging physically active behavior.</p><p>Finally, our school-based nutritional intervention seems to have induced positive modifications on children&#x02019;s eating habits. In fact, the consumption of energy-dense foods decreased after intervention, with a contemporary increase of fruit and vegetables consumption, revealing the efficacy of the proposed nutritional intervention to modify eating habits. It seemed that children substituted high energy food and sweet drinks with fruit and vegetables consumption. The presence at school of the European program <italic>&#x0201c;School Fruit Scheme&#x0201d;</italic> stimulated fruit consumption among children. However, our combined PE and nutritional interventions led to a qualitative changes in the eating habits of both experimental groups while no nutritional modifications were found in control group. Our experimental PE interventions contributed to healthy changes in eating habits since ministerial programs of PE for primary school provide experiences aimed to know the relationship between diet, physical exercise and health to assume healthy lifestyle habits (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy of 16 November 2012, 2013</xref>). Although our study showed positive effects of combined PE and nutritional interventions on weekly PA level, sedentary time and eating habits, no improvements of schoolchildren&#x02019;s body composition were observed. Contrarily to our expectations, no significant reduction was found for weight, BMI <italic>z</italic>-score, and FM% after intervention. The relationship and the compensatory mechanism underlying the interaction between PA and energy intake could affect energy balance (<xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Thivel, Saunders &#x00026; Chaput, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Thivel &#x00026; Chaput, 2014</xref>), with no positive consequent impacts on anthropometric variables. PA has the potential to modulate appetite control, inducing food consumption modifications (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Blundell et al., 2003</xref>). PA and eating patterns are closely associated, with a relative strong impact on energy intake leading to an increase in energy intake (<xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Thivel &#x00026; Chaput, 2014</xref>). Moreover, we investigated the weekly food consumption but we did not have indications regarding food portion sizes, which is a key element of energy intake (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Livingstone &#x00026; Pourshahidi, 2014</xref>). Therefore, children may probably have increased their food intake since PA might also have increased their hunger and also alter the hedonic response to food (<xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Blundell et al., 2003</xref>). A larger-than-appropriate portion size could have increased the fat mass gain in the children participating to the study. It was plausible to assume that the proposed nutritional intervention induced exclusively a positive qualitative changes of nutritional habits of children.</p><p>In conclusion, our experimental PE interventions combined with a school nutritional intervention pointed out a better healthful practices in both experimental groups, revealing the efficacy of a multidisciplinary and educational approach.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><p>The results of this study revealed the effectiveness of an integrated PE and nutritional intervention to improve PA and dietary practices. The strength of the present study included the study design and the large participation of children without drop-out. The intervention was designed to be feasible and not financially demanding for the school system.</p><p>However, our research had some limitations. The weekly frequency of PE interventions did not comply guidelines for school health PE programs for reasons linked to the school schedule. Therefore, we sustained the necessity of a congruous involvement of governmental institutions and schools to support children&#x02019;s healthy habits. Self-reported measures and the use of the OMNI scale for the perceived exertion, could have affected our results. Self-report is a promising methodology for children that is applicable for large studies, but, sometimes, subjects tend to alter the answers (<xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Shepard, 2003</xref>). Finally, we investigated the weekly food consumption but we did not have indications regarding food portion sizes, which is a key element of energy intake (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Livingstone &#x00026; Pourshahidi, 2014</xref>). Therefore, some changes in children&#x02019;s energy ingestion could have been occurred, partially explaining some of the discrepancies in the observed results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study revealed the effectiveness of a 5-month combined PE and nutritional intervention to improve schoolchildren&#x02019;s habits.

The basketballs were used in unconventional ways with varying game rules (e.g., application of foot-eye coordination techniques with basketballs). This lesson was geared toward the development of both motor control and perceptual-motor adaptation abilities. It focused on the development of psychomotor competences and expertise in movement-based problem solving through functional use of a common tool (e.g., basketball), and considering various tasks that involved decision-making motor tasks and manipulative ball handling skills (e.g., bouncing, throwing, and/or receiving a ball). The experimental 2 lesson combined physical load due to the practice of physical exercises and cognitive load required for movement-based problem solving and decision-making tasks with accurate timing, temporal estimations, temporal production, spatial and temporal adjustments, and spatial and temporal orientation, which are essential cognitive requirements to perform such types of activities. The experimental 2 lesson aimed to develop both motor control abilities and perceptual-motor adaptation abilities, by combining demands on gross-motor and manipulative control abilities and perceptual-motor adaptation abilities (particularly kinesthetic differentiation and response orientation).</p></sec></app></app-group><sec sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional Information and Declarations</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interests"><title>Competing Interests</title><fn id="conflict-1" fn-type="conflict"><p>Laura Guidetti is an Academic Editor for PeerJ.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contributions"><title>Author Contributions</title><fn id="contribution-1" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-1">Maria Chiara Gallotta</xref> conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, wrote the paper, reviewed drafts of the paper.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-2" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-2">Sara Iazzoni</xref> performed the experiments, wrote the paper.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-3" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-3">Gian Pietro Emerenziani</xref> performed the experiments.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-4" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-4">Marco Meucci</xref> contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools, language editing.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-5" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-5">Silvia Migliaccio</xref> contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-6" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-6">Laura Guidetti</xref> analyzed the data.</p></fn><fn id="contribution-7" fn-type="con"><p><xref ref-type="contrib" rid="author-7">Carlo Baldari</xref> prepared figures and/or tables, revised the paper.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Human Ethics</title><fn id="addinfo-1" fn-type="other"><p>The following information was supplied relating to ethical approvals (i.e., approving body and any reference numbers):</p><p>The University Ethical Committee approved this investigation (Rif 3502 Prot. 1883/15).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="other"><title>Data Availability</title><fn id="addinfo-2" fn-type="other"><p>The following information was supplied regarding data availability:</p><p>Raw data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1">Data S1</xref>.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><ref-list content-type="authoryear"><title>References</title><ref id="ref-1"><label>Aburto et al.
