Budesonide inhalation suspension (BIS) is used for the long-term management of bronchial asthma in children aged from 6&#x000a0;months to 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There have been a few reports on the use of BIS in patients with acute asthma attacks, but a consensus is yet to be reached on its role in the treatment of these patients. The recommended dose of BIS has previously been reported to be 0.8 to 2&#x000a0;mg per administration, which is higher than the maximum dose of 0.5&#x000a0;mg normally used in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If BIS can be generally administered at home for treatment of asthma attacks, the medical costs associated with hospitalization for bronchial asthma attacks would likely be reduced.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether BIS at a dose of 0.5&#x000a0;mg could be used for the treatment of moderate bronchial asthma attacks rather than steroid injection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Definition of bronchial asthma</title><p>In infantile asthma, diagnosis is based mainly on clinical data. Furthermore, some small children have recurrent episodes of acute wheezing during respiratory infections only at this age and do not actually have persistent asthma later in their life. In the Japanese Pediatric Guideline for the Treatment and Management of Bronchial Asthma 2008 (JPGL2008), for early intervention, a diagnosis of infantile asthma can be made if there are 3 or more episodes of marked expiratory wheezing, regardless of the presence of respiratory tract infection. These criteria may include wheezing caused by viral infection; therefore, we used this definition. Moderate bronchial asthma attacks were also defined by the JPGL2008 as the presence of apparent wheezing, retractive breathing, prolonged expiration orthopnea, or increased respiratory rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>All subjects of this study were patients aged 5&#x000a0;years and younger admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at Hospital between October 2008 and March 2010 because of moderate bronchial asthma attacks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients who required oxygen on admission and patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection were excluded. A rapid respiratory syncytial virus antigen detection kit was used for diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection in all patients in admission. Oxygen was administered if the percutaneous oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was 92% or lower. Patients admitted on weekends, national holidays, or at night were also excluded. We did not consider intravenous steroid treatment prior to admission as an exclusion criterion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcome of the study</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was the Modified Pulmonary Index Score (MPIS) during hospitalization, and the secondary outcome was cortisol level at discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Methods of treatment</title><p>After written consent had been obtained, the envelope method was used to randomly assign 20 patients to the methylprednisolone (mPSL) group and 20 to the BIS group. The mPSL group began the initial treatment with inhalation of a mixture of 0.01% procaterol hydrochloride (0.3&#x000a0;mL) and 1% disodium cromoglycate (2&#x000a0;mL) three times a day and intravenous administration of mPSL (1&#x000a0;mg/kg) three times a day. The BIS group began the initial treatment with inhalation of a mixture of 0.01% procaterol hydrochloride (0.3&#x000a0;mL) and BIS (0.5&#x000a0;mg, 2&#x000a0;ml) three times/day. Maintenance fluid infusions were given to all patients in both groups. Disodium cromoglycate is used as maintenance treatment for children with moderate asthma in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Procaterol hydrochloride is a bronchodilator that is widely used in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The JPGL2008 recommends a dose of 0.1 to 0.3&#x000a0;mL for infants and preschool children, and 0.2 to 0.4&#x000a0;mL for school-age children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In this study, 0.3&#x000a0;mL of procaterol hydrochloride was administered regardless of age. The frequency of using an inhaled bronchodilator, BIS or mPSL was increased or reduced as appropriate in accordance with symptoms such as wheezing and dyspnea independently. The jet inhalation device used was a Micro Mist Nebulizer&#x000ae; (Hudson RCI/Teleflex, Research Triangle Park, NC, United States). In principle, inhalation was performed by a nurse; if performed by a family member, it was monitored by a nurse to ensure that appropriate procedures were followed. Parameters such as pulse rate, SpO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory rate, wheezing, use of respiratory musculature, and retracted breathing were evaluated on a daily basis during hospitalization. The Modified Pulmonary Index Score (MPIS) was used to assess the severity of attacks that required hospitalization and the patient&#x02019;s respiratory status during hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Atopic bronchial asthma was defined as positive immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies for <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic> (&#x02265;0.35 UA/mL by the ImmunoCAP method, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Blood tests and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and cortisol level measurements were performed on admission and at discharge. Cortisol levels were measured in blood sampled before noon on the day of admission and 10&#x000a0;a.m. on the day of discharge. Cortisol levels at discharge were measured in blood sampled at least 2&#x000a0;days after final steroid administration. No blood samples were taken if a patient was discharged on a weekend or national holiday. We compared the duration of hospitalization (in days), the frequency of using an inhaled bronchodilator, and plasma cortisol levels at discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical method</title><p>The results are shown as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviations.

Patients in whom cortisol levels were below the reference value were retested as outpatients after 1&#x000a0;month, and they all had normal cortisol levels (8.0&#x02013;22.1&#x000a0;mg/dL).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that treatment with BIS is equivalent to or better than that with mPSL for moderate bronchial asthma attacks. In this study, patients treated with BIS required less frequent use of a bronchodilator, and the use of BIS did not cause suppression of adrenocortical function, which is often seen in steroid treatment.</p><p>The number of inhalations in the mPSL groups was higher than that in the BIS groups on days 3, 4, 5, and 6. We consider it unlikely that this was the result of milder wheezing episodes in the BIS group rather than an effect of the BIS itself. The MPIS of the BIS group was not lower than that of the mPSL group on day 1 and remained nearly constant from day 1 to day 7.</p><p>There have been a number of previous reports on the efficacy of BIS for acute exacerbations of bronchial asthma. Bacharier <italic>et al.</italic> reported that inhalation of 2&#x000a0;mg/day of BIS prevented aggravation of moderate-to-severe intermittent wheezing compared with a placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A review by Schramm <italic>et al.</italic> also concluded that inhaled budesonide might have equivalent efficacy to oral steroids for acute attacks of bronchial asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A meta-analysis by Xin-Ming <italic>et al.</italic> reported a similar rate of hospitalization in patients treated with inhaled budesonide and those treated with oral systemic corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has also been reported that there was no significant difference between continuous daily administration of budesonide and intermittent administration of budesonide (1&#x000a0;mg) twice daily for one week at the time of an attack in terms of suppressing asthma attacks in preschool children with recurrent wheezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In a study on moderate-to-severe attacks, Matthews <italic>et al.</italic> compared 46 patients aged from 5 to 16&#x000a0;years with severe asthma attacks, not serious enough to be life-threatening, who were treated with 2&#x000a0;mg/kg of prednisolone every 24&#x000a0;hours and those treated with 2&#x000a0;mg/kg of nebulized budesonide every 8&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There was a significantly greater improvement in forced expiratory volume per second in the nebulized-budesonide group 24&#x000a0;hours after admission. The authors stated that nebulized budesonide was at least as effective as oral steroids. Devidayal <italic>et al.</italic> studied 80 children aged from 2 to 12&#x000a0;years with moderate-to-severe attacks, and they compared patients who underwent three inhalations with 800&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of BIS and 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg of salbutamol at 30-minute intervals with those treated with 2&#x000a0;mg/kg of oral prednisolone and three inhalations with 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg of salbutamol at 30-minute intervals. They found that SpO<sub>2</sub>, number of breaths, pulmonary function, and dyspnea score improved significantly in the BIS group after 2&#x000a0;hours, and that those patients could be discharged earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Milani e<italic>t al.</italic> performed a double-blind study of three groups of children aged from 2 to 7&#x000a0;years with severe bronchial asthma attacks only, treated with 2&#x000a0;mg of BIS, 1&#x000a0;mg/kg of oral prednisolone, and placebo, and they found that although BIS and prednisolone resulted in an equivalent amelioration of symptoms, SpO<sub>2</sub> improved more rapidly with oral prednisolone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. They stated that inhalation treatment may be insufficient in cases of severe bronchial asthma attacks, and that oral steroids may be more effective as their absorption can be assured. Conversely, in moderate attacks in which adequate inhalation is feasible, BIS may be of equivalent therapeutic efficacy to oral steroids. This may support our finding that BIS was useful for moderate attacks. However, it may not be effective for severe attacks, and further study is required. In the present study, we used a lower dose of BIS (0.5&#x000a0;mg/treatment) than the doses of 0.8 to 2&#x000a0;mg reported in other studies. However, we observed no significant difference between the therapeutic effect of BIS and that of systemic administration of mPSL. As noted earlier, nurses ensured that caregivers were able to properly administer BIS. This meant that there was little variation in the inhalation procedure, which may have ensured the full therapeutic effect of BIS.</p><p>It is important to consider the effect of steroid administration on adrenocortical function. Shapiro <italic>et al.</italic> administered inhalation treatment with the doses of 0.25&#x000a0;mg, 0.5&#x000a0;mg, and 1.0&#x000a0;mg of budesonide twice a day for 12&#x000a0;weeks to 178 children aged from 4 to 8&#x000a0;years with inhaled steroid-dependent bronchial asthma, and they found no significant difference between the three experimental groups and the placebo group in terms of cortisol levels and adrenocorticotropic hormone challenge test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The maximum daily dose of BIS of 1.5&#x000a0;mg used in the present study was lower than the maximum dose of 2&#x000a0;mg used in the other study, and the duration of administration of less than 1&#x000a0;week in the present study was shorter than the 12&#x000a0;weeks in the other study. The dose of BIS used in the present study should therefore not have a major effect on adrenocortical function.</p><p>In the present study, although cortisol levels were not below the reference value in any of the patients in the BIS group, they were below the reference range in one-third of the patients in the mPSL group. Hedlin <italic>et al.</italic> compared cortisol levels in children aged from 1 to 3&#x000a0;years treated for 10&#x000a0;days with oral betamethasone or high-dose inhaled budesonide (800&#x02013;1600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/day). They found that cortisol levels decreased in patients who received betamethasone, but not in those treated with budesonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of moderate bronchial asthma attacks with BIS does not cause adrenocortical suppression, which is a common side effect in systemic administration of mPSL. Moreover, treatment of moderate bronchial asthma attacks with BIS is equally effective as standard systemic administration of intravenous steroids in the hospital. Because BIS can be administered at home if a nebulizer is available, it may allow home treatment of asthma without the common side effects of steroid therapy. Thus, this treatment may also help reduce the medical costs associated with hospitalization for bronchial asthma attacks. However, it may not be effective if appropriate inhalation procedures are not followed. Furthermore, whereas BIS appears to be effective for moderate attacks, evidence is lacking with respect to severe cases. In summary, BIS may be considered as a treatment option for acute attacks in moderate cases providing that appropriate inhalation procedures are observed.</p><p>Nonetheless, there are several limitations to this study. This was not a double-blind study and a double-blind study is required. Approximately half of the patients in both groups had already been treated with intravenous hydrocortisone sodium succinate prior to admission, but none of them had been treated more than once and the maximum dose was 7&#x000a0;mg/kg; therefore, the effect was limited because the patients were all administered hydrocortisone sodium succinate, which has a half-life of only 90&#x000a0;minutes. There were some limitations regarding the cortisol assessments, because this study ended 2&#x000a0;days after the last dose and the effect may have thus been underestimated. It should also be noted that the sample size was small and thus further study is needed. In addition, the results may not be generalized to children of any age and of those with severe asthma attacks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We compared systemic administration of mPSL and treatment with BIS in patients hospitalized for moderate bronchial asthma attacks and showed that the efficacy of BIS was equivalent to or better than that of mPSL. In addition, BIS enabled less frequent usage of inhaled bronchodilators and did not cause side effects such as adrenal suppression. Although future studies to confirm its efficacy for severe bronchial asthma attacks are required, it may be a valid therapeutic option for moderate bronchial asthma attacks as long as appropriate inhalation procedures are observed.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>After collecting data on all patients, the study was registered as a clinical trial (UMIN000012722).
