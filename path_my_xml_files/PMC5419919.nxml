SGAs can be used for either spontaneous breathing or positive pressure ventilation (PPV),<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> but the employment of PPV is gradually increasing because spontaneous breathing is frequently associated with significant hypercarbia, reduced functional residual capacity, and the increased work of breathing.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> However, high inspiratory pressure obtained with PPV can cause high gas leakage around the SGAs that may increase the risk of gastric insufflation in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> During PPV with SGAs, excessively increased PIP which exceeds the oropharyngeal leak pressure may lead to gastric insufflation or gas leakage through the mouth.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Although conventional volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) provides a constant tidal volume, it may also provide a higher peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) compared with pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) because PIP obtained with VCV varies depending on the patient's airway resistance, compliance, and inspiratory flow rate. PCV can provide approximately 10% to 16% less PIP than VCV while maintaining equal ventilation and may reduce the risk of gastric insufflation during anesthesia with laryngeal mask airway in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, gastric insufflation is still a concern in any modes of PPV with SGAs.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Moreover, SGA disposition or fold-over malposition may facilitate gastric insufflation.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>The pediatric i-gel (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK), one of the second generation SGAs, is a latex-free device with a noninflatable cuff and a channel for gastric tube (except size 1). The i-gel, including the cuff, is made of a gel-like thermoplastic elastomer, which provides a perilaryngeal seal with a slight pressure on the pharyngolaryngeal structure. A meta-analysis demonstrated that the i-gel provides higher oropharyngeal leak pressure than classic laryngeal mask airway or ProSeal, which is the most important determinant of the efficacy and safety of the SGA.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> The i-gel has high oropharyngeal leak pressure and a gastric channel to protect against gastric insufflation. However, high PIP during PPV with i-gel may result in gastric insufflation, especially if the gastric tube was not placed. In several studies, the incidence of gastric insufflation varied from 0% to 30% depending on the PIP and the presence of a gastric tube.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup></p><p>We hypothesized that PIP would be significantly lower in the PCV group compared with the VCV group during anesthesia with i-gel. The primary aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study was to compare PIP between ventilatory modes of VCV and PCV in children undergoing general anesthesia with the i-gel without a gastric tube. The secondary aims of this study were to evaluate the oropharyngeal leak pressure and the incidence of gastric insufflation.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized-controlled study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Yonsei University Health System (IRB number, 4-2014-0594) and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/">www.ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (ref. number: NCT02259569). Informed consent was obtained from the parents of all the children. This study was conducted between October 2014 and February 2015 in Severance Hospital in Seoul, Republic of Korea.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p>Thirty-four children, aged 6 to 84 months, ASA physical status I or II, undergoing elective urologic surgery requiring general anesthesia were enrolled. Children with congenital oropharyngeal or facial anomalies, current respiratory disease, or risk of aspiration (gastrointestinal stenosis or gastroesophageal reflux disease) were excluded.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Study protocol</title><p>The enrolled patients were randomly allocated into the PCV group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17) or the VCV group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17) using a computerized randomization table by an investigator not involved in patient care. No premedication was administered. The children were transferred to the operating room under light sedation with intravenous thiopental sodium. After routine monitors were applied, anesthesia was induced with 4 to 5&#x0200a;mg/kg of thiopental sodium, while the oxygen and sevoflurane 3.5% was administered with facemask ventilation. After the patients lost their eyelash reflex, rocuronium 0.3&#x0200a;mg/kg was administered for neuromuscular blockade, and the i-gel was inserted using a standard method according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Each i-gel was inserted by an anesthesiologist who has performed &#x0003e;100 i-gel insertion, and was not involved in this study.</p><p>The ease of insertion of the i-gel was assessed using a 4-graded scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no resistance, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;mild resistance, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;moderate resistance, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;inability to place the device). The number of insertion attempts was also recorded. After confirmation of successful i-gel insertion with a clinical test (square wave of capnogram, bilateral chest expansion, and reservoir bag movement), a polyethylene catheter was inserted through a side channel of the i-gel to remove possible gastric insufflation during facemask ventilation, and then the catheter was removed. The position of the i-gel was evaluated with fiberoptic bronchoscopy (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) through the device and the i-gel position was graded using a scale between 1 and 4 (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;larynx only seen, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;larynx and epiglottis seen, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;epiglottis impinging on grille, but larynx seen, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;epiglottis down-folded, and larynx not seen).<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> If the grade was &#x02265;3, the i-gel was repositioned to grade 1 or 2 and secured with a tape. Oropharyngeal leak pressure was measured in both groups.</p><p>For the VCV group, the tidal volume was set at 10&#x0200a;mL&#x0200a;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. For the PCV group, the inspiratory pressure was set to obtain the same tidal volume. The respiratory rate (RR) was set at 20/minutes with an inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2. The RR was adjusted to maintain the end tidal CO<sub>2</sub> between 35 to 40&#x0200a;mm Hg in both groups. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (2&#x02013;3%) in 50% oxygen.</p><p>Ultrasonography (US) was performed on the upper abdomen to ensure an empty gastric antrum by a highly experienced anesthesiologist using a LOGIQ<sup>e</sup> (GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI). For the standardization of the scanning level on the sagittal plane, the gastric antrum was identified with a 4-MHz convex transducer along the length of the abdominal aorta at the level of the superior mesenteric artery as described in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> A high-frequency linear probe was applied at the same point, and the image was acquired 5 times between the antral contractions for the accuracy of the outcome variables. Three measurements, excluding the smallest and largest values, were selected for mean values.</p><p>Before surgery, caudal block was performed in all children in the lateral decubitus position. After the children were placed in the supine position, fiberoptic bronchoscopy was repeated, and the i-gel was repositioned to grade 1/2, if the grade was &#x02265;3. At the end of the surgery, all the measurements were repeated (PIP, US, oropharyngeal leak pressure, and fiberoptic bronchoscopy).</p><p>Oropharyngeal leak pressure was measured by closing the adjustable pressure-limiting valve of the pediatric circle system to 30&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O at a fixed gas flow of 3&#x0200a;L/min and noting the steady-state airway pressure on the monitor.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>US examinations were performed after the initial fixation of the i-gel, and after the end of surgery.

The mean difference (pooled SD) in PIP was 2.6 (1.98) cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Considering a type-1 error (&#x003b1;) of 5% and a power (1-&#x003b2;) of 90%, 14 patients were required in each group for statistical significance.

In 7 cases with gastric insufflation detected on US, gastric insufflation was confirmed by the &#x0201c;gurgle&#x0201d; sound through a gastric tube inserted in the side channel of the i-gel in all cases showing comet-tail appearance on US. Actually, US had a higher sensitivity and specificity for the detection of gastric insufflation.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> And also, on the 2nd US examinations after the completion of surgery, GAA was significantly increased compared with the GAA of the 1st US in both groups. But we cannot be sure that the increased GAA definitely reflects the occurrence of gastric insufflation. Several researchers reported that enlarged GAA indicates gastric insufflation.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> However, as Schmitz et al. suggested,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> several anatomical and functional variations make it difficult to confirm gastric insufflation with simple measurement of GAA on US. Nevertheless, it should be considered that gastric insufflation may occur frequently in patients with i-gel during PPV if a gastric tube is not inserted.</p><p>The i-gel has a potential for preventing gastric insufflation with its higher oropharyngeal leak pressure and its specific design of the noninflatable cuff for laryngeal sealing and a side channel for gastric decompression.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, clinically undetected malpositioning of SGAs is a significant risk factor for gastric insufflation in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> In several studies investigating the fiberoptic bronchoscopy position of the i-gel, grade 3 (only visible epiglottis) or 4 (vocal cords were not visible) was found in 10% to 40% of subjects.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Although it is considered that the flattened stem of i-gel improves its stabilization and prohibits its malposition, a manipulation could be required often to maintain stability of this device.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> And also, i-gel can be displaced after postural change as in a caudal block. In our study, the i-gel position was changed to grade 3 in 8 of 34 children (23.5%) after caudal block. After the end of surgery, 8 of 34 cases (including some previously displaced cases) showed the grade 3 again. Gastric insufflation was detected on US in 3 of that 8 cases. In most studies, including our study,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> ventilation was acceptable in grade 3/4, but increased PIP following grade worsening may induce gastric insufflation and oropharyngeal leakage during PPV.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> If there is no room for the escape of air outside the oral cavity, leaked oropharyngeal gas can be forced into the stomach.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In our study, the median oropharyngeal leak pressure was not different between both groups (20&#x02013;23&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the VCV group and 20&#x02013;21&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in the PCV group) despite the PIP difference. The oropharyngeal leak pressure is consistent with previous studies reporting 21 to 26&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> In comparison, gastric insufflation was presented in 20.6% of patients in our study, which is higher than in a study by Kim et al (9%)<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> but lower than observed in another study by Kim et al (30%).<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> This discrepancy might be related to the detection period. In these previous studies using i-gel without a gastric tube,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> gastric insufflation was detected by auscultation at the time of leak pressure measurement. In most studies measuring oropharyngeal leak pressure of the SGAs in children, the adjustable pressure-limiting valve was set at 30 to 40&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O with a gas flow of 3&#x0200a;L/min.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Thus, transient high airway pressure and gas leakage are produced during a measurement. If there is any malpositioning of SGA, leaked gas will be forced into the stomach if there is no room for the escape of the leaked gas due to the taped stalk of the SGA.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Although we performed a second US examination just before the measurement of oropharyngeal leak pressure after the end of surgery, we cannot exclude the possibility of gastric insufflation occurrence during the 1st leak pressure measurements. Infancy is a vulnerable period for gastric insufflation during PPV because of the immature lower esophageal sphincter tone, the short length of the intraabdominal esophagus, and the blunt angle of His.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> As reported by Theiler et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> oropharyngeal leak pressure was higher in younger children weighing 5 to 9.9&#x0200a;kg than older children with i-gel. Thus, gastric insufflation also can occur more easily during leak pressure measurement as well as during PPV in infants.</p><p>PCV is considered a safer ventilation mode than VCV with SGA in children to reduce lower inspiratory pressure, ventilator leakage, and gastric insufflation. Maintaining PIP below 15&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O is recommended to prevent gastric insufflation during PCV in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> However, in a study by Sinha et al,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> gastric insufflation occurred in PCV with PIP below 13&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in infants, although they suggested that PCV should be the preferred mode compared to VCV. In our study, gastric insufflation was presented similarly in both the VCV and PCV groups despite the low PIP under 15&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O in both groups. Thus, the upper limit of PIP of 15&#x0200a;cm H<sub>2</sub>O may not prevent gastric insufflation in infants and small children whether the ventilator mode is PCV or VCV in small children.</p><p>In our study, 23.5% of children showed grade 3 fiberoptic bronchoscopic position of i-gel after the end of surgery despite the repositioning of the i-gel after caudal block. As we mentioned before, a risk of gastric insufflation might be increased in malposition of SGA during anesthesia. Therefore, careful monitoring is needed throughout the anesthesia.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, we enrolled cases using size 1.5 and 2 of i-gel, this result may not exactly apply to every size if i-gel for children. Second, because US examination was performed in the supine position, the collected air in the antrum might not be detected in some parts on portable US. And also, the gastric antral image may be affected by anatomical and functional variations by patients. Third, since the most of children enrolled to this study were male patients, the result of this study may not be extrapolated to female pediatric population.</p><p>In conclusion, although PCV provided lower PIP compared with VCV, the incidence of gastric insufflation was similar in the 2 groups during anesthesia using i-gel without a gastric tube. Although i-gel resulted in a high oropharyngeal gas leak pressure, gastric insufflation can occur frequently if the gastric tube is not placed through a side channel during anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was presented in part as an abstract at American Society of Anesthesiologists Annual Meeting 2015, San Diego, CA, USA, October 24&#x02013;28, 2015.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: GAA = gastric antral area, PCV = pressure-controlled ventilation, PIP = peak inspiratory pressure, PPV = positive pressure ventilation, RR = respiratory rate, SD = standard deviation, SGAs = supraglottic airways, SpO<sub>2</sub> = oxygen saturation, US = ultrasonography, VCV = volume-controlled ventilation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Efrat</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Kadari</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group>
