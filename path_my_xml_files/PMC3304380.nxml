The present study was designed to evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of <italic>Frankincense</italic> in the treatment of gingivitis, which is a periodontal tissue inflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods</title><p>This double blind randomized placebo controlled trial was carried out among high school female students with moderate plaque-induced gingivitis. Based on either administration of 0.1 gram of <italic>Frankincense</italic> extract or 0.2 gram of its powder or placebo and whether the patients undergone scaling and root planning (SRP) or not, they were randomly assigned to 6 groups. The primary efficacy outcome was changes in Gingival Index (Loe &#x00026; Sillness) and the secondary outcomes were alteration in plaque index (Sillness &#x00026; Loe), bleeding index (Cowell) and probing pocket depth (WHO probe). All indices were measured in the 0, 7th and 14th days of the study.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy five patients ranged of 15&#x02013;18 years old were enrolled. At the end of the study, the indices in all groups showed significant decreases in comparison to the first day (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.05), except for the bleeding index in the group without SRP and drug therapy (<italic>p</italic>=0.111). More precise analysis of data revealed that SRP in association with <italic>Frankincense</italic> application (either extract or powder) can lead to remarkable decrease in inflammatory indices in comparison to the groups without SRP and drug therapy (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In addition, no significant difference was observed between powder or extract therapy (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e;0.05) and between patients received either SRP or treatment alone (<italic>p</italic>=0.169).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Frankincense</italic>, a safe and low-cost herbal medicine, may be feasibly applied to improve inflammation based disease of gingival as an adjunct to the conventional mechanical therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dental plaque</kwd><kwd>Inflammation</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Herbal medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gingivitis in its most common form, plaque-induced gingivitis, results from interactions of immune system and existing biofilm. Inflammation as the major pathological manifestation of periodontal diseases is a part of the immune system response to overcome aggregated microorganisms in the plaque. The more severe the response and aggregation of inflammatory cells and mediators, the more the destruction of periodontal tissues. Basically, plaque removal and inflammation reduction are achieved by means of scaling and root planning (SRP) and anti-inflammatory medications, respectively. As daily use of non-opioid analgesics such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase inhibitors (e.g., Celecoxib) can result in complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding, hypertension, congestive heart and renal failures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>), special attention has been recently paid to selective lipooxygenase inhibitors. <italic>Frankincense</italic>, a resin-like extract of Bowsellia species from Burseracea family, possessing Boswellic acid (B.A) is a pentacyclic terpeniod that has been used in the Indian Ayurvedic traditional medicine (ayur: life, veda: knowledge) for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref>). It has been demonstrated that Acetyl Keto Boswellic Acid (AKBA), as the most active component of boswellia extract, is a selective non-oxidative inhibitor of 5-lipooxygenase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref>). This pathway is the key pathway of leukotriens production from arachidonic acid in the cellular inflammatory cascade. Besides, the role of boswellic acid and <italic>Frankincense</italic> extract has been assessed in inflammatory diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). Other herbal medication such as German Chamomile mouth wash has been reported to reduce dental plaque and gingival inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>). Absence of acute or chronic adverse effects of <italic>Frankincense</italic> in animals and humans has been guaranteed the low risk of daily use of this medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0006">6</xref>). Taking into consideration the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects, low-cost, availability of <italic>Frankincense</italic> and also relatively high frequency of gingivitis, this study was designed to assess the effect of <italic>Frankincense</italic> powder or extract in the treatment of gingivitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Study design and eligibility criteria</title><p>A randomized, double-blinded (patient, clinician, biostatician), placebo controlled; parallel assigned trial was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of <italic>Frankincense</italic> derivatives for treatment of plaque induced gingivitis among female high school students. The students with systemic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and gastrointestinal diseases and also those who had used antibiotics or any other periodontal affecting drugs during the previous month were excluded from the study. Besides students with severe malocclusion teeth crowding, prior periodontal surgery and scaling and root planning (SRP) during the last 6 months along with profound Ramjford teeth decay or filling were excluded from the study. The patient parents or guardians were asked to write informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Group assignment &#x00026; Medicaments preparation</title><p>Six groups were designed as follows: group 1 (only extract), group 2 (only powder), group 3 (no medicament, no SRP), group 4 (extract and SRP), group 5 (powder and SRP) and group 6 (only SRP). Extracts and powders were prepared from an Indian species, Boswellia Serrata.</p><p>The placebo (sugar free gum which does not contain any medicament) with the same shape and colour and amount prepared by the same pharmacist who was also responsible for preparation of drugs for entire study. Extract and powder were prepared from an Indian species, Boswellia Serrata. samples were purchased from registered local herbal medicines market. The physical and botanical characteristics of <italic>Frankincense</italic> were identified and authenticated by an expert specialist in herbal section of Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, Babol University of Medical Science, Babol, Iran and a voucher specimen (No: CS_00235) was deposited. Extraction was carried out on fine powder by maceration in 95% ethanol for 48hrs. After filtration, the filtrate was concentrated in rotary evaporator apparatus and then it was added into gum base to make 0.1% w/w preparation. Powder was prepared by the same process as for the extract and was available as gum containing 0.2% w/w. Gum base was obtained from commercially available sugar-free samples from the market.</p></sec><sec><title>Study protocol</title><p>After informed consent and final enrolment, the participants were subjected to receive either 0.1 g of the extract or 0.2 g powder (in the form of chewing gums) or placebo (pure chewing gums) with or without scaling. SRP was performed at the beginning of the study and participants were instructed to chew three times per day, a gum each time, for 14 days. All groups were also provided with Oral Hygiene instruction (OHI) and safety issues to report any allergy and sensitivity, itching and burning, severe bleeding, ulcer formation or any adverse effects possibly caused by the prescribed medicaments.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and secondary end points</title><p>All indices including Gingival Index (GI), Plaque Index (PI), Bleeding Index (BI) and Pocket Probe Depth (PPD) were recorded at the beginning of the study. The primary efficacy outcome was changes in GI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>) and the secondary outcomes were alteration in PI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref>), BI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref>) and PPD (WHO probe) and other side effects. All indices were measured in the 0, 7th and 14th days of the study by the same clinician with the above mentioned indices in a standard light.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Alteration of each index within each group and comparison of same index between groups were assessed by means of repeated measure Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and One-way ANOVA, respectively. In addition mean difference of each index (Mean Diff.) during the study and overall difference computing for all 4 indices (Total diff.) was designated to reveal the group in which higher level of differences (Improvement in inflammatory indices) was achieved. Finally a pooled group (i.e., A [(only drug therapy (combination of groups 1 and 2)], B [without SRP and drug therapy (group 3)], C [SRP and drug therapy (combination of groups 4 and 5)] and D [only SRP: (group 6)] designs were taken into account to investigate putative effect of medicament. Further, a two-tailed &#x003b1; at p value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. This study reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of Babol University of Medical Sciences and all investigations were undertaken according to Helsinki treaty.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S0009"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Patient recruitment accomplished among female high school students at Babol discrete, Mazandaran province, Iran during 2004&#x02013;2006.

Improvement of inflammation of periodontium by the use of extract or powder of <italic>Frankincense</italic> was remarkable. These findings are in accordance with results of previous investigations upon anti-inflammatory properties of <italic>Frankincense</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004">4</xref>). Relative superiority of extract to powder which was not significant may be explained by higher concentration of active components in the resin extract of <italic>Frankincense</italic> when compared to the powder preparation. In both assessment of 6 and combined 4 groups, the most improvement was found in groups with medicament. Nevertheless, this superiority in medicament treated groups was hampered in sole SRP groups, although, this difference was not statistically significant (p value &#x0003c;0.05). In addition, in groups which were subjected to medicament therapy or SRP, significant difference was observed in comparison to groups without either medicament or SRP. Also, other than the bleeding index in group which received neither medicament nor SRP (group 6), there were improvements of all indices in all groups, at the end of the study, compared to the first day of the study. It seems that excessive inflammatory reactions due to the mechanical SRP traumatic forces may proceed to obscure the remedial effect of pure chewing gums. It is probable that, by increasing the follow up period up to one month and more, useful effects of mechanical deletion of plaque may become more evident. It should be mentioned that low sample sizes of the studied groups may under- or overestimated the reported outcomes. A 30 percent lost-to-follow up rate in some groups is better to be considered as another limitation and reporting bias of the present work. Previously Jing et al highlighted that Boswellia may exert its effects in a dose and time dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>). Besides, one should consider that change in patterns may have gradual fashion continued 1&#x02013;3 months after phase I therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref>). Improvements in other indices (PI, GI, and PPD) in group 6 probably is related to effects of improved regional blood flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>) and mechanical ablation of plaque perceived by chewing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref>). Cochrane authentic review in 2008 has challenged the anti inflammatory capability of B.A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>). Failure of AKBA to suppress inflammation in chronic setting may be due to overproduction of peroxidase during oxidative stresses in oxi-redox interactions. In the work described, chewing gum which contained neither powder nor extract of <italic>Frankincense</italic> was used as placebo in the control group. Considering previous reports on the local effect of the gum on gingivitis with probable augmentation of the microcirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>), concern may be raised upon biased conclusion about independent anti inflammatory effect of <italic>Frankincense</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="S0017"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Result of this investigation displayed anti inflammatory properties of <italic>Frankincense</italic> extract on chronic plaque induced gingivitis. This herbal medicament may be feasibly and safely applied to improve gingival health. This naturaceutical exhibits satisfactory remedial properties, which is comparable and even superior to scaling and root planning (SRP) as the current standard of dental plaque removal which are costly and discomfort during the procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gabriel</surname><given-names>SE</given-names></name><name><surname>Jaakkimainen</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Bombardier Risk of serious gastrointestinal complications related to use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
