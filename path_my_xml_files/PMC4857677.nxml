Many national and international governmental and non-governmental health agencies are running programs to reduce the incidence of these diseases. We can provide an insight to the reproductive and sexual health needs of adolescents by assessing their knowledge, attitude, and practice about these diseases.</p><p>The stage of life during which individuals reach sexual maturity is known as adolescence. It is the period of transition from childhood to adulthood. Young adolescents constitute an equally large amount of those infected with STDs. &#x0201c;Teenagers not aware about STDs&#x0201d;, says about 10&#x02013;15 teenagers seek treatment for STDs every month &#x02013; TOI, Bangalore.</p><p>Over the period 1985&#x02013;1996, a general decrease of gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia infections was noted in developed countries, both in the general population and among adolescents. From the mid-1990s however, increases in the diagnoses of STDs, in particular syphilis, gonorrhea, and chlamydia have been reported in several European countries, especially among teenagers 16&#x02013;19 years old.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The declining age of first sexual intercourse has been preferred as one possible explanation for the increase in numbers of STDs. According to data from different European countries, the average age of first sexual intercourse has decreased over the last three decades, with increasing proportions of adolescents reporting sexual activity before the age of 16 years.</p><p>The reluctance of adolescents to use condoms is another possible explanation for the increase in STDs. Some surveys of adolescents have reported that condoms were found to be difficult to use by the sexually inexperienced, detract from sensual pleasure and also embarrassing to suggest. Furthermore, many adolescents do not perceive themselves to be at risk of contracting an STD.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>A study was conducted by Samkange-Zeeb <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to determine the awareness and knowledge of school-going adolescents in Europe of STDs, not only concerning HIV/AIDS, but also other STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, human papillomavirus, and herpes simplex virus. Where possible we will identify differences in awareness and knowledge by key demographic variables such as age and gender, and how awareness has changed over time.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim</title><p>To compare the awareness of STDs among general population with below and above high school qualification.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A simple randomized, cross-sectional study of 6 months duration was conducted on the awareness of STDs on out-patients and in-patients of Saveetha Medical College and Hospital.
