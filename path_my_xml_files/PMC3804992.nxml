video games played on the Xbox Kinect on the muscle strength, muscle tone, and activities
of daily living of post-stroke patients. [Subjects] Fourteen stroke patients were
recruited. They were randomly allocated into two groups; the experimental group (n=7) and
the control group (n=7). [Methods] The experimental group performed training using video
games played on the Xbox Kinect together with conventional occupational therapy for 6
weeks (1 hour/day, 3 days/week), and the control group received conventional occupational
therapy only for 6 weeks (30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week). Before and after the intervention, the
participants were measured for muscle strength, muscle tone, and performance of activities
of daily living. [Results] There were significant differences pre- and post-test in muscle
strength of the upper extremities, except the wrist, and performance of activities of
daily living in the experimental group. There were no significant differences between the
two groups at post-test. [Conclusion] The training using video games played on the Xbox
Kinect had a positive effect on the motor function and performance of activities of daily
living. This study showed that training using video games played on the Xbox Kinect may be
an effective intervention for the rehabilitation of stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Video game</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Motor function</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The use of technology in rehabilitation has increased rapidly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.

recreation rather than rehabilitation of patients. Nevertheless, it is an advanced
technology that can be used to encourage functional recovery of individuals with permanent
disabilities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent studies,
virtual reality training using video games has been shown to improve the motor function of
the upper extremity of patients with stroke<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. A few studies has also demonstrated that
patients showed high levels of motivation when playing in the video games, and that video
games can be satisfying for patients in rehabilitation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Xbox Kinect is a
device for playing video games that recognizes user&#x02019;s movement using infrared camera
sensors. Users can see their posture and movement in the virtual reality environment without
a controller, confirmed in real time. Few studies have investigated the effect of video
games played on devices such as the Xbox Kinect in the rehabilitation of post-stroke
patients. This study investigated the effects of training using video games played on the
Xbox Kinect on muscle strength, muscle tone of the upper extremities, and performance of
activities of daily living of chronic stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Subject characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Etiology (I/H)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side (R/L)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease duration (month)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.71 (9.14)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3/4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.29 (1.38)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.43 (5.80)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6/1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.29 (3.40)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are frequency or mean (SD).

of the subjects who participated in this study. The participants were randomly allocated to
two groups; the experimental group (n=7) and the control group (n=7). The experimental group
performed training using video games played on the Xbox Kinect together with conventional
occupational therapy for 6 weeks (1 hour/day, 3 days/week), and the control group received
conventional occupational therapy only for 6 weeks (30&#x02005;min/day, 3 days/week). Before and
after the intervention, the participants were measured for muscle strength, muscle tone, and
performance of activities of daily living.</p><p>The muscle strength was measured using the Manual Muscle Test (MMT). The test-retest
reliability coefficients for the MMT range from 0.63 to 0.98<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle tone was evaluated with the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS).
Kendall&#x02019;s tau correlation between grades in the MAS is reported as 0.847<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The performance of activities of daily
living was measured using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). The inter-rater
reliability coefficients for the FIM range from 0.83 to 0.96<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Xbox Kinect (Xbox 360, Microsoft, US) was used for training. Xbox Kinect has an
infrared camera sensor that recognizes user movements without a controller. For the
training, the screen and beam projector were set in a room that was not influenced by
external factors. The infrared camera was located in the front of the screen, and the
subjects were asked to either sit or stand. The programs used for training, the Kinect
sports (Boxing and Bowling) and Kinect adventure (Rally Ball, 20,000 Leaks, and Space Pop),
were chosen by the researcher. Two games of each program were selected by the participants
according to their interest. Two games were played for 15&#x02005;min each, for a total of 30&#x02005;min.
The conventional occupational therapy focused on upper extremity function and activities of
daily living. That was performed for 30&#x02005;min.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for statistical analysis. The
Wilcoxon Signed Rank test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare the differences
within and between groups. Null hypotheses of no difference were rejected if p values were
less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison within and between groups</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Measures</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Experimental group</td><td align="center" valign="top" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pretest</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Posttest</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pretest</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Posttest</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Muscle strength</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoulder flexion</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.14 (1.95)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.57 (2.70)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.85 (2.34)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.57 (2.64)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoulder extension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.85 (2.04)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.57 (2.37)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.86 (2.34)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.29 (2.75)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elbow flexion</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.86 (2.27)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.29 (2.81)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.43 (1.90)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.57 (3.15)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elbow Extension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.43 (2.23)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.71 (2.93)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.00 (2.31)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.14 (3.24)*</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wrist flexion</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.43 (2.51)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.86 (3.53)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.00 (2.31)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.57 (3.21)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wrist extension</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.14 (2.49)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.29 (3.25)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.57 (2.44)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.29 (3.35)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Muscle tone</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Shoulder</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.71 (0.95)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.14 (0.38)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.29 (0.49)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.29 (0.49)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Elbow</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.14 (1.21)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.43 (0.79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.57 (0.98)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.14 (0.38)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Wrist</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.71 (0.76)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.29 (0.49)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.14 (0.38)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.14 (0.38)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FIM</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.71 (11.48)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.42 (15.00)*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.43 (9.85)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.24&#x000b1;11.93*</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are mean (SD).

the Xbox Kinect on the muscle strength, muscle tone, and performance of activities of daily
living of patients with chronic stroke. In the experimental group, the muscle strength of
the upper extremities, except the wrist, and performance of activities of daily living
significantly improved after intervention compared to the baseline. In the control group,
there were significant improvements in the elbow extensor strength and performance of
activities of daily living only. However, no significant differences were found between the
groups at post-test.</p><p>Muscle weakness and loss of muscle tone are the primary impairments that occur in stroke
patients, creating functional limitations on activities using the upper extremities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, for functional recovery of the
upper extremities, impairments such as muscle weakness and loss of muscle tone should be
addressed. The Xbox Kinect is a video game playing device that may be suitable as an
intervention for functional recovery. The subjects of this study, who played games on the
Xbox Kinect, were required to perform voluntary movements, and it was anticipated that these
would improve muscle strength. The results of this study are similar to those of previous
studies. Song et al. reported that shoulder muscle strength of stroke patients increased
significantly as a result of virtual reality training using video games played on the
Wii<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and that performance of
activities of daily living activities improved significantly in the experimental group. This
may have resulted from an increase of muscle strength. Yavuzer et al. reported that training
using video games played on a Playstation improved functions related to daily living of
stroke patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, but they observed no
significant differences in variables between the experimental and control groups. We think
this is a limitation of video games that are not created for rehabilitation. There were no
significant differences between and within groups in muscle tone. Marie et al. reported that
training using video games played on a Wii decreased the muscle tone of stroke patients, but
not significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Yong Joo
et al. demonstrated that training using computer-based games was effective at decreasing the
spasticity of post-stroke patients, but not significantly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. They suggested that intervention for rehabilitation of stroke
patients should be task oriented<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
provide visuoauditory feedback<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
Xbox Kinect is a video game device that matches these requirements, and consequently, it may
provide significant benefits for muscle strength training of the upper extremity and
performance of activities of daily living. Individuals can play the video games using the
Xbox Kinect, repetitively and purposefully, and the user can receive feedback immediately,
because users can see their posture and movements in the virtual environment in real time.
The Xbox Kinect may be suitable as an intervention for the rehabilitation of stroke
patients. This study had some limitations. There was a small number of subjects who
participated in the study, and we did not investigate their balance or gait ability factors
that can influence function. Thus, in future studies, further investigation is required to
strengthen the evidence of the training effects derived from using the Xbox Kinect.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Kyungnam University Foundation Grant, 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kalra</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Stroke rehabilitation 2009: old chestnuts and new
