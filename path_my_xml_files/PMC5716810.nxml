Large-scale efforts such as Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T. (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cancercontrolplanet.cancer.gov/">https://cancercontrolplanet.cancer.gov/</ext-link>) and the <italic>Community Guide</italic> placed various evidence-based interventions in the hands of cancer control practitioners (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Even with knowledge of effective interventions, often 15 to 20 years elapse before research findings are incorporated into practice (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Knowledge of effective approaches for dissemination of evidence-based interventions is growing (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Practitioners in state health departments can assess a public health problem, develop an appropriate program or policy to address the problem, and ensure that programs and policies are effectively delivered and implemented (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The process of evidence-based decision making (EBDM) involves multiple elements, including making decisions that are based on the best available scientific or rigorous evaluation evidence, applying program planning and quality improvement frameworks, engaging the community in assessment and decision making, adapting and implementing evidence-based interventions for specific populations or settings, and conducting sound evaluation (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). To select and implement evidence-based interventions in diverse populations and settings, advanced knowledge and skill is needed in key processes (eg, adaptation of interventions, evaluation) (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Previous research with state health agencies showed that although levels of awareness of EBDM is high, implementation of evidence-based interventions varies widely and is limited in many states (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Similarly, another study found that although cancer control practitioners showed a strong preference for programs with proven effectiveness, fewer than half of respondents in that study (48%) had ever used resources on evidence-based interventions (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A national survey of state practitioners in chronic disease control found that only 20% used evidence-based interventions often in their work (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Nonetheless, staff members in state public health agencies recognize the need for capacity building to support implementation of effective practices (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Putting evidence to use in public health settings requires sufficient capacity &#x02014; the availability of resources, structures, and workforce to deliver the preventive dose of an evidence-based intervention (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Capacity is a determinant of performance; that is, greater capacity is linked with greater effect on public health (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Success in implementing EBDM in public health settings is achieved by building the skills of individuals (eg, their ability to carry out a program evaluation) and organizations (eg, achieving a climate and culture that supports innovation and evidence-based approaches) (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These 2 skills are interrelated in that individuals shape organizations and organizations support the development of individuals (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>To date, little research has addressed the most effective approaches for building capacity for EBDM in state public health agencies seeking to address chronic disease prevention and control. The objective of this study was to test whether providing training and other support to state health departments increased the use of EBDM processes to prevent chronic diseases at both the individual level (eg, reducing skill gaps) and the organization level (eg, increasing participatory decision making).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a 2-arm, group-randomized trial consisting of an intervention arm and a control arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). We assessed 50 states and the District of Columbia for eligibility. We excluded 3 states with the lowest burden of cancer and overall chronic disease, 3 states with the lowest capacity for EBDM, 2 states with the highest capacity for EBDM, 7 states that had already received extensive EBDM training, and 3 states that had no logical pair match. State exclusion criteria are detailed elsewhere (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The remaining 33 states were organized into tertiles according to state population size. Two pairs from each state population tertile were selected in 3 rounds of staggered selection and enrollment. Each round consisted of 1 state randomly selected from each of 2 tertiles and matched with the nearest population-sized state within the tertile. Six state health department&#x02019;s chronic disease prevention units (hereinafter called states) were selected via a simple randomization method by our data analyst (R.R.J.) and then pair-matched with the state closest in population size, to decrease between-state variability, for a total of 6 pairs (6 intervention states and 6 control states, 1 each per pair). We then invited the states to participate by contacting the chronic disease director in each state health department. Two states declined to participate, and we selected the state with the nearest population in the tertile to replace that state to retain our total of 12. After pairing and obtaining consent from the lead chronic disease official, whom we designated as the state-level representative, the 2 states in each pair were randomly assigned to the intervention arm or control arm. There was no blinding. Enrollment of state pairs, data collection, and intervention trainings were staggered for scheduling feasibility. Enrollment of states took place from September 2013 through May 2014. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01978054) (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The study was approved by the Washington University in St. Louis Institutional Review Board (no. 201111105).</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study of evidence-based decision making conducted in 12 states, 2014&#x02013;2016 (CONSORT diagram).</p></caption><long-desc>This flowchart shows that from 50 states and the District of Columbia, 33 states were eligible to be randomized into the intervention or control arm. After pairing, 12 states were randomized. Participants were surveyed at baseline in 6 intervention states and 6 control states (n = 580). Post-intervention surveys were conducted at 18 to 24 months after initial multiday training.</long-desc><graphic xlink:href="PCD-14-E121s01"/></fig><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>
<bold>Intervention states.</bold> The intervention began with a 3.5-day training in EBDM conducted onsite at each of the 6 intervention states between March 2014 and March 2015. Training details are described elsewhere (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The lead official responsible for chronic disease control in each state assisted the team in recruiting training participants from among their staffs and sometimes included staff members from state or local partnering organizations. A total of 222 staff members attended a multiday EBDM course in 1 of the 6 intervention states. All intervention state participants were asked to complete an online baseline survey before the multiday training. Each intervention state received a report on its baseline survey results for planning purposes and selected supplemental capacity-building activities, typically brief trainings or management strategies intended to build an organizational culture of EBDM, improve staff access to research evidence, share information, and build evaluation capacity (Appendix Table 1). Follow-up conference calls with intervention states provided technical assistance and supplemental activity planning and updates.</p><p>
<bold>Control states</bold>
<italic>.</italic> Control states identified participants for data collection and received a list of EBDM resources, web links, and state-specific baseline and post-intervention findings. They received no training, and all control state participants were asked to complete an online baseline survey before their paired state&#x02019;s multiday training.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Study participants were 2 groups of chronic disease control practitioners at the state and local level, an intervention group and a control group. These were people who directed and implemented population-based intervention programs in government agencies or in community-based coalitions. Participants were directly involved in delivering programs, setting priorities, or allocating resources for programs related to chronic disease risk factors or screening. Examples were the director of a comprehensive chronic disease program for the state or a leader in a state or regional chronic disease control coalition. </p><p>The intervention arm comprised 2 groups: a primary group and a secondary group. The primary group in each intervention state was made up of staff members who attended the EBDM course; most worked in state health departments and a few were from state or local partnering organizations. The secondary group in each intervention state, none of whom attended the EBDM course, was made up of chronic disease staff members and partnering staff members from each state health department, local health departments, universities, and coalitions (collaborators). Collaborators were surveyed because they were expected to apply EBDM in their organizations for control of chronic diseases as funded or guided by the state. Inclusion of collaborators also helped the study team meet sample size requirements. All participants were aged 20 years or older and able to take an online survey in English. Across the entire sample, most participants worked either in chronic disease risk reduction or chronic disease screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures, data collection, and statistical analysis</title><p>Measures in the 65-item online Qualtrics Version January 2014&#x02013;November 2016 (Qualtrics) survey were informed by a literature review (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) and earlier research by the study team (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Measures, described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), were tested with cognitive response methods and test&#x02013;retest reliability (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Survey questions assessed individual-level skills (eg, adapting interventions, action planning, communicating to policy audiences) and organizational-level capacities (eg, access to evidence, program evaluation, perceived supervisory expectations) (Appendix Table 2). Survey participants were asked to rate on a 11-point Likert scale the perceived importance and perceived availability of 10 EBDM skills.</p><p>Online self-report surveys were administered, by state, at 2 points at staggered times: 1) a baseline survey conducted from January 2014 through December 2014 and 2) a post-intervention survey conducted from October 2015 through November 2016, 18 to 24 months after the state pair&#x02019;s EBDM training. The study team followed up each returned post-survey email invitation to determine whether the participant had left the agency or just had a new email address and recorded reasons for declining among those who declined the post-survey by telephone or email. </p><p>The unit of analysis was individual staff members, with individuals from all 12 clusters (states) who completed both surveys included in analyses. We calculated baseline intra-cluster correlations for the dependent variables using standard methods to assess need for mixed modeling, but we elected to conduct mixed modeling as a conservative approach regardless of result. One-stage mixed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models were fitted by using PROC MIXED (SAS Inc) with state as a random effect to account for clustering by state (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The between&#x02013;within method was used to calculate denominator degrees of freedom for the fixed effect instead of the SAS default containment method, because it is more appropriate for unbalanced study designs. SAS version 9.4 was used for descriptive analyses and mixed ANCOVA modeling, and SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp) was used to clean and recode data and create calculated variables. Covariates were included in final ANCOVA models when the unadjusted effect size was attenuated by 10% or more on the basis of addition of a particular covariate to the model (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Sex was included in all adjusted models as required in studies funded by the National Institutes of Health. All tests of significance were 2-sided, including the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests and independent samples <italic>t</italic> tests used to compare baseline participant characteristics and scores. The sample size calculation of the study is described elsewhere (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>The primary individual-level outcomes were gaps in EBDM skills among public health practitioners and their use of research evidence for job tasks. The primary organization-level outcomes were access to research evidence and the presence of a staff with EBDM skills, supervisory expectations for EBDM use, evaluation, and work unit participatory decision making as assessed through individuals&#x02019; perceptions. The main analyses compared data on the primary intervention arm participants with data on control participants; we also compared data on secondary intervention arm participants and control participants. </p><p>We calculated gaps in the 10 EBDM skill scores by subtracting the score in perceived availability from the score in perceived importance for each individual for each skill. Higher gap scores indicate larger gaps. A summary score for gaps in skills was calculated for each individual by summing the values for gaps in scores for the 10 EBDM skills. A summary frequency of use of research evidence for job tasks was the calculated mean of the 6 job task responses.</p><p>We used items from a 7-point Likert scale (1 = &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; and 7 = &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;) to conduct exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal rotation to create individual scores for 5 factors: 1) access to research evidence and resources (4 items), 2) evaluation capacity (3 items); 3) supervisory expectations (3 items), 4) participatory decision making (3 items), and 5) agency leadership support (3 items) as in a previous national survey with state health department public health practitioners (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). By definition, the factor scores had a mean of zero and were normally distributed. One or more organization behavior items were left blank by 34 of the 567 survey participants (6.0%); these participants were excluded from factor score creation and mixed ANCOVA modeling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, 1,237 of the 1,508 invited public health practitioners completed the online survey (82.0% response, 83.6% for the 6 intervention states, 80.2% for controls). At follow-up, 909 (73.5%) of baseline participants completed the post-intervention survey, with a median of 73 participants per state (mean, 75.8; standard deviation [SD], 10.6). Loss to survey follow-up was primarily due to staff turnover. Of the 222 people assigned to the primary intervention arm who attended the EBDM training, 148 (66.7%) completed both baseline and post-intervention surveys (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>); of the 439 secondary intervention arm participants, 342 (77.9%) completed both surveys, and of the 580 control participants, 419 (72.2%) completed both surveys. Overall, most baseline survey participants were women (80.6%), and 64.3% had at least a master&#x02019;s degree in any field. At baseline, primary intervention participants differed significantly from control participants in several characteristics: for example, the percentage working in state health departments, age, and the percentage holding a master&#x02019;s degree or doctorate in public health. The number of primary intervention arm participants varied by state from 18 to 32, and the number of control participants varied by state from 65 to 72. </p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Characteristics of Participants at Baseline Among Primary Intervention Participants and Controls in 12 States, Study of Evidence-Based Decision Making, 2014&#x02013;2015<xref rid="T1FN1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref>

We sought to reduce the gap between the generation of evidence and its application in practice settings, which can be viewed as &#x0201c;leakage in the dissemination pipeline&#x0201d; from discovery to application (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). In large part, this leakage relates to lack of individual and organizational capacity to practice EBDM (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Our 12-state study showed improvements in individual-level capacity in several skill areas, although for the content area with the largest baseline gap (economic evaluation), we saw no improvement. Although deficits in EBDM competencies among state-level practitioners appear to be narrowing over time (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), interventions like ours probably can narrow the gap more rapidly. The skill areas of interest were derived from a systematic process (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and are essential for making use of many online tools and toolkits for chronic disease control (eg, the <italic>Community Guide</italic>, Cancer Control P.L.A.N.E.T.).</p><p>In a systematic review of dissemination studies of cancer prevention in community settings (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), the role of organizational factors in the uptake of evidence-based interventions was scarcely examined. We sought to increase the variety of organization-level variables. Our interventions did not result in significant improvements in measures of organizational capacity. The exception was for the 4-item factor on access to evidence and skilled staff. Organizational change is difficult and requires long-term commitment. It is possible that the interventions in our study were not intensive enough to result in measureable organizational change in some variables. Several studies have shown a high rate of turnover in state public health agencies (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). This ever-changing workforce may make it difficult to develop and maintain an organizational climate and culture supportive of EBDM.</p><p>Limitations of this study should be noted. It was difficult to gather objective data on practitioner or agency performance. Although data were well-tested psychometrically, we relied on self-reported (perceived) data on individual-level and organization-level outcomes. We assessed no direct chronic disease outcomes (eg, does greater use of research by practitioners lead to better chronic disease outcomes?), yet a substantial body of literature shows that the variables we measured on EBDM lead to better performance (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Performance over time was probably improving in our control group given that many programs funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now require grantees to implement EBDM. Although it is established that individuals influence organizations and the reverse (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), our finding that only 1 of 4 organization-level outcomes was affected by our intervention suggests that more intensive interventions and longer time periods may be needed to change an organization&#x02019;s climate and culture. Given that our intervention group included only 6 states, our findings may not be generalizable to all states.</p><p>This study should be considered first-generation research and can be viewed in the context of the growing literature on dissemination and implementation research (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Several topics deserve future consideration among practitioners and researchers. First, more tailored, active approaches are warranted. It is unclear whether our study approach was intensive enough to sustain positive changes. In addition, larger effects for subgroups (eg, master&#x02019;s degree&#x02013;trained individuals) suggest approaches may need to be adapted for various staff categories. The skill sets for health department staff members may differ from those needed among partners outside of a public health agency. Second, there is a need for better measures of EBDM. One of the greatest needs among chronic disease control practitioners is how to better assess organizational capacity (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Most existing measures focus on ultimate outcomes, such as change in health status. Most existing measures of capacity have not been tested adequately for reliability and predictive validity (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Third, capacity building needs to occur in the context of staff turnover. The rate of turnover among participants in our study was substantial, suggesting that frequent exposure to EBDM processes may be needed as new staff members are hired and trained. Fourth, the lack of change in some skill areas (eg, economic evaluation) may call for more intensive skill building or seeking out partners (eg, university staff) to help with more complex content areas. Fifth, more attention is needed on driving organizational change. Changing organizational culture and climate to an environment supportive of EBDM takes time and concerted effort (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). The intervention activities in our study may not have been intensive enough to foster measureable change in organizations, especially considering the heterogeneity in organizations.</p><p>To control chronic disease at a population level, EBDM requires a complex set of individual skills and organizational capacity. Our findings suggest several dissemination interventions that should be considered by practitioners as they seek to apply EBDM in their agencies to ultimately benefit the populations they serve.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (grant no.
