</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par4">Droxidopa (<sc>l</sc>-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine) is a synthetic catecholamine prodrug that is converted to norepinephrine by dopa decarboxylase (DDC), the same enzyme that is responsible for the conversion of levodopa to dopamine (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Droxidopa is also metabolized by catechol-<italic>O</italic>-methyltransferase (COMT) to 3-methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine; this is the major degradation product identified in tissue, serum, and urine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Norepinephrine is the key neurotransmitter responsible for mediating autonomic cardiovascular responses to orthostatic change [i.e., increases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate]. These hemodynamic responses to orthostatic stress are required to avoid end-organ hypoperfusion, particularly that of the central nervous system, by countering the gravitationally induced shift in blood volume to the lower extremities, including the splanchnic capacitance vessels, caused by standing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Metabolism of droxidopa</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40268_2018_226_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par5">Inadequate physiologic compensation during a positional change (i.e., supine or sitting to standing) may result in orthostatic hypotension (OH), which is defined as a sustained BP reduction (&#x02265;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;mmHg systolic or &#x02265;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mmHg diastolic) within 3&#x000a0;min of standing or head-up tilt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease, multiple system atrophy (MSA), or pure autonomic failure may frequently develop neurogenic OH (nOH) because of impaired norepinephrine release associated with autonomic failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Droxidopa has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness, lightheadedness, or the &#x0201c;feeling that you are about to black out&#x0201d; in adult patients with symptomatic nOH caused by primary autonomic failure in Parkinson disease, MSA, or pure autonomic failure; dopamine &#x003b2;-hydroxylase deficiency; or nondiabetic autonomic neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The efficacy and safety of droxidopa have been shown in three randomized controlled trials of patients with nOH associated with these underlying conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Previously, pharmacokinetic studies have reported droxidopa and norepinephrine levels achieved after administration of a single dose of droxidopa in patients with symptomatic nOH resulting from autonomic failure conditions (MSA or pure autonomic failure) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The current study assesses (1) the pharmacokinetic profile of droxidopa after single-dose administration, with and without food; and (2) changes in the pharmacokinetic profile of droxidopa and its metabolites (norepinephrine and 3-methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine) associated with multiple daily dosing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par8">The study protocol was approved by the PRACS Institute Institutional Review Board (Fargo, ND), and the study was conducted in accordance with the International Council for Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before the initiation of study procedures.

Therefore, administration of droxidopa with a high-fat, high-calorie meal may result in a decreased hemodynamic response. Minimal changes in the dose-to-dose plasma concentration of droxidopa were observed with TID administration. Because these findings suggest that there is a food effect on the absorption of droxidopa, it is recommended that patients always take droxidopa in the same manner, either with or without food for consistency of effects. In the phase 3 clinical trials of droxidopa, food intake was not controlled.</p><p id="Par26">The pharmacokinetic parameters identified in this study of healthy subjects are generally consistent with findings from earlier pharmacokinetic studies of droxidopa performed in nOH populations. The droxidopa <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;e</sub> values found in this study (2.5&#x02013;2.7&#x000a0;h in single or TID dosing regimens) are similar to values reported in a single-dose (400-mg) study in patients with nOH associated with pure autonomic failure or MSA (2.3&#x02013;2.7&#x000a0;h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The droxidopa <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> values reported in this study are consistent with values previously reported. In two previous studies, a <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of approximately 1900&#x000a0;ng/mL and <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> of approximately 3&#x000a0;h have been reported after single-dose administration of droxidopa (400&#x000a0;mg); in one study, droxidopa was administered 1&#x000a0;h after a standard breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; in the other study, the timing of administration of droxidopa with regard to meals was not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">To the best of our knowledge, no previous published studies have reported on the systemic pharmacokinetic disposition of the droxidopa major metabolite, 3-methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine, in human subjects. In the current study, 3-methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine levels steadily increased after administration of the three doses of droxidopa. Although the clinical significance of this accumulation of 3-methoxylated dihydroxyphenylserine remains unknown, toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have not identified pharmacologic activity associated with this metabolite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In the current study, the healthy elderly subjects had baseline venous plasma norepinephrine levels [mean (SD), 577 (220) pg/mL] within the normal physiologic range (reference range 70&#x02013;1700&#x000a0;pg/mL depending on postural position) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and mean norepinephrine levels remained within the normal physiologic range (i.e., &#x0003c;&#x000a0;900&#x000a0;pg/mL) during droxidopa administration every 4&#x000a0;h. Although there was no nOH comparative group in this study, patients with nOH associated with MSA and Parkinson disease have physiologic venous plasma norepinephrine levels similar to those of healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Further, the healthy elderly subjects who received 300&#x000a0;mg of droxidopa every 4&#x000a0;h had maximal venous plasma norepinephrine concentrations (in the semi-recumbent position) of 802&#x02013;895&#x000a0;pg/mL. These values are consistent with reported maximal venous plasma norepinephrine values between 1184 and 1250&#x000a0;pg/mL after a single 400-mg dose of droxidopa in patients with nOH (due to pure autonomic failure or MSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the current study, the <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> of norepinephrine was approximately 1.75&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h after each dose of droxidopa, despite some differences in the administration of each dose with respect to timing of meals (i.e., the first dose was administered after an overnight fast, and the second and third doses were each administered 2&#x000a0;h after a meal). This <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> range for norepinephrine is similar to the 3-h <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> reported after droxidopa administration in MSA patients with nOH (unknown timing of food ingestion with droxidopa dosing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Taken together, the single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic findings from this study are likely applicable to the nOH population and support the dosage and administration recommendations for droxidopa in the management of nOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Titration of droxidopa to symptomatic response is suggested because patients with nOH resulting from a variety of underlying autonomic failure conditions may require different maintenance doses of droxidopa based on endogenous norepinephrine levels (associated with type of neurodegeneration). A starting droxidopa dosage of 100&#x000a0;mg TID is suggested, which may be increased to the maximally recommended dosage of 600&#x000a0;mg TID. The findings of the current study suggest that a 300-mg TID dosing regimen does not lead to droxidopa accumulation and is associated with minimal fluctuations in norepinephrine levels.</p><p id="Par31">Although this study was not designed to correlate plasma droxidopa or norepinephrine levels with hemodynamic changes, BP has been shown to rise in parallel with an increase in venous plasma norepinephrine level, with the peak BP increase preceding the peak increase in norepinephrine level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Pharmacodynamically, an elevation in norepinephrine levels at night may blunt physiologic nocturnal BP dipping via mitigation of peripheral vasodilatation/increased systemic resistance and result in supine hypertension. Given that patients with nOH have circadian BP abnormalities, either as blunted nocturnal dipping or reversal of the normal circadian rhythm with higher BP values at night compared with the day, the potential effect of increased plasma norepinephrine levels must be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">However, plasma norepinephrine levels alone do not predict the occurrence of supine hypertension. The mechanism for supine hypertension in nOH is unclear, but appears complex and multifactorial. Various associated factors include increased vascular resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], elevated plasma angiotensin II levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and inappropriate mineralocorticoid receptor activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a study of patients with longstanding supine hypertension and OH, supine resting venous plasma norepinephrine levels were in the normal range, and systemic vascular resistance (not norepinephrine levels) was associated with supine hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In an investigation using 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, patients with nOH treated with droxidopa [mean dosage (SD) 444 (129)&#x000a0;mg TID] experienced a nonstatistically significant increase in nocturnal mean systolic BP [7.8 (4.8)&#x000a0;mmHg; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.122] compared with baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

To maximize clinical benefit (i.e., induction of pressor effects when a patient is expected to be upright and active) and minimize risk of nocturnal supine hypertension, it is recommended that the first dose of droxidopa be taken in the morning (upon awaking) and the second dose taken midday, with the final dose taken in the late afternoon (at least 3&#x000a0;h before bedtime to avoid peak vasoconstrictor effects in parallel with <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub> of norepinephrine).</p><p id="Par34">Limitations associated with the current study include that it was conducted in healthy elderly subjects and not in patients with nOH. Although the mean age of the subject population was typical of patients with nOH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], other factors that may affect the pharmacokinetic findings, such as comorbid conditions or polypharmacy, were not evaluated in this study [e.g., effect of concomitant use of DDC inhibitors (e.g., carbidopa) or COMT inhibitors (e.g., entacapone)]. Because of the role of DDC and COMT in the metabolism of droxidopa (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), administration of DDC or COMT inhibitors with droxidopa could alter pharmacokinetics and resultant pharmacodynamic and clinical effects. Studies have shown blunted BP responses and reduced norepinephrine levels when droxidopa is coadministered with carbidopa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, those studies involved coadministration with a single carbidopa dose (200&#x000a0;mg) much greater than that used in standard-of-care clinical practice. No significant differences in the pharmacokinetic profile of droxidopa or norepinephrine were observed when droxidopa was coadministered with single-dose entacapone (200&#x000a0;mg) compared with droxidopa alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Integrated clinical trial data suggest that patients using a DDC inhibitor have significant improvements in orthostatic dizziness/lightheadedness symptoms (the cardinal symptom of nOH), although the magnitude of the response was less when compared with non-DDC inhibitor users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Thus, concomitant use of droxidopa with a DDC inhibitor may require dose adjustments. During the randomized treatment period, supine hypertension rates were similar in patients with and without concomitant DDC inhibitor use.</p><p id="Par35">A further limitation of this study is that a gender subgroup analysis was not conducted for the pharmacokinetics of droxidopa. Significant sex differences in pharmacokinetics are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], including for AUC of levodopa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Consideration of sex differences between patients, particularly body weight differences, is thus advisable when prescribing droxidopa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par36">In summary, a high-fat, high-calorie meal slowed absorption of a single 300-mg dose of droxidopa, resulting in increased <italic>t</italic><sub>max</sub>, decreased <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC, but similar <italic>t</italic><sub>&#x000bd;e</sub>.
