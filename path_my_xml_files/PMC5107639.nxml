Six cattle farms with history of clinical parasitism and avermectin use were included. On the day of treatment (Day 0), 20 naturally infected calves per farm (total n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;120) were stratified by initial faecal egg counts (FEC) and randomly allocated to a treatment group dosed with 0.2&#x000a0;mg IVM kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> body weight s.c. (IVM; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) or an untreated control group (CTL; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10). Individual FEC were obtained at Day 0 and Day 14 post-treatment and pooled faeces by group were cultured to isolate L3 for detection of <italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic> and <italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic> by qPCR. Treatment efficacies were analysed using the recommended WAAVP method and two open-source statistical procedures based on Bayesian modelling: &#x02018;eggCounts&#x02019; and &#x02018;Bayescount&#x02019;. A simulation study evaluated the performance of the different procedures to correctly identify FEC reduction percentages of simulated bovine FEC data representing the observed real data. In the FECRT, reduced IVM efficacy was detected in three farms by all procedures using data from treated animals only, and in one farm according to the procedures including data from treated and untreated cattle. Post-treatment, <italic>O.&#x000a0;ostertagi</italic> and <italic>C.&#x000a0;oncophora</italic> L3 were detected by qPCR in faeces of treated animals from one and three herds with declared reduced IVM efficacy, respectively. Based on the simulation study, all methods showed a reduced performance when FEC aggregation increased post-treatment and suggested that a treatment group of 10 animals is insufficient for the FECRT in cattle. This is the first report of reduced anthelmintic efficacy in Danish cattle and warrants the implementation of larger surveys. Advantages and caveats regarding the use of Bayesian modelling and the relevance of including untreated cattle in the FECRT are discussed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical" id="abs0015"><title>Graphical abstract</title><p><fig id="undfig1" position="anchor"><alt-text id="alttext0010">Image 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="fx1"/></fig></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0020"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Reduced IVM efficacy in three out of six Danish cattle farms declared by FECRT.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p><italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic> was identified by qPCR in three herds with reduced IVM efficacy.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p><italic>Ostertagia ostertagi</italic> was detected in one farm with reduced IVM efficacy.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Increased FEC aggregation post-treatment affects estimation of drug efficacy.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Further validation of design and analysis of FECRT in cattle are urgently needed.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gastrointestinal nematodes</kwd><kwd>Cattle</kwd><kwd>Ivermectin</kwd><kwd>Faecal egg count reduction test</kwd><kwd>Real-time PCR</kwd><kwd>Bayesian modelling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Grazing cattle are continuously exposed to infection with gastrointestinal nematodes (GIN) that can severely impair the health and productivity of pasture-based livestock systems (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Corwin, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Shaw et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Charlier et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In practice, the control of GIN in cattle largely relies on the routine use of anthelmintic drugs, mainly from the macrocyclic lactone (ML) family (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Vercruysse and Rew, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, worm populations resistant to MLs have been selected, and anthelmintic resistance (AR) is now becoming a serious threat to the control of bovine nematodes in several countries (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland and Leathwick, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Gasbarre, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland and Bullen, 2015</xref>). Coinciding with the development of AR, concerns regarding the prophylactic use of veterinary drugs and chemical residues in both food and environment have led to stricter regulations on the use of anthelmintics in some nations (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Thamsborg et&#x000a0;al., 1999</xref>). In 1999, Denmark became the first country to introduce prescription-only use of anthelmintics in livestock, requiring a mandatory veterinary diagnosis before treatment in both organic and conventional farms (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2013</xref>). Since 2000, there has been an additional requirement for all prescriptions in production animals to be registered in &#x02018;VetStat&#x02019; &#x02013; the Danish system for surveillance of the veterinary use of drugs (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Stege et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). Preliminary analyses in VetStat indicate that MLs accounted for &#x0223c;85% of all anthelmintics prescribed for Danish cattle between 2010 and 2012, with ivermectin (alone or in combination) representing 72% of all ML prescribed (Pe&#x000f1;a-Espinoza et&#x000a0;al., unpublished data). However, and despite the significance of ivermectin for current parasite control strategies in cattle, its field efficacy against GIN has not been investigated in Denmark.</p><p>In the absence of quantitative molecular techniques for the detection of ML-resistance, and the high cost of the controlled efficacy test (the current gold standard method for verification of anthelmintic activity; <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Wood et&#x000a0;al., 1995</xref>), the only readily available technique for investigating field drug efficacy is the faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). This technique estimates the efficacy of an anthelmintic to reduce the faecal egg counts (FEC) of infected animals based on measurements pre- and post-treatment, or between treated and untreated individuals. The major advantages of the FECRT are that all drugs can be tested regardless of active compounds or formulation and that it relies on FEC detection methods readily available in most diagnostic laboratories. The current recommendations to conduct and analyse FECRT in cattle derive from guidelines by the World Association for Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology (WAAVP), which were originally developed for detection of AR in sheep nematodes (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). However, potential limitations have been highlighted concerning the use of FECRT with bovine nematodes, mainly due to the lower faecal egg excretion of cattle, compared to sheep, and the highly aggregated distribution of FEC in cattle groups (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coles, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Demeler et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">El-Abdellati et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland and Leathwick, 2011</xref>). These factors may limit the correct analysis of FECRT data and inference of drug efficacy in cattle using the WAAVP guidelines. More recently, Bayesian modelling using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods have been advocated as robust statistical analyses to cope with low and aggregated FEC data (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Torgerson et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). These MCMC-based procedures, available as open-source R packages or web-interface software, are being increasingly used to infer drug efficacy and to monitor AR in horse nematodes (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and cattle helminths (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Neves et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">O'Shaughnessy et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Novobilsk&#x000fd; and H&#x000f6;glund, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ramos et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). However, the performance of these MCMC procedures with the low mean FEC and parasite aggregation levels commonly found in cattle has not yet been evaluated. In addition, sensitive and species-specific tests to detect which GIN species survive treatment are critical for the surveillance of AR and are urgently required for cattle (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Coles, 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Sutherland and Leathwick, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The objectives of the present study were: 1) to assess the efficacy of ivermectin (IVM) against GIN in naturally infected Danish cattle by FECRT, and 2) to evaluate the performance of different statistical approaches for estimating drug efficacy using simulated bovine FEC data of similar characteristics to those observed in Danish cattle. In addition, we investigated the prescription patterns of anthelmintics in the study farms in order to examine a possible relationship between previous use of avermectins and IVM efficacy in the FECRT.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Selection of farms</title><p>Cattle farms (&#x0223c;50) with a history of clinical parasitism were contacted through local veterinarians across Denmark during spring 2013 and 2014. The farmers were offered free FEC analyses and evaluation of anthelmintic efficacy by FECRT. Farms were selected based on the following criteria: herd size &#x02265;20 first-season grazing (FSG) calves with &#x02265;4 weeks of grazing (before the initial screening) and not treated with anthelmintics within 8 weeks prior to sampling. In addition, the availability of a cattle crush or barn was required for the handling of animals. A total of 19 farms (8 in 2013 and 11 in 2014) that fulfilled these criteria accepted the invitation. Individual faecal samples were collected from 20 FSG calves in each farm between mid-June and early September of 2013 and 2014 for analysis of FEC (initial screening). Due to a low number of farms with mean FEC &#x0003e;150 strongyle eggs per g (epg) of faeces (as recommended by <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>), farms with a mean FEC&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;75&#x000a0;epg were selected for the FECRT. Of the six farms finally included in the study, one herd was a conventional beef farm (farm #1), three were organic dairy farms (#2, #4 and #6), one was an organic beef farm (#5) and one was a conventional dairy farm (#3). In Denmark, organic cattle farms should by law provide access to pasture from 15 April until 1 November (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Anonymous, 2016</xref>), while conventional farms do not have to comply with this rule. The cattle breeds in the investigated farms were Danish Holstein crossbreeds (#1 and #5), Danish Holstein (#2, #3, and #6) and Danish Jersey (#4). All the selected farms were located in the Jutland Peninsula and the FECRT was conducted within one to four weeks after the initial screening.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT)</title><p>The FECRT was performed to test the efficacy of IVM based on WAAVP recommendations (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). Pre- and post-treatment faecal samples from treated and untreated animals were included, and a total of 120 FSG calves were enrolled in the FECRT studies. On the day of treatment (Day 0), 20 FSG animals from each farm were stratified by FEC (based on the initial screening) and randomly allocated to a treatment group (IVM; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) or an untreated control group (CTL; n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10) of similar (initial) mean FEC. Due to a limited number of animals available in farms #4 and #6&#x000a0;at the start of the FECRT, the CTL groups at these properties consisted of nine calves. Oral formulations of IVM are not registered for use in cattle in Denmark, thus injectable IVM was used. At Day 0, individual body weights (BW) were estimated in the IVM group using a girth tape for cattle (Rondo combi<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Kruuse, Denmark), and the calves in the treatment group were injected with the recommended dose of IVM (0.2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW s.c., Ivomec<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 10&#x000a0;mg/mL, Merial Norden A/S). A comparison of BW estimations between girth tape and electronic scale in a group of 30 FSG calves (BW range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;84&#x02013;172&#x000a0;kg) was performed prior to the study and demonstrated a very high correlation between the methods (Pearson's correlation&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.98). Faecal samples were collected rectally from all animals on Day 0 and 14 days post-treatment (Day 14). Immediately after collection, the faecal samples were vacuum packed (Freshield Touch, CSE Co, Gyeonggi-do, Korea) to create anaerobic conditions and transported to the laboratory in a cooling box. On all farms, animals in the IVM and CTL groups grazed together on the same pastures until Day 14, when all control calves were treated with the recommended dose of injectable IVM as described above.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Parasitological analyses</title><p>Upon arrival at the laboratory, faecal samples were refrigerated at 5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis.

In Denmark, every veterinary drug prescribed for production animals is dispensed to farmers by official pharmacies or by veterinary practitioners. The dispensing pharmacy or veterinarian must register in VetStat the total amount of a specific drug sold to the farmer, the farm identity, the animal species and the age group which received the prescribed treatment. In VetStat, cattle are divided into three age groups: 1) calves &#x0003c;12 months old (heifer and bull calves); 2) young cattle&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;12 months old (heifers until first calving and steers until slaughter) and 3) adult cattle (cows after first calving). For the study of anthelmintic use, data retrieved included the name and active compound of the prescribed anthelmintic, the formulation and total amount (in total mL or g) of the drug prescribed, and the targeted cattle age group. However, the exact number of treatments actually performed in each prescription is not recorded in VetStat. We therefore estimated the number of treatments for each prescription in the &#x02018;targeted&#x02019; group (i.e. calves, young cattle or adult cattle) within each farm using the total amount of a prescribed drug (exact data from VetStat), the recommended dose of a given anthelmintic (considering its formulation) and a defined BW for each cattle age group. The defined BW for each age group was estimated based on data from the Danish Cattle Association (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Danmap, 2012</xref>) and considering common anthelmintic treatment practices in each group as: 200&#x000a0;kg BW for calves, 450&#x000a0;kg BW for young cattle and 620&#x000a0;kg BW for adult cattle. Due to this defined BWs and the likely variation in the actual amount of active compound used for different animals following each prescription, the calculated number of treatments is only a proxy of the real number of animals treated. In addition, it was assumed that anthelmintics delivered to farmers were used within a month, which may not always have been the case; however, this potential bias is presumably consistent across the different drugs and age groups. The number of animals per age group in each farm at the prescription date was retrieved from the Central Husbandry Register (Ministry of Environment and Food of Denmark, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://chr.fvst.dk" id="intref0020">http://chr.fvst.dk</ext-link>, accessed on 15 March 2016).

The analyses were performed via the freely available web interface of the procedure (available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://shiny.math.uzh.ch/user/furrer/shinyas/shiny-eggCounts/" id="intref0025">http://shiny.math.uzh.ch/user/furrer/shinyas/shiny-eggCounts/</ext-link>; visited on 01 September 2016). This software is also available as an R package (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Wang et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). The eggCounts procedure uses MCMC to fit a model using a gamma-Poisson distribution for pre- and post-treatment FEC data, thus accounting for aggregation in FEC data and the Poisson errors of the egg counting process, to generate the FECR% with 95% CI (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Torgerson et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The procedure uses a single prior for the over-dispersion parameter (aggregation). Two model options are available using the eggCounts web interface: <italic>i)</italic> the unpaired model, which models pre- and post-treatment data as independent gamma-Poisson distributions, with a scaled mean and common aggregation parameters, and <italic>ii)</italic> the paired model, which fits a gamma-Poisson distribution to the pre-treatment data only and scales the means of the Poisson processes from each individual by the same constant to model the mean of the Poisson processes representing the post-treatment data. Therefore in the paired model, pre- and post-treatment mean FEC come from the same Poisson distribution (i.e. this assumes that the degree of FEC aggregation does not change post-treatment relative to the pre-treatment). Both models are available with or without a zero-inflation component. For comparison, we used both paired and unpaired models to analyse our FECRT data, with the default moderately informative prior distributions as described by <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#x000a0;al.

A correction factor of 5&#x000a0;epg was applied to the data (to obtain the number of eggs counted) and FEC data from only the IVM group at Day 0 and 14 were used (<italic>No</italic> CTL), as the software currently does not incorporate the FEC variation of a separated CTL group.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6.3"><label>2.6.3</label><title>Modified Bayescount</title><p>Using a model based on that implemented by the Bayesian MCMC &#x02018;Bayescount&#x02019; procedure described by <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al. (2010)</xref> and <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al. (2015)</xref>. The Bayescount paired model describes the pre-treatment FEC data as a compound gamma-gamma-Poisson distribution, with the first gamma distribution reflecting the variation between animals and the second gamma-Poisson (negative binomial) distribution describing the variation in observed FEC that would be expected with repeated samples from the same animal. The post-treatment FEC data is modelled as a separate gamma-Poisson (negative binomial) distribution based on the estimated mean for that animal, and scaled by the FECR%. The procedure provides the 95% CI of the FECR%, while accounting for the FEC aggregation between individuals and for the Poisson errors of the egg counting method. The model is also able to separate the between- and within-animal FEC variation, and allows for changes in the FEC aggregation of post-treatment data relative to the corresponding pre-treatment observation from the same animal. This increases the uncertainty in the estimates compared with assuming that FEC aggregation is identical at Day 0 and 14, but allows for potential differences in drug efficacy between animals to result in a higher FEC aggregation post-treatment. Further description of the method can be found in the appendix of <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al. (2015)</xref>. Furthermore, for the present study the Bayescount paired model was modified to incorporate the FEC data from the initial screening in each farm and to model the data from all six herds simultaneously, therefore allowing for pooling of one or more variance parameters between farms. As a result, the procedure allows inference to be made on three FEC variability (aggregation) estimates (<italic>k</italic>) separately: <italic>i)</italic> the expected variability between the unobserved true mean of the animals (between-animal pre-treatment <italic>k</italic>); <italic>ii)</italic> the expected variability between pre-treatment samples from the same animal (within-animal pre-treatment <italic>k</italic>) and <italic>iii)</italic> the expected variability between post-treatment samples from the same animal (within-animal post-treatment <italic>k</italic>, which also captures variation in the true efficacy between animals). The mean FEC from each time point was modelled independently in each farm, so that no pooling of mean FEC or FECR% parameters took place between herds. Minimally informative DuMouchel priors (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Denwood, 2016</xref>) were used for the mean FEC and various <italic>k</italic> parameters, and a Beta(1,1) prior was used for the FECR% and 95% CI estimates.

The target coverage of the 95% CI is expected to be close to 95%.

As alternative, other nematode stages could be used for species-specific detection by molecular techniques (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Harmon et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>), and recent studies from our group have explored this by effectively quantifying ITS-2 copies in eggs and first-stage larvae of <italic>O.&#x000a0;ostertagi</italic> (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Drag et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In the FECRT, methods of calculation that included the FEC of untreated animals resulted in a higher number of inconclusive results, in comparison with methods excluding the CTL group. The inclusion of untreated animals in a FECRT has been recommended to detect changes in the FEC of a herd not related with the treatment, and for the correction of such fluctuations in the estimation of drug efficacy (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>, <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lyndal-Murphy et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). However, the inclusion of a control group is based on the assumption that treated and untreated animals with comparable FEC share similar worm burdens, which may not be always the case in cattle (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Michel, 1967</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Michel, 1969</xref>). Moreover, the density-dependent control of fecundity in some bovine nematodes, such as in <italic>O.&#x000a0;ostertagi</italic>, may reduce the FEC in untreated animals due to newly acquired infections and could increase the egg excretion of female worms in treated groups due to lower worm burden and competition (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Dobson et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). In practice, when few animals are available for a FECRT, the inclusion of a control group will limit the size of the treatment group and consequently increase uncertainty of the estimated efficacy (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). The low number of FSG calves with positive FEC that could be included in our study suggests that in these circumstances, the inclusion of untreated cattle in the FECRT should not be recommended. Instead, it may be advisable to include more animals in the treatment group in order to increase the certainty of the calculated FECR% (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Levecke et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>), a similar conclusion derived from our simulation study.</p><p>The simulation study showed the difficulties of analysing FECRT data, even with sophisticated methods such as that implemented in eggCounts and Bayescount. The poor coverage of 95% CI produced by the paired eggCounts procedure suggests (based on our simulations) that the eggCounts unpaired model should be preferred, even when analysing paired data such as that simulated here. Both eggCounts models were also tested with the use of the zero-inflation option, but results were qualitatively similar to those without zero-inflation (data shown). The relatively simple WAAVP procedure showed a better coverage probability than most of the other procedures, but does have the limitation of not providing a 95% CI when post-treatment FEC are zero (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Denwood et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">Torgerson et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Only the Bayescount procedure was able to consistently identify the simulated FECR% within the 95% CI produced, although this comes at the cost of increased uncertainty. The results also suggest that a treatment group of n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10 is inadequate for cattle, and also support the observations of <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Gill et&#x000a0;al. (1986)</xref> that the minimum required sample size depends strongly on the degree of aggregation that is assumed. Given these complications, new statistical methods are needed to quickly determine the prospective study power of a given animal group size, mean FEC and aggregation parameters. However, despite the limited sample size available in the FECRT studies, we were able to modify the paired Bayescount model to make use of the available data from the initial screening and use of pooled variance parameters to bolster the inference of the model. This produced substantially reduced 95% CI relative to the independently modelled datasets using the same procedure (data not shown), and is therefore highly recommended as a way to maximise the utility of MCMC for these types of data. A second benefit of this approach is that the variability parameters themselves may give useful information; in this case, there is a strong suggestion that the change in FEC aggregation post-treatment is more substantial in some farms than others. If this is due to variation in efficacy between animals, then a large post-treatment change in variability could itself indicate the early signs of developing AR. It is also possible to incorporate moderately informative priors into models fit using Bayesian MCMC as a way of maximising the inference from the data. Informative priors were explored as part of the modified Bayescount model presented, but ultimately did not provide any more information than the minimally informative priors. Moderately informative priors are used by eggCounts, and these are certainly valid in the context given by <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Paul et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref>, but care should be taken when using these models for different datasets to ensure that the priors are appropriate in the situation at hand. If the use of these methods is attempted without some understanding of the theory and application of MCMC, then the potential for erroneous inference is extremely large due to either selection of inappropriate model formulations (including prior selection) or errors introduced by poor convergence and/or high autocorrelation (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Brooks and Roberts, 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Kass et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Toft et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). We therefore strongly recommend that users without the necessary statistical experience seek assistance with implementation and interpretation of both the eggCounts and Bayescount procedures, although when correctly applied these methods can be used to maximise the information available from the data by incorporating additional data sources and using techniques such as partial pooling. There is also substantial scope for the development of a procedure that is simpler in application and interpretation than MCMC, but until such method is available, our results support the continued use of the WAAVP method to analyse FECRT in cattle where mean post-treatment FEC are greater than zero and statistical expertise is not available.</p><p>At the recommended dose of 0.2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> BW, injectable IVM is expected to reduce susceptible <italic>O.&#x000a0;ostertagi</italic> adults and L4 stages by&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;99% and susceptible <italic>C.&#x000a0;oncophora</italic> adults and L4 stages by&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;97% (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Egerton et&#x000a0;al., 1981</xref>). However, the current WAAVP guidelines suggests that any treatment with a FECR &#x0003e;90% in cattle should not be considered a case of drug resistance (<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Coles et&#x000a0;al., 1992</xref>). In practice, most studies evaluating anthelmintic efficacy in cattle declare AR when FECR &#x0003c;95% and lower 95% CI&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;90, as proposed for sheep. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that this criteria is biased towards declaration of AR when there is none, particularly if the mean FECR% is between 90&#x02013;95% and the CI is wide (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Lyndal-Murphy et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). In the present study, we included the upper 95% CI in the interpretation of the FECRT to increase the certainty of detecting true cases of IVM inefficacy. A similar interpretation for FECRT studies in cattle has been reported in recent investigations by <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Geurden et&#x000a0;al. (2015)</xref> and <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ramos et&#x000a0;al. (2016)</xref>. However, the effect of including the upper 95% CI in the interpretation for estimating drug efficacy using a FECRT, and how this correlates with an actual resistant phenotype confirmed by controlled efficacy tests, warrant further investigation. It is also important to note that a reduced FECR% may not necessarily be caused by AR. A lower-than-expected <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> efficacy, or varying drug response between animals, could be the result of under dosing (e.g. due to inaccurate estimation of BW) and/or altered drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in different animals (e.g. due to nutrition-related variations in fat reserves that may affect the persistent efficacy of ML, erratic absorption of drugs from the site of injection and/or interactions with other co-administered drugs) (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Gonz&#x000e1;lez Canga et&#x000a0;al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">El-Abdellati et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Areskog et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Areskog et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">De Graef et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). These factors can impair the correct estimation of drug efficacy and detection of AR, particularly in the dose-limiting species <italic>C.&#x000a0;oncophora</italic>. Recently, <italic>C.&#x000a0;oncophora</italic> populations that were declared resistant to the recommended dose of injectable IVM by FECRT in two Swedish cattle farms (with FECR% [upper CI]&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;78% [97%] and 79% [98%] in each farm; <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Demeler et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) were declared IVM-susceptible when tested in calves under controlled conditions (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Areskog et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the presence of IVM-resistant nematodes suggested by our FECRT in three farms, as well as the AR status in the farms with inconclusive results and low initial FEC, should be confirmed by controlled efficacy test.</p><p>The use of anthelmintics in the farms included in our FECRT was investigated to potentially detect trends in drug use and the extent of treatments with avermectins. Data was retrieved from the VetStat database and used to estimate the number of animals treated with a given anthelmintic at each prescription. However, the actual number of cattle treated at each investigated prescription is unknown and our analysis aimed only to offer a rough estimate of the anthelmintic use in these farms. Furthermore, VetStat does not register whether adult cattle are lactating or not at the time of treatment, and therefore the prescription of drugs not allowed for treatment of animals in lactation (e.g. IVM, levamisole) recorded in some of the studied farms deserves further investigation. Based on the data retrieved from VetStat, most of the anthelmintics prescribed in the six farms between 2002 and 2012 were avermectins, mostly topical IVM products. A similar reliance on avermectins has been preliminarily detected in the entire Danish cattle population in the period 2010&#x02013;2014, constituting &#x0223c;80% of all treatments &#x02013; of which 79% were IVM, mainly in topical formulations (Pe&#x000f1;a-Espinoza et&#x000a0;al., unpublished data). The irregular prescription of anthelmintics observed in the study farms correlates with the prescription-only regulations in Denmark, illustrated by the treatment of single animals or selected groups of animals in the herds. However, prescription patterns suggesting whole-group treatments in some farms indicate that these may be recommended by veterinarians under certain conditions (e.g. during outbreaks of dictyocaulosis), and the effect of this practice on the selection for AR needs further investigation. All treatments against GIN in Denmark should be based on a clinical and/or laboratory examination, and preventive/strategic anthelmintic treatments without such diagnosis are illegal. Organic farms are further encouraged to apply other means of parasite control than use of anthelmintics; however, due to limited knowledge of alternative and effective parasite control methods, most farms (whether organic or not) still rely on anthelmintic drugs. Therefore, and considering the relevance of IVM and other anthelmintics for nematode control in Danish cattle, the true extent of AR in bovine nematodes in Denmark needs to be assessed in larger surveys. Until then, producers and veterinarians should be aware of potentially ineffective treatments against GIN in cattle, while reducing the reliance on anthelmintics by including other parasite control strategies with documented efficacy, such as grazing management and feeding with bioactive forages (<xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Nansen et&#x000a0;al., 1987</xref>, <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Pe&#x000f1;a-Espinoza et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, reduced IVM efficacy was detected by all methods for analysis of FECRT data excluding untreated controls in three of six Danish cattle farms investigated. <italic>Cooperia oncophora</italic> was the main species surviving IVM treatment in three farms with confirmed reduced drug efficacy, while <italic>O.&#x000a0;ostertagi</italic> was also identified post-treatment by qPCR in one farm with reduced IVM efficacy. Nevertheless, the presence of IVM-resistant nematode strains suggested by the FECRT should preferably be confirmed by controlled efficacy test. The reduced efficacy of IVM detected in this study and the widespread use of ML drugs in Danish cattle suggest that farmers and their advisors should be aware of potentially ineffective treatments and larger surveys are warranted to describe the true extent of the problem. However, further validation of the design and analysis of the FECRT in cattle are urgently needed before such surveys can be implemented in cattle farms.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Conflicts of interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anonymous</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Lov nr. 1043 af 23/12&#x02013;1998 om &#x000e6;ndring af Lov om L&#x000e6;gemidler</chapter-title><year>1998</year><comment>(in Danish)</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=21108" id="intref0035">https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=21108</ext-link><comment>(visited on 14 January 2016)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anonymous</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>BEK nr. 1671 af 12/12/2013</chapter-title><year>2013</year><comment>(in Danish)</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=160842" id="intref0040">http://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=160842</ext-link><comment>(visited on 14 January 2016)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anonymous</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>BEK nr 306 af 29/03/2016 G&#x000e6;ldende</chapter-title><year>2016</year><comment>(in Danish)</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=177546" id="intref0045">https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/R0710.aspx?id=177546</ext-link><comment>(visited on 10 September 2016)</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref4"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Areskog</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Von Samson-Himmelstjerna</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alvinerie</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sutra</surname><given-names>J.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>H&#x000f6;glund</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dexamethasone treatment interferes with the pharmacokinetics of ivermectin in young cattle</article-title><source>Vet.
