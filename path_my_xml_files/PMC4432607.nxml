The screws were examined macroscopically to ensure they had no structural defects.</p><p>In the test group, the screws were sterilized by an autoclave (Prestige Medical 2100 Classic, UK) in 121&#x000b0;C and 15 psi pressure for 20 min. A custom made screw drive (CSD) and a digital torque tester (Imada DiD-4, Imada Inc., USA) were used to evaluate the maximum insertion and removal and FT.</p><p>The mini-screws were inserted into a 3-mm thick polycarbonate plate (Raychung, Taiwan) mounted inside an aluminum frame. The rotation velocity (45 rpm), penetration depth (7-mm), movement axis, insertion and removal speeds (0.9-mm/360&#x000b0; rotation = 0.675-mm/s) and the vertical forces during insertion and removal were calibrated by mounting the combination of screws, CSD and torque tester on the rotating part of a milling machine (Jamco, CM6241, China) and the polycarbonate plates on its nonrotating part [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Torque testing setup (milling machine, torque tester, custom-made screw driver, mini-screw and polycarbonate plate).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-12-243-g001"/></fig><p>Holes with 1-mm depth and 0.8-mm diameter were predrilled in 10-mm distances on the plates to eliminate any deviation from axial inclination of the screws during insertion. Maximum insertion torque (MIT) and maximum removal torque (MRT) were recorded in N.cm units. After the torque measurements, the screws were prepared by cleaning and processing method described in a previous study of authors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] First, they were completely immersed in 37% phosphoric acid gel (Ultradent Product, Inc., USA) and then soaked in 0.3 cc phosphoric acid for 10 min. Afterwards, they were rinsed with 10 cc distilled water using a syringe and then dried for 5 s. The screws were then placed in 10cc sodium hypochlorite 5.25% (Raga, Pakrood Co., Iran) for 30 min and afterwards washed and dried as described. After this process, the screws were sterilized inside the autoclave as above mentioned. Then, maximum insertion and removal torque tests were done again. This cycle was done 5 times.</p><p>After that, FT test was done for both multiple-re-used group and control group. The control group samples also were sterilized before measurements just like the test group. To test FTs, mini-screw and CSD were mounted on torque tester and hand-drived into a 10-mm thick polycarbonate block (Raychung, Taiwan). Predrilling with 1-mm depth and 0.8-mm diameter was done to decrease deviation from axial inclination of the screws during insertion. Maximum torque values before fracture were recorded in N.cm units.</p><p>The SPSS software (version 13.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the data.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Evaluating the physical and mechanical changes of appliances after re-use.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluating the chemical safety of the re-use process, for instance the absorption of chemical disinfectants on the instrument surface, which can lead to toxic reactions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Evaluating the biological safety of the re-use process, like remnant debris on the instrument.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p></list-item></list>

This increase may be due to screw thread blunting. The mean MIT values during 5 times re-use were very close; therefore, re-use had no significant adverse clinical effect.</p><p>According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, it can be predicted with 95% confidence that after 5 times re-use, MIT will only increase 4.9 N.cm. This amount is clinically neglectable and doesn&#x02019;t complicate screw placement and doesn&#x02019;t significantly increase their failure risk.</p><p>To increase torque measurement accuracy, the screws were inserted using a milling machine. The milling machine provided a monotonous rotational speed and similar to the clinicians hand speed. Therefore, the effects of speed change on torque could be controlled. The milling machine rotated the screw driver with a monotonous 0.9-mm/round (0.675-mm/s) speed perpendicular to the polycarbonate plate. This speed was selected according to mini-screw pitch. If the speed is not coordinated with the screw pitch, it will produce vertical inward or outward forces between the sloped surface of the mini-screws thread and the polycarbonate plate, which increases friction and affects torque values. Using the machine in comparison to hand-driving, allowed to eliminate lateral forces on the screw and reduced eccentric rotations thus, increasing the test accuracy.</p><p>Regarding MRT, the only statistically (but not clinically) significant difference was between MRT2 and other MRT values, which may have been occurred due to screw thread blunting in this sample size and just in this step of the experiment.</p><p>Multiple re-using had no significant adverse effects on MRT values. According to <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, it can be predicted with %95 confidence that after 5 times re-using, the lowest MRT (12.48 N.cm) is clinically close to as-received screw MIT values, which proves that multiple re-using doesn&#x02019;t have a noticeable adverse effect on screw's clinical stability.</p><p>In this study, the FT values of the test group after 5 times re-using had no significant difference with the control group values. The results of this study, justifies the previous study of the authors,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which showed that processing, sterilizing and bone insertion doesn&#x02019;t affect the mechanical properties of the screw.</p><p>Mattos <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that FT of 1.4-mm &#x000d7; 8-mm used screws was significantly higher than the suggested MIT for successful insertion (5-10 N.cm)[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and also higher than the appropriate MRT (10.7-21.07 N.cm).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In their study, because of the decreased FT observed in used screws compared with the as-received group, they suggested not to re-use the screws.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that torque values higher than 23 N.cm is required for mini-screw fracture.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The FT values in this study in both groups are higher than 28 N.cm and cover this suggested safe margin.</p><p>Tipping of mini-screws at first contact with the plate or during insertion can reduce their fracture resistance.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In this study, to decrease the tipping, holes with 1-mm depth and 0.8-mm diameter were predrilled into polycarbonate block. These holes guided the screw into the block and eliminated eccentric movements; therefore, improved the accuracy of the test.</p><p>After fracture of screw, that part inserted in the block cannot move but the other part attached to screw-driver can move. If the movement continues after screw fracture, friction between two segments of fractured screw can affect torque values. To consider this point, we preferred hand-driving rather than machine-driving in fracture test of screws.</p><p>In this study, during the FT test, all screws fractured in the thread area, which agrees with the results of Whang <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in which the screws fractured in the intra osseous area and not the head or neck. This can be explained by the light tapering of the body of the screw and the more thickness of the head. Kravitz and Kusnoto[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] carried out an <italic>in vivo</italic> study and showed that the screws fractured in the neck during removal.</p><p>According to the results of this study, re-using the mini-screws &#x0003c;5 times is safely suggested. Proper use of mini-screws in previous applications, like no lateral forces during insertion and removal, re-using the mini-screws in lower density bone sites, not re-using the mini-screw when there had been a strong resistance during previous insertion and not re-using mini-screws, which have been deformed or structurally harmed will reduce the chances of unwanted complications during mini-screw re-use.
