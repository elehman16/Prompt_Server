Patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite MTX were randomised to add TCZ to ongoing MTX (add-on strategy) or switch to TCZ plus PBO (switch strategy). Using a treat-to-target approach, open-label conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), other than MTX, were added from week 24 if Disease Activity Score in 28 joints based on erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) &#x0003e;3.2. Between weeks 52 and 104, patients in sustained clinical remission (DAS28-ESR &#x0003c;2.6 at two consecutive visits 12&#x02005;weeks apart) discontinued TCZ and were assessed every 4&#x02005;weeks for 1&#x02005;year. If sustained remission was maintained, added csDMARDs, then MTX/PBO, were discontinued.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 556 randomised patients, 76% completed year 2. Of patients entering year 2, 50.4% discontinued TCZ after achieving sustained remission and 5.9% achieved drug-free remission. Most patients who discontinued TCZ (84.0%) had a subsequent flare, but responded well to TCZ reintroduction. Despite many patients temporarily stopping TCZ, radiographic progression was minimal, with differences favouring add-on treatment. Rates of serious adverse events and serious infections per 100 patient-years were 12.2 and 4.4 in add-on and 15.0 and 3.7 in switch patients. In patients with normal baseline values, alanine aminotransferase elevations &#x0003e;3&#x000d7;upper limit of normal were more frequent in add-on (14.3%) versus switch patients (5.4%).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Treat-to-target strategies could be successfully implemented with TCZ to achieve sustained remission, after which TCZ was stopped. Biologic-free remission was maintained for about 3&#x02005;months, but most patients eventually flared.

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Remission should represent the absence of inflammation and no advancement of joint deterioration. The newly updated European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of RA emphasise the importance of using a treat-to-target approach. The EULAR Task Force suggests that in cases of persistent remission, after tapering glucocorticoids, patients and physicians may decide together to titrate the dose of conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) or consider tapering biological DMARDs.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Initial data suggest that patients who have achieved and maintained remission may be able to discontinue biological treatment<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref>; however, clinical trial definitions of remission and flare differ, discouraging meaningful comparisons across studies.</p><p>ACT-RAY is a 3-year phase 3b randomised clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe RA who have an inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). The first 24&#x02005;weeks of ACT-RAY evaluated the safety and efficacy of adding tocilizumab (TCZ) to ongoing MTX (add-on strategy) versus switching to TCZ monotherapy (switch strategy), with results of the primary efficacy analysis at week 24 demonstrating that the add-on strategy was not statistically superior to the switch strategy.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> From week 24 through year 3, ACT-RAY employed a treat-to-target strategy, where all patients continued on TCZ therapy+blinded MTX/placebo (PBO) but could add open-label csDMARDs based on disease activity.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> After week 52, the open-label treat-to-target strategy was adapted based on response where study medication could be tapered, continued, intensified or maintained with the goal of achieving drug-free remission.

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Briefly, during the first 24&#x02005;weeks, all patients were randomised either to continue oral MTX with the addition of open-label TCZ 8&#x02005;mg/kg intravenously every 4&#x02005;weeks (add-on strategy) or switch to TCZ alone with PBO (switch strategy). Between weeks 24 and 52, treatment with TCZ plus blinded MTX/PBO continued unchanged; however, if DAS28-ESR was &#x0003e;3.2 at week 24, an open-label csDMARD (sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine or azathioprine; choice and dose at investigator's discretion) was added. If DAS28-ESR was &#x0003e;3.2 at week 36 with an added csDMARD, the patient was moved to the maintenance arm (TCZ+blinded MTX/PBO+open-label csDMARD) for the remainder of the study, with the option to receive an additional open-label csDMARD per the investigator's discretion.</p><p>Between weeks 52 and 104, open-label treatment was adapted based on response every 12&#x02005;weeks, and patients continued the study in one of four treat-to-target strategies (see online supplementary figure S1):

Two reading campaigns were performed, one for baseline, week 24 and week 52, and one for baseline and week 104.

Analyses of covariance models were used for continuous measures (eg, ACR core components, disease activity indices and GSS measures). Binary and categorical response variables were analysed using a logistic regression model similar to that used for the primary analysis. All tests were exploratory and conducted at the 5% statistical significance level.</p><p>Safety endpoints included the incidence of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), serious infections (SIs) and specific laboratory abnormalities, which were analysed in the safety population (all treated patients with &#x02265;1 postbaseline safety assessment, analysed according to the treatment received).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient disposition and baseline demographics</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205752F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B summarises the patient disposition through 104&#x02005;weeks and beyond. Of the 556 randomised patients enrolled at 118 centres, 553 received &#x02265;1 dose of TCZ and blinded MTX/PBO (ITT population). A comparable proportion of patients in both treatment groups received their first or second open-label csDMARD at week 24 or later (see online supplementary table S1). By week 100, a total of 134 patients (48.4%) in the add-on arm and 147 patients (53.3%) in the switch arm had added a first or second open-label csDMARD. Of the 553 patients included in the ITT population, 138 prematurely discontinued study treatment due to safety (60 patients (10.8%)) or non-safety reasons (78 patients (14.1%)). The proportion of patients who withdrew for safety reasons was similar between the add-on and switch treatment groups (10.1% and 11.6%, respectively); however, a larger proportion of patients in the switch arm withdrew for non-safety reasons (eg, insufficient therapeutic response, failure to return, refused treatment, other protocol violation, withdrew consent and other) compared with patients in the add-on arm (17.8% vs 10.5%). Of the patients who withdrew for non-safety reasons, 14 (5.1%) patients in the switch group and 5 (1.8%) patients in the add-on group withdrew due to insufficient response.

The treatment groups had similar changes in laboratory parameters, including decreased neutrophil, platelet and white blood cell counts; however, the add-on group had a higher proportion of patients with elevation of alanine aminotransferase &#x0003e;3&#x000d7;upper limit of normal than the switch group (14.3% vs 5.4%, respectively).</p><table-wrap id="ANNRHEUMDIS2014205752TB3" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Overview of adverse events, deaths and shift from normal at baseline to worst elevations in liver enzymes through the end of study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Add-on (N=277)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Switch (N=276)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total TCZ exposure, PY</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">433.34</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">431.24</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">AEs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total patients with &#x02265;1 AE, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">89.5 (248)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.4 (244)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total no. of AEs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1762</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1558</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Rate of AEs (95% CI), per 100 PY</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">325.2 (310.2 to 340.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">302.5 (287.7 to 317.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x02265;1 AE leading to discontinuation, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.1 (28)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.2 (31)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">SAEs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total patients with &#x02265;1 SAE, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.7 (49)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4 (48)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total no. of SAEs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">66</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Rate of SAEs (95% CI), per 100 PY</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.2 (9.4 to 15.5)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.0 (11.8 to 18.7)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">SIs</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total patients with &#x02265;1 SI, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.9 (19)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.7 (13)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Total no. of SIs</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">19</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Rate of SIs (95% CI), per 100 PY</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.4 (2.8 to 6.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7 (2.2 to 5.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total no. of deaths</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ALT elevations, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N*=244</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N*=242</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;ULN&#x02020;&#x02013;1.5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.5 (67)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.4 (59)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;1.5&#x000d7;ULN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30.3 (74)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.4 (42)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;3&#x000d7;ULN&#x02013;5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.2 (25)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.1 (10)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.1 (10)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2 (3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">AST elevations, % (n)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N*=257</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">N*=249</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;ULN&#x02021;&#x02013;1.5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.6 (84)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1 (55)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;1.5&#x000d7;ULN&#x02013;3&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.2 (52)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.6 (19)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;3&#x000d7;ULN&#x02013;5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9 (10)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6 (4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;&#x0003e;5&#x000d7;ULN</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2 (3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.4 (1)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Number of patients with normal values at baseline.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;ULN=55&#x02005;U/L.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02021;ULN=40&#x02005;U/L.</p></fn><fn><p>AE, adverse event;

The EULAR Task Force recommends the use of all biologics in combination with MTX<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>; however, registry data estimate that approximately one-third of patients are receiving biologics as monotherapy.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;13</xref> In cases of intolerance to MTX or where continued use of MTX is no longer appropriate, TCZ has supportive evidence to be superior to MTX or other csDMARDs.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> The findings from ACT-RAY provide physicians with further information when considering treatment options for patients requiring biological monotherapy. Patients in persistent remission after tapering glucocorticoids may consider tapering the dose of biologics and csDMARDs.</p><p>In ACT-RAY, treat-to-target strategies could be successfully used in patients with an inadequate response to MTX (whether or not currently on MTX) to achieve sustained remission, while a subsequent step-down approach enabled some patients to reach biologic-free or all study drug-free remission. Patients in the switch group were less likely to achieve TCZ-free remission compared with patients in the add-on group; however, analyses that compare elements of the treat-to-target strategy (eg, time to flare) between the treatment groups should be interpreted with care as confounding factors cannot be excluded. The treatment groups may differ slightly at the initial time point of this analysis with respect to disease activity, concomitant medication or time in the study. To reduce variability in background levels of prednisone that patients received during the first year, patients were required to maintain a dose of &#x02265;5&#x02005;mg/day; however, this study began before recommendations for the management of RA were published, which state that low-dose glucocorticoids should be considered part of the initial treatment strategy, but should be tapered as rapidly as clinically feasible.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The treatment step-down approach in patients who achieved sustained remission (first TCZ discontinuation, then subsequent open-label csDMARDs and blinded MTX/PBO discontinuation) was associated with a high flare risk. Median time to flare, defined at the investigator's discretion, was longer in add-on patients compared with switch patients; however, patients in both groups who restarted TCZ therapy after a flare achieved rapid improvements in DAS28-ESR and TJC (68). In ACT-RAY, drug discontinuation was not blinded, and the diagnosis of flare was left up to the investigator and closely monitored. Findings from studies of antitumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; agent withdrawal were rather variable,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> which may be attributed to large design differences among studies concerning the conditions leading to withdrawal and the assessment of flare.</p><p>Progression of structural X-ray damage was small in both groups, with differences favouring patients in the add-on arm at week 104. These results were consistent with those seen at week 52, with a small percentage of patients benefiting from receiving continuous MTX treatment in the add-on arm.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Overall, the safety findings were similar to previous studies, and no new safety issues were observed. Safety outcomes were similar between both groups at week 104, except patients in the add-on group exhibited numerically higher rates of elevated transaminase levels than patients in the switch group, consistent with week 24 and week 52 results.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The rates of AEs, SAEs and SIs were comparable between the two treatment groups and consistent with previous clinical studies of TCZ.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrated that the add-on and switch treatment strategies were comparable to achieve clinical remission at week 24 and maintain clinical and radiological benefits through week 104, with combination therapy being preferred; however, TCZ as monotherapy is a viable option in some patients who cannot or do not take MTX. In agreement with EULAR recommendations, the addition of TCZ to MTX may provide added benefit for patients who are able to tolerate MTX.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Treat-to-target strategies, in addition to TCZ treatment, permitted achievement of predefined goals of sustained clinical remission in a good number of patients. Following TCZ discontinuation, most patients subsequently flared so that drug-free remission remained an elusive goal except for a minority of patients. However, patients experiencing a flare responded rapidly to reintroduction of study drug. Importantly, these results show that temporary biologic-free remission can be achieved, but further clinical data are required to provide more information on when to discontinue biological treatment or consider drug holidays following achievement of sustained remission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2014-205752-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1160" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Support for third-party writing assistance for this manuscript, furnished by Eric Deutsch, PhD, was provided by F.
