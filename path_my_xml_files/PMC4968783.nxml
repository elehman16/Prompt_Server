They were asked to perform four surgical maneuvers, including simple corneal pass at 50% and 90% depth, repair corneal laceration at 90% depth, and create triplanar clear-cornea wound on porcine eyes. The MI-OCT&#x02212; residents initially operated without MI-OCT guidance, whereas the MI-OCT+ residents operated under MI-OCT feedback (trial 1).

Freshly enucleated porcine eyes obtained from a local slaughterhouse and stored at 4&#x000b0;C were used for the wet laboratory within 18 hours to minimize corneal edema. The residents were asked to perform a corneal suture pass at 50% thickness, a corneal suture pass at 90% thickness, repair a linear full-thickness corneal laceration with suture at 90% thickness, and construct a triplanar clear-corneal &#x0201c;cataract-type&#x0201d; incision on the porcine eye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-f01">Fig. 1</xref>). The corneal suture passes and laceration repair were with 10-0 nylon suture on a spatulated needle (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA), whereas the clear-corneal wound was constructed using a standard 2.75-mm disposable keratome for cataract surgery (Alcon, Fort Worth, TX, USA).</p><p>In the trials involving MI-OCT feedback, the residents could ask for OCT at any point during the surgical maneuver. The OCT feedback entailed obtaining scans in any orientation anywhere within surgical field as directed by the surgeon. At that point, based on the feedback, the resident could rectify the maneuver (i.e., back out the needle pass and go deeper or shallower) based on the MI-OCT finding for up to three trial attempts. In the trials not involving MI-OCT feedback, the entire procedure was performed using only the operating microscope. For both, however, intraoperative OCT was used to obtain images used for grading the maneuver at the end of the procedure. For depth-based maneuvers, an intraoperative OCT image perpendicular to the needle and when visible along the suture tract was obtained after each completed pass to allow subsequent grading of the depth of the pass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-f01">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-f02">2</xref>). Each resident performed two independent scored attempts for each maneuver. The depth scores of the individual attempts were averaged and analyzed for statistically significant differences between the MI-OCT+ and MI-OCT&#x02212; groups. For the clear-corneal incision, a B-scan oriented along the radial axis of the wound was acquired at the conclusion of the maneuver and used for grading.</p><fig id="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-f02" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Close-up view of the MI-OCT display options is demonstrated in <bold>A</bold>&#x02013;<bold>C</bold>.

This crossover was designed as an internal control to ensure that any observed differences between the group performance in trials 1 and 2 were not due to confounding variables such as innate surgical ability.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Microscope-Integrated OCT Setup</title><p>The MI-OCT scanner used was previously published<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and utilized an external display for image viewing. Briefly, a customized mechanical enclosure allowed integration of the MI-OCT into an ophthalmic surgical microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL, USA). A dichroic mirror folded the OCT beam path onto the surgical microscope path to allow unobstructed surgical viewing with simultaneous (SS-OCT) imaging. The final surgical microscope objective lens was shared between the two systems and ensured that both systems were parfocal. The SS&#x02013;MI-OCT system used a (SS-OCT) engine utilizing a swept-frequency source centered at 1040 nm with a sweep bandwidth of 100 nm and a sweep rate of 100 kHz (Axsun, Billerca, MA, USA).<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> This resulted in a measured system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 99 dB, and axial and lateral resolutions of 7.8 and 15 &#x003bc;m, respectively. The imaging protocol consisted of 500 A-lines/B-scan and 100 B-scans/volume with an average of 5&#x02013;10 volumes per second. Custom GPU-accelerated software enabled real-time acquisition, processing, and simultaneous display during surgery of a continuously updated and optimized OCT B-scan, top-down retinal view, and volumetric rendering on a computer screen adjacent to the operating microscope. The site of user-specified B-scan of interest in the volume was selected by an assistant using a mouse; at that site, B-scans were averaged 5 times to enhance visualization.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Depth-Based Maneuvers Grading</title><p>To grade the suture placement, custom software was created using MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). On averaged B-scans at the point of maximal depth of the needle and suture passes, the surface of the corneal endothelium and epithelium were marked by a masked trained grader. Two-dimensional correction of the selected B-scan was performed to correct for image distortions due to refraction as previously described.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The corneal thickness at the suture pass was defined as the shortest distance between the epithelial and endothelial layers that included the position of the surgical needle or suture. The percent depth was calculated as the ratio between the distance from the epithelium to the needle/suture and the distance between the epithelium and endothelium (corneal thickness). In some corneal laceration cases, jagged edges and protrusions occurred in the epithelium at the edge of the laceration. In these B-scans, the epithelial segmentation was fit to a higher-order polynomial to accurately follow these high frequency features. Refraction correction was performed as described previously, except where a significant portion of the corneal tissue was missing in the laceration. In those cases, the refractive index of air (<italic>n</italic><sub>air</sub>) was used to make depth calculations. The best-approximated orthogonal path through the cornea was segmented manually in these instances, and the shortest linear path was found between the endothelium and epithelium.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Corneal Wound Grading</title><p>For clear-corneal incision geometry assessment, volume and averaged B-scans parallel to the direction of the keratome path were deidentified, shuffled, and reviewed by two masked expert graders. Graders determined the geometry of the clear corneal incisions on a categorical scale (3 = triplanar wound, 2 = biplanar wound, 1 = monoplanar wound, 0 = unable to determine geometry of the wound) by comparison with standard images for each grade. The scores of the individual graders were averaged for each scan, and the agreement (<italic>&#x003ba;</italic> statistic) between the graders was computed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Surgeon's Survey</title><p>All subjects were given an anonymous survey to determine their subjective experience (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-s03">Supplementary Tables</xref>). The MI-OCT+ group was asked to rank their agreement with statements evaluating their comfort in performing simple corneal passes, repairing the corneal laceration, and constructing the clear corneal incision under direct MI-OCT guidance. The MI-OCT&#x02212; group was asked to rank their agreement with statements evaluating their comfort in performing simple corneal passes, repair of corneal laceration, and construction of clear corneal wound without direct MI-OCT feedback on a 1 to 5 numerical scale. They were then asked to rerank their performance of the same maneuvers with direct MI-OCT feedback at the completion of trial 3 when they were finally provided with MI-OCT guidance. Both groups were asked to rank their overall experience of using MI-OCT, as well as their likelihood of using MI-OCT in their future practice on a 1 to 5 numerical scale.

The residents performing depth-based maneuvers (simple corneal passes at 50% and 90% depth, and repair of corneal laceration at 90% depth) with direct MI-OCT feedback outperformed their counterparts who were operating with only the microscope alone. Interestingly, the enhanced performance persisted even when direct MI-OCT assistance was removed, which suggests that MI-OCT can allow for sustained learning of surgical skill even when MI-OCT feedback is not subsequently available. We also demonstrated a favorable subjective experience of the trainee surgeons in using MI-OCT through a surgeon-administered survey. On average, most residents' reported that their comfort in performing study maneuvers increased as a result of using MI-OCT, and residents ranked the MI-OCT experience as either &#x0201c;very helpful&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;helpful,&#x0201d; while reporting on average being more likely to use MI-OCT in their future practice. Overall, the results of this study suggest that MI-OCT feedback can directly impact surgical outcomes, and for the first time, demonstrates its potential utility in surgical training of ophthalmic residents.</p><p>Not all surgical maneuvers were amenable to effective MI-OCT feedback under the current study methodology. In our study, we found no effect of MI-OCT feedback on corneal incision geometry. We attributed this to the metal keratome shadowing large portions of the OCT image, which limited feedback while the incision was being created, and the use of an external display of the OCT images, which was adjacent to, but not within the oculars. Both of these limited the surgeon to assessing the wound geometry after, but not readily during the performance of the surgical maneuver. Development of OCT heads-up display through the operating microscope eyepieces and an OCT-compatible keratome may aid in the utility of direct MI-OCT guidance for construction of cataract incisions and other similar maneuvers in the future. The survey questions were used to obtain general feedback and were not provided before and after testing. A more standard validated questionnaire would be useful in future assessment of imaging as a training tool.</p><p>Other limitations of our study include the small sample size and a single study site. Validation of the utility of MI-OCT with a larger number of ophthalmology residents and fellows at other programs, and expanding the range of surgical maneuvers for which MI-OCT may be useful in ophthalmic surgical training, such as posterior segment surgery, would be important future steps. Such feedback may also be useful in ophthalmic surgeon self-assessment using a similar wet laboratory setup or with comparable model eye materials (e.g., KITARO kit; FCI Ophthalmics, Pembroke, MA, USA). In addition, a natural future evolution from our study would be for potential integration of MI-OCT feedback for future training of residents and fellows in patient surgical treatment, such as during early experience in repair of corneal lacerations, open globes, and corneal suturing (e.g., penetrating keratoplasty). Determining whether improved anatomic outcomes with MI-OCT feedback in resident-performed and early career surgery will translate into improved visual outcomes, shorter operative time, and faster visual rehabilitation in patients would be important to justify significant cost of acquiring this technology for training or for use during routine surgery.</p><p>Clinical assessment from OCT imaging of the eye has revolutionized diagnosis and management of many ophthalmic conditions and is now an indispensable part of practice of almost all ophthalmic subspecialties. Although relatively recently introduced in the operating room, the histology-level feedback that intraoperative imaging provides during ophthalmic surgery holds the potential of a similar disruptive change in the surgical practice of ophthalmology. Multiple studies to date have reported the use of intraoperative OCT in anterior and posterior segment surgery.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b23" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b24" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b25" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of microscope-integrated SD-OCT Rescan 700 (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA)<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> will allow for access to microscope integrated, heads-up display OCT viewing during live surgery in the United States. Ehlers et al.<sup><xref rid="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> recently published 2-year results of a prospective evaluation of microscope-mounted SD-OCT used at pauses in 275 anterior segment and 256 posterior segment ophthalmic surgeries. In this single center study, the use of MM-OCT (which required moving the microscope to the side) resulted in a mean delay of 4.9 minutes while altering intraoperative surgeon's decision making in more than 40% of surgical cases. The results of our SS&#x02013;MI-OCT study build on these findings. The current study demonstrates that MI-OCT feedback can not only guide a surgeon's intraoperative decision making, but also has the potential to improve surgical performance, enhance anatomic outcomes, and be used as a training tool that is directly translatable to the operating room for use in live human surgery. As intraoperative OCT technology continues to evolve, so will our understanding of its potential, which will allow for its increasing creative applications in many aspects of ophthalmic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-s03"><label>Supplement 1</label><media xlink:href="i1552-5783-57-9-OCT146-s03.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Supported by National Institutes of Health Bioengineering Research Partnership Grant R01-EY023039, National Institutes of Health Grant R01-EY024312, and an unrestricted grant from Research to Prevent Blindness to the Department of Ophthalmology, Duke University School of Medicine.</p><p>Disclosure: <bold>B.
