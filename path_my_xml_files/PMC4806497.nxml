All trial hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own control, with analysis undertaken of the change within each hospital based on data collected in the control and intervention periods. Each site will be randomised to one of the 11 intervention timings with staggered commencement dates in 2016 and an intervention period between 20 and 50&#x000a0;weeks. All sites complete the trial at the same time in 2017. The inclusion criteria allow for a purposive sample of both public and private hospitals that have higher-risk patient populations for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). The primary outcome (objective one) is the monthly number of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteraemias (SABs), <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infections (CDIs) and vancomycin&#x000a0;resistant enterococci (VRE) infections, per 10,000 bed days. Secondary outcomes for objective one include the thoroughness of hospital cleaning assessed using fluorescent marker technology, the bio-burden of frequent touch surfaces post cleaning and changes in staff knowledge and attitudes about environmental cleaning. A cost-effectiveness analysis will determine the second key outcome (objective two): the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio from implementation of the cleaning bundle.</p><p id="Par3">The study uses the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) framework to support the tailored implementation of the environmental cleaning bundle in each hospital.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par4">Evidence from the REACH trial will contribute to future policy and practice guidelines about hospital environmental cleaning.

In Australia, 200,000 cases of HAI arise each year and 1.9 million hospital bed days are diverted to treat them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Reducing HAIs requires successful implementation of multiple evidence-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">While reasonable knowledge exists on many aspects of HAI prevention and control, good quality data on the effectiveness of hospital environmental cleaning programmes are limited. The healthcare environment plays a key role in the transmission of HAIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Environmental cleaning and evaluating cleanliness is therefore a critical component of HAI prevention. Most research examining the association between cleaning and reduction of infections has been based on a single ward or hospital using quasi-experimental designs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is little published evidence on cleaning relating to intervention cost, cost-effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability. Decision makers need more rigorous evidence from randomised controlled trials in real-world settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Environmental cleaning in hospitals is a complex process, and implementing and sustaining effective cleaning programmes is challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A review of hospital cleaning in Australian hospitals found great heterogeneity in cleaning practices between hospitals even though there are detailed cleaning guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Using bundles to improve implementation of complex interventions</title><p id="Par29">A bundle is a set of evidence-based practices that when performed collectively and reliably have a proven ability to improve patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Using a bundle is a structured way to introduce a number of interventions concurrently, improving implementation and impact on processes of care.</p><p id="Par30">An environmental cleaning initiative that combines multiple evidence-based interventions within a &#x02018;cleaning bundle&#x02019; has the potential to improve the effectiveness of hospital cleaning by including strategies to educate, provide feedback and empower healthcare workers. A multi-site trial of an environmental cleaning bundle will allow a change in cleaning policy and practice to be evaluated in real-world settings to determine efficacy and cost-effectiveness. This trial will provide evidence that can be used by clinicians and decision makers to inform future environmental cleaning and infection prevention in hospitals. This trial is called Researching Effective Approaches to Cleaning in Hospitals (REACH).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial objectives</title><sec id="Sec90"><title>Objective 1</title><p id="Par31">The first objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of an environmental cleaning bundle to reduce HAIs in Australian hospitals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec91"><title>Objective 2</title><p id="Par32">The second objective is to estimate the cost-effectiveness of a decision to adopt the environmental cleaning bundle for Australian hospitals.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Stepped-wedge design</title><p id="Par33">This is a randomised controlled trial using a cross-sectional stepped-wedge random allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

</p><p id="Par34">All hospitals will receive the intervention and act as their own control, with analysis undertaken of the change within each hospital based on data collected in the control and intervention phases. The stepped-wedge design, with staggered commencement timings and intervention length (20&#x02013;50&#x000a0;weeks), supports feasibility while maintaining the rigour of the study. This design will allow research staff to work with individual hospitals as they change-over, maximising consistency of implementation of the cleaning bundle and avoiding managing change at 11 sites across Australia simultaneously. This design also avoids having control hospitals that get no intervention, which could make it difficult to recruit hospitals, and ensures equity. Each hospital acting as their own control avoids inconsistencies in comparing infection control programmes across hospitals and jurisdictions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Implementation framework</title><p id="Par35">The project will use the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (iPARIHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] framework to promote the successful implementation of the evidence-based intervention at trial sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This framework has key constructs of innovation (e.g. the cleaning bundle), recipients (e.g. the environmental services staff) and context (e.g. hospital characteristics) that are underpinned by a fourth construct of facilitation (e.g. engagement strategies) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par36">Eleven large acute public and private Australian hospitals that fulfil the inclusion criteria and agree to participate will be enrolled in the study.

The pre-intervention infection rate and within-hospital correlation were estimated using a dataset of over two million hospital admissions and infection data from nine Queensland hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The stepped-wedge sample size formula is from Hussey and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

We will test the residuals of the model to look for autocorrelation over time and will check for influential observations. In a sensitivity analysis we will consider the possibility of a delayed intervention effect of up to one month. This is plausible because it may take time for the intervention to break the cycle of infection transmission.</p><p id="Par61">The primary outcome will be a fixed effect meta-analysis of the estimated change in infection rates across the three infection types. We will use a forest plot to visually examine the variation in the change in infection rates. The combined mean will be considered statistically significant if the 95&#x000a0;% confidence limit does not include zero. The meta-analytic approach avoids using a combined infection rate, as this is questionable given the different drivers of infection.

The main resources used in implementing the bundle include staff time, costs of cleaning products, invisible gels, ultraviolet lamps and pathology costs. Resource use will be collected from each hospital by a monthly survey. Using a standardised tool across all hospitals and applying common cost vectors will ensure consistency in collection of costs across all sites and reduce uncertainty in estimates that often results from using retrospective administrative data.

It could be difficult to recruit that number as it is very likely that some hospitals will decline or be unable to participate. This could be due to a number of reasons, e.g. disinterest in research, a lack of resources, a concern about negative impact on hospital budgets due to the need to implement change and increased product use associated with participation. This will be addressed by following an established recruitment process that provides clear information about what is required and a focus on fostering engagement and relationships with key decision makers at each site.</p><p id="Par81">Once enrolled, willingness to participate may waiver for sites that are randomised to later trial commencement times. This will be addressed by maintaining communication with all sites and through ongoing monitoring of site context and engagement. The potential for fatigue related to participation, especially for the longer intervention phase sites, will be managed through frequent monitoring and engagement activities at the trial site.</p><p id="Par82">We recognise some possible limitations in relation to the &#x02018;opt-in&#x02019; nature of the recruitment process (i.e. that participating hospitals may be those most receptive to change and quality improvement). To mitigate this, we will as much as possible approach a range of eligible hospitals and will ensure we complete comprehensive context mapping at each site to fully understand the barriers and enablers that may have influenced the site&#x02019;s decision to participate.</p><p id="Par83">Other limitations could occur due to adverse events occurring at the staff, patient or hospital level during the trial. This could include outbreaks of HAIs, seasonal factors, organisational or policy changes. This will be mitigated by frequent monitoring of each site. Participating sites will agree to not implement changes that could impact the trial, e.g. cleaning policies or product use, without prior agreement from the study team. If there is a serious national epidemic during the trial the study will continue to collect data, but any planned changeovers to the intervention will be delayed until the epidemic has passed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Significance</title><p id="Par84">Previous cleaning research has often focused on single interventions, such as a new cleaning product or auditing strategy. However, implementing cleaning in a hospital setting is a multifaceted and complex process, where contextual factors influence the success of a new approach. This study, with its implementation science approach and emphasis on facilitation and local hospital context, will enable us to develop new insights into the processes and impacts of hospital cleaning. These will be used to assist with the translation of new knowledge from each of the trial sites to other hospitals in Australia and internationally.</p><p id="Par85">The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a cleaning bundle intervention will be evaluated to support evidence-based decision-making in public and private healthcare sectors about the impact of investment in an environmental cleaning programme in acute hospitals, particularly on the risks of HAIs. It will further show whether this policy is cost-effective in a real world setting, addressing an identified research gap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACSQHC</term><def><p id="Par6">Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANZCTR</term><def><p id="Par7">Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATP</term><def><p id="Par8">adenosine tri-phosphate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUD</term><def><p id="Par9">Australian dollar</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDI</term><def><p id="Par10">
