<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Reinfection among young women treated for chlamydia is particularly high.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Skills such as negotiating condom use, notifying a partner about an infection and testing can reduce the risk of infection. However, young people can lack the confidence and skills needed to adopt safer sex behaviours.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Mobile phones for intervention delivery</title><p>Phone ownership in the UK is high, with an estimated 93% of adults owning a personal phone and 90% of people aged 16&#x02013;24 owning a smart phone.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Among young people in the UK, mobile phones have become constant companions; 59% say that their mobile phones would be the device that they would miss the most if taken away and almost half (48%) report checking their phones within 5&#x02005;min of waking.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Mobile phones therefore have the potential to deliver widely accessible and inexpensive health behaviour support. With sensitive health topics such as sexual health, mobile phones can offer convenience and privacy.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Existing research</title><p>Interventions delivered by mobile phone can be effective in improving a range of behaviours such as smoking cessation, adherence to medication and contraceptive uptake.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;14</xref> There is some evidence that mobile phone support can increase safer sex behaviours; however, high-quality trials are needed to reliably establish effects.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> A trial evaluating an intervention consisting of eight safer sex text messages, aimed at increasing knowledge and perceived behavioural control, reinforcing safer sex behaviours and changing attitudes, found that intervention participants were more likely to report using condoms with new partners in the previous 3&#x02005;months compared with controls who received text messages not about safer sex (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2). However, this trial found little evidence for an intervention effect on always using condoms in the previous 6&#x02005;months (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.4).<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> An intervention consisting of 14 &#x02018;short and catchy&#x02019; text messages providing advice and information about sexually transmitted infection (STI), increased STI testing in women compared with control participants who did not receive the messages (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.11 to 5.69).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> A trial of an intervention aimed at retesting following a positive chlamydia test result found a fourfold increase in testing in participants that received text message reminders versus controls that received the standard advice from a clinician (RR 4.5, 95% CI 1.05 to 19.22).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> None of these trials had a low risk of bias or targeted partner notification.

We aimed to recruit and randomise 200 participants within 3&#x02005;months and achieve 80% response at each follow-up point. There were no changes to the methods after the trial started.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Residents of England aged 16&#x02013;24 who had received either a positive chlamydia test result or reported unsafe sex in the last year (defined as more than one partner and at least one occasion of sex without a condom), were literate in English and who owned a personal mobile phone were eligible.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment</title><p>We recruited participants from seven sexual health services located in inner city Manchester, South London, Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Maidstone and Hull. Recruitment staff enrolled participants at the service or, with their permission, gave the telephone numbers of eligible people to the trial manager at LSHTM who contacted them by phone for recruitment. We gave all potential participants detailed verbal and written information, the opportunity to ask questions and time to consider their participation. For participants recruited by telephone, the trial manager emailed or texted the link to the web-based information sheet and participants provided informed consent by completing the form on the secure study website. We recorded the number of participants that were assessed, were eligible and declined.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Treatment groups</title><p>Our texting software automatically delivered the intervention or control messages to the mobile phone number that participants provided at enrolment. The software delivered the messages in accordance with a predetermined message schedule.

<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It consists of short, non-judgmental text messages designed to reduce STI in young people by supporting them in using condoms, telling a partner about an infection and testing before unprotected sex with a new partner. There are four intervention message sets, tailored to gender and infection status at enrolment sent over 12&#x02005;months: women-positive (63 messages), men-positive (61 messages), women-negative (51 messages) and men-negative (49 messages). Around half of the messages in each set are delivered in the first month: 59% (37/63) of the women-positive, 59% (36/61) of the men-positive, 49% (25/51) of the women-negative and 49% (24/49) of the men-negative messages (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary file 1</xref>). The messages are delivered to each participant according to the set schedule, that is, each participant starts at message #1 and receives the message set consecutively. Participants who had a positive STI test result at the time of enrolment received additional messages during the first week after randomisation on obtaining and taking treatment and notifying partners about their infection.

The trial manager required access to treatment allocation in order to identify intervention participants for qualitative interviews.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Laboratory staff assessing chlamydia infection and researchers assessing the outcomes were blinded to treatment allocation. Research staff performing the statistical analysis were blinded to treatment allocation. Data were double entered, with one researcher blinded to allocation. The treatment allocation variable in the data set was coded 1 or 2 and this was kept undisclosed to two of the three research staff performing the analysis (one was the trial manager) until the full analysis was complete.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Data collection and follow-up procedures</title><p>We assessed numbers recruited by the number randomised during the 3-month time-period. We assessed follow-up response by numbers completing the questionnaire at 1 and 12&#x02005;months and numbers returning a chlamydia test sample at 3 and 12&#x02005;months. We also collected clinic data for tests within the 12-month follow-up period.</p><p>We recruited participants face-to-face in clinics and by telephone, depending on the service. We collected baseline data by paper questionnaire in face-to-face recruitment. At the Cambridge service, staff assessed eligibility when providing positive chlamydia test results over the phone. With the potential participant's agreement, staff at the service provided their telephone number to the Project coordinator, who then contacted the participant to enrol them and collect baseline data over the phone. Recruitment staff who obtained informed consent and administered the baseline questionnaire entered the baseline data onto a secure online trial database system. If the test result was pending when the participant was enrolled, recruitment staff entered the baseline data onto the system within 24&#x02005;hours of the test result. All participants enrolled by telephone referral had received a positive chlamydia test result and the trial manager entered their data on the day that they were recruited.</p><p>We requested all outcome data by post in the first instance and followed up non-responders by email and phone. At 1&#x02005;month, we sent an unconditional &#x000a3;5 incentive with the questionnaire. At 3&#x02005;months, we sent &#x000a3;5 unconditional incentive and a postal chlamydia test kit. Men were sent a urine test (sensitivity 98.1%, specificity 99.5%) and women were sent a vulvo-vaginal swab (sensitivity 94.1%, specificity 99.7%). At 12&#x02005;months, we sent an unconditional &#x000a3;10 incentive with the 12-month questionnaire and test kit. Participants were given the option of returning their questionnaire by post or completing the questionnaire on the online database system. Participants were told that they would receive &#x000a3;20 for returning the test sample when they received the test kits. Participants sent the test kit in a prepaid envelope directly to the laboratory. Recruitment sites provided clinic data for positive tests during participants' involvement in the trial (participants consented to this at enrolment). Our approach to developing the follow-up procedures involved identifying the effective methods to increase follow-up from systematic reviews, testing prototype procedures and consulting with the target group regarding the acceptability of the procedures.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We assessed the proportion of messages successfully delivered using our trial database metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Analysis</title><p>We conducted all analyses in Stata V.14.

We fully recruited to target and achieved 81% follow-up for our proposed primary outcome for the main trial, cumulative incidence of chlamydia at 12 months. Participants' views suggested that the intervention is acceptable. Ninety-seven per cent of messages sent were successfully delivered to participants' phones.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>In the pilot trial, we achieved acceptable follow-up, allocation was concealed and laboratory staff and those analysing data were blinded to allocation. Only one researcher who double entered the data was blinded to allocation. While the trial manager was non-blinded, the risk of bias associated with this was low as the intervention was delivered by the automated texting software, not by the trial manager. We present a complete case analysis of the process outcomes and participants' views about the acceptability of the intervention. The main trial will include sensitivity analyses in relation to missing data, which could reveal that participants lost to follow-up were less likely to read the messages and less likely to find them acceptable. Given the small sample and the large number of variables assessed, baseline characteristics were reasonably well balanced. A larger sample size in a main trial would allow for better balance between the arms. The pilot trial was not powered for behavioural or STI outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Comparisons with other studies</title><p>The pilot trial achieved a higher follow-up response than a pilot trial of a sexual health website intervention for young people (&#x02018;Sexunzipped&#x02019;).

<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> An effective mobile phone messaging intervention shown to decrease STI would be inexpensive to deliver at scale with high fidelity. In contrast, face-to-face STI interventions often consist of multiple sessions,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;34</xref> which require ongoing staff training to ensure fidelity in delivery and much greater resources than safetxt.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Implications for the main trial</title><p>We are currently conducting a main trial of the safetxt intervention, informed by a number of findings from the pilot trial to evaluate the effects of the intervention. The main trial sample size is powered to produce a precise estimate for the effect of the intervention on cumulative incidence of STI at 12 months. We will use the follow-up procedures used in the pilot trial and we will have enough staff for all those entering data to be blinded to allocation. In the pilot trial, 75% of participants that tested positive during the study also tested positive at enrolment (18/24). In the main trial, only people that test positive at the time of enrolment are eligible, enabling the trial to achieve the estimated event rate with a smaller sample size. As the target group in the main trial differs from the pilot trial, we will monitor recruitment to enable us to develop strategies to recruit any groups that are under-represented. In order to achieve a more demographically diverse sample, we are also recruiting from clinics with greater numbers of male clients that report having sex with men. The main trial will include a mediation analysis of the hypothesised mechanisms of action of the intervention, for example, we will investigate if the intervention increases condom use self-efficacy and self-efficacy in telling a partner about an infection.</p><p>The postal test kits and monetary incentives for returning them were not part of usual care during the pilot trial, but part of the pilot trial procedures and delivered to participants in the intervention and the control group. In the main trial, we are sending postal test kits at 12 months only, with participants unaware of the incentive until they receive the kit. It is possible that offering incentives at 12 months could influence self-reported behavioural outcomes, but this would be equal in both groups. The incentive could not influence whether or not participants had an STI at 12 months.</p><p>Modern mobile phones offer an array of options in which to deliver intervention content. For example, content can be delivered through app instant messaging, videos and audio and can involve bidirectional interactive content. The main trial will evaluate the content of the safetxt intervention messages that could be delivered by alternative modes in the future, such as instant messaging or private social media messaging, should the content be shown to be effective.</p><p>The sample size of the main trial is 5000 participants. Of the pilot trial participants with an infection at baseline, 20% (18/89) had a positive chlamydia test at 12-month follow-up. Based on this and previous studies,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> we estimated the event rate (cumulative incidence of STI at 12 months) to be 20%. The trial is designed to detect a reduction in STI from 20% to 16% (RR 0.8). Taking into account the 2% contamination in the pilot trial, 5000 participants are required to detect this reduction with 90% power, allowing for 20% loss to follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our pilot trial has demonstrated that recruitment, randomisation, intervention delivery and follow-up were successful.
