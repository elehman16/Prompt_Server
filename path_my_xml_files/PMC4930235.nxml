Furthermore, AM is widely available and less costly than other bioengineered skin substitutes. Human AM was used for 2,308 ophthalmologic reconstructions in Germany 2008.<xref rid="b1-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Its special success in ophthalmology may be due to the immune privileged properties of the AM.<xref rid="b2-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The anti-inflammatory property of AM seems to be a result of production of anti-inflammatory proteins and reduction of expression of transforming growth factor B and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin 10.<xref rid="b3-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Also, AM produces B defensins, elastase inhibitors, elastin, and lactoferrin that contribute to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects.<xref rid="b5-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The reduction in scarring after application of AM to wounds might be due to the anti-inflammatory effects, acceleration of epithelialization,<xref rid="b3-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and inhibition of fibrosis.<xref rid="b8-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Accelerated reepithelialization was also demonstrated by Maral et al<xref rid="b9-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> after covering split thickness skin graft with AM in rats. Loeffelbein et al<xref rid="b10-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> demonstrated accelerated formation of basement membrane in wounds treated with AM that might be due to the release of growth factors. One of the most important properties of AM as a skin substitute is pain relieving which may be due to diminished inflammation, better hydration of wound bed, and protection of exposed nerve endings.<xref rid="b10-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> AM expresses few antigens, which accounts for its good tolerability and the absence of rejection reactions.<xref rid="b11-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> AM expresses many neurotrophic and angiogenic factors: endothelin-2 and -3, vascular endothelial growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor-B, Tie-2 angiopoietin receptor, ephrin-A2, ephrin receptors A2, B1, B3, B4, B5, neuropilin-2, nerve growth factor receptor, and semaphorin-F19 as well as erythropoietin and its receptor that contribute to healing of wounds.<xref rid="b12-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Some studies demonstrated the effectiveness of AM graft for healing of wounds. Mermet et al<xref rid="b14-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> put an AM graft for 15 chronic leg ulcers and healing occurred in all patients. Pesteil et al<xref rid="b15-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> used cryopreserved AM in eight patients with resistant vascular ulcers. Tolerance to the graft was excellent with healing of six out of eight patients with significant improved pain. Alsina-Gibert and Pedregosa-Fauste<xref rid="b16-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> used AM for four refractory ulcers with a mean 81.93% reduction of ulcer size after 16 weeks. Litwiniuk et al<xref rid="b17-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> suggested the potential role of matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors present in radiation-sterilized amnion dressing in healing of 23 out of 25 patients with chronic venous ulcers. Sheikh et al<xref rid="b18-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> used dehydrated amnion to provoke healing of chronic wounds in four patients and healed wounds did not recur on long-term follow-up. A similar study was done by Zelen et al<xref rid="b19-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> who used dehydrated AM in diabetic foot ulcers with complete healing of 37 out of 40 ulcers.

Each patient signed an informed consent after accepting to be enrolled in the study. Ethical aspects whether substantial or procedural have been implicated in this study and approval was obtained from the Faculty of Medicine, Ethical Committee of Cairo University (30-9-2012).</p><p>Patients were then randomly divided into two different groups. Group I (the control group) included eleven patients with eleven chronic leg ulcers in whom ulcers were treated with conventional wound dressings that were changed daily for 8 weeks. Group II (the study group) included 14 patients with 14 chronic leg ulcers. The AM was placed in contact with the ulcer and held in place with a secondary dressing, which was changed daily. Inclusion criteria were presence of leg ulcers for more than 3 months with no improvement despite standard treatment and age between 26 and 43 years. Exclusion criteria were ulcers with ongoing active infection and presence of diabetes. Full history taking and clinical assessment were done with special reference to previous treatment and surgery, diagnosed diabetes and/or hypertension, causes, types, and duration of ulcers present.</p><p>The follow-up during treatment period includes assessment of ulcer healing and pain. Ulcer healing was assessed using the percentage of the healed wound area and healing rate. Using ImageJ program (Rasband, W.S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA), the wound areas were analyzed and a percentage of the healed wound area was calculated, in respect to the original wound area and the final wound area after 2 weeks and at the end of 2 months according to the formula:

Exclusion criteria were symptoms of infection in the newborn, delivery before 34 weeks gestation, and membrane rupture more than 12 hours before delivery. The donors gave written informed consent for the donation and use of the AM. One placenta can provide four to five AM tissue fragments 5 cm in diameter.</p><p>Preparation was performed in a classified (class D) room with a microbiological safety workstation (class A). The placenta was washed with physiological saline and left in contact with an antibiotic solution in its collection container until preparation within 2 hours of the cesarean delivery. The entire membrane structure was immersed in a sterile packing container. The AM is mixed with antibiotics and antifungal in the container. The AM was then cut into different sizes and AM tissue fragments were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ijwh-8-225">Figure 1</xref>). For cryopreservation of AM, a cryoprotective agent was added (Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium [RPMI] and glycerol), and then stored in a temperature of &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C with each piece of the AM stored in a separate container. Three AM samples are collected for bacteriological examination. The placenta rinse fluid (8&#x02013;10 mL) was used to inoculate two vials of aerobic and anaerobic organisms for bacteriological testing. The placenta was also prepared for a pathological evaluation. On the day of the cesarean section, test tubes containing blood from the mother were collected for the following serology tests: HIV-1 and -2, Ag p24, HCV, HTLV; syphilis: VDRL-TPHA; and HBV: HBs antigen-HBc antibody. Final validation of the AM was performed after a repeat serology test by testing again the donor woman after 120 days. Before use, the AM can be transported to hospital and stored on dry ice up to 24 hours and conserved up to 2 hours in normal saline at room temperature after thawing before utilization.</p><p>The preparation of the ulcers includes cleaning and mechanical debridement with a scalpel. The membrane preservation solution was removed by washing with physiological saline and the membrane was applied directly onto the ulcer bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ijwh-8-225">Figure 2</xref>). The graft was then covered with vaseline dressing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-ijwh-8-225">Figure 3</xref>). Patients were confined to bed for 2 hours and then allowed to do moderate activity for the next 5 days.</p><p>Follow-up was done to detect healing rate and detection of ulcer size, assessment of pain, and to take ulcer images (days 0, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60).

Arterial and venous insufficiency combined in 10%&#x02013;20% of cases.<xref rid="b21-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Chronic leg ulcers often heal poorly if there is no revascularization. Different lines of treatment are based on optimized local wound care: cleansing, debridement and dressings, compression therapy, and skin grafting. AM graft can be used as placental tissues contain a large quantity of growth factors. Furthermore, AM downregulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and its receptor expression by fibroblasts and in doing so it reduces the risk of fibrosis. Therefore, an AM scaffold can modulate the healing of a wound by promoting tissue reconstruction rather than promoting scar tissue formation.<xref rid="b3-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>AM is a natural scaffold, which is the supporting matrix upon which cells and tissues grow, and so it is considered an important component of tissue repair with multiple clinical applications. In addition, the AM has other biological properties important for tissue repair, including anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifibrosis, antiscarring, and low immunogenicity as previously discussed. AM may thus be regarded as a bio-therapeutic product composed of a single layer of epithelial cells that lie on a basement membrane and of a nonvascular collagenous stroma. These three components give AM its beneficial properties, including antiadhesive effects, bacteriostatic properties, wound protection, pain reduction, and epithelialization effects.<xref rid="b22-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The AM epithelial cells reside on the inner layer of the AM, while amniotic mesenchymal stromal cells form the outer layer.<xref rid="b25-ijwh-8-225" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Results obtained from our study group showed complete healing of 14 ulcers in 14&#x02013;60 days with a mean of 33.3&#x000b1;14.7; healing rate range was 0.064&#x02013;2.22 and mean 0.896&#x000b1;0.646 cm<sup>2</sup>/day with a 100% reduction in ulcer size.

No adverse effects were observed.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to prove the possible efficacy of AM in treating nonvascular (traumatic) refractory wounds (two cases in this study) in addition to efficacy in treating vascular refractory ulcers (12 cases in this study) that was shown by previous similar studies.
