Screening for asymptomatic coronary artery disease with treatment by means of revascularization seems to be an appealing option for prevention. The utility of such a strategy has never been challenged in a randomized trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>In the present study a cohort of diabetic patients without any symptoms and without known coronary artery disease will be screened at two diabetes outpatients services. Those with intermediate or high risk (equal or greater than 10% according to the Italian risk chart) will be asked to participate and enrolled. They will be seen and followed in order to provide the best adherence to medical therapy. Half of the patients will be randomized to undergo an exercise tolerance testing while the other group will continue to be regularly seen at diabetes outpatients services. Best medical/behavioral therapy will be offered to both groups. Those patients with a positive exercise tolerance testing will be studied by coronary angiography and treated according to the severity of coronary lesions by percutaneous stenting or surgery.</p><p>The objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of the screening strategy aimed at revascularization. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed at the end of the follow up.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The study will provide useful information about prevention and treatment of diabetic patients at high risk of coronary events. It will be made clearer if detection of silent coronary artery disease has to be recommended and followed by treatment.

Prevalence of cardiac ischemic disease in the general population is between 2 and 4%, while it reaches 55% among adult diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death in diabetic patients accounting for more than 70% of the deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that patients with type 2 diabetes without prior myocardial infarction have a similar risk of death from coronary artery disease as patients without diabetes with prior myocardial infarction. Diabetes is considered to be a <italic>risk equivalent </italic>of coronary artery disease for future myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Given these strong associations, there is clear need to identify patients with type 2 diabetes who are at risk of cardiovascular events before the onset of symptoms, providing that an effective treatment is available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Observational studies reported a higher rate of acute coronary syndromes in diabetic patients with documented but asymptomatic ischemic coronary artery disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless the hypothesis that revascularization will reduce this risk has never been challenged in a randomized trial.</p><p>Screening for coronary artery disease in asymptomatic diabetic patients is thus an appealing but still unexplored concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>According to these observations a screening test should be aimed at detection of severe blockages of the coronary arteries that might warrant treatment.</p><p>An ideal test suitable for screening should be safe, sensitive, cheap, repeatable and widely available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Exercise tolerance testing seems close to these ideal characteristics although its sensitivity is low compared with new diagnostic tools available today. On the other hand it does not deliver radiations, it is cheap and really widely available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Recommendations about the use of exercise testing as a screening tool are vague because no clear evidence exists. The American College of Cardiology acknowledges the possible value of exercise testing in people with diabetes who are contemplating an exercise program with a strength of recommendation IIa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The American Diabetes Association suggests exercise testing to diabetic patients when two other major cardiovascular risk factors are present (strength of recommendation IIb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. What to do in case of a positive test it is not known.</p><p>U.S. Preventive Task Force states that an "adequately powered randomized trial of screening exercise tolerance testing compared with management based on traditional risk factors would <italic>greatly </italic>inform clinical decision making" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><sec><title>General objective</title><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate efficacy of screening and treatment of asymptomatic coronary disease in diabetic patients at high risk. Screening is achieved by exercise tolerance testing aimed at revascularization, surgical or percutaneous.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary objective</title><p>To assess the effectiveness of screening and treatment of coronary artery disease on the occurrence of cardiac events (acute coronary syndromes or cardiac death) in a group of patients with type 2 diabetes considered at intermediate/high risk according to the risk chart.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary objective</title><p>We will also consider and analyse the impact of screening and treatment of coronary artery disease on the occurrence of symptomatic heart failure.

Recently the publication of DIAD trial results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrates that screening asymptomatic diabetic patients by myocardial perfusion imaging without any treatment strategy does not affect outcome. This study cannot be considered the last word in this field because a screening plan should be performed only if treatment is available when positive cases are found. DIAD study design is not thought to test screening and treatment together but screening alone. Moreover the screening tool was myocardial perfusion imaging, a very sensitive and specific test, but with considerable radiation burden. In case of favourable results such a strategy would not be applicable to a large population due to costs and risks. Exercise tolerance testing is a simple and cheap test with low or no risk, it does not deliver radiations. In case of positive results the same strategy would be completely feasible in the <italic>real world</italic>.</p><p>Even the publication of BARI 2D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] trial results does not represent the final answer to the dispute. BARI 2D was not designed as screening trial, patients with left main disease were excluded and patients with history of heart failure or ischemic heart disease were included. Furthermore a benefit in terms of major cardiovascular events was observed in patients undergone coronary artery bypass.</p><p>This study is designed as screening and treatment study and mandate coronary angiography for every patient with positive exercise testing. In case of coronary blockages, revascularization (percutaneous or surgical) is proposed. The results will help to establish if a screening strategy followed by revascularization is the best approach to high risk diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>FT conceived of the project, led the design and co-ordination of the trial and drafted the manuscript.
