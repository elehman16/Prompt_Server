We aim to compare the functional status at ICU discharge of patients who underwent a progressive mobilization protocol versus patients who received conventional physiotherapy. We also examine the level of physical activity in the ICU, the degree of pulmonary and muscle function, and the length of stay to analyze correlations between these variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a protocol for a randomized controlled trial with blind evaluation. Ninety-six ICU patients will be recruited from a single center and randomly assigned to a control group or an intervention group. To determine the level of protocol activity the patient will receive, the patients&#x02019; ability to participate actively and their muscle strength will be considered. The protocol consists of five phases, ranging from passive therapies to walking and climbing stairs. The primary outcome will be the functional status at ICU discharge, measured with the Barthel Index and the ICU Mobility Scale (IMS). Measured secondary outcomes will include the level of physical activity, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, maximum voluntary ventilation, handgrip strength, surface electromyography of the lower limb muscles, and results of the Timed Up and Go and 2-Minute Walk tests. Evaluations will be made within 2 days of ICU discharge except for the level of activity, which will be evaluated daily. Physiological variables and activity level will be analyzed by chi-square and <italic>t</italic> tests, according to the intention-to-treat paradigm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Mobility and exercise in the ICU should be undertaken with intensity, quantity, duration, and frequency adjusted according to the patients&#x02019; status.

In a prospective cohort study of 1075 patients 5 months after discharge, 48% of patients needed help in at least one activity of daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Data show that 1 year after their stay in ICU, patients still reported muscle weakness, loss of muscle mass, and fatigue, and half of those patients had not yet returned to occupational tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even after 5 years, some of these changes persisted in most patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In another study, quality of life was evaluated at 1 year and 4 years after hospital discharge, with results indicating a decrease in quality of life in surviving patients due mainly to a decrease in physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">These medium and long-term consequences originate at the beginning of hospitalization and are related to changes that occurred during the stay in the ICU. In this period, patients may experience a period of inactivity and prolonged rest resulting in immobility, related to changes in various systems of the body. In the respiratory system, the main consequences of this immobilization are atelectasis, mechanical ventilation (MV), and hospital-associated pneumonia as well as delayed removal of the MV due to muscle weakness, decreased vital capacity, and residual volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Studies of immobility in bed have shown a decrease in strength and muscle mass with variations similar to the losses experienced during ICU stays, with a decline of 1&#x02013;1.5% per day and up to 50% of total muscle mass in 2 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In healthy people, immobilization has been shown to induce muscle atrophy, characterized by decreased protein content, fiber diameter, fatigue resistance, and strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Signs of cardiovascular dysfunction are observable within 3 to 4 days of immobility in the bed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These effects, seen in healthy, bed-restricted patients may be potentially relevant for ICU patients who also present with fluid loss, as evidenced by a decrease in plasma volume of 10&#x02013;20%. This decrease contributes to postural hypotension and tachycardia as well as decreased systolic volume, ejection volume, cardiac output, and oxygen uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In the ICU, in addition to immobility, muscular dysfunction is common due to multiple factors such as inflammation, the use of pharmacological agents (corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, or antibiotics) and the presence of neuromuscular syndromes associated with critical illnesses: critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Peripheral muscle weakness has been reported in 25&#x02013;33% of patients undergoing MV for 4 to 7 days and in 60% of patients with respiratory failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In light of these facts, interventions that encourage greater mobility in and out of bed during hospitalization are necessary to avoid or minimize losses associated with immobility and inactivity. The European Respiratory Society and the European Society of Intensive Care recommend starting these interventions as early as possible in critical patients, which can be done through both passive and active exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that early activity for ICU patients is safe and feasible, and results in a larger number of patients who leave the ICU functionally independent. Of all patients discharged from the ICU, those who underwent early mobilization left with fewer complications related to immobility and with improved functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Among the benefits described in the academic literature on early mobility are increased days free of MV, reduced incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia, reduced skin lesions, reduced days of hospital and ICU stay, decreased duration of delirium, and improved physical function at hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">There is no clear consensus on the ideal prescription for patients in ICU; however, the American College of Sports Medicine proposes a basic program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The program should include a prescription of intensity, volume, and frequency for each patient to optimize the benefits from physical activity, even for ICU patients and those with respiratory insufficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, there are no guides or well-established practices for early and progressive mobility in the ICU. Determining the optimal initiation and progression of physical exercises can enhance beneficial effects of the protocol. Studies of current mobility protocols are still scarce in the academic literature of physical activity.</p><p id="Par25">Rehabilitation programs within the ICU have been proposed, but the academic literature describes some limitations to early mobility in critical patients such as a lack of knowledge among professionals about early mobility, sedation practices, and insufficient numbers of professionals or equipment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Since a shortfall of professionals and a lack of equipment are cited as barriers to rehabilitation programs, the use of technology has emerged as a possible way to provide such services. Thus, the introduction of rehabilitation technologies, such as equipment for strength exercises, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, cycle ergometers, and equipment for walking can be an important factor in improving muscle strength, cardiopulmonary function, and functionality for patients in intensive care. Virtual reality has been suggested as a tool to improve certain cognitive functions. This is because exercise linked to virtual reality is able to offer demands that include multitasking, inhibition, taskswitching, short-term/working memory, and intelligence. Games can offer cognitive work since they generate cognitive demands such as: plan movements in order to hit targets, response inhibition, divide attention between tasks, sustain attention, follow visual and auditory cues, identify stimulus and decide quickly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In the ICU, the use of these technologies, along with mobility programs, requires a thorough evaluation of the potential benefits and the safety, practicality, and efficacy.</p><p id="Par26">Therefore, we created an early and progressive mobilization program based in four areas&#x02014;muscle, cardiovascular, respiratory, and cognitive activities&#x02014;to promote appropriate functional capacity and performance. The program includes exercises to maintain or recover basic function and to integrate these systems, preserving or recovering patients&#x02019; functionality even during hospitalization in the ICU.</p><p id="Par27">The study&#x02019;s hypothesis is that a progressive mobilization protocol and the use of technology is superior to conventional physiotherapy in promoting activity levels in the ICU and provides greater functional capacity at ICU discharge. Given evidence that points to the benefits of early mobilization, we chose to use conventional physiotherapy with the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par28">The primary goal of the study will be to compare the functional discharge status of ICU patients who undergo conventional physiotherapy with ICU patients who receive the progressive mobilization protocol. A secondary goal will be to assess and compare levels of physical activity in the ICU, length of stay, and pulmonary and muscle changes in patients who receive conventional physiotherapy and those who undergo the progressive mobilization protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par29">This study uses a protocol for a randomized and controlled trial with blind evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Setting</title><p id="Par30">The study will be conducted in the general ICU of a tertiary level university hospital (Hospital das Cl&#x000ed;nicas at the University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo) in S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil. The unit has a physiotherapist available at all times, and patients receive physical therapy twice a day. The patients receive respiratory care and mobilization from physical therapy professionals. There are no physiotherapy protocols in the unit; the protocol described in this article will be added to the physiotherapy routine for this research. The ICU is a general unit that receives patients with all kinds of illness as well as clinical and surgical patients. The average stay in the ICU is 12&#x000a0;days, and there are 14 beds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par31">Participants will be patients admitted to the ICU who are 18&#x000a0;years old or older with a Barthel Index equal to 100 points before hospitalization, who have not been transferred from another hospital, and who meet the criteria for inclusion in the progressive mobilization program will be enrolled in the study. The criteria for for initiation and continuity the progressive mobilization program follow the safety consensus described in the academic literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and some points are as follows: respiratory rate (RR)&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;35 breaths per min, absence of cardiac arrhythmias or acute ischemia, heart rate (HR) between 50 and 140 beats per min, without the use of vasoactive drugs or without dose increase, mean arterial pressure (MAP) between 60 and 120&#x000a0;mmHg, absence of active bleeding, and no prescription of bed rest. Patients with MV with inspired fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>)&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O are also eligible to participate.</p><p id="Par32">Patients to be excluded include patients with neurological diagnoses associated with motor alterations, who refuse to carry out the proposed exercises or ask to withdraw less than 3 days after beginning the protocol, with contraindications for movement, those with pre-existing amputations or who undergo amputation upon hospitalization, and those who die before the final evaluation will be excluded from the study.</p><p id="Par33">After admission to the ICU, patients will be evaluated at all times of the day regarding the inclusion criteria in the program. Patients will be evaluated within 2 days of admission to the ICU to participate in the study. If they do not present the criteria for initiating a mobilization program in that period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], they will not be randomized and will not be included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Details of the intervention and control</title><p id="Par34">The study will consist of two groups: control and intervention. Patients will be randomized into groups using a computer program after evaluation of the inclusion criteria. Both groups will receive respiratory care according to the routine of the ICU and will receive physiotherapy twice daily. The ICU staffs a physiotherapist at all times. Patients in the intervention group will receive conventional physiotherapy in the morning and perform the research protocol in the afternoon period, thus receiving physiotherapy twice a day. Patients in the control group will also receive physiotherapy twice a day, performing conventional physiotherapy in both the morning and afternoon.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par35">The control group will perform the conventional treatment offered by the unit physiotherapists. The unit physiotherapist will not have access to the protocol and equipment used, and the exercises that patients perform will be at the physiotherapist&#x02019;s discretion. Conventional therapy consists of passive, active assisted, and active mobilization as well as bed positioning, bedside and armchair transfers, orthostatism, and ambulation; however, the type of therapy will not be defined in advance, but instead will be at the discretion of the attending physiotherapist and without a pre-established routine. No technological equipment will be used for this group, as these elements are not part of the normal service.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention group</title><p id="Par36">The intervention group will undergo a program of early and progressive mobilization (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) created by the research team, based on data in the academic literature. As maintenance of functionality seems to depend primarily on the muscular and cardiorespiratory systems, the program is designed for rehabilitation focused on these systems. The protocol describes exercises, techniques, and apparatus for maintenance of muscle length, maintenance and gain of muscle strength, aerobic exercises, exercises aimed at reeducation of gait, and cognitive components.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Progressive mobilization program</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2641_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par37">The patients will undergo the prescribed program therapy at the appropriate level for each patient, chosen based on the physiotherapist&#x02019;s evaluation and evolving within the protocol as described below.

To determine the appropriate level, the methods used to determine the appropriate level for each patient will be the patient&#x02019;s ability to understand and their MS. The patient&#x02019;s capacity to understand will be evaluated through requests to follow simple commands, such as &#x0201c;Put your hand on your head, bend your legs, open and close your eyes.&#x0201d; MS at the beginning of the program will be assessed using the MRC Strength Scale. A score of 3 points will be used as a cut-off to determine whether the patient can perform the movement alone and against the action of gravity. Patients capable of these movements will progress to the next level.</p><p id="Par57">Thus, if a patient meets the criteria to enter the program, the next step will be to determine the activity level at which he or she will start the protocol. The first criterion is whether the patient can respond to commands; patients who are unresponsive will enter the program at level I. Patients who can follow commands will begin at levels II, III, IV, or V. To determine the specific level of each patient, MS is measured, with a cut-off score of 3 on the force scale. Patients with MS less than 3 will begins the program at level II, patients with MS of 3 or greater will begin at level III. The difference between level I and the other levels is the ability to understand commands, and the differences between the other levels depend on MS. After completing a level, the patient can move to the next level.</p><p id="Par58">Patients will be reassessed daily to determine whether they can advance to the next level. To progress from level I to level II, the patient should have improved consciousness and be able to respond to commands. If MS is less than 3, the patient will enter level II. If the patient&#x02019;s MS is equal to or greater than 3, they can advance directly to level III.</p><p id="Par59">From level II onwards, patients can advance by one level when they can perform all the exercises prescribed for that level. Therefore, at levels III, IV, and V in the early and progressive mobilization program, the patient must be able to perform all of the physical exercises and postural changes at their present level or they will remain at the same level for the following day. When patients can complete all of the activities, they advance to the next level on the following day.</p><p id="Par60">Patients in both the control and intervention groups will be monitored throughout the therapy for hemodynamic and respiratory stability. Therapy will be discontinued if the RR is above 35 breaths/min, the MAP is below 60&#x000a0;mmHg or above 120&#x000a0;mmHg, the HR is below 60&#x000a0;bpm or above 140&#x000a0;bpm, or the patient experiences discomfort or unrelenting pain during the therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Patient assessment procedures</title><p id="Par61">At the time of admission to the ICU and up to 2 days after admission, the patient will be examined against the inclusion criteria. The patient&#x02019;s functionality in the 2 weeks before admission will be evaluated with the Barthel Index, which will be assessed by directly questioning the patient or their caregiver if they are unable to respond. Evaluation will include hemodynamic, respiratory, and cardiac stability for the safe practice of early mobility, and the absence of exclusion criteria will also be assessed. The patient will then be randomly placed in the control group or the intervention group.</p><p id="Par62">After the patient is enrolled in the study, the initial variables will be collected, consisting of data related to the patient and their hospitalized and pre-hospitalization levels of functionality.

The accelerometer will be placed on the dominant lower limb using a bandage and will not be removed until discharge, allowing information on the patient&#x02019;s physical activity to be collected objectively. The evaluation of the intensity of the exercises performed during ICU stay in both groups will be performed through the parameters evaluated by the accelerometer. This instrument is able to identify the intensity of the exercise performed, and for analysis we will divide it into mild, moderate and intense or absence of activity. Exercise intensity will also be monitored and evaluated by the Borg Scale at the end of each physical therapy session.

The functional status is the difference between baseline and final score on both the Barthel Index and the IMS. Therefore, at discharge from the ICU, the Barthel Index and IMS will be redone, and the quantitative final score on those scales will be considered as the primary endpoints of the study. The secondary outcomes will be the respiratory and muscular variables and the number of days of hospitalization in the ICU.

Objective descriptions of the intensity of exercise performed in the ICU are scarce in the academic literature.</p><p id="Par83">Physiotherapy in clinical practice differs greatly in character between care services. Variation in the supply and types of treatments available within the ICU may be the main difficulty in achieving greater benefits, and standardization with early and progressive programs, with the patient being included at most appropriate level of the program (i.e., the maximum the patient can do at that moment), may be the key to better outcomes. Other procedures used in the ICU, such as weaning from MV, weaning from sedation and therapies for sepsis have previously been addressed and are implemented using defined protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par84">A study conducted in ICUs in Australia showed that, although the vast majority of physiotherapists routinely prescribed exercises in the ICU, practices varied widely across the country, and it was also found that the results of the therapies were not measured. These results led to the conclusion that future research is necessary for adequate and improved exercise prescription in ICUs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par85">As with other therapies, mobility and exercise in the ICU should be planned in terms of intensity, quantity, duration, and frequency. It is important that physiotherapy in the ICU also has directions and protocols for these characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Studies of current mobility protocols are still scarce, especially regarding physical activity characteristics, such as exercise intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par86">We hope that the early and progressive rehabilitation program will result in a higher level of physical activity during ICU admission and thus will also result in improved functional indexes and muscle and respiratory functions at ICU discharge. Also, we hope that our results will contribute to scientific knowledge about the benefits of physical activity in the ICU and help to direct physiotherapeutic activity in this environment, bringing benefits to patients and the health care system (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par87">Trial registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrails.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link></p><p id="Par88">Registration number: NCT02889146.
