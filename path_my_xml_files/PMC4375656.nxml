pressure (BP) of hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To evaluate the impact of light salt substitution for regular salt on BP of
hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Uncontrolled hypertensive patients of both sexes, 20 to 65 years-old, on stable
doses of antihypertensive drugs were randomized into Intervention Group (IG -
receiving light salt) and Control Group (CG - receiving regular salt). Systolic BP
(SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were analyzed by using casual BP measurements and
Home Blood Pressure Monitoring (HBPM), and sodium and potassium excretion was
assessed on 24-hour urine samples. The patients received 3 g of salt for daily
consumption for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study evaluated 35 patients (65.7% women), 19 allocated to the IG and 16 to
the CG. The mean age was 55.5 &#x000b1; 7.4 years. Most participants had completed the
Brazilian middle school (up to the 8th grade; n = 28; 80.0%), had a family income
of up to US$ 600 (n = 17; 48.6%) and practiced regular physical activity (n = 19;
54.3%). Two patients (5.7%) were smokers and 40.0% consumed alcohol regularly (n =
14). The IG showed a significant reduction in both SBP and DBP on the casual
measurements and HBPM (p &#x0003c; 0.05) and in sodium excretion (p = 0.016). The CG
showed a significant reduction only in casual SBP (p = 0.032).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The light salt substitution for regular salt significantly reduced BP of

disease (CVD). Sodium restriction has a favorable influence on blood pressure (BP)
control, thus being a potentially powerful tool for systemic arterial hypertension (SAH)
prevention and control<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>Several studies have claimed that a reduction in sodium-rich foods consumption causes a
significant decrease in BP of hypertensive patients<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.
<italic>Intersalt</italic> was one of the first studies to evaluate sodium intake
from 24-hour urine samples, demonstrating a positive association between high sodium
consumption and BP increase<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>High sodium excretion is related to a higher risk of death due to CVD. On the other
hand, higher potassium excretion implies reduced heart attack risk<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Chang et al<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> have detected
that mortality due to CVD decreased significantly in individuals who consumed salt with
lower sodium and higher potassium levels.</p><p>Research studies assessing the effect of the reduction in sodium consumption on BP have
been treated with great importance by the scientific community. For this reason, it is
important to perform new experimental studies in order to find complementary and more
current results on the association between those variables<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, evaluating the impact of a low-sodium salt consumption on BP may contribute
to better control it. The present study aimed at evaluating whether light salt
substitution for regular salt could reduce the BP of hypertensive patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-blind randomized controlled trial.</p><sec><title>Sample characterization</title><p>Sample size was calculated for comparison of means, with a statistical power of 90%,
two-tailed hypothesis test, standard deviation of 12.7 mmHg and an expected
difference of 13.1 mmHg in systolic blood pressue (SBP)<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>, with a significance level of 5%. The necessary sample size was
of 20 individuals in each group.</p><p>Hypertensive individuals of both sexes, aged between 20 and 65 years, were recruited
and regularly followed up at a multiprofessional service for hypertension care.
Patients were dwellers of the metropolitan region of Goi&#x000e2;nia, Brazil, on stable doses
of antihypertensive drugs for at least 30 days, with uncontrolled hypertension (BP &#x02265;
140 x 90 mmHg)<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> in their last visit.</p><p>Patients with acute or subacute (up to 3 months before the beginning) and unstable
chronic diseases were excluded, as were those having their meals prepared with a salt
different from that provided in this study more than once a week.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample selection and randomization</title><p>Initially, patients were identified from medical charts, according to the inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Then, they were invited to visit a nutrition office to
receive the necessary information about this research and to provide their written
informed consent, when agreeing to participate in this study. The project was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee from the General Hospital of the Federal
University of Goi&#x000e1;s (protocol number 193/2011) and was conducted in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The studied population was assigned to two homogeneous groups [Intervention Group
(IG) and Control Group (CG)], according to the order of their visit with the
nutritionist: the first patient was included in IG and the second in CG, and so
forth. The IG participants received light salt, whereas CG participants received
placebo (regular salt), for four weeks (28 days). All participants from both groups
remained on regular follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The variables collected in the inclusion visit were sex, age, schooling level
(complete middle school; complete high school; and complete college), family income
(up to US$ 600; from US$ 600 to US$ 1200; and US$ 1200 or more), regular physical
activity practice (at least 30 minutes, three times a week), smoking habit and
alcoholism (alcoholic beverage intake frequency equal to or higher than once a
month.</p><p>The variables collected prior to and following the intervention included weight,
height, body mass index (BMI), 24-hour urine sodium and potassium (mEq/day), casual
BP and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM).</p><p>Patients were recruited from May to October 2012. Two visits were scheduled during
this study, the first corresponding to the participants' selection and randomization
and the second, 28 days after the first, during the post-intervention return. In the
initial week of study, patients had their casual BP measured, and underwent HBPM for
four days and 24-hour urine sample collection. Then, they started to consume the
prescribed salt and carried it on for 28 days. During the last week of the study,
patients returned to their second visits, had their casual BP measured, and underwent
HBPM and 24-hour urine sample collection, following the same procedures used before
the intervention.</p><p>Casual BP was measured by the same researcher, at least three times and at 1-minute
intervals, until the differences between the measurements were lower than 4 mmHg<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. For the purpose of analysis, the mean of the
last two values was considered.</p><p>HBPM was accomplished according to the III Brazilian Guidelines for HBPM<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Twenty-four measurements were performed,
being three in the morning and three in the afternoon for four days. The examinations
with a recovery percentage higher than 70% were considered adequate.</p><p>All the SBP and DBP measurements were obtained by using a semi-automatic digital
device (OMRON 705 CPINT, Illinois, USA), and patients were duly guided on how to use
the device for HBPM.</p><p>The process of 24-hour urine sample collection initiated with the second urine
elimination of the first day and finished at the first elimination of the following
day, approximately at the same time. Urine was analyzed at the General Hospital's
laboratory of the Federal University of Goi&#x000e1;s using the ion-selective membrane
technique<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> to quantify sodium and
potassium levels in human urine.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>All patients were instructed to consume only the provided salt throughout this study.
In addition, they were instructed to reduce sodium-rich food consumption during the
study period, being particularly warned about industrialized foods<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>.</p><p>The patients received the salt after the first BP evaluation and urine collection.
The daily recommendation adopted was 3 g of salt per person, proposed by the VI
Brazilian Guidelines on Hypertension<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. To
calculate the amount of salt consumed per patient, the number of people usually
sharing the same meals was considered. Ten percent of the amount of salt per patient
was added, anticipating a higher consumption due to family routine changes on
weekends (greater number of people).</p><p>Every patient received 28 small plastic bags containing the daily amount of salt,
with a tag showing the initials of the patient's name, date of use and the amount of
salt. The salt provided showed no identification of its composition. Therefore,
participants were not aware of the type of salt they were receiving. The researcher
was the only person who knew that information, characterizing the study as a
simple-blind investigation.</p><p>The light salt composition (per gram) was as follows: 130 mg of sodium, 346 mg of
potassium and 44 mcg of iodine. The regular salt contained (per gram) 390 mg of
sodium and 25 mcg of iodine.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using the SPSS software, version 20.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago,
USA). Qualitative variables were presented as mean and standard deviation, according
to their absolute and relative frequencies. Shapiro-Wilks W test was used to verify
data normality. In the presence of normal distribution, independent data, as well as
paired data, were compared by using Student <italic>t</italic> test; Wilcoxon's test
was used when paired data were skewed.</p><p>The 5% significance level was adopted for all tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 1800 medical registrations at our service, 265 corresponded to patients with
uncontrolled BP, of whom, only 56 were eligible. This could be explained by the fact
that our service provides care to an elderly population with a high incidence of chronic
diseases, which were exclusion criteria of this study.</p><p>Of the 56 eligible patients, 38 agreed to participate and were selected for the study
from May to October 2012 (19 in each group). The calculated sample (40 individuals) was
not reached, because most of the patients reported personal problems or difficulties as
a justification for not participating. In addition, after beginning the research and due
to patients' personal reasons (illness in family or lack of time), there was a follow-up
loss of three CG individuals prior to the intervention, which resulted in a final sample
of 35 patients (19 in IG and 16 in CG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure

socio-demographic variables. The mean age was 55.5 &#x000b1; 7.4 years, and 65.7% of the sample
corresponded to women. The majority had completed the Brazilian middle school, that is,
up to the 8<sup>th</sup> grade (n = 28; 80.0%), had a family income of up to US$ 600 (n

Due to its peculiar
taste, light salt had low acceptance by 89.5% of IG individuals, who claimed there
were taste changes in the prepared foods. Nevertheless, patients agreed to use that
salt throughout the study period. The above mentioned adverse effect was considered
mild and study interruption was not necessary.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study sought to reduce the dietary sodium intake of CG patients to less than the 5
g of salt per day (2 g of sodium) proposed by the World Health Organization<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, considering that the 3 g provided corresponded
to the consumption of 1.2 g of sodium from regular salt.</p><p>On the other hand, light salt (with approximately 67% less sodium than the regular one)
promoted a mean intake of 390 mg of sodium per day. This sodium restriction was capable
of promoting the BP and sodium excretion control observed in the IG, suggesting that, at
least in the short-term, the use of light salt has proven to be an efficient strategy
for SAH treatment.</p><p>Despite demonstrating a significant BP reduction after decreasing salt intake, the mean
sodium excretion values in the present study were higher than 125 mEq (IG) and 180 mEq
(CG), indicating that the provided sodium amount (1.2 g from regular salt and 390 mg
from light salt) may not have corresponded to that consumed by the patients. This shows
the difficulty of changing a lifestyle, because salt consumption is a strong habit
around the world. Ortega et al<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> have found a
dietary salt intake of 9 g/day on Spanish adults between 18 and 60 years, with 168
mmol/d sodium excretion on 24-hour urine. It reflects ingestion above the recommended 5
g per day, just as in the present study.</p><p>Unfortunately, the design of this study could not follow patients on their routine to
check if there was a complete adhesion regarding their sodium intake, although they had
been strongly instructed about how to use the given salt and how to avoid all
sodium-rich food. It seems they may have eaten less sodium than usual, but not exactly
as recommended, justifying sodium excretion above expected. Besides, 24-hour excretion
values showed only the previous-day sodium and potassium intake, which could have been
atypical as compared to that of other days, even with all the recommendations. The same
argument may apply to the unchanged potassium excretion of IG, in addition to the fact
that the light salt potassium content is low to cause a significant difference in urine
excretion, which could vary more with a higher than usual potassium-rich food
ingestion.</p><p>Resistance to lifestyle changes to control SAH is common among hypertensive
patients<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. In addition, another limiting
aspect that impairs adhesion to SAH control was detected among IG patients, because
89.5% reported identifying a bitter taste in their foods. Although the same patients
reported that the 28-day period of diet was acceptable, they were reluctant to comply
with the suggestion of maintaining light salt after the conclusion of the study, even
after acknowledging the better control of their BP.</p><p>The possible explanation for the taste change of light salt is the potassium added to
its composition. In spite of this negative effect, the scientific community often
discusses not only the beneficial effect on BP of reducing sodium intake, but also the
positive impact that potassium intake may have on SAH control<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Similarly to the present study, Lotaif et al<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
used a salt with lower sodium content and added potassium in order to verify its effect
on BP. Patients were separated into a control group (regular salt) and an intervention
group (light salt), and had their BP assessed by using Ambulatory Blood Pressure
Monitoring (ABPM), as well as their blood and urine sodium and potassium levels
assessed. The intervention group showed BP reduction. On the other hand, sodium levels
showed no change in any of the groups, whereas the intervention group showed a
significant increase only in plasma potassium levels. The authors attributed BP control
to potassium supplementation and not to the reduction in sodium intake.</p><p>The literature, however, still lacks conclusive studies on the need for medical
supplementation of potassium to control BP, being a balanced diet, rich in fruits and
vegetables, the best way to obtain that mineral<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>In accordance with the results of the study by Lotaif et al<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, the potassium excretion values obtained at the beginning and end
of this study were similar. It indicates that, in the present study, salt intake from
light salt may not have influenced the total balance ingested by patients, since the
daily potassium need for adult individuals, which contributes to BP control, is 4.7
g<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the potassium content consumed by the IG may not have accounted for the BP
reduction of those patients, because the additional amount ingested from light salt was
only 1038 mg. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that the BP control of this study was
due to sodium reduction, much more effective with the use of light salt and,
additionally, confirmed with the significant reduction in sodium excretion of IG
patients.</p><p>Such reduction in sodium intake is an important factor considering the reduction in CVD
mortality, as shown in the study with individuals from five kitchens of a retirement
home in northern Taiwan, who were separated into two groups. The first group was given a
potassium-enriched lower sodium salt, and the other group, only regular salt. A
significant reduction in CVD mortality was observed in the experimental group<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>.</p><p>A systematic review has shown randomized trials of dietary counseling methods on sodium
intake reduction to treat hypertension and identified a significant reduction in BP and
sodium excretion when sodium intake was restricted<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>Sodium intake reduction has also been proven to be efficient in the SAH control of 169
individuals, separated into two groups, one with low sodium intake and the other with
placebo, submitted to a double-blind crossover study<sup><xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>. In the present study, the decrease in BP reached 15.84 x 13.84 mmHg (IG)
and 6.25 x 8.44 mmHg (CG), although the reduction was significant only in IG.</p><p>Another meta-analysis allowed the conclusion that, when compared to the current
recommendations, a reduction in salt consumption to 3 g per day may have much better
results and, thus, that should be used as the daily intake goal around the world<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Such conclusion reinforces this study's findings
to obtain more favorable results on BP control.</p><p>The sodium excretion values found in the present study suggest that the patients may
have consumed amounts higher than 3 g of the provided salt, as already mentioned.
Nevertheless, BP control at the end of the intervention demonstrated that the intake
prior to the study was probably excessive as compared to that during the study.
Therefore, the reduction in salt consumption had beneficial effects on SAH, as seen in
this study's results.</p><p>These data reinforce the relevance of the present study, once dietary sodium restriction
has been constantly referred to as a factor contributing to SAH control, and,
consequently, to reduce mortality due to CVD<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>.</p><p>Therefore, changes in eating habits, such as decreasing the consumption of addicted salt
and processed food, which represents more than 75% of sodium intake of the North
American's diet<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>, proposed in this study, are a
valuable tool for SAH control and reduction in the risk of mortality due to CVD, which
is the major cause of death in the world.</p><p>The significant reduction in casual SBP in the CG, with no changes in HBPM values, may
have occurred due to attenuation of the white-coat effect in the study.</p><p>One limitation of this study was the change in food taste attributed to light salt by a
large number of IG patients. This fact did not interfere with the use of light salt
during this study, but it may be a limiting factor regarding long-term adhesion.
Finally, salt sensitivity, which varies among individuals, may have influenced the
patients' BP levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, potassium-enriched light salt substitution for regular salt was efficient
in reducing hypertensive patients' BP in this study. Thus, the long-term implementation
of that change could be interesting to reduce population hypertension and even mortality
due to CVD. Health care professionals could use these results to explain to their
patients how sodium intake can raise BP and encourage them to reduce it by using light
salt. Furthermore, hospitals could control BP of hypertensive patients by using that
type of salt in their diet during hospitalization and light salt's industry could create
strategies so that its flavor is not a limiting factor for its use, since the benefits
of its consumption were evident.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions</bold></p><p>Conception and design of the research: Barros CLA, Sousa ALL, Jardim TSV, Jardim
