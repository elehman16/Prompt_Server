In a randomised cross-over design, thirty-five lean men (<italic>n</italic> 14) and women (<italic>n</italic> 21) extended their overnight fast or ingested a typical carbohydrate-rich breakfast in quantities relative to RMR (i.e. 1963 (<sc>sd</sc> 238)&#x000a0;kJ), before an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch 3&#x000a0;h later. Blood samples were obtained hourly throughout the day until 3&#x000a0;h post-lunch, with subjective appetite measures assessed. Lunch intake was greater following extended fasting (640 (<sc>sd</sc> 1042)&#x000a0;kJ, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;01) but incompletely compensated for the omitted breakfast, with total intake lower than the breakfast trial (3887 (<sc>sd</sc> 1326) <italic>v.</italic> 5213 (<sc>sd</sc> 1590)&#x000a0;kJ, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001). Systemic concentrations of peptide tyrosine&#x02013;tyrosine and leptin were greater during the afternoon following breakfast (both <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05) but neither acylated/total ghrelin concentrations were suppressed by the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch in the breakfast trial, remaining greater than the morning fasting trial throughout the afternoon (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;05). Insulin concentrations were greater during the afternoon in the morning fasting trial (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;01). There were no differences between trials in subjective appetite during the afternoon. In conclusion, morning fasting caused incomplete energy compensation at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch. Breakfast increased some anorectic hormones during the afternoon but paradoxically abolished ghrelin suppression by the second meal. Extending morning fasting until lunch altered subsequent metabolic and hormonal responses but without greater appetite during the afternoon. The present study clarifies the impact of acute breakfast omission and adds novel insights into second-meal metabolism.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Breakfast skipping</kwd><kwd>Appetite hormones</kwd><kwd>Insulin sensitivity</kwd><kwd>Second-meal effect</kwd><kwd>Energy intake</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> EI, energy intake; PYY, peptide tyrosine&#x02013;tyrosine</p></notes></front><body><p>Regular breakfast omission is associated with greater risk of obesity<sup>(</sup>

Increased adiposity is due to chronic positive energy balance, so laboratory studies have understandably explored a possible role of daily breakfast in regulating energy intake (EI) and associated metabolic responses. However, the focus of previous research in adults has been to compare breakfasts of varied quantity or composition<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> have measured hormonal and appetite responses to breakfast omission/consumption followed by an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch. These studies therefore provide valuable information, but their designs included mid-morning preloads (i.e. a standardised feeding of 1050&#x000a0;kJ (250&#x000a0;kcal) and 1500&#x000a0;kJ (358&#x000a0;kcal) in all trials before lunch) such that the effects of unbroken overnight fasting prior to an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch were not a focus. However, there is evidence in adolescent girls that breakfast consumption can reduce hunger relative to morning fasting, with high protein breakfasts reducing daily ghrelin (an appetite-stimulating hormone<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> (shown to augment insulin secretion to nutrients and reduce food intake<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">

Omission of breakfast therefore has the potential to affect EI as well as metabolic and hormonal responses to subsequent feeding.</p><p>The metabolic and hormonal responses to an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch when still in an overnight fasted state remain to be examined in adults. This question is of relevance both in terms of understanding the basic physiology influencing daily feeding patterns and in terms of practical relevance for the 19&#x02013;28&#x000a0;% of Western societies who frequently skip breakfast altogether<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, we examined acute EI, appetite-regulatory hormones and metabolic responses after extended morning fasting relative to a standardised high glycaemic index/carbohydrate breakfast. We hypothesised that the prescribed differences in EI during the morning would not be fully compensated for at lunch. Secondly, that morning fasting would result in greater appetite sensations consistent with increased orexigenic (ghrelin) and lower anorectic (e.g. PYY) hormone responses throughout the day.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The present study was part of a wider randomised controlled trial (the Bath Breakfast Project), other results from which have been published previously<sup>(</sup>

RMR was assessed as described later, before a cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein, with a baseline sample of 15&#x000a0;ml blood obtained. Participants were then provided with either a breakfast (to be consumed within 15&#x000a0;min) or asked to rest for the same duration, with blood samples taken at 15&#x000a0;min, 30&#x000a0;min and an hour after completion of the breakfast period. Blood samples were then obtained hourly until 3&#x000a0;h post-breakfast, at which point an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch was provided.

The overall percentages of energy from macronutrients in the breakfast were 70&#x000a0;% carbohydrate, 17&#x000a0;% fat and 13&#x000a0;% protein. This breakfast was selected because it is typical of the type of carbohydrate-rich foods commonly consumed at breakfast in the UK<sup>(</sup>

The breakfast was provided in quantities that contained 0&#x000b7;06&#x000a0;g carbohydrate per kcal of each individual participant's measured daily RMR, resulting in an EI of 1963 (<sc>sd</sc> 238)&#x000a0;kJ (469 (<sc>sd</sc> 57)&#x000a0;kcal). The size of this breakfast was based upon pilot work to determine an ecologically valid portion size, which also surpasses one of the most commonly accepted EI ranges of &#x02018;breakfast&#x02019; as a minimum of 20&#x000a0;% of daily EI<sup>(</sup>

Consistent with the rationale for the carbohydrate-rich breakfast, this meal was selected on the basis that it would also challenge glycaemic control. Pasta was provided in a bowl which was replenished every 10&#x000a0;min to minimise visual feedback relating to consumed volume, and to prevent any tendency to finish the portion provided.

</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study investigated EI along with hormonal, metabolic and subjective appetite responses to an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch in an overnight fasted state in contrast with following a standardised breakfast in lean individuals. EI at the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch was greater following morning fasting than breakfast. However, in accordance with our hypothesis, greater lunch intake was insufficient to compensate for energy from breakfast, resulting in lower net intake in the morning fasting trial. Following lunch, the response of hormones associated with satiety (PYY, leptin) was greater in the breakfast trial but, paradoxically, acylated/total ghrelin were not suppressed after lunch in the breakfast trial. Suppression of ghrelin would be expected due to the substantial energy/carbohydrate intake at lunch. In contrast to our hypothesis, subjective appetite 3&#x000a0;h after lunch was not different between trials; indicating that morning fasting may not cause greater appetite than breakfast in the afternoon despite incomplete compensation at lunch and lower concentrations of satiety-inducing hormones. This may be due to abolished ghrelin suppression after lunch following breakfast.</p><p>PYY has been shown to reduce food intake<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In the present study, PYY increased in response to breakfast, remaining higher than the morning fasting trial throughout the day, despite greater intake at lunch following morning fasting. This is consistent with the accumulated difference in intake, and is supported by a report of similar PYY concentrations between conditions after an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch at which participants ate sufficient to compensate energetically for an omitted breakfast<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In combination, this suggests PYY is more a reflection of nutritional status over the entire day rather than in response to the most recent feeding, consistent with PYY peaking 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after feeding, followed by an elevation lasting several hours<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Leptin concentrations were also greater 3&#x000a0;h after lunch in the breakfast trial. This finding is in accord with the slow response of leptin to feeding, such that increased concentrations relative to the morning fasting trial approximately 6&#x000a0;h after breakfast are likely a product of postprandial glucose and insulin responses to breakfast and lunch<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>44</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It is possible that the diurnal phase of leptin may have shifted in the morning fasting trial such that the usual increase later in the day was delayed. Indeed, postponing food intake from 07.00 to 13.30 hours has been shown to shift the rise in leptin later in the day<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The greater PYY and leptin during the afternoon in the breakfast trial would be expected to contribute to greater satiety at the end of the trial, although there was no difference in subjective appetite between the trials 3&#x000a0;h after lunch. This may be due to the complete lack of ghrelin suppression following lunch in the breakfast trial. This is a particularly unusual result that, to our knowledge, has not been reported previously in lean individuals. As increasing energy content of liquid breakfasts with carbohydrate causes greater reductions in ghrelin<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">

Ghrelin has been associated with meal initiation<sup>(</sup>

An obvious distinction presently is that 3&#x000a0;h after initial feeding, the participants received another carbohydrate-rich meal. This indicates that in the breakfast trial the ghrelin response to the second meal was abolished, with ghrelin following the established time course of a similar carbohydrate load without a second feeding occasion.</p><p>There have been reports that insulin may play an important role in ghrelin suppression<sup>(</sup>

It is conceivable the substantial reduction in insulin concentrations during the afternoon may have contributed to the absence of ghrelin suppression after lunch in the breakfast trial. However, this lack of suppression needs confirmation, and it remains to be seen whether elevated ghrelin following a lunchtime meal as observed translates to greater intake throughout the rest of the day. It has been suggested in a time-blinded study that ghrelin needs to reach a &#x02018;threshold&#x02019; (reported as 93&#x000a0;% of fasting concentrations) prior to meal requests<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. As ghrelin in the morning fasting trial had returned to baseline concentrations 3&#x000a0;h after lunch (the point at which appetite was assessed in the afternoon), this may explain why there was no difference in appetite detected despite greater concentrations of ghrelin in the breakfast trial. In addition, as previously discussed, although ghrelin was greater throughout the afternoon, anorectic hormones were also elevated in the breakfast trial. Finally, it may be that ghrelin concentrations following repeated meals may not be as relevant in signalling hunger as prior to the first/second meal of the day.</p><p>Whilst reduced insulin and glucose concentrations after lunch may be partly explained by the slight reduction 640 (<sc>sd</sc> 1042)&#x000a0;kJ (153 (<sc>sd</sc> 249)&#x000a0;kcal) in lunch intake following breakfast, this is also potentially representative of a second meal effect on glucose<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Evidence that reduced insulin concentrations after lunch were due to the prior meal and not just reduced intake is demonstrated in the eleven individuals who ate similar lunches in both trials (i.e. more in the breakfast trial or intake within 335&#x000a0;kJ (80&#x000a0;kcal) in both trials). Ten of these individuals had reduced insulin concentrations 60&#x000a0;min after lunch during the breakfast trial, with concentrations 68 (<sc>sd</sc> 25)&#x000a0;% of the morning fasting trial, providing evidence of acutely reduced insulin sensitivity following extended fasting.</p><p>Previous studies both support<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, with both studies including a mid-morning preload (i.e. a fixed feeding occasion 90&#x000a0;min before lunch). When this &#x02018;snack&#x02019; feeding prior to lunch is removed and the fast remains unbroken until the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch, Levitsky &#x00026; Pacanowski<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> report that intake at lunch was either unaffected, or was reduced by 728&#x000a0;kJ (approximately 174&#x000a0;kcal), following prescribed 1464&#x000a0;kJ (350&#x000a0;kcal) breakfasts or a self-selected 2611&#x000a0;kJ (approximately 624&#x000a0;kcal) buffet breakfast, respectively. Lunch intake in the present study was only reduced to a similar degree as the larger breakfast in the aforementioned study. Therefore, it appears that any persistent satiating effect of a typical breakfast at lunch is only brought about by breakfast intake of a magnitude that cannot reasonably be matched solely by reduced intake at lunch.</p><p>A limitation of the present study is that without intake data for the remainder of the day after lunch, it is not possible to establish whether further energetic compensation would occur within the 24-h period. However, laboratory work measuring intake following lunch through the afternoon/evening (including snacking opportunities) has not identified greater consumption at any feeding occasion following lunch after morning fasting<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Another potential limitation is that, whilst each individual participant repeated dietary intake for 48&#x000a0;h prior to each laboratory visit, this pre-trial diet was not standardised between participants. While any variance between different individuals would not confound the overall interpretation between trials within this repeated measures design, it could contribute to greater variability in inter-individual responsiveness between treatments, given that an extreme shift in macronutrient composition of an evening meal (i.e. 16 <italic>v</italic>. 62&#x000a0;% energy as fat) can affect next-day metabolic outcomes<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>57</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. However, an additional consideration is that a standardised evening meal would not represent habitual intake for each individual. It should also be noted that appetite sensations were obtained relatively infrequently and this may have reduced our ability to detect differences between trials during the afternoon.</p><p>Future laboratory studies should include further feeding opportunities after lunch while extending metabolic and hormonal measures through the evening to elucidate the role of these physiological responses in influencing feeding throughout the duration of the day after morning fasting. As the first study to report the unexpected response of ghrelin to repeated carbohydrate-rich/high glycaemic index feedings, it is important for further research to replicate these findings and also examine breakfasts of different macronutrient composition and glycaemic index. In addition, due to the suggested appetite suppressive effects of higher protein breakfasts in adolescents<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> and during the morning in adults<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>58</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, the effects of sequential meals on metabolic and hormonal responses following high protein breakfasts should be further examined in adults.</p><p>In summary, while morning fasting was incompletely compensated for at an <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch, prior carbohydrate-rich breakfast consumption increased concentrations of some satiety hormones after lunch but abolished suppression of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. This novel finding may be mediated through reduced insulin response to a second meal and results in similar appetite during the afternoon independent of morning feeding pattern.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to acknowledge assistance provided by Matthew Jeans with elements of data collection.</p><p>The present study was supported by a grant from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BB/H008322/1).
