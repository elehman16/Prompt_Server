Pain is its most prominent symptom. In the absence of pathology suitable for endoscopic or surgical interventions, pain treatment usually includes opioids. However, opioids often have limited efficacy. Moreover, side effects are common and bothersome. Hence, novel approaches to control pain associated with CP are highly desirable. Sensitisation of the central nervous system is reported to play a key role in pain generation and chronification. Fundamental to the process of central sensitisation is abnormal activation of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate receptor, which can be antagonised by <italic>S</italic>-ketamine. The RESET trial is investigating the analgaesic and antihyperalgesic effect of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine in patients with CP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>40 patients with CP will be enrolled. Patients are randomised to receive 8&#x02005;h of intravenous <italic>S</italic>-ketamine followed by oral <italic>S</italic>-ketamine, or matching placebo, for 4&#x02005;weeks. To improve blinding, 1&#x02005;mg of midazolam will be added to active and placebo treatment. The primary end point is clinical pain relief as assessed by a daily pain diary. Secondary end points include changes in patient-reported outcome measures, opioid consumption and rates of side effects. The end points are registered through the 4-week medication period and for an additional follow-up period of 8&#x02005;weeks to investigate long-term effects. In addition, experimental pain measures also serves as secondary end points, and neurophysiological imaging parameters are collected. Furthermore, experimental baseline recordings are compared to recordings from a group of healthy controls to evaluate general aspects of pain processing in CP.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol is approved by the North Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics (N-20130040) and the Danish Health and Medicines Authorities (EudraCT number: 2013-003357-17).

It is a disease characterised by progressive destruction of the pancreatic gland and, as the disease evolves, significant impairment of exocrine as well as endocrine functions takes place. Within 5&#x02005;years of diagnosis, endocrine and exocrine insufficiencies develop in approximately 50% and 80% of patients with CP, respectively. These conditions are usually managed sufficiently with antidiabetic treatment and pancreatic enzymes to optimise metabolic and nutritional status, whereas the treatment of pain in CP is more intricate. This progressive destruction also leads to pain, which is the most common symptom in CP, and up to 90% of patients have chronic abdominal pain, often worsened by acute pain exacerbations typically requiring hospitalisation.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hence, pain is a major burden for most patients with CP and it has been associated with impaired psychosocial functioning, physical disability and decreased life quality.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It is recognised that chronic pain may alter central pain processing, for example, central sensitisation, as the continuous damage of the pancreatic nerves may in time lead to central sensitisation of the pain system. The key component in this process is aberrant activation of the <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The initial analgaesic medication in painful CP will often involve opioids in the absence of pathology suitable for endoscopic or surgical interventions. However, opioid-based analgaesia often only shows limited effectiveness in these patients and it is frequently accompanied by undesirable side effects.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, an NMDA receptor antagonist, for example, <italic>S</italic>-ketamine, could potentially be able to reverse this central sensitisation by its action on the NMDA receptor, thus providing long-term pain relief in sufferers of chronic pain.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><sec id="s1a"><title>Pain mechanisms in CP</title><p>The pathophysiology of pain in CP has yet to be fully elucidated; it is probably of multifactorial origin. Historically, pain treatment has focused on the pancreatic gland, assuming pain to be generated by ongoing pancreatic inflammation, parenchymal hypertension and ductal obstruction. Consequently, treatment was focused on pathology in or closely related to the pancreatic gland. However, there is no direct relationship between abdominal pain and pancreatic morphology, and the experimental evidence supporting this is conflicting.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The most recent explanation model of pain pathogenesis in CP is that recurrent inflammation beyond a certain threshold causes irreversible injury to the pancreatic tissue.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This process of repeated inflammation is linked to continuous damage of the pancreatic nerves along with peripheral and central sensitisation of the pain system. Key to the process of central sensitisation is aberrant activation of the NMDA receptor as described below. An important outcome of central sensitisation is that once the disease has advanced and the neural pathophysiological processes are firmly established, the generation of pain becomes self-perpetuating and independent of the initial nociceptive drive. Consequently, the management of pain becomes difficult and conventional treatment much less effective. This novel and improved understanding of the pain aetiology advocates a paradigm shift in pain management of CP.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title><italic>S</italic>-ketamine and central sensitisation</title><p>Developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic drug, <italic>S</italic>-ketamine is currently used not only as a safe anaesthetic drug, but also as an analgaesic drug in acute and preoperative pain as well as an antihyperalgesic drug in various chronic pain conditions.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The different effects are dose dependent. It is classified as a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, but acts on multiple receptors including opioid receptors.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Hence, analgaesia induced by <italic>S</italic>-ketamine may be partly mediated by actions on opioid receptors; however, the main analgaesia is induced by the NMDA receptor antagonism. Ketamine exists in two distinct stereoisomeric forms, the S-form and the R-form. A racemic equimolar mixture and a pure S-enantiomer are available. The S-isomeric form has a four times higher affinity for the NMDA receptor compared to the R-isomeric form and will be used in the present study.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In anaesthesia, <italic>S</italic>-ketamine provides a dissociative anaesthetic state by blocking the connections between the limbic system and thalamus, while it provides an analgaesic and antihyperalgesic effect when used in subanaesthetic doses. The latter is mainly attributed to antagonism of the NMDA receptor, an excitatory inotropic glutamate receptor located in the central as well as the peripheral nervous system. At resting membrane potentials, the NMDA receptor ion channel is physically blocked by a magnesium ion so that no current flows if glutamate binds to it. Hence, activation of the NMDA receptor by glutamate produces excitation only when this magnesium block is relieved by depolarisation. Prolonged NMDA receptor activation results in removal of the magnesium ion blockade and a progressive increase in neuronal output. With ongoing activity, such activity-dependent sensitisation of central pain pathways ultimately becomes independent of the peripheral nociceptive drive and self-perpetuating. The mechanisms underlying this activity-independent sensitisation involves phosphorylation of different second messenger systems along with alterations in gene transcription. The resulting chronification of pain typically manifests as hyperalgesia and allodynia, which are the clinical hallmark of central sensitisation although not specific for this entity. Central sensitisation of the pain system is well documented in CP and it is increasingly accepted to play a prominent role in its pain pathogenesis.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref></p><p><italic>S</italic>-ketamine exerts its antihyperalgesic effect by restoring the NMDA receptor to its resting state condition through non-competitive antagonism. Thereby the &#x02018;gain&#x02019; of the pain system is restored to normal physiological status. Multiple studies have consistently produced positive results regarding the use of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine in patients with chronic pain. Thus it comprises an interesting remedy to depress central sensitisation and its associated hyperalgesia in painful CP. This was supported by a recent Dutch double-blinded crossover trial designed to evaluate the effect of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine infusion on hyperalgesia associated with CP. Infusion of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine temporarily reversed pressure pain hyperalgesia and the underlying sensitised state of the pain system. This study was, however, not powered or designed for clinical end points.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Experimental testing</title><p>The experimental testing of the study is based on quantitative sensory testing and provides information of the pain on central as well as peripheral levels of the nervous system using controlled external pain stimuli. This evaluation of the sequential activation of the pain systems at different levels provides valuable information regarding the neuroplasticity in a sensitised nervous system. Assessment of experimental pain measures will be employed at baseline, during <italic>S</italic>-ketamine infusion, after 4&#x02005;weeks of treatment with oral <italic>S</italic>-ketamine and at follow-up 8&#x02005;weeks after treatment, to unravel the mechanisms of the underlying antihyperalgesic and analgaesic effects of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine. Furthermore, experimental baseline assessments will be compared to assessments from a group of healthy controls to evaluate general aspects of pain processing in CP.

Moreover, a secretin-enhanced MR cholangiopancreatography will be performed to ensure that patients do not have any pathology suitable for endoscopic or surgical therapy. Next, instruction to all questionnaires will be given and reporting of daily pain intensity in the pain diary will begin.

Furthermore, patients will have a thorough experimental pain examination at this visit (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). Finally, MRI of the brain will be carried out in relation to this visit to assess both functional and morphological entities.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Visit 2</title><p>At the second visit, the biochemical screening from visit 1 will be checked and questionnaires will be reviewed to secure compliance. Resting state EEG, contact heat evoked potentials on the pancreatic viscerotome (Th10) and a control area (Th4), and conditioned pain modulation will be performed before, during and after the infusion of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine or placebo. Fourteen blood samples will be drawn during the infusion in order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine and its metabolites.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Monitoring between visits 2 and 3</title><p>Patients are to be monitored closely during the entire study with frequent telephone interviews. Initially when medication is titrated, participants have 2&#x02013;3 telephone interviews per week to monitor potential side effects and safety and to ensure compliance. During follow-up patients have at least one telephone interview allocated per week.</p><sec id="s2i1"><title>Visit 3</title><p>At the third visit, the experimental tests described for the first visit will be repeated.

Based on a medical judgement, the dose of study drug may be reduced and the treatment continued or the patient may be withdrawn from the study. Follow-up consultations and eventually additional blood tests will be arranged as judged by the investigator.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Discontinuation criteria</title><p>If the participants are not able to tolerate the dose 0.25&#x02005;mg/kg of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine three times per day during the oral phase of the study, they will be excluded. Otherwise, discontinuation will rely on the discretion of each participant. A healthy volunteer who discontinues will always be asked about the reason(s) for discontinuation and the presence of any adverse events. If needed, they will be seen and assessed by the investigator. New participants will replace dropouts.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Dissemination</title><p>Positive as well as negative and inconclusive results of the study will be reported in international peer-reviewed journals in the field of gastroenterology, pain or neurophysiology, and presented at conferences, hence dissemination to researchers as well as to clinicians will be achieved. Participants will be informed of the results of the trial by the investigators. Authorship will be ascribed in accordance with the Vancouver system. After the conclusion, a report will be submitted to the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and the North Denmark Region Committee on Health Research Ethics, as required by law.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Safety considerations</title><p>Some patients may experience nausea and dizziness for a brief period after administration. Moreover, adverse effects such as vivid dreams, nightmares and hallucinations have been described after anaesthesia and analgaesia with <italic>S</italic>-ketamine.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Adverse effects are directly related to the dose used. In the present study, the doses are low and subanaesthetic, and severe adverse effects are unlikely to be seen. Adverse effects are self-assessed using a five-point Likert scale (0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe, 4=very severe/unbearable) and the ESAS questionnaire. In regard to potential abuse of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine, we find the potential benefits in the treatment of chronic pain to outweigh the risk of recreational use of the drug. Almost every eligible participant for the trial are using opioid-based for analgesic purposes. This group of drugs have a large potential for abuse; however, there are no reports of drug abuse amongst the eligible participants. The abuse potential of <italic>S</italic>-ketamine is related to parenteral use and this part of the study will be conducted at the hospital under strict control. Furthermore, a well-known or suspected substance abuse potential such as excess alcohol consumption will lead to exclusion from the trial. Patients will continue on their usual analgaesic medication when the trial ends. This also applies to dropouts.</p></sec><sec id="s2p"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study is powered to detect a minimal difference of 30% between groups on the average pain diary score during 4&#x02005;weeks of study treatment (primary end point). On the basis of an SD of 25% of the mean we determined that a study with 15 patients per group is needed to provide a power of 90%, with the use of a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Hence, the sample size is set at 20 patients per group to allow for possible dropouts.</p></sec><sec id="s2q"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The principal analysis of end points will be by intention-to-treat, meaning that all randomised patients are included in their initially assigned study arm, regardless of adherence to study protocol. Experimental end points will be by per-protocol, meaning that only patients completing the experimental setup are included. The primary end point will be compared between the treatment groups by mixed models, and subsequent analyses directed at the secondary, experimental and safety end points will be analysed using appropriate statistics.</p></sec><sec id="s2r"><title>Data handling and record keeping</title><p>The study is approved by the Danish Data Protection Agency. For each participants , a case report form will be kept in which data for the participants will be entered. Data will be stored under lock and key at Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Aalborg University Hospital, for 5&#x02005;years, under the responsibility of the principal investigator, Professor Asbj&#x000f8;rn Mohr Drewes. All forms will be filled out during (or immediately after) the assessment of a participant and must be legible. Errors will be crossed out, corrections added and, next to the changes, date and initials will be entered. A patient identification list containing patient number, full name, social security number, study medication and treatment codes for all persons included in the study will be created. The list will be populated and updated by a project nurse or other competent person and stored at the same facility. The principal investigator will be required to maintain complete and accurate records to ensure that the execution of the study gets fully documented and the study data can be subsequently verified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JJ, SSO, AEO, AD, OW-S, JLP, AM, JBF and AMD conceived and designed the study and participated in logistical planning of the study.
