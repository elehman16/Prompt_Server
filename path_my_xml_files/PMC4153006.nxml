Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine are commonly administered to reverse NMB at the end of surgery and to reduce the risk of residual paralysis and associated adverse respiratory events
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, these agents may provide slow and unpredictable recovery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and are associated with several unwanted side-effects, both alone and in combination with anticholinergic agents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The selective relaxant-binding agent sugammadex (Bridion&#x000ae;, MSD, Oss, The Netherlands) has been shown to rapidly and completely reverse the effects of the NMB agents rocuronium
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and vecuronium
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, sugammadex is equally effective for reversal of rocuronium-induced NMB under both propofol and sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Sugammadex is marketed for reversal of rocuronium- and vecuronium-induced NMB in over 40 countries worldwide.</p><p>Data on the efficacy and safety of sugammadex in Chinese subjects are required. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate efficacy and safety of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg compared with neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg plus atropine 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg for reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced NMB in Chinese and Caucasian subjects. Key secondary objectives were to show faster recovery from rocuronium-induced NMB with sugammadex vs neostigmine in Caucasian subjects and to demonstrate equivalence in recovery times between Chinese and Caucasian subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study subjects and study design</title><p>This was a randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, safety-assessor-blinded study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>; NCT00825812; protocol P05768), conducted from February to September, 2010.

All subjects were required to provide written, informed consent.</p><p>This study involved Chinese and Caucasian subjects undergoing elective surgery with propofol anesthesia, using NMB with rocuronium. For inclusion, subjects had to be 18&#x02013;64 years of age and of American Society of Anesthesiologists Class 1&#x02013;3. Chinese subjects had to be born in China, have never emigrated out of China and have a Chinese home address. Similarly, Caucasian subjects had to be born in Europe have never emigrated out of Europe and have a European home address.</p><p>Subjects were excluded from the study if they had anatomical malformations expected to lead to difficult tracheal intubation, neuromuscular disorders affecting NMB, significant renal/hepatic dysfunction (as determined by the investigator), (family) history of malignant hyperthermia, allergy to general anesthesia medications, contraindication to study drugs or a clinically significant condition that may interfere with the trial (as determined by the investigator).</p><p>Screening took place&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;days before study treatment administration. Eligible subjects were randomized via a central randomization system. The sponsor produced a computer-generated randomization schedule with treatment codes in blocks, using a validated SAS-based application. The schedule associated each treatment code with a subject number, and subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg or neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg with atropine 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedures</title><p>An intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted for the administration of anesthetic drugs. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with IV propofol according to the clinical needs of the subject. Opioids could be administered according to local practice. Other anesthetic practices, e.g. use of methods such as bispectral index or entropy monitoring for measuring depth of anesthesia, were performed according to routine practices at the study site. Propofol was administered until a train-of-four (TOF) ratio of 0.9 has been established by the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX (Organon Ireland Ltd., a subsidiary of Merck and Co., Swords, Co. Dublin, Ireland).</p><p>After induction of anesthesia but before rocuronium administration, neuromuscular monitoring was carried out using continuous acceleromyography at the adductor pollicis muscle using the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX, in agreement with guidelines for Good Clinical Research Practice in pharmacodynamic studies of neuromuscular blocking agents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Following induction of anesthesia, the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX was calibrated with the built-in calibration modus (CAL 2) after 5-sec 50&#x000a0;Hz tetanic stimulation preceded by a repetitive TOF stimulation for 1&#x000a0;min. After calibration, a 3&#x02013;4-min repetitive TOF stimulation was required before administration of rocuronium to ensure a stable response. TOF stimulation was applied every 15&#x000a0;sec at the ulnar nerve until the end of anesthesia or at least until recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9. Neuromuscular data were collected via an interface to a computer by means of the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX Monitoring Program, version 2.3.</p><p>After the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX had been set up, rocuronium 0.6&#x000a0;mg/kg was administered within 10&#x000a0;sec as a fast-running IV infusion. Tracheal intubation was then performed. Rocuronium maintenance doses of 0.1&#x02013;0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg were given as required throughout anesthesia. After the last dose of rocuronium, at reappearance of second twitch, a single IV dose of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg or a single IV dose of neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg plus atropine 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg was administered to reverse NMB. All doses of neuromuscular blocking agents and reversal agents were administered based on actual body weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the time from the start of administration of sugammadex or neostigmine/atropine to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9. Secondary efficacy variables included time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.7 and 0.8.</p><p>In line with mean data from other studies within the sugammadex clinical trial programme, time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;6&#x000a0;min for a subject receiving sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg was classed as a prolonged recovery time.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Safety assessments were performed by a safety assessor who was blinded to the treatment administered, and included monitoring of adverse events (AEs), vital signs and physical examination. Treatment-related AEs were those AEs considered by the investigator to be related to the study treatment (sugammadex or neostigmine). Risk factors for post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] were assessed at baseline, and the relationship between the number of risk factors and occurrence of PONV during the study was evaluated. Additionally, subjects were assessed for evidence of residual NMB or recurrence of NMB, using both the TOF-Watch&#x000ae; SX and clinical signs.</p><p>In addition to safety assessments during screening and the peri-operative period, further assessments were made at a post-anesthetic visit (10&#x000a0;h after study drug administration, or the day following the operation) and at the follow-up assessment on Day 8.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For regulatory considerations of a new pharmaceutical compound in China, 100 evaluable subjects per treatment group are required. For the primary objective, assuming a maximum drop-out rate of 13%, 115 evaluable subjects were to be enrolled per treatment group across the Chinese sites. It was estimated that this would give a power of at least 95% to demonstrate that recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 after sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg is at least two times faster than after neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg, testing at a significance level of 5% (two-sided), and assuming that the coefficient of variation (CV) in both groups is&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2.2 (based on previous sugammadex studies). For the secondary objectives, enrollment of 30 Caucasian subjects per treatment group was required to ensure a power of 80% to demonstrate equivalence in recovery times between Chinese and Caucasian subjects (assuming a standard deviation of 1.5&#x000a0;min), and a power of 95% to demonstrate at least three times faster recovery with sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg vs neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg in Caucasian subjects (with a CV of 1.1).</p><p>The primary analysis was performed on the full analysis set (equivalent to an intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all subjects who received the randomized study drug and had at least one efficacy assessment. In the event of missing data, values were imputed, using a worst-case scenario for sugammadex
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>For the primary analysis, logarithms of the times from start of sugammadex and neostigmine administration to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9 in the Chinese subjects were compared using analysis of variance on log recovery times adjusted for study site effects. Recovery times are now known to follow an approximately lognormal distribution and thus recovery times were summarized by geometric means and associated 95% confidence Intervals (CIs).</p><p>Data for the secondary objective of demonstrating faster recovery in Caucasian subjects after sugammadex vs neostigmine were analyzed as for the primary objective. For the secondary objective of demonstrating equivalence in recovery times of the TOF ratio to 0.9 between Chinese and Caucasian subjects, analyses were performed using a non-parametric CI approach, which enables a quantitative measure of any differences between the groups. The estimated median difference between the two subject groups and the corresponding two-sided 97.5% CI were calculated using the Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann estimator for treatment effect and Moses for CI of estimated treatment effect. Equivalence in efficacy between Chinese and Caucasian subjects was considered to be demonstrated when the 97.5% CI for the median difference between the groups was within a -1 to +1&#x000a0;min interval.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed for the all-subjects-treated (AST) group, and included all randomized subjects who received a dose of study medication.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Patient disposition and flow (according to CONSORT guidelines) is shown in Figure&#x000a0;

The most frequently reported treatment-related AE was anesthetic cardiac complication (in 11 subjects in total [1% and 0% of Chinese and Caucasian subjects after sugammadex and 5% and 13% of Chinese and Caucasian subjects after neostigmine, respectively]). All subjects with anesthetic cardiac complication were reported to have bradycardia or decreased heart rate. Other frequently reported treatment-related AEs were procedural hypotension (in five subjects in total [16% Caucasian subjects receiving neostigmine and no sugammadex-treated subjects]), and increased upper airway secretion (in six subjects in total [2% Chinese subjects receiving sugammadex and 4% Chinese subjects receiving neostigmine, and not reported in Caucasian subjects]). All AEs related to bradycardia or low heart rate were considered by the investigator to be possibly or probably treatment-related; this included all subjects with anesthetic cardiac complication as noted above, four subjects with procedural complication (three Chinese, one Caucasian, all in the neostigmine group), and one Chinese subject in the sugammadex group who had mild bradyarrhythmia. In total, two Chinese subjects (2%) and no Caucasian subjects in the sugammadex group and nine Chinese subjects (8%) and five Caucasian (16%) subjects in the neostigmine group had at least one bradycardia or low heart rate event.</p><p>Serious AEs were reported for three subjects, all following treatment with neostigmine, and all were considered unlikely to be related to the study drug by the investigator. One Chinese subject experienced incision site hemorrhage of severe intensity. Enterococcal bacteremia and anastomotic leak of moderate and severe intensity, respectively, were experienced by two Caucasian subjects.</p><p>Three subjects (one Chinese and two Caucasian) who received sugammadex and three subjects (all Chinese) who received neostigmine had AEs which were considered by the study sponsor to be potentially related to muscle weakness. Two of these AEs were considered by the investigator to be potentially treatment-related (mild hypoventilation in a Chinese subject who received sugammadex and severe muscular weakness in a Chinese subject who received neostigmine). Four of these AEs were considered unlikely to be treatment-related. The mild hypoventilation was treated with supplemental oxygen and resolved the next day; the subject had received three maintenance doses of rocuronium and a single IV dose of tramadol 100&#x000a0;mg at 3&#x000a0;min before sugammadex administration. The severe muscular weakness (weakness of lower limbs) began 7&#x000a0;h after neostigmine administration and resolved the next day; the subject experiencing this AE received no maintenance rocuronium dose and received a prescribed dose of gentamicin 80&#x02009;000 U at 6&#x000a0;h after neostigmine administration. There was no evidence of residual NMB or recurrence of NMB, either clinically or based on neuromuscular monitoring for any patient.</p><p>Ten Chinese subjects (seven receiving sugammadex and three receiving neostigmine) had AEs considered by the study sponsor to be potentially attributable to drug hypersensitivity (e.g. mild-to-moderate rash, pruritis, facial swelling, facial flushing). All except one of these AEs (moderate rash on chest following sugammadex) were considered by the investigator to be unlikely to be related to the study drug. This subject, who experienced moderate rash on the chest, was treated with diphenhydramine and recovered on the same day. There were no reports consistent with anaphylaxis.</p><p>Events considered by the investigator to be likely reflective of bleeding were reported for eight (7%) Chinese subjects treated with sugammadex (five cases of vaginal hemorrhage, plus a case each of incision site hemorrhage, uterine hemorrhage and occult blood stool), and for 12 (11%) Chinese subjects treated with neostigmine (nine cases of vaginal hemorrhage, one case of incision site hemorrhage, and two cases of melaena). One (2%) Caucasian subject had a bleeding event; this patient experienced post-procedural hematoma after lumpectomy surgery, and was treated with neostigmine. None of these events were considered by the investigator to be related to study medication.</p><p>In total, PONV events were reported for 16 Chinese (13%) and four Caucasian (14%) subjects who were treated with sugammadex and 19 Chinese (17%) and seven Caucasian (23%) subjects who were treated with neostigmine. Each subject had at least one PONV risk factor with the majority of subjects having three risk factors.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This was the first study comparing efficacy and safety of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg vs neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg plus atropine 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg for reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced NMB in Chinese and Caucasian subjects. Neostigmine was chosen as the comparator reversal agent as it is commonly used for NMB reversal in many countries. Atropine was chosen as the anticholinergic agent to reflect current clinical practice in China.</p><p>The main study finding was that recovery to a TOF ratio of 0.9 was significantly faster after administration of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg compared with neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg (geometric mean 1.6&#x000a0;min vs 9.1&#x000a0;min, respectively). Geometric mean time to a TOF ratio of 0.9 in Caucasian subjects was 1.4&#x000a0;min and 6.7&#x000a0;min for sugammadex and neostigmine, respectively, confirming the efficacy of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg for reversal of moderate rocuronium NMB in Caucasian subjects as demonstrated in previous studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, equivalence of efficacy of sugammadex (i.e. time to recovery of the TOF ratio to 0.9) was demonstrated between Chinese and Caucasian subjects.</p><p>The overall safety profile of sugammadex was shown to be favorable, and no serious AEs reported in sugammadex-treated subjects. The most frequently reported AEs were incision site pain, procedural pain and nausea. Importantly, there was no evidence of recurrence of NMB in any patient, either clinically or according to neuromuscular monitoring.</p><p>A higher number of subjects in the neostigmine group had at least one bradycardia or low heart rate event compared with those in the sugammadex group. Bradycardia is a side-effect associated with the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine, although co-administration with an anticholinergic agent would be expected to counteract this
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It should be noted that, in the current study, neostigmine 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg was given together with 10&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg atropine in a ratio ranging from 2.5:1 to 5:1, depending on local practice.</p><p>A total of seven Chinese subjects who received sugammadex and three who received neostigmine had AEs consistent with drug hypersensitivity reactions, although only one of these was considered by the investigator to be possibly treatment-related (moderate rash on chest following sugammadex). None of the drug hypersensitivity reports were consistent with anaphylaxis, and there were no reports of drug hypersensitivity in Caucasian subjects. Low incidences of suspected sugammadex-induced hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in healthy volunteers
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; Merck (Study P07042), data on file, and as post-marketing events in case-reports
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Reported reactions have varied from isolated skin reactions to serious systemic reactions (i.e. anaphylaxis, anaphylactic shock) and have occurred in patients with no prior exposure to sugammadex
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There have also been case reports of allergic drug reactions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and anaphylaxis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] following neostigmine, although these reports are rare.</p><p>Overall, there were a total of 20 (9%) Chinese subjects and one (2%) Caucasian subject for whom, at least one event of bleeding was reported. The incidence of bleeding was higher in Chinese patients, regardless of treatment group, occurring in eight (7%) Chinese patients receiving sugammadex and 12 (11%) receiving neostigmine. Underlying reasons for this are not clear, although may be reflective of differences in surgical procedures. None of the events were considered treatment-related. Of note, while previous Phase I studies demonstrated a prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time (international normalized ratio) in healthy volunteers following sugammadex treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], these effects were not clinically relevant, and sugammadex has since been shown not to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding vs usual care
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>There also appeared to be some general differences between the populations in the safety findings, with 23% of Chinese subjects in both study groups reporting incision site pain but with no reports of this AE for the Caucasian subjects. Such differences may be reflective of the different surgical procedures undergone by the Chinese vs Caucasian subjects. Additionally, while the MedDRA system of coding was used to ensure consistency wherever possible, variations in local practices also may have contributed to observed differences in the incidence of AEs.</p><p>As ethnicity and geographic location may affect the effectiveness and duration of action of drugs, it is important to investigate sugammadex in a variety of patient populations. Differences in drug action between Chinese and Caucasian/white subjects have been previously reported for several drugs,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] with at least some of these differences likely to be due to differences in drug metabolism, e.g. resulting from variations in cytochrome P450 enzymes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Inter-ethnic differences in drug pharmacokinetics may also reflect differences in lipid stores and body stature
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Importantly, the results of the present study have excluded any clinically relevant differences in the effectiveness of sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg in Chinese compared with Caucasian subjects. However, geometric mean times to recovery to TOF 0.9 following neostigmine administration were 1.37 (95% CI 1.05&#x02013;1.78) times longer in Chinese vs Caucasian subjects. This result is statistically significant; however, it is unclear why this difference occurred. While there is no known race effect for neostigmine, Chinese subjects have previously been shown to be more sensitive to effects of atropine vs Caucasian subjects
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and this may have potentially played a role. Furthermore, spontaneous recovery from rocuronium has previously been shown to be somewhat slower in Chinese vs Caucasian patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], with the authors concluding that reasons for the observed interethnic difference were likely to be multifactorial.</p><p>In the current study, Chinese and Caucasian subjects treated with sugammadex had fewer anesthetic cardiac complications than those treated with neostigmine. All AEs termed &#x0201c;anesthetic cardiac complication&#x0201d; were incidences of bradycardia or low heart rate, a well-recognized potential side-effect of neostigmine
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the present study where sugammadex was administered at moderate blockade, a recent study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sugammadex 4&#x000a0;mg/kg when administered at 1&#x02013;2 post-tetanic counts (deep blockade) in Chinese patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], offering further support to the results of the current study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In Chinese subjects, sugammadex 2&#x000a0;mg/kg provided significantly more rapid reversal of moderate rocuronium-induced NMB compared with neostigmine (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).
