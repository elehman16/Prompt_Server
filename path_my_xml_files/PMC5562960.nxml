The primary outcome measure was the rate of change in total functional capacity (TFC) between baseline and end of follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included changes in additional clinical scores, tolerability, and quality of life. Safety was assessed by adverse events and laboratory studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>At 46 sites in North America, Australia, and New Zealand, 553 participants were randomized to creatine (275) or placebo (278). The trial was designed to enroll 650 patients, but was halted for futility after the first interim analysis.

The original design included assessing change in study outcome measures after 36 months of treatment. Due to low enrollment and following review and approval by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), the design was modified in September 2011 to permit follow-up durations of 18&#x02013;48 months and annualized assessment of change. Of 151 participants who completed the originally planned 36 months of treatment, 110 consented to 12 months of extended follow-up.

The primary tolerability measure was study completion on at least 5 g daily. Frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs), changes in vital signs, and laboratory tests served as safety measures. Exploratory measures assessed clinical symptoms (UHDRS subscores), independence, daily function, clinical global impressions, quality of life, caregiver burden, cognition (Hopkins Verbal Learning, Benton Judgment of Line Orientation), biology (plasma creatine, 8OH2'dG,<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and metabolomic markers; huntingtin protein and RNA markers in blood; CAG mutation length [CAGn]), and MRI measures in a subset of 93 participants from 4 sites.

Study personnel, participants, caregivers, steering committee members, and NIH program staff were blinded to treatment assignment until study conclusion. Creatinine elevations were expected since creatinine is the primary metabolite of creatine. All creatinine values after screening were redacted and reviewed by the clinical monitor. Serum creatinine levels &#x0003e;2.0 mg/dL led to dose suspensions, close monitoring, and resumption or discontinuation of drug depending on resolution within 12 weeks. Random suspensions generated by an unblinded statistician were instituted so that suspensions for cause would not be unblinding. Participants were encouraged to remain in the study even after permanent drug discontinuation. A questionnaire assessed blinding of participants and investigators and the reasons for their suppositions.

Participants who were enrolled by December 31, 2011, and on study drug at the end of the original 36-month follow-up phase were eligible to continue for an extra year on their assigned treatment.

Creatinine levels were monitored in real time by the medical monitor and a nephrology specialist was available for consultation. Elevated creatinine levels (&#x02265;2.0) triggered a 2-week suspension. A recheck of creatinine levels was performed every 2 weeks for up to 12 weeks, and study drug was restarted when creatinine returned to the normal range. If, after 12 weeks, creatinine levels had not normalized, participants were referred for nephrology workup.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1-7"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>The primary hypothesis was that participants assigned to creatine would have a reduced rate of decline in TFC compared with controls. The study was originally designed to have 96% power to detect a 25% reduction in the overall rate of TFC decline, approximately 80% to detect a 20% reduction. The revised statistical analysis plan specified power of 84% to detect a 25% reduction and 66% power to detect a 20% reduction. Analyses were conducted in accordance to the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle. The original protocol specified that the primary analysis use an analysis of covariance model for the changes in TFC from baseline to 3 years including terms for baseline TFC, enrolling site, and treatment. To incorporate the protocol modification for variable lengths of follow-up, the primary analysis was changed to compare the mean annualized rates of change in TFC between the 2 groups. These were estimated by a mixed model incorporating adjustments for baseline values and site. Analyses of secondary outcome variables were conducted similarly. Data on the TMS score are also provided since it has been the primary outcome in trials examining progressive motor decline.</p><p>Interim analyses were prespecified for efficacy and futility at 50%, and for efficacy at 75%, of projected study information. Efficacy analyses were based on an O'Brien&#x02013;Fleming &#x003b1;-spending function and the futility analysis used a predictive power criterion. Supportive analyses included changes from baseline to the 1-, 2-, and 3-year time points conducted according to the original analysis of covariance model for those participants with the requisite data. Prespecified subgroup analyses, based on age, sex, and disease severity, were also conducted. Safety and tolerability data were tabulated by treatment group and blindedness questionnaires by participant and investigator. Premature withdrawal rates and times to discontinuation of study medication were compared by the log-rank test. Data from one site (16 participants) were excluded due to Good Clinical Practice concerns identified prior to the interim analysis. This study provides Class II evidence for assessing whether creatine monohydrate is beneficial for slowing functional decline in patients with early symptomatic HD.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Enrollment began in September 2009 and follow-up ceased in December 2014.

The CREST-E cohort was highly representative at baseline for the demographic and symptom characteristics of the individuals with early HD for whom CREST-E was designed. CREST-E did not address the possibility that creatine could be beneficial in prodromal HD. Although CREST-E was well-powered to detect a clinically meaningful beneficial effect of creatine, it failed to demonstrate such an effect in the primary and secondary clinical outcomes. However, a prespecified subgroup analysis of sex revealed a positive trend in male participants and a negative effect in female participants. Sex differences have not been reported in previous clinical studies of HD but have been described in relation to ergogenic and lean body mass effects of creatine and to exercise and sex hormone modulation of creatine kinase.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>Challenges arose in the conduct of CREST-E, which reinforce the need for biomarkers predictive of efficacy, clinical outcome measures that could support more efficient phase III studies, and reducing the burden of study participation. Despite having 46 sites and extensive marketing and outreach, competition with other trials, the wide availability of over-the-counter forms of creatine, and unwillingness to risk placebo assignment inhibited enrollment. This prompted redesign and primary endpoint revision 2 years into the trial and reduced the potential power to detect a small reduction in the rate of TFC decline. Participant and caregiver burden due to the length and complexity of CREST-E contributed to the substantial withdrawal rate. The higher withdrawal rate in the creatine group compared to controls (35% vs 26%) suggested that treatment-related gastrointestinal side effects may have been a factor despite the high proportion of participants reaching the targeted dose range, the allowance of unlimited dose adjustments, and stable body weight.</p><p>Maintaining a blinded study was a concern from the outset and the imbalance in the blindedness questionnaire data at the end of the study indicates that we were not completely successful. Risk of unblinding was mitigated by effective matching of creatine and placebo compounds, by instituting random suspensions to help mask suspensions due to true elevations caused by creatine metabolism, and by redacting potentially unblinding creatinine results, which were only visible to the clinical monitor. Nevertheless, AEs or other factors may have enabled some correct guessing about treatment assignment. Participants concerned about being assigned to placebo could have purchased creatine; however, heightened blood levels in 5/178 placebo participants suggested that such supplementation was rare. 8-OH2DG levels were not useful as a biomarker, largely because baseline levels were only minimally elevated. Expanding community use of antioxidant supplements could have been a factor.</p><p>Finally, while CREST-E proceeded based on earlier human data, the results suggest that animal model experiments may be more valuable for addressing biological aspects of a possible treatment than for predicting clinical efficacy.</p></sec>
