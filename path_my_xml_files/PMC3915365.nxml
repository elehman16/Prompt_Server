None of the treatments is proven clearly superior to others. Hence, the study was planned to compare the efficacy of paracetamol, ibuprofen and paracetamol-ibuprofen combination for treatment of febrile children.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This was an investigator blind, randomized, comparative, parallel clinical trial conducted in 99 febrile children, 6 months to 12 years of age, allocated to three groups. First group received paracetamol 15 mg/kg, second group received ibuprofen 10 mg/kg and third group received both paracetamol and ibuprofen, all as a single dose by the oral route. Patients were followed-up at intervals of 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post dose by tympanic thermometry.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Mean tympanic temperature after 4 h of drug administration was significantly lower in the combination group compared with paracetamol group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05); however, the difference was not clinically significant (&#x0003c;1&#x000b0;C). The rate of fall of temperature was highest in the combination group. Number of afebrile children any time post dose until 4 h was highest in the combination group. Difference between combination and paracetamol was significant for the 1<sup>st</sup> h (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Highest fall of temperature was noted in the 1<sup>st</sup> h of drug administration in all the groups. No serious adverse events were observed in any of the groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Paracetamol and ibuprofen combination caused quicker temperature reduction than either paracetamol or ibuprofen alone. If quicker reduction of body temperature is the desired goal of therapy, the use of combination of paracetamol + ibuprofen may be advocated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>combination therapy</kwd><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>ibuprofen</kwd><kwd>paracetamol</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fever also known as pyrexia or controlled hyperthermia[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] is a common medical sign characterized by an elevation of temperature above the normal range of 36.5-37.5&#x000b0;C due to an increase in the body temperature regulatory set-point.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Fever is common in children and can cause distress, parental anxiety and in some parents &#x0201c;fever phobia.&#x0201d; Rationales for treating childhood fever include relieving distress and lowering temperature, often to reduce the risk of febrile convulsions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Options for treating fever in children include taking cool fluids, dressing lightly, tepid sponging and antipyretics drugs like paracetamol and ibuprofen.</p><p>Both paracetamol and ibuprofen have shown greater efficacy in comparison to placebo[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and ibuprofen superior to paracetamol in the treatment of fever.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Both antipyretics have been found to be equally safe in children.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, literature reviews often conclude that paracetamol should be used preferentially due to a lower risk of adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Ibuprofen has the advantage of less frequent dosing (every 6-8 h vs. every 4 h for paracetamol) and its longer duration of action makes it a suitable alternative to paracetamol.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Paracetamol and ibuprofen exert their effects at differing points in the pyrogenic pathways, so synergistic action is plausible. Parents and health-care professionals treat fever in children by using ibuprofen and paracetamol.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The practice of giving both medicines concurrently as fixed dose combination or separately is widespread, but there is lack of conclusive evidence of superiority of combination over individual drugs.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Currently, the Cochrane systematic review for summarizing the available literature on the efficacy of paracetamol compared to that of ibuprofen and the combination of these two drugs is going on.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hence, this study was planned with the aim of comparing the efficacy of a single dose of paracetamol, ibuprofen and their combination in the treatment of fever in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was investigator blind, randomized, parallel group, multiple arm comparative, single dose trial carried out at Pediatrics department of a tertiary care teaching hospital.

We considered the attrition rate as 10% for the clinical trial based on Lassagna's law[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and hence the final sample size was fixed at 33 patients per group (Total 99).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Age, sex, weight, primary diagnosis, treatment received and detailed history were recorded in Case Record Form for children attending pediatric out-patient department and presenting with fever as one of the presenting symptoms. The participants, who fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria, were admitted to the pediatric ward. The participants were allocated by the un-blinded investigator to one of the three treatment arms as per randomization charts. Randomization sequence was concealed by the un-blinded investigators and drug administration was carried out in the absence of the blinded investigator, who was responsible for the conduct of the study except randomization and drug administration. Based on computer generated randomization, block randomization was used to assign three sequences to 33 subjects in each group in the ratio of 1:1:1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Interventions</title><p>Paracip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Syrup, (Cipla Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) - 60 ml bottle contains 100 mg/5 ml of paracetamol and Ibugesic<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Syrup (Cipla Pharmaceutical Ltd.) 60 ml bottle contains 125 mg/5 ml of ibuprofen. Study drugs were administered as single oral dose after calculating the dose in milliliter - for ibuprofen 10 mg/kg or paracetamol 15 mg/kg or both ibuprofen and paracetamol, with the help of calibrated measuring cylinder with 60 ml of water. The dose of the study drug was repeated if the child vomited within 1 h of administration of the drug. The bottles of the drug were kept at room temperature. Only the un-blinded investigators had access to study drugs.</p><p>The tympanic thermometer is more sensitive in measuring the core body temperature, compared to conventional thermometer and also convenient for the patient due to shorter time required for measurement of temperature.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Hence, the tympanic temperature was measured with the help of a pediatric tympanic thermometer (Swan-DX 6603<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The tympanic temperature was recorded before drug administration and then on an hourly basis till 4 h post dose. We chose 4 h as efficacy end point based on past studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Some children would require repetition of antipyretics at 4 h. Moreover, our primary study objective was the reduction in the tympanic temperature from the baseline temperature at the end of 4 h after drug administration. No rescue medication was used in the trial. Baseline temperature was recorded thrice to ensure precision of the thermometer.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Assessment of outcomes</title><p>Primary end point for efficacy was the reduction in the tympanic temperature from the baseline temperature at the end of 4 h after drug administration.</p><p>Secondary end points were &#x02013; Percent reduction of temperature from baseline to 4 h post dose, proportion of afebrile children at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h post dose, any adverse drug events occurring during the 4 h period as recorded by the investigators and causality assessed with the help of Naranjo's algorithm.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data was analyzed using an analysis of variance for demographic variables and analysis of the primary outcome based on per protocol analysis on valid case set, i.e., set of patients that participated in the study as intended. Time for the temperature to fall to 37.5&#x000b0;C was compared using the log rank test. The number of patients experiencing adverse events and the number of patients whose temperature fell by 1&#x000b0;C or more at 4 h were each compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test.

So far a few trials[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] compared the combination of paracetamol + ibuprofen with these two drugs administered alone. While some of these showed no clinically significant difference between paracetamol, ibuprofen and combined paracetamol ibuprofen treatment,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] a study comparing antipyretic effect of three different treatment regimens in children, using either ibuprofen alone, ibuprofen combined with paracetamol or ibuprofen followed by paracetamol over a single 6 h observation period showed that combined and alternating doses of ibuprofen and paracetamol provided greater antipyresis than ibuprofen alone at 4-6 h.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The Cochrane systematic review for summarizing the available literature on the efficacy of paracetamol compared to that of ibuprofen and the combination of these two drugs is still going on to settle this issue.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hence, this study was planned to compare the antipyretic efficacy of paracetamol, ibuprofen and combined paracetamol ibuprofen in Indian children.</p><p>The reduction of body temperature at 4 h from baseline was 1.48&#x000b0;C for paracetamol, 1.87&#x000b0;C for ibuprofen and 2.19&#x000b0;C for ibuprofen + paracetamol combination. There was statistically significant difference between paracetamol group and combination group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003), but not between paracetamol and ibuprofen group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.102) or between ibuprofen and combination group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.167). This finding is in accordance with the previous study of Erlewyn-Lajeunesse <italic>et al</italic>. who reported a significant difference between the combination group and paracetamol alone but not between the combination group and ibuprofen as well as between the ibuprofen and paracetamol groups at 1 h post dose.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This finding was also reported by Hay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, our study findings differ from the earlier study, which showed a significant difference between combination and ibuprofen group. The difference could be due to longer follow-up after dosing.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A European study[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed single dose ibuprofen produced quicker temperature reduction and also had statistically superior efficacy than paracetamol group at 4<sup>th</sup> h post dose. The same is reported in a systemic review.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the difference in temperature reduction between two groups although statistically significant, was not clinically significant less than 1&#x000b0;C (0.71&#x000b0;C). A study by McIntyre and Hull also reported no clinically significant difference in reduction of temperature between paracetamol and ibuprofen at 4 h post dose.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Moreover, the antipyretic effect of paracetamol started declining earlier compared with ibuprofen or combination of the two. In a recent systemic review by Purssell which analyzed seven randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy or effectiveness of any dose of a combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen, either together or separately, with either drug alone, concluded that there is little benefit from combining paracetamol and ibuprofen.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, our study was conducted before this review was available at a time when controversy about the superiority of combination therapy was still on.</p><p>The highest fall of temperature was noted in the 1<sup>st</sup> h of drug administration in all the groups; in all three groups more than 50% of the total reduction in temperature occurred in the 1<sup>st</sup> h after drug administration. This finding is in accordance with the results of Caraba&#x000f1;o Aguado <italic>et al</italic>., 2005 who found that the maximum rate of temperature reduction was achieved during the first 60 min after drug administration and 1 h post dose fall of temperature noted in the ibuprofen group was significantly greater compared to paracetamol group.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The highest percentage of afebrile patients at any time was observed in the paracetamol-ibuprofen combination group as compared to ibuprofen and paracetamol alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. Percentage of afebrile patients in the ibuprofen group was higher than paracetamol group which is different from the earlier study, which revealed equal number of afebrile children.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>None of the participants suffered from any severe or serious adverse event. All adverse events were mild in severity and having possible or doubtful relation to the treatment and requiring no treatment. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in this respect (<italic>P</italic> = 0.71). This finding is in accordance with the results of previous studies of Perrott <italic>et al</italic>. and Walson <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The safety of paracetamol and ibuprofen combination for multiple dosing may require further studies. Higher percentage of children in the combination group showed improvement in general well-being than paracetamol or ibuprofen groups, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups.</p><p>Wilson <italic>et al</italic>., in their study reported patients with higher baseline temperature show significantly greater fall than patients with lower temperature.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In our study also, the group having baseline &#x02265;39&#x000b0;C showed greater fall in temperature (2.18 &#x000b1; 0.92) compared to the group &#x0003c;39&#x000b0;C (1.69 &#x000b1; 0.94), which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02).</p><p>Out trial was randomized, investigator blinded, a very simple but effective trial design and we had less attrition rate due to scientifically and logistically fair follow-up period. We measured tympanic temperature, which is more sensitive and convenient than axillary temperature. Age for inclusion was kept 6 months-12 years so that wide age groups could be included. The study also evaluated antipyretic efficacy and improvement in general well-being in a way likely to reflect common practice.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>We administered the dose on bodyweight basis but this is not a regular clinical practice. As both drugs are available over the counter, community practice is to administer the drug according to age. We have evaluated effects of a single dose given orally, but the effects of multiple dosing can be different both in terms of efficacy and safety. We compared the combination of paracetamol and ibuprofen with each drug individually as it is a common clinical practice of prescribing combination of these two drugs, pharmacokinetically and pharmacodynamically suitable for concurrent use.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Double blind design would have been ideal but would have been complicated and not likely to be acceptable by participants hence investigator blind design was considered.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>To conclude, this randomized comparative study has shown that paracetamol-ibuprofen combination is statistically superior to paracetamol as antipyretic in children, but not compared to ibuprofen. However, the difference of temperature over 4 h between combination and paracetamol group even though statistically significant, cannot be considered clinically significant (&#x0003c;1&#x000b0;C). Combination of paracetamol-ibuprofen may have marginal clinical benefit over ibuprofen or paracetamol alone in routine clinical practice only when quicker reduction in body temperature is the goal of therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Our sincere thanks to the Dean of the college Dr. Pankaj R.
