However, none of them has become a standard and there is no empirical evidence of comparative evaluation of such methods. This paper brings together GoodOD and OQuaRE. GoodOD is a guideline for developing robust ontologies. It was previously evaluated in a randomized controlled trial employing metrics based on gold standard ontologies and competency questions as outcome parameters. OQuaRE is a method for ontology quality evaluation which adapts the SQuaRE standard for software product quality to ontologies and has been successfully used for evaluating the quality of ontologies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this paper, we evaluate the effect of training in ontology construction based on the GoodOD guideline within the OQuaRE quality evaluation framework and compare the results with those obtained for the previous studies based on the same data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our results show a significant effect of the GoodOD training over developed ontologies by topics: (a) a highly significant effect was detected in three topics from the analysis of the ontologies of untrained and trained students; (b) both positive and negative training effects with respect to the gold standard were found for five topics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The GoodOD guideline had a significant effect over the quality of the ontologies developed.

Their success is based mainly on the provision of a well-structured list of terms that are needed to describe a specific domain. Most ontology development efforts have required not only the participation of ontology engineers but also of domain experts. However, the quality of ontologies varies widely due to absent integration of one or more of such expert competencies <xref rid="pone.0104463-dAquin1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Different kinds of quality indicators of ontologies are affected: structural, logical, correct representation of domain knowledge and coverage.</p><p>As engineering discipline, the ontology development requires the existence and application of methodologies and standards. In the last decades, different processes, strategies, and ontology development methods have been proposed. Among the methods proposed in the nineties we can highlight TOVE (TOronto Virtual Enterprise) <xref rid="pone.0104463-Gruninger1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the Enterprise Model Approach <xref rid="pone.0104463-Uschold1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, or Methontology <xref rid="pone.0104463-Lopez1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. More recently, approaches based on best practices like Ontology Design Patterns (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ontologydesignpatterns.org">http://ontologydesignpatterns.org</ext-link>), principles like the OBO Principles (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.obofoundry.org/crit.shtml">http://www.obofoundry.org/crit.shtml</ext-link>) or guidelines like GoodOD <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> have been proposed.</p><p>Apart from the availability of development methodologies, measuring the quality of the resulting ontologies is necessary in order to monitor to which extent and how good methodologies, practices and guidelines are being applied. Consequently, methods for ontology evaluation have been developed by the ontology community, which can, roughly, be divided into three groups: ontology ranking <xref rid="pone.0104463-LozanoTello1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104463-Tartir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, formal correctness of the ontology contents <xref rid="pone.0104463-Corcho1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104463-Vrandecic1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; and ontology quality frameworks <xref rid="pone.0104463-Gangemi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104463-Evermann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the differences between these groups, many of the approaches share some evaluation instruments like the use of quality models or metrics. Some methods use a gold standard to which the ontology is compared using ontology similarity metrics <xref rid="pone.0104463-David1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0104463-Dellschaft1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Gold standards are an important resource, but they are rarely available, especially for those domains for which new ontologies are developed.</p><p>Another evaluation approach is the use of competency questions, which can be understood as the formulation of ontology requirements as questions, for which correct answers are created by domain experts. A good ontology has to provide the correct answers to these questions with the help of automated reasoning <xref rid="pone.0104463-Fox1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This technique has also been mentioned by ontology evaluation <xref rid="pone.0104463-Obrst1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and construction <xref rid="pone.0104463-Gruninger2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> approaches. The main reason for this is that ontology development and evaluation methods are related. The final report of the Ontology Summit 2013 <xref rid="pone.0104463-Neuhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> proposes a method for developing and evaluating ontologies. The method focuses on the requirements traceability from development life cycle to quality evaluation. Five ontology quality characteristics were identified and combined in a model for ontology life cycle <xref rid="pone.0104463-Neuhaus1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>: Requirements Development, Ontological Analysis, System Design, Ontology Development, System Development and Integration. For each phase of the model, a set of ontology evaluation criteria in terms of competency questions were defined.</p><p>Hence, it can be said that the alignment of ontology construction and evaluation methods is a current challenge that would be an important contribution to the progress in ontology engineering, although there is <italic>only little empirical evidence</italic> for the effectiveness of this approach. Besides, to our knowledge there are no empirical studies that compare different ontology evaluation methods. In this work we will try to make contributions to these areas by analyzing and comparing the results achieved with the GoodOD ontology construction approach <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, which promotes an ontology construction guideline and has been applied to ontology building tasks under lab conditions. We perform the analysis within the ontology evaluation framework OQuaRE and compare the results with the outcome of previous analyses of the GoodOD method <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The ontology quality framework OQuaRE <xref rid="pone.0104463-DuqueRamos1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> addresses the traceability between requirements and metrics. Ontology requirements are traced to quality characteristics, which in turn are associated with quality subcharacteristics. Each subcharacteristic is measured through a set of metrics. At the end, each (sub)characteristic is given a score in the range 1 (worst) to 5 (best). OQuaRE has demonstrated its usefulness for evaluating existing biomedical ontologies <xref rid="pone.0104463-DuqueRamos1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104463-DuqueRamos2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, but its usefulness for evaluating ontologies that had been specifically developed following good practices has not been studied so far.</p><p>The GoodOD <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> guideline for good ontology design focuses on ontology engineering principles in the spirit of the new reference discipline &#x0201c;Applied Ontology&#x0201d;, and methodological principles. This guideline provides a basic understanding required by a user with limited knowledge in logics, computer science or philosophy &#x0201c;to be able to solve ontology engineering problems in a foreseeable and non-arbitrary way&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.org/goodod/guideline">http://purl.org/goodod/guideline</ext-link>). The effectiveness of the guideline was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.</p><p>The objectives of this paper are (1) to employ the metrics of the OQuaRE framework as outcome parameter for the evaluation of the result ontologies derived from the GoodOD randomized controlled trial, and (2) to specify whether OQuaRE is able to provide additional useful information in addition to similarity and competency question based metrics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The OQuaRE quality model</title><p>Ontology quality evaluation and Requirements (OQuaRE) is a framework for Ontology Quality Evaluation, based on the software product quality ISO 25000:2005 named as SQuaRE. The OQuaRE framework defines all the elements required for ontology evaluation: evaluation support, evaluation process and metrics. OQuaRE combines a quality model and quality metrics. It also addresses the traceability between ontology requirements and metrics.</p><p>Currently, OQuaRE includes the quality model which defines a set of quality characteristics such as structural, reliability, operability, maintainability, compatibility, transferability and functional adequacy, for evaluating ontologies. Such characteristics have been adapted from SQuaRE to ontologies except for the structural one, which has been included due to its importance in measuring ontology quality, according to requirements, principles and characteristics of ontologies. Every quality characteristic has a set of quality subcharacteristics associated, which are measured by quality metrics.</p><p>The ontology requirements as such are not defined in OQuaRE but they could be traced to the Quality Characteristics which are presented in terms of the capability of the ontology to fulfill some criteria. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows the OQuaRE model with an example of the traceability from Ontology Requirements to Metrics.</p><fig id="pone-0104463-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0104463.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>OQuaRE framework.</title><p>The left side shows the components of the OQuaRE framework (Ontology Requirements, Quality Model and Quality Metrics) and the right side presents an example of traceability from ontology requeriments to metrics in OQuaRE.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0104463.g001"/></fig><p>The complete description of the OQuaRE quality model is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://miuras.inf.um.es/oquarewiki">http://miuras.inf.um.es/oquarewiki</ext-link>.

The evaluation of a particular subcharacteristic depends on its associated metrics.</p><p>One metric can be associated with one or more subcharacteristics, and therefore may contribute to the score of more than one subcharacteristic. For instance, ANOnto &#x0201c;Annotation properties per class&#x0201d; contributes to knowledge reuse (of functional adequacy) and Redundancy (of structural), because annotation properties represent additional knowledge useful for reusing, so it is more informative and helps to be less redundant. Consequently, ANOnto contributes to Structural and Functional Adequacy characteristics.</p><p>The metrics are presented in different scales. For instance, RFCOnto and ANOnto generate absolute values whereas CROnto and INROnto produce relative values. Hence, in order to measure a quality subcharacteristic, those values are mapped onto the range 1 to 5. This mapping is based on the SQUaRE scores of the quality characteristics and subcharacteristics where values are ranged between 1 and 5. A value of 1 means &#x0201c;not acceptable&#x0201d;, 3 is &#x0201c;minimally acceptable&#x0201d;, and 5 is &#x0201c;exceeds the requirements&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0104463-ISO1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that high values in the metrics might not correspond to a high quality score. For this purpose we apply the recommendations and best practices of the Software Engineering community for software metrics and ontology evaluation metrics.</p><p>Finally, the score of each subcharacteristic is calculated by the weighted average of the scores for its metrics. Likewise, the score of each characteristic is calculated by the weighted average of the scores of its subcharacteristics. The scoring mechanism based on weights provides a flexibility which permits to adapt the method to the need of a particular community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The Good Ontology Design (GoodOD) Guideline</title><p>In the Good Ontology Design (GoodOD) project a guideline was formulated describing principles of good ontology design (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://purl.org/goodod/guideline">http://purl.org/goodod/guideline</ext-link>).

This guideline combines foundations from philosophical ontology and logics, with the representational language OWL DL, and is rooted in the domain top-level ontology BioTop <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The effectiveness of the GoodOD guideline was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in which the performance of ontology developers was compared after specific and unspecific training. As outcome parameters gold-standard based similarity measures <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and a competency question based approach <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> were adopted. The study is described in more detail in the following sections.</p><p>Main results and conclusions from the study were that in the gold-standard based evaluation approach no significant effect of the specific training on the quality of ontologies could be detected. However, these results are not sufficient to conclude that there are generally no effects of the GoodOD principles. With the competency-question based approach a small but significant effect of the guideline-based training over the unspecific training could be shown (about 10% better). However, when analyzed on the level of single topics, a significant effect was measureable only for one topic.</p><p>Due to the high complexity and the educational nature of the study, the results should be carefully interpreted. The small effects of this study do not mean that construction principles should be abolished. They indicate that better evaluation methods must be developed. It is also optimistic to expect that significant training effects can be measured already after a one-week training phase. To our knowledge, the GoodOD study is the only empirical study investigating the effects of construction principles and ontology development guidelines on the quality of resulting ontologies so far.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Design</title><p>In this study the results of a randomized controlled trial are re-assessed by a complementary ontology evaluation framework (OQuaRE) and compared with prior results.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of guideline-based ontology training</title><p>The objective of this trial was to investigate whether guideline-based ontology training has an effect on the performance of ontology developers.

Each student developed 12 test ontologies, six ontologies for the three topics in which they had received specific guideline based training and six ontologies for the three topics in which they only received unspecific training. It should be noted that the assessment of each topic included two different ontology development tasks. The students developed the test ontologies with the Prot&#x000e9;g&#x000e9; ontology editor, so that 12 OWL ontologies were collected from each student in 12 individual OWL files resulting in a total of 288 files.</p><p>The outcome parameter of the study was the quality of the resulting ontologies. The main outcome parameter was the quality of the ontologies measured as the similarity with gold standard ontologies and the secondary outcome parameter was the quality of the ontologies measured with a competency-question based approach.</p><p>In this work, OQuaRE is introduced as a new set of secondary outcome parameters. The authors of the GoodOD study see this extension of outcome parameters, although not declared in the original study protocol, as a legitimate and valuable application of further quality measures on the original research question of the study. For the detailed application of OQuaRE see the next section.</p><p>A<sc>NALYSIS AND</sc> R<sc>EPORTING</sc>: For the calculation of similarity between students' ontologies and gold standard ontologies, a set of gold standard ontologies was developed by the authors of the GoodOD study.

They were expressed in Manchester OWL 2 Syntax as DL axioms. The competency questions were used to check different aspects of the ontologies, such as the correctness of the asserted hierarchy, the correct and exhaustive introduction of disjointness axioms, the correct usage of classes and relations of top-level ontologies and the correct usage of ODPs.</p><p>The reporting of the study follows the CONSORT statement for the reporting of randomized controlled trials <xref rid="pone.0104463-Moher1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>E<sc>THICAL</sc>
<sc>APPROVAL</sc>: Ethical approval was requested from the ethical authority of the University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. The chair of the University of Freiburg ethics committee reviewed the project and concluded that a full formal ethics committee statement was not required due to the educational nature of the study. It was designed according to the general requirements for educational studies at the University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, and was performed with written informed consent of the participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Application of OQuaRE as an outcome parameter of the GoodOD study</title><p>In this experiment, 288 OWL files corresponding to 12 ontologies developed by 24 students were reused. Each ontology was evaluated using a predetermined OQuaRE configuration that will make use of 29 OQuaRE subcharacteristics. The application of OQuaRE was done using a home-made Java tool, which calculates the corresponding scores and returns a score in the range 1 to 5 for each characteristic, subcharacteristic and metric.</p><p>A random selection of ontologies was performed to obtain independent ontology samples with equal sample sizes in each of the 12 combinations of untrained and trained students by topic, balancing the inability of the tool to process all of the 288 OWL files; 6 randomly selected OWL files per ontology from different students were discarded from the study. The process assured that the data contained ontologies from all of the 24 students. Consequently, the final set of data consisted of 216 OWL files corresponding to 12 ontology construction tasks, each one tackled by 18 different students (9 trained, 9 untrained) randomly selected from a set of 24 students, and supplemented by two gold standard ontologies.</p><p>Next, we describe the methodological approach followed to perform the statistical analysis of the data which was done using R packages. Firstly, using data from the evaluation of students' ontologies, a two-way ANOVA model <xref rid="pone.0104463-Everitt1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> with balanced independent samples design was used to identify the effect of the main factor training by topic in each of the 29 OQuaRE subcharacteristics. The interaction mean plot allowed to visualize the effect of the training along the topics and, in the situation where the interaction term was significant, the Student's t-test was performed to analyse the differences between the means of untrained and trained groups.</p><p>Secondly, to compare the gold standard against the students, the mean distances from both untrained and trained students to the gold standard were used. This distance was computed by means of the difference in absolute value of the gold standard measure minus the untrained and trained students observed scores, respectively.</p><p>Additionally, descriptive multivariate analysis was used to analyse the 29 OQuaRE subcharacteristics together. Clustering methods were applied to describe, through internally homogeneous groups of subcharacteristics, the change of those groups from untrained to trained case. Principal Component Analysis was applied to quantify and describe in detail this change.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In this section we present the main results of our data analysis.

The effect of training was not significant for any subcharacteristics in topic SPA. These results provide support to say that the GoodOD training presented important effect over the quality of the developed ontologies for PRO and CME, medium effect for INF, low effect for CLO and IMM and no significant effect for SPA.

To measure the effect of the training over the properties of the ontologies, two different studies were carried out: (1) comparative analysis of the properties of the ontologies developed by untrained and trained students; (2) analysis of the distances of both sets of ontologies with respect to a set of gold standard ontologies. Additionally, the subcharacteristics have been ordered and classified according to the respective distances to the gold standard solutions.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Comparison with previous evaluations of the GoodOD guideline</title><p>Our research objectives were inspired by the work presented in <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Consequently we compare the present results with these two studies. We first analyzed the effect of training over the quality of the ontologies. In <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, the evaluation was based on competency questions metrics and found an effect of training for two topics, PRO and CME, and the differences were significant only for the first one. In our study, we have analyzed the effect of the training for 22 subcharacteristics, where the effect of topic by training interaction was significant. The effect was highly significant for six subcharacteristics in INF, 11 in CME and 17 in PRO. Additionally, in this last topic, ontologies developed by trained students were more homogeneous than the set developed by untrained ones. Hence, both studies draw similar conclusions.</p><p>Second, we have tested whether the ontologies developed by trained students were closer to the gold standard than those developed by the untrained ones were. In <xref rid="pone.0104463-Boeker2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, a set of similarity measures of the ontology artifacts revealed that the ontologies developed by trained students were not significantly more similar to the gold standard than those developed by untrained students. Our findings reveal that there is a significant effect of training with respect to the gold standard (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104463-t004">Table 4</xref>), in both negative and positive directions for PRO, IMM, CLO, CME and INF. SPA did not present significant differences from trained neither untrained students to the gold standard. Additionally, the classification and sorting of subcharacteristics showed that students reached values more similar to the gold standard after training with respect to 19 subcharacteristics, whereas their results were less similar to gold standard after training with respect to the 10 other subcharacteristics (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104463-t006">Table 6</xref>). Such conclusions were drawn for PRO, IMM, CLO, CME and INF, which are highly correlated in pairs and with the first component (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g006">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, SPA is uncorrelated with the rest of the topics, behaving differently for both untrained and trained cases. After training, 18 subcharacteristics reached in SPA values more similar to the gold standard and 11 were less similar.</p><p>Consequently, we believe that these results permit to say that OQuaRE is able to capture the findings of the previous GoodOD evaluations, which was one major objective of this work.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Findings in the ontologies produced by the students</title><p>A second objective was to study what additional information OQuaRE could provide about the quality of the ontologies developed and the effectiveness of GoodOD. According to our results, the GoodOD training had a significant effect on 59% of OQuaRE subcharacteristics and therefore on the quality of the ontologies developed by the students, and these differences were identified between ontologies developed by specific training and those without it.</p><p>Mean values for ontologies developed by untrained students and trained students, and for the gold standard ontologies were similar and high for seven subcharacteristics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The highest quality scores were obtained for Tangledness for all topics except for PRO, in which Tangledness obtained a better value after the training. These subcharacteristics are associated with the general training of the GoodOD guideline, which seems to have been effective.</p><p>In general terms, Tangledness and Modification Stability obtained the highest positive effects of the training. The ontologies developed after the training presented less multiple inheritance and were more stable for changes in their classes, properties and terms. This effect might be due to the training of the GoodOD guideline, where a quality criterion is to construct ontologies in a way that multiple parenthood is inferred and not asserted.</p><p>Additionally, Recoverability, Cohesion, Availability and Replaceability obtained the most negative effects of the training. Such subcharacteristics are associated with the dependence between ontology classes.</p><p>More findings can be described when focusing on specific topics. Comparing the data for PRO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104463-t004">Table 4</xref>, training had a significant effect on all the Maintainability subcharacteristics: Analysability, Changeability, Modification Stability, Testability and Reusability. Such differences might be induced by the training. A similar conclusion may be drawn for the rest of the subcharacteristics for which the training effect was significant. It should be noted that the most notable evidence of the effect of training is the homogeneity of the results of the trained students compared to those of the untrained students (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>For CME, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0104463-g004">Figure 4</xref>, shows the effect of the training on subcharacteristics such as Redundancy, Control Vocabulary, Availability, Recoverability, Adaptability, Replaceability, Learnability and Knowledge Acquisition. Thus, the scores of the ontologies from trained students are more similar to the gold standard than those from untrained students.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0104463-t006">Table 6</xref>, the largest difference between the gold standard and mean values for untrained and trained students was found in two subcharacteristics: (1) <italic>Redundancy</italic>, which is the capability of the ontology to be informative; and (2) <italic>Controlled vocabulary</italic>, defined as the capability of the ontology to avoid heterogeneity of the terms. Both subcharacteristics are related to the number of annotations per class. We have found that ontologies of trained students included annotations for less than 10% of the classes, whereas the gold standard included them for almost 100%. For topics SPA, INF and CME, untrained students presented lower values than trained ones for those subcharacteristics. This means that training had a positive effect with respect to those specific subcharacteristics. For topics PRO, IMM and CLO, the training effect was negative. This might be due to the annotations created by the students before and after the training. Although finding an explanation for such behaviour is out of the scope of this work, we believe that such information would provide an interesting feedback for further developments and applications of the GoodOD guideline.</p><p>These findings lead to the conclusion that OQuaRE is able to provide fine-grained information about the quality of the ontologies because of its organization in quality characteristics and subcharacteristics.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Limitations and Future Work</title><p>As it has been aforementioned, due to technical limitations, we have not been able to work with the complete original dataset. Consequently, the study was designed to reduce potential biases. Our design was based on independent samples with equal sample sizes to use an F statistic in the ANOVA analysis less sensitive to the eventual non-compliance of the normality and homocedasticity hypotheses of the sample. In a different situation, we would have needed to test the hypotheses the ANOVA model is based on and to deal with the non-uniqueness of the solution.</p><p>The current version of OQuaRE lacks a module for the definition of a set of Ontology Quality requirements which would permit a more direct traceability between competency questions and quality metrics, allowing the measurement of the ontologies from the development phase. Additionally, we are working on including new axiom-based metrics in the framework. Besides, new experiments involving both OQuaRE and GoodOD would permit a coordinated evolution of approaches for guiding the construction of the ontologies and to evaluating those ontologies.</p><p>It should be noted that neither the OQuaRE metrics nor the GoodOD methods are meant to be sufficient for a full picture of the quality of an ontology, even when combined. Nevertheless, the work that we present in this paper is one of the very first efforts to combine different methods and our results suggest that it is a promising way to proceed. We aim at extending our approach with new metrics and combining our results with other ontology quality approaches; a possible candidate for such an extension could be the measurement of the cognitive quality of ontologies <xref rid="pone.0104463-Evermann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, which could also be included as part of the OQuaRE measurements. This approach proposes a method for evaluating the relationship between a cognitive conceptualization and an explicit specification, but assumes that the quality of an ontology is relevant and useful only in relation to that of another ontology. Consequently, it might provide additional information for studying similarities between the gold standard and the students' ontologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, OQuaRE was used to evaluate the quality of a set of ontologies developed using the GoodOD guideline for good ontology design. The quality of the ontologies was previously measured a competency-question based approach and the measurement of the similarity to gold-standard ontologies. A comparison of OQuaRE with the two previous evaluations was done.</p><p>OQuaRE results showed a significant difference in terms of quality between untrained and trained students for three topics. Additionally, compared to the gold standard, training resulted in both positive and negative effects on five topics. OQuaRE was able to draw similar conclusions as the original GoodOD evaluations, and to provide specific results such as correlations between different topics, the set of subcharacteristics affected by training, and the differences, by subcharacteristics, among ontologies developed by untrained and trained students and gold-standard ontologies.</p><p>Summarized, GoodOD and OQuaRE can be used together to take advantage of their respective strengths to develop and evaluate ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the very first studies that attempts to compare and combine independent ontology development and evaluation methods. We believe this to be an important contribution to the progress of the ontology engineering community.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0104463-Hepp1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Hepp M (2008) GoodRelations: An Ontology for Describing Products and Services Offers on the Web.
