Since the original trial, many large-scale translations around the world, including Finland, Australia, China, and India, have successfully reduced onset of diabetes among patients with prediabetes and/or predictors like weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">To gain an overall perspective of the effectiveness of diabetes prevention studies, Balk et al. conducted a review of 53 studies (72% of which were randomized controlled trials), evaluating 66 combined diet and physical activity programs (41% of which were based on DPP), and concluded that such programs are effective in reducing incidence of diabetes, body weight, and FPG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Programs varied widely in design: ranging from 3 to 72&#x000a0;months in duration and from no contacts (virtual contacts only) up to 72 contacts with participants. The review concluded that more intensive programs appeared to yield more positive outcomes, but there was little insight into how other program characteristics may contribute to outcomes. Since these studies focused on patient outcomes, they also provided no insight into how to successfully implement these interventions. Aziz et al. partially filled this gap with their systematic review of 38 studies with the goal of identifying factors leading to successful implementation of DPP in &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] using the penetration, implementation, participation, and effectiveness (PIPE) impact metric. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows the distribution of program characteristics for eight dimensions and two outcomes: a wide range of program designs and durations have been implemented within clinical and community settings around the world. Across this diverse array of studies, two thirds reported low participation and 42% reported low weight loss (&#x0003c;4.6&#x000a0;kg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both reviews by Aziz et al. and Balk et al. concluded that more intensive programs may enhance weight loss outcomes. However, Aziz et al. stress that even modest weight loss can have significant population-level impact if a high proportion of high-risk individuals participate in the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This broader view of impact is essential for policy- and other decision-making.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>DPP characteristics reported by Aziz et al.&#x02019;s systematic review.

</p><p id="Par24">Kahn and Davidson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] highlighted the dearth of real-world confirmation of the remarkable clinical outcomes reported by the original DPP study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The Balk et al. review of DPP-like programs reported significant reduction in diabetes incidence (0.59; 95% CI, 0.52&#x02013;0.66, based on 16 (30%) of 53 studies that reported this outcome) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Aziz et al. reported &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;high&#x0201d; risk reduction for 7 (18%) of 38 studies; this outcome was &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; for the remaining 31 (82%) of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The low proportion of studies reporting these clinical outcomes may indicate potential reporting bias toward positive results; on the other hand, these downstream effects are more challenging to assess within clinical settings outside of highly controlled lengthy clinical trials. Despite the &#x0201c;voltage drop&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] often seen in outcomes within real-world settings, definitive guideline statements have been disseminated recommending DPP around the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite large-scale population-based availability of DPP in some countries (Finland being a notable leader [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]), within other countries, access to DPP is limited, in part because of the expense, lack of reimbursement by insurance or funding entities, and challenges of effectively implementing DPP across diverse uncontrolled settings and populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Within the USA, interest in implementing DPP is increasing because the US Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) plans to reimburse participation expenses for eligible individuals starting in 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; over 1000 programs were listed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) registry of certified programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] as of November 2016 compared to 500 in May 2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">In the USA, recognition status by the CDC Diabetes Prevention Recognition Status (DPRP) requires at least 50% of participants to have a diagnosis of prediabetes based on blood testing (or have documented history of gestational diabetes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], though risk assessments, administered by short surveys, are also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. When eligible individuals are identified, outreach is needed to encourage participation in DPP and often clinical testing is used to verify diagnosis. Thus, significant challenges remain: designing and reliably executing robust approaches to identify, enroll, and engage individuals at high risk for diabetes.</p><p id="Par26">Within VA, the national policy office responsible for prevention efforts, the National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP), commissioned a pragmatic trial to demonstrate impact and feasibility of implementing DPP (VA-DPP) in VHA, in the context of the already existing MOVE!&#x000ae; weight management program (MOVE!) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. This clinical demonstration was conducted in three geographically diverse medical centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Candidate participants included patients with prediabetes (HbA1c 5.7&#x02013;6.4% or FPG 100&#x02013;125&#x000a0;mg/dL) who lived within 60&#x000a0;min of a demonstration site, were obese (BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m2) or overweight (BMI 25&#x02013;30&#x000a0;kg/m2) with diagnosis of an obesity-related condition (e.g., hypertension, diabetes), and attended a MOVE! orientation session. Eligibility criteria were confirmed clinically; participants who did not have a HbA1c or FPG within prior 6&#x000a0;months were invited to have HbA1c screening, which is aligned with CDC DPP and national care guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Patients for whom anti-glycemic medication (including metformin) was documented within their electronic health record in the last 6&#x000a0;months and those with contraindications to uptake of intensive lifestyle change were excluded.</p><p id="Par27">VA-DPP characteristics are indicated in comparison to the Aziz et al. review in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

VA-DPP also had higher rates of participation, e.g., 42.5% completed at least eight sessions compared to 31% for MOVE!. Neither VA-DPP nor MOVE! resulted in changed HbA1c compared to baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]; this trial was not powered to examine differences in diabetes incidence.</p><p id="Par28">This evaluation was guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework, which was designed to inform translation of evidence-based programs into practice and heighten public health impact by examining impact on domains beyond clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. RE-AIM includes five domains: (1) Reach, the proportion of the targeted population willing to participate in the intervention; (2) Effectiveness, the impact of the intervention on key outcomes; (3) Adoption, the proportion of organizations and individuals within organizations who are willing to initiate the intervention within their setting; (4) Implementation, the fidelity and cost of delivery at the setting level; and (5) Maintenance, the extent to which the intervention is sustained over the longer term at the setting and individual levels.

Briefly, costs of implementing VA-DPP were estimated for two categories: (1) recruiting participants and implementing VA-DPP and (2) conducting VA-DPP sessions. VA-DPP coordinators and coaches at each site recorded time spent on a range of tasks: recruitment, administrative tasks, team meetings, session preparation, and session delivery. Total recruitment time was multiplied with per-minute wage rates to derive site-specific total cost. Total costs were divided by the number assessed and enrolled per site to derive per participant enrollment cost. VA-DPP sessions included costs of the labor inputs and participation rates associated with each group session. Appropriate per-minute wage rates were applied to the aggregated activity times. For delivering sessions, labor cost was divided by the number of participants who completed each session.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p id="Par38">The following sections describe facets of the RE-AIM domains that were evaluated, including quantitative measures of delivery fidelity, participant satisfaction, and implementation costs.

Overall, 11% were women and 48% were a racial/ethnic minority. The only demographic differences between VA-DPP and MOVE! participants were related to race/ethnicity; there were higher proportions of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white VA-DPP participants, but a lower proportion of Hispanic participants (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).

None of the sites achieved their recruitment goal due to several barriers.</p><p id="Par40">A process to systematically identify individuals with prediabetes did not exist prior to VA-DPP implementation (Negative Compatibility). However, MOVE! had an existing obesity screening and referral process in place; VA-DPP recruitment relied on the MOVE! referral process. However, clinician referrals to MOVE! were lower than expected in all three sites. First, although health promotion and disease prevention was a high priority in VHA, clinicians felt they had limited time to discuss weight management and diabetes prevention with their patients. Patients frequently presented with multiple chronic and acute conditions which were a more immediate medical priority (Negative Relative Priority).<disp-quote><p id="Par41">They don&#x02019;t have time for [prediabetes], you know, they&#x02019;re having a hard-enough time just dealing with the [patients with] out of control diabetes] [&#x02026;], it&#x02019;s the old story about when you&#x02019;re killing alligators, it&#x02019;s hard to drain the swamp (Provider).</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par42">Second, some clinicians did not believe behavior modification programs were effective for their patients and were reluctant to refer patients (Negative Evidence Strength and Quality).<disp-quote><p id="Par43">I&#x02019;ve heard one physician who&#x02019;s pretty vocal at the meetings say, &#x0201c;[MOVE!] doesn&#x02019;t work, they re-gain the weight anyway.&#x0201d; A couple of physicians have said that actually. &#x0201c;Bariatric surgery&#x02019;s the only thing that works.&#x0201d; So I don&#x02019;t know that they even believe that a lifestyle program can work, and frankly some of our participants do well but a lot don&#x02019;t (MOVE!

</p><p id="Par44">Third, primary care clinics at the three sites were overwhelmed by the major reorganization to align with VA&#x02019;s version of PCMH (Negative Relative Priority). Fourth, one site had no formal MOVE! referral process and instead, patients were advised by their primary care and specialty providers to schedule a MOVE! orientation visit during the check-out process. This may have reduced one barrier (not requiring a provider referral) but introduced another when patients did not follow up (Negative Compatibility).</p><p id="Par45">In addition, determining eligibility to participate in VA-DPP required a lab or point-of-care (POC) HbA1c or FPG test. One site had a POC testing procedure in place while another changed their electronic health record (EHR) to prompt clinicians to order an HbA1c test if they referred a participant to MOVE! (Positive Compatibility). The third site did not have either process in place; VA-DPP team members used a relatively labor-intensive process that involved evaluation based on EHR data or ordering a new HbA1c lab test for willing individuals (Negative Compatibility).</p><p id="Par46">Lastly, the percentage of individuals referred to MOVE! with prediabetes was lower than expected; prevalence rates for normal glycemic status, prediabetes, and diabetes were 43% (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;796), 22% (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;404), and 28% (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;504), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

Furthermore, VA-DPP session times were determined by available space, not by convenience for participants (Negative Available Resources). Although site directors signed an MOU, mid-level managers were largely disengaged and did not help teams resolve hiring or space issues (Negative Leadership Engagement). Lastly, VA-DPP coaches often struggled to cover all the content specified in the DPSC facilitation guides within hour-long sessions (Negative Design Quality and Packaging).

</p><p id="Par70">Within VA, the usual care MOVE! weight management program can prevent incidence of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. It is a relatively low-intensity program with no diabetes risk assessment. The present study evaluated a higher intensity intervention based on a CDC-recognized structured curriculum targeted to individuals with clinically verified prediabetes. This trial shows that having national and local leaders who are committed to diabetes prevention is a necessary, though far from sufficient, condition for successful implementation within a large healthcare system.</p><p id="Par71">Reaching and engaging target populations is a universal challenge for comprehensive lifestyle programs across settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. There was relatively high participation in this trial (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>); more participants assigned to VA-DPP attended at least one session compared to participants assigned to MOVE!. In addition, unlike most behavioral intervention studies, which tend to over-represent non-Hispanic whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], 48% of VA-DPP participants identified as a racial/ethnic minority (compared to 25% of national VHA users) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] and 11% of VA-DPP participants were women (compared to 8% of national VHA users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]). Robust referral processes and networks to identify and engage participants at high risk are essential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Once high-risk individuals have been referred, scheduling sessions at locations and times that are convenient to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] or offering online programming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] may help bolster participation.</p><p id="Par72">The single largest investment incurred for the VA-DPP demonstration was the total average $40,348 per site to assess eligibility and implement the program. In the current study, new clinical processes had to be designed and adapted to each local setting to accomplish the required clinical testing of HbA1c or FPG levels. Several countries have administered short self-assessment risk instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Individuals at high risk are then encouraged to enroll in a nearby community-based DPP-like program. The later the risk is identified, the more intensive the intervention should be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The current study used more intensive risk identification based on clinical testing that relied on preexisting obesity treatment referral processes already in place. This approach may have resulted in later risk identification and contributed to the smaller than planned sample size but may justify the more intensive DPP. Number of referrals was lower during the demonstration period than in the years leading up to the demonstration, perhaps because of other organizational priorities during that time (e.g., implementation of PCMH during the demonstration) and there was an unexpectedly high prevalence of patients who already progressed to diabetes, especially compared to the general VHA patient population (43 vs. 25%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. This illustrates the potential missed opportunities to identify and engage high-risk individuals <italic>before</italic> they progress to diabetes. Additionally, VA-DPP relied on primary care physicians to refer patients; however, there were cases where physicians did not believe in the effectiveness of lifestyle change programs for their patients.</p><p id="Par73">Few studies report the extent to which DPP is delivered as designed, though stated use of a standard curriculum is a recognized contributor to greater weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. The current study assessed fidelity of delivery. Though ratings of characteristics of the coaches delivering each of the programs (VA-DPP and MOVE!) were comparable (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), VA-DPP had higher fidelity ratings for delivery of educational content, goal setting, review of goal progress, and group cohesion. Reinforcing this finding, VA-DPP participants reported higher satisfaction for six of eight program characteristics compared to MOVE!. Together, program differences in fidelity ratings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and participant satisfaction helped to identify factors that may explain higher participation rates for VA-DPP compared to MOVE!, as well as more weight loss for VA-DPP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] at least in the short term. It is not clear what contributed to higher delivery fidelity for VA- DPP compared to MOVE!; specific characteristics of DPP as well as more recent training of DPP coaches may have contributed to this difference. Although there were no statistical differences in effectiveness of VA-DPP versus MOVE! at 12&#x000a0;months (3.4 vs. 2.0&#x000a0;kg lost, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]), the lack of statistical difference between groups may be in part due to the smaller than planned sample size.</p><p id="Par74">The challenge of evaluating implementations of complex behavior change programs like DPP is well-recognized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Use of a theoretical framework provides concepts and language that can be expressed consistently across diverse studies to aid comparisons and build knowledge about complex implementation processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Based on current findings, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> posits relationships between contextual factors and domains of RE-AIM based on common barriers and facilitators to VA-DPP implementation. These relationships are offered as hypotheses that require testing in other settings and within larger-scale implementations. Multi-faceted strategies that address multiple domains of context are needed to implement DPP in a way that maximizes outcomes within each RE-AIM domain (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par75">Though DPP has been shown to be cost-effective, including when delivered in a community setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], health system and policy decision-makers will not implement programs like DPP without first knowing the upfront investment and ongoing delivery costs. Costs to deliver VA-DPP sessions averaged $101 per session. In the current study, attendance was highly variable across sites, across cohorts within each site, and across sessions within each cohort. While the average cost per participant per session was $46 ($1012 for 22 sessions) for VA-DPP, this cost could be as low as $12 per participant per session ($264 for 22 sessions), if the lowest-cost site ($1410) had the highest observed level of participation (119). This cost range was lower than cost reported for the original DPP (estimated costs of $1399 per person in the first year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] and are similar to those of a YMCA group-based DPP (estimated costs between $275 and $325 per person in the first year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In addition, administrative tasks related to preparing for each VA-DPP session, such as reminding participants to attend and planning the session, which averaged $328 per participant in the current study, must also be considered when allocating staff resources.</p><p id="Par76">It is important to note limitations in this evaluation. First, only three academically affiliated VHA sites participated; therefore, implementation experiences reported may be unique to their respective settings. In addition, the study occurred during an organizational transformation to the VA&#x02019;s model of PCMH within the primary care clinics, which may have contributed to lower than expected number of referrals. Second, fidelity ratings may be biased positively because they were determined by VA-DPP coordinators/coaches who rated their peers. However, this bias may be present for both programs because VA-DPP teams worked closely with MOVE! teams. It is important to note that comparison of ratings for VA-DPP and MOVE! was limited to a sample of program sessions and delivery components at these sites and not a comprehensive rating for all aspects of all sessions. Third, this effort was done as part of an effectiveness-implementation hybrid trial. National partners contributed funding for the clinical teams at each of the three facilities and did not assess diabetes incidence or clinical measures of cardiovascular disease or risks. When funding ended, two of the three sites were not able to maintain the program or continue screening for prediabetes. A strength of this study was that partners and local leaders deemed local activities, including eligibility screening, delivery of VA- DPP, and outcome assessments as part of a clinical quality improvement (QI) initiative that required no additional assessments for research purposes. Patient satisfaction was elicited via surveys funded by research. IRB approvals included use of data collected through local clinical QI activities. Fourth, an economic evaluation of usual care was not completed and intervention impacts on blood pressure and blood cholesterol were not assessed. Costs were estimated for eligibility screening, implementation, and delivery of only DPP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par77">The comprehensive qualitative and quantitative findings from this pragmatic trial of VA-DPP reveal barriers and facilitators that influence overall program success. Findings suggest a number of strategies that may help support future real-world implementations of DPP, including gaining visible support from system and local leaders, highlighting the evidence base and benefits of DPP for key stakeholders including referring clinicians, and providing sufficient time and resources for high-quality staff training. As the need and demand for DPP increases, it is important to recognize, address, and leverage implementation process and contextual factors that contribute to maximum success of DPP.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p id="Par5">Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p id="Par6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CFIR</term><def><p id="Par7">Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMS</term><def><p id="Par8">Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPP</term><def><p id="Par9">Diabetes Prevention Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPSC</term><def><p id="Par10">Diabetes Prevention Support Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHR</term><def><p id="Par11">Electronic health record</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FPG</term><def><p id="Par12">Fasting plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HbA1c</term><def><p id="Par13">Glycosylated hemoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MOU</term><def><p id="Par14">Memorandum of understanding</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCP</term><def><p id="Par15">National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCMH</term><def><p id="Par16">Patient-centered medical home</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POC</term><def><p id="Par17">Point-of-care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE-AIM</term><def><p id="Par18">Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance framework</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA</term><def><p id="Par19">Veterans Affairs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA-DPP</term><def><p id="Par20">Veterans Affairs Diabetes Prevention Program</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VHA</term><def><p id="Par21">Veterans Health Administration</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank all of the leadership, coaches, and staff members within the multiple organizations who were involved with this study: VHA National Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (NCP), VA MOVE!, VA HSR&#x00026;D, VA Diabetes QUERI, Diabetes Prevention Support Center, VA Ann Arbor Center for Clinical Management Research (CCMR), Durham VA Medical Center, VA Baltimore Medical Center, VA Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, and VA Minneapolis Healthcare System.
