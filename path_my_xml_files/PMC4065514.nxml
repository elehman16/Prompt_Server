Postoperative ocular inflammation is a local response that begins immediately after surgical trauma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Corticosteroids have been used systemically, regionally, and topically to reduce the ocular inflammatory response after various types of ophthalmic surgeries, including pars plana vitrectomy (PPV).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Topical steroids are known to cause elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP), with possible development of glaucoma and infrequent optic nerve damage, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and delayed wound healing. Although systemic effects are extremely uncommon, there have been rare occurrences of systemic hypercortisolism after the use of topical steroids.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Nepafenac is the first prodrug ophthalmic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) formulation approved for use in the treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation after cataract surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nepafenac itself has little activity on the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) enzyme activity and requires deamination to the more active congener amfenac, for therapeutic action. The theoretical advantage offered by nepafenac over other existing NSAIDs is in corneal penetration. However, the expected therapeutic advantage of nepafenac, based on its corneal permeability profile and absorption, is not fully recognizable in the comparative assessment of clinical anti-inflammatory efficacy. Significantly reduced postoperative inflammation and pain seen with topical nepafenac may positively affect patient outcome, by increasing compliance with the postoperative procedures, positioning, and administration of medications.</p><p>Several prospective, randomized, clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of topical NSAIDs in inhibiting miosis,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reducing postoperative pain and inflammation,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] preventing cystoid macular edema (CME),[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and improving visual recovery after cataract surgery.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Topical ketorolac (0.4%)[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and topical nepafenac (0.1%)[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] are found to be safe and effective in reducing pain and inflammation in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery. Naithani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have conducted an investigator-masked, randomized study to evaluate the effect of topical nepafenac on intraocular inflammation, pain, and postoperative macular edema, in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery. They have compared the effect of nepafenac to a placebo group as an adjunct to the regular prednisolone eye drops.</p><p>Side effects and complications, such as, transient burning, stinging, and conjunctival hyperemia with NSAIDs are mild and uncommon. There are rare reports of the development of superficial punctate keratitis, corneal infiltrates, epithelial defects or corneal melting, which can be avoided with proper dosing and vigilant use of these drugs.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The aim of this prospective, randomized, double masked, single center study, is to compare the efficacy of postoperative topical nepafenac (0.1%) with prednisolone acetate (1%) as anti-inflammatory agents in eyes undergoing TSV.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study protocol adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval for the trial was taken from the local Ethics Committee and all the participants signed a written informed consent. A total of 80 eyes of 76 patients were investigated in this study.</p><p>All eyes that underwent TSV between January 2009 to December 2010, for macular hole, epiretinal membrane, vitreomacular traction, and vitreous hemorrhage with attached retina on a USG B-scan, were included in the study. Cases having retinal detachments, those that required port conversion and suturing of port, re-surgery, pre-existing uveitis, those who had received intravitreal triamcinolone or anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections within three months of surgery, and cases requiring silicone oil for tamponade or buckling were excluded. Patients requiring cataract surgery along with vitrectomy were also excluded.</p><p>The participants were randomized to the postoperative topical nepafenac (0.1%) group or topical prednisolone acetate (1%) group in a double-masked fashion by a computer-generated randomization schedule. Cases receiving nepafenac formed Group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 40) and cases receiving topical prednisolone acetate formed Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 40).</p><p>All cases were operated on the Alcon constellation vision system by the same surgeon (M.N). All cases completed the three-month follow up. The subjects were asked to grade the ocular pain on the visual analog scale.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The VAS consisted of a 10-cm line, with 0 on one end representing no pain and 10 on the other representing the worst pain ever experienced. A subject marked on this line to indicate the severity of his or her pain experience. The VAS was filled up by the patients on Day 1, Day 30, and Day 90. Intraocular inflammation was graded on each visit by an investigator, masked to the study group (S.L.), using the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature Working Group grading classification. According to this classification, less than one cell (in a 1 mm<sup>2</sup> field illuminating the anterior chamber) is taken as grade 0, 1 to 5 cells as grade 0.5, 6 to 15 cells grade 1, 16 to 25 cells as grade 2, 26 to 50 cells as grade 3, and more than 50 cells as grade 4. Lid edema was graded as follows: Minimal swelling with lid creases visible was grade 1, moderate swelling with skin creases affected was grade 2, marked swelling when eye lids could be opened actively was grade 3, and extreme swelling when eyelids could not be opened actively was grade 4. Conjunctival chemosis was taken as grade 1 if it involved 30% of the conjunctiva, grade 2 if it involved 30-70% of the conjunctiva, and grade 3 if it involved 70-100% of the conjunctiva. Conjunctival hyperemia was graded as grade 0 for no hyperemia, grade 1 for sectoral engorgement of vessels, grade 2 for diffuse engorgement, and grade 3 for significant engorgement.</p><p>Best corrected visual acuity was obtained on Snellen Visual acuity charts at each visit.</p><p>Subjects self-administered the drops in both the groups, with group 1 receiving nepafenac (Nevanac, Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, Texas, USA) three times in a day for six weeks and group 2 receiving Pred Forte (Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA, U.S.A.) beginning six times a day for week one and four times a day till week four, two times a day for week five, and once a day for week six. All the patients received prophylactic antibiotics for four weeks and atropine sulfate 1% HS for a week. All the patients also received a diclofenac sodium 100 mg suppository preoperatively and diclofenac sodium 50 mg tablet postoperatively twice per day, for five days.</p><p>The descriptive statistics were calculated for case characteristics. Group comparisons were performed with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, using the two-sided analysis. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant. Snellen visual acuity was converted to logMAR units for analysis purposes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>Seventy-six patients undergoing small gauge vitrectomy, who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.

Topical NSAIDs appear more effective than topical steroids in re-establishing the blood-aqueous barrier, as quantitatively measured with anterior ocular fluorophotometry.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study by Miyake <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] nepafenac was found to be more effective than fluorometholone in preventing angiographic CME and blood aqueous barrier disruption, and the results indicated that nepafenac led to more rapid visual recovery. Lane <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] also, in a prospective randomized double-blinded study, showed an unequivocal reduction in post cataract surgery pain and inflammation in patients receiving topical nepafenac.</p><p>Our study demonstrates the safety and efficacy comparison of nepafenac 0.1% versus prednisolone acetate 1%, as topical anti-inflammatory agents, in eyes undergoing small gauge vitrectomy. We randomized the patients into two groups and followed up for a minimum of three months.</p><p>We assessed anterior chamber inflammation, conjunctival hyperemia, conjunctival chemosis and lid edema in both the groups on days one, 30, and 90. After thirty days there was no difference noted in relation to the above-mentioned parameters of inflammation in both groups. In another study by Naithani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] patients given nepafenac had significantly less intraocular inflammation on day one, postoperatively, as compared to those who received placebo drops. However, in this study the drops were started three days preoperatively in both the groups and were given in addition to topical prednisolone. Our study eliminates the variable of adjunct steroid drops used as a postoperative regimen.</p><p>We followed the standard procedure of staining the hyaloid with triamcinolone in all cases, except the cases of non-resolving vitreous haemorrhage. This was an intraoperative step and the drug was not left behind as a depot in any case. We agree that few crystals could have remained behind and could perhaps have had a role to play in reducing inflammation, but both the groups had an equal number of patients (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05), who received triamcinolone during surgery. Hence, the groups were well-matched regarding this variable.</p><p>Patients operated under general anesthesia were also given a peribulbar block. Both the groups had equal percentage of patients with peribulbar block and general anesthesia (with peribulbar block) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, this factor should also not play any major role in affecting the results.</p><p>In our study, there was reduction in the pain scores in both the groups after 30 and 90 days. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the pain scores between both the groups. Naithani <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found that individuals put on nepafenac were statistically significantly less likely to have postoperative eye pain than those in the placebo group.</p><p>This study suggests that topical nepafenac is possibly non-inferior to prednisolone acetate in postoperative management following transscleral sutureless vitrectomy. It may be particularly considered for cases that are known steroid responders. It may also be of benefit for early tapering of steroid drops in the postoperative period. Thus, it may be a complementary drug, in addition to a steroid, while tapering them earlier and also an alternative in cases where steroids may be contraindicated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
