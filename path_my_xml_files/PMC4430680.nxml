The role of radiotherapy (RT) in the management of prostate cancer significantly changed over the last few decades with developments in brachytherapy (BT), external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). One of the challenging factors of radiotherapy treatment of localized prostate cancer is the development of acute and late genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicities. There are several studies and case series published in the literature assessing the toxicities developed during EBRT and brachytherapy treatment for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Background for Study</title><p>EBRT and brachytherapy emerged as the mainstays of localized prostate cancer treatment in recent years. Brachytherapy can be delivered either in low-dose rate (LDR) or in high-dose rate (HDR). The low-risk, localized prostate cancers can be treated with low-dose brachytherapy or by prostatectomy, whereas the intermediate and high-risk localized prostate cancers are usually treated with EBRT alone or in combination with HDR brachytherapy (HDR-BT). HDR monotherapy in this patient group is not routinely practiced unless as part of a study. Radiation dose escalation has been proven to be effective in biochemical response and clinical outcomes in prostate cancer. However, increased toxicity limits the total dose of radiation that can be safely administered [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Combining external beam radiotherapy with a brachytherapy boost has been effective in tumor control, allowing for significant dose escalation without any change in acute and late toxicities in comparison to external beam radiotherapy alone [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The relative sensitivity of radiotherapy depends on the alpha/beta ratio. This ratio expresses the sensitivity to radiation fraction size and estimates the impact of the given radiation schedule on tumor control and toxicity. There is increasing evidence to support the alpha/beta ratio for prostate cancer to be as low as 1.5 Gy. The evidence indicates that a hypofractionated radiation schedule&#x02014;larger dose per fraction with smaller number of fractions&#x02014;would offer optimal tumor control [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. As a result, the practice of combining EBRT with HDR brachytherapy is gaining momentum in clinical practice. However, the current practice across the globe differs in both radiation doses and in the timing of each modality delivered.</p><p>The recent European guidelines suggest that there is no consensus regarding the timing of HDR brachytherapy and EBRT. The schedules vary in different institutions where an HDR boost can be given either before or after EBRT. Few centers deliver HDR in between the fractions of EBRT [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The EBRT doses range from 37.5 Gy in 13 fractions (2.88 Gy per fraction) to 45 Gy in 25 fractions (1.8 Gy per fraction) when given with HDR. The total HDR brachytherapy dose can be delivered in fractions, however a single dose of 15 Gy is gaining acceptance across the world due to its logistical advantage [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The time gap between the two radiotherapy modes of delivery is generally within 21 days.</p><p>The toxicity profile of radiation therapy is dependent on the type of modality used to deliver the treatment, and whether the treatment is delivered as a combined modality or standalone treatment [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A randomized phase III trial where EBRT was delivered before HDR showed that the 5- and 7-year incidence for patients with any severe urinary symptom was 26% and 31%, respectively, for those treated with EBRT and HDR-BT delivered sequentially. For patients given EBRT alone, the 5- and 7-year incidence was 26% and 30%, respectively (log rank <italic>P</italic>=.5). The incidence of severe bowel events for the EBRT/HDR combination group was considerably lower&#x02014;7% and 6% at 5 and 7 years, respectively (log rank <italic>P</italic>=.8) [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. On the other hand, a single-arm phase II study was performed to determine the toxicity profile of EBRT delivering a dose of 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions that was given after a single-fraction HDR boost of 15 Gy. In this study, Morton et al found acute grade 2 and grade 3 genitourinary toxicity in 62% and 1.6% of patients, respectively, and acute grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity in 6.5% of patients, with no grade 3 gastrointestinal toxicity [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Both acute and late toxicity assessments in prostate cancer patients are assessed by various tools. For example, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Cancer Patients (EORTC QLQ-C30), the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire for Prostate Cancer Patients (QLQ PR25), the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grading system, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P), version 4, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), the International Index of Erectile Function Scale (IIEFS), and the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC) questionnaire may be used for toxicity assessments. Furthermore, the same data collection tools are used to measure health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Rationale and Risks/Benefits</title><p>There is no consensus about the timing of HDR brachytherapy when treating prostate cancer along with EBRT. The advantages of using HDR brachytherapy before EBRT are that patients could potentially be identified who are not suitable for brachytherapy early in the treatment process. As the patients would be radiotherapy na&#x000ef;ve, there would be less chance of soft tissue injury during the brachytherapy process if BT is given first. However, having brachytherapy first can be logistically difficult in a busy radiotherapy unit in terms of planning and arranging delivery of EBRT within 2 to 3 weeks of BT. Moreover, if the patients develop acute urinary complications during brachytherapy they would need to continue with EBRT with a urinary catheter, which could potentially prolong the duration of the catheter in situ and cause significant patient discomfort.</p><p>On the other hand, delivering EBRT first is logistically easier to arrange and could theoretically make the hypofractionated radiation dose of brachytherapy more effective, as tumor cells could become more radiosensitive due to molecular changes having been induced by EBRT. However, normal tissue damage due to delivery of EBRT first could make the brachytherapy procedure difficult with increased risk of toxicity. It is, therefore, essential to know whether there are any significant differences in toxicities and treatment outcomes, especially acute urinary toxicity among the two treatment approaches.</p><p>This randomized feasibility study will look at the treatment arms according to the timing of HDR brachytherapy&#x02014;either before or after EBRT&#x02014;and their toxicity profiles. The study is called Timing of HDR brachytherapy with EBRT in Prostate CAncer (THEPCA). Assessment of acute and late toxicities and other parameters in these two arms at various time points will enable appropriate sequencing of EBRT and HDR therapy resulting in an optimal level of reduced toxicity. The treatments from both arms will be delivered with standard planning techniques. The incidence of grade 3 genitourinary toxicity is 1.6% in this cohort of patients [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, this feasibility study will also explore the challenges of image-guided radiotherapy planning between the two study arms. Provided a significant difference between the two treatment arms is achieved following final analysis, consideration will be made to use this to inform the development of a further pivotal study to look more deeply into the toxicity and other parameters related to the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Objectives</title><sec><title>Primary Objective</title><p>The primary objective of this study is the prospective assessment of genitourinary toxicities related to the treatment sequence of HDR brachytherapy and EBRT.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary Objectives</title><p>The secondary objectives of this study are to assess treatment outcomes, including biochemical response and survival, prospective assessment of gastrointestinal toxicities according to the treatment sequence of HDR brachytherapy and EBRT, and assessment of radiotherapy planning challenges, including image-guided radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary and Secondary Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of this study is the presence of grade 3 genitourinary toxicity in patients. The secondary endpoints of this study are the presence of all other grades of genitourinary toxicity (ie, grades 1 and 2), the presence of gastrointestinal toxicity (ie, grades 1 to 4), prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival, overall survival, and quality of life (QoL).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>This study will be a randomized, two-arm trial in which intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer patients are treated with both HDR brachytherapy and EBRT.

ARCTU uses the Trans European Network ALEA (TENALEA) randomization service provided by the Trans European Network for Clinical Trial Services. This is an Internet-based randomization system, which will be set up for the study by ARCTU in accordance with the protocol. It will be a simple 1:1 ratio randomization, which will only be possible if a participant meets the inclusion criteria and not the exclusion criteria. The system stores the predetermined sequence of randomization&#x02014;this list is not visible to the investigator or to the Anglia Ruskin Clinical Trials Unit. Once a patient has consented to take part in the trial, they will be randomly allocated to either Arm A or Arm B. The research nurse or investigator will log onto the Web browser application and enter the patient&#x02019;s eligibility and stratification factors into the system. The study arm allocation is then returned to the investigator and to selected members of ARCTU and the study team. Please refer to the study scheme diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Baseline Procedures</title><p>The following baseline procedures will be performed: physical examination, measurement of vital signs, and assessment of QoL baseline (IPSS, IIEFS, FACT-P, CTCAE questionnaires), hematology, biochemistry, concomitant treatment (eg, androgen deprivation therapy [ADT]), and PSA.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment Modalities</title><sec><title> Brachytherapy Procedure</title><p>The brachytherapy procedure will be carried out at the surgical theaters in Southend University Hospital. The steps are as follows:</p><p>1. Patients will undergo prostate implantation under general or spinal anesthetic using a transrectal ultrasound-guided transperineal technique.</p><p>2. Imaging according to local practice using ultrasound, CT, and/or MRI will be undertaken.</p><p>3. The clinical target volume for prostate (CTVp) is defined by the prostate capsule and is extended to include any extra capsular or seminal vesicle disease. A volumetric expansion of 3 mm constrained to the rectum posteriorly is then added&#x02014;this defines the planning target volume (PTV).</p><p>4. Catheter reconstruction and dwell time definition is then undertaken to provide a treatment plan for approval by the treating clinician.</p><p>5. Treatment is delivered once an optimized plan has been approved.</p><p>6. After completion of treatment in the brachytherapy room, the implant catheters and urinary catheter are removed&#x02014;no anesthesia is required for this procedure.</p><p>7. The patient will return to the ward and may be discharged home later the same day or the following day.</p></sec><sec><title>Dose Prescription</title><p>A dose of 15 Gy will be given in a single treatment exposure defined at 100% isodose, which is the minimum tumor isodose to cover the PTV. PTV recommendations are as follows: the minimum dose received by 90% of PTV (D90) should be &#x02265;15 Gy, and the volume of the target area receiving 100% of the prescribed dose (V100) should be &#x02265;95%.

If the patient has to undergo urinary catheterization for relieving blockage symptoms while undergoing EBRT and should not proceed further with HDR.</p><p>2. Any other unforeseen toxicity developed during RT treatment, and as a consequence the patient is unable to finish the protocol treatment.</p><p>The withdrawn patients will be followed as per protocol up to the end of year 1 from the time of completed treatment. With ongoing consent, patients should remain in the trial and be followed up according to the protocol visit schedule.</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal of Consent</title><p>Patients may withdraw their consent to participate in the trial at any time. If the patient explicitly states their wish not to contribute further data to the study, the investigator should inform the coordinating center in writing and the withdrawal of consent should be documented by the investigator in the patient&#x02019;s case report form (CRF). However, data up to the time of consent withdrawal will be included in the data reported for the study.</p><p>Although the participant is not obliged to give the reason for withdrawing their consent, this information will help ascertain any trends related to trial procedures and may influence the protocol development in future projects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Laboratory Tests</title><p>All laboratory tests will be taken as per the standard of care within the local pathology department at Southend University Hospital National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust. Tests include full blood count (FBC), liver function tests (LFTs), urea, electrolytes, and PSA.</p><p>The samples will be collected by the trial nurse, labelled and logged in the CRFs, processed according to the local standard operating procedures (SOPs), and the results will be recorded in the CRFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacovigilance</title><sec><title>General Definitions</title><sec><title>Adverse Event</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant to whom a medicinal product has been administered, including occurrences which are not necessarily caused by, or related to, that product. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended sign, including an abnormal laboratory finding, symptom, or disease temporarily associated with study activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious Adverse Event</title><p>A serious adverse event (SAE) fulfils at least one of the following criteria: (1) is fatal&#x02014;results in death (NOTE: death is an outcome, not an event), (2) is life-threatening, (3) requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, (5) is a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or (6) is otherwise considered medically significant by the investigator.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Investigator&#x02019;s Assessment</title><sec><title>Seriousness</title><p>The chief investigator (CI) or principal investigator (PI) responsible for the care of the participant, or in his absence an authorized medic within the research team, is responsible for assessing whether an event is serious according to the definitions given above.</p></sec><sec><title>Causality</title><p>The investigator must assess the causality of all serious adverse events in relation to the trial treatment according to the definitions given above.</p></sec><sec><title>Expectedness</title><p>The investigator must assess the expectedness of all SAEs according to the definitions given above. If the SAE is unexpected and related, then it needs immediate reporting.</p></sec><sec><title>Severity</title><p>The investigator must assess the severity of the event according to the following terms and assessments. The intensity of an event should not be confused with the term &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; which is a regulatory definition based on participant/event outcome criteria.</p><p>1. Mild: intensity of an event is mild if some discomfort is noted, but without disruption of daily life.</p><p>2. Moderate: intensity of an event is moderate if discomfort is enough to affect/reduce normal activity.</p><p>3. Severe: intensity of an event is severe if it causes a complete inability to perform daily activities and lead a normal life.</p></sec></sec><sec><title> Notification and Reporting of Adverse Events or Reactions</title><p>If the AE is not defined as <italic>serious</italic>, the AE is to be recorded in the study file and the participant is to be followed up by the research team.

The measures should be taken immediately. In this instance, the approval from the licensing authority prior to implementing these safety measures is not required. However, it is the responsibility of the CI to inform the sponsor and main research ethics committee&#x02014;via telephone&#x02014;of this event immediately.</p><p>The CI has an obligation to inform the main ethics committee <italic>in writing within 3 days</italic>, in the form of a substantial amendment.

There will also be an assessment of trends in the scores over time using a repeated measures analysis of variance on the four follow-up scores, with the baseline score as a covariate. Prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with a test for the difference between the survival curves using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards multiple regression will also be used to assess the effects of covariates on survival. For this feasibility study, this analysis will be carried out after the end of the follow-up at 12 months, whereas for a main study a longer follow-up period would be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Endpoints</title><p>As the primary endpoint is concerned with adverse events, this will be a central concern of the primary endpoint analysis as described above&#x02014;the analyses will be carried out after the end of the follow-up at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Size</title><p>In this feasibility study, the sample size has not been determined according to statistical principles, but is the number judged to be suitable for evaluating the suitability of the processes and procedures of running the study, and for assessing the patient experience and adherence in the study. To this end, two samples of 25 patients&#x02014;50 overall&#x02014;will be randomized to the two treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Although the sample size will be small, there will nevertheless be attempts to analyze the data in the same way as would be the case for a main study. However, this might not always be possible depending on the pattern of the outcomes and missing values. For descriptive statistical summaries, continuous data will be summarized using means, medians, standard deviations, interquartile ranges, and ranges. Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages. All statistical significance testing will be at the 5% significance level. For the IPSS and IIEFS scale scores, the two means at each of the follow-up assessments will be compared using a two-sided permutation <italic>t</italic> test using 1,000,000 random permutations, and the 95% confidence limits for the difference between the means will be calculated using a bootstrap method using 9999 resamplings. There will also be an assessment of trends in the scores over time using a repeated measures analysis of variance on the four follow-up scores with the baseline score as a covariate.</p><p>For categorical data based on adverse events, percentages will be compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. In this small study it will be possible to carry out the full combinatorial calculations for Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, whereas in a main study, 10,000 random permutations will be obtained in a Monte Carlo approach. For differences between percentages, the 95% confidence limits will be obtained using Newcombe&#x02019;s Hybrid Score Interval method. For the secondary analysis, prostate-specific antigen relapse-free survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with a test for the difference between the survival curves using the log-rank test&#x02014;the <italic>P</italic> value will be obtained using a permutation test with 10,000 permutations. Cox proportional hazards multiple regression will also be used to assess the effects of covariates on survival, with model comparisons carried out using likelihood ratio tests.
