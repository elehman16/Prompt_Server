Neuropsychological evidence reported dissociations between cognitive and affective components of social cognition. Here, we tested whether performance on social cognitive and affective tasks can be modulated by transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). To this aim, we compared the effects of tDCS on explicit recognition of emotional facial expressions (affective task), and on one cognitive task assessing the ability to adopt another person&#x02019;s visual perspective. In a randomized, cross-over design, male and female healthy participants performed the two experimental tasks after bi-hemispheric tDCS (sham, left anodal/right cathodal, and right anodal/left cathodal) applied over DLPFC. Results showed that only in male participants explicit recognition of fearful facial expressions was significantly faster after anodal right/cathodal left stimulation with respect to anodal left/cathodal right and sham stimulations. In the visual perspective taking task, instead, anodal right/cathodal left stimulation negatively affected both male and female participants&#x02019; tendency to adopt another&#x02019;s point of view. These findings demonstrated that concurrent facilitation of right and inhibition of left lateral prefrontal cortex can speed-up males&#x02019; responses to threatening faces whereas it interferes with the ability to adopt another&#x02019;s viewpoint independently from gender. Thus, stimulation of cognitive control areas can lead to different effects on social cognitive skills depending on the affective vs. cognitive nature of the task, and on the gender-related differences in neural organization of emotion processing.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>Data are from the present study whose authors may be contacted at the correspondence address.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>Data are from the present study whose authors may be contacted at the correspondence address.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social cognition refers to the different psychological processes enabling individuals of the same species to interact with one another; such interaction essentially relies on perception of &#x0201c;social signals&#x0201d;, such as facial expressions, eye gaze and body posture [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Primates, and especially humans, are able to mentally represent what might be going on in others&#x02019; minds through high-level processing of such social signals.</p><p>In recent years, many imaging studies investigated the neural correlates of understanding others&#x02019; mind, a process known as mentalizing or theory of mind [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Different experimental tasks (requiring judgments on facial expressions, stories or moving shapes) consistently demonstrated the activation of a set of regions that include anterior medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, the superior temporal sulcus and the adjacent temporo-parietal junction [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Activity in these domain-specific neural structures devoted to processing relevant cognitive and affective cues is modulated by domain-general control areas, such as the lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Recent neurofunctional studies showed that lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in cognitive control of emotional information conveyed by facial expressions [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or complex scenes [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, Zaki et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] required participants to draw inferences about the emotional states of another person based on congruent or incongruent social cues (facial expressions and contextual signals; e.g., person&#x02019;s smiling while describing an upsetting event). Results showed that conflicting social cues implied activation of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The right lateral prefrontal cortex seems to be particularly involved in processing emotional facial expressions [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but the debate is open on whether a right hemispheric predominance exists for processing all emotions, irrespective of their valence [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], or whether the two hemispheres preferentially process different emotions, being the left hemisphere dominant for positive emotions and the right dominant for negative ones (the valence theory) [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>A different line of research underlined the role of the lateral prefrontal cortex in cognitive control over social, non-affective situations in which one had to take another person&#x02019;s point of view (visual perspective taking) [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Neuroimaging data showed stronger lateral prefrontal cortex activation for other person&#x02019;s perspective compared with self-perspective judgments [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; in particular, it has been suggested that when judging another&#x02019;s perspective the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) cortex inhibits one&#x02019;s own perspective selectively [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, in a study in which participants were required to select between competing visual perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], Ramsey et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that the right DLPFC is involved in selecting the appropriate viewpoint by inhibiting the irrelevant perspective in a viewpoint-independent manner. These findings are consistent with previous neurophysiological and neuropsychological evidence showing that right lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in resolving conflicts between perspectives [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>From the data reviewed above it could be inferred that lateral prefrontal cortex exerts a cognitive control over both cognitive and affective facets of social cognition, but some recent neuropsychological evidence reported dissociations between these two components of social cognition [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On the same line, inhibition of right DLPFC by 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) speeded-up response times on a task assessing cognitive mentalizing abilities, but did not significantly modify performance on an affective task [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This result would support the cognitive/affective dissociation in the domain of social cognition, but left open the issue of the role of lateral prefrontal cortex in mentalizing tasks.</p><p>Several lines of evidence demonstrated that these social cognitive abilities can be shaped by gender. For instance, females generally perform better (in terms of both accuracy and processing speed) than males in recognizing emotional facial expressions [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, gender seems to affect the way in which an individuals understand others&#x02019; point of view, with females employing cognitive strategies different from those adopted by males [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Although gender is recognized as a major source of individual differences in processing specific social signals, such as facial emotional expressions [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], it is still not clear whether gender also modulates domain-general control processes of social cognition. Moreover, it is worth remembering that there is some evidence showing that male and female participants react differently to electrical brain stimulation (for instance see [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Since the effects of brain stimulation are dependent on the baseline cortical activity and activation of specific neural circuits, it has been suggested that differences in gender-related patterns of baseline brain activation could partly account for different responses to tDCS in males and females [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of the aforementioned considerations, we aimed to clarify whether the lateral prefrontal cortex exerts domain-general or domain-specific control over processing of cognitive and affective aspects of social cognition, and whether gender can shape such control processes. To these purposes, we compared the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over DLPFC in male and female healthy volunteers who were required to process social cues in two tasks: one affective task, tapping explicit recognition of emotional facial expressions, and one cognitive task, assessing the ability to adopt another person&#x02019;s visual perspective. In the affective task participants had to label the six basic emotions, i.e., happiness, fear, anger, disgust, surprise and sadness, conveyed by faces from the &#x0201c;Pictures of Facial Affect&#x0201d; set [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In the cognitive task, participants had to explicitly code the left-right location of a target object in a scene from their own (self) or the actor&#x02019;s (other) perspective [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]; the actor acted, gazed or acted/gazed toward a target object in the scene. In this task, healthy participants provide a higher number of responses anchored on the actor&#x02019;s position (altercentric responses) when observing the actor grasping the target; this effect is likely related to the activation of simulation processes [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] that instead cannot be activated in individuals affected by autism spectrum disorders [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used a bi-frontal tDCS that can reliably modulate high-level executive control [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In particular, Fecteau et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] showed that the bi-frontal stimulation over DLPFC significantly modified participants&#x02019; decision making behavior whereas unilateral tDCS stimulation yielded no effect. The authors suggested that tDCS exerts its strongest influence by altering the relative balance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices: a cross-hemisphere interplay would play a crucial role during decision making and would be interfered with by the bilateral tDCS [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The idea of cross-hemispheric interplay and of reciprocal inter-hemispheric inhibition has been proposed also to account for the effects produced by TMS stimulation over the DLPFC on theory of mind tasks [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Analogously, recent tDCS studies assessing the role of DLPFC on processing emotional [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and identity [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] information conveyed by faces adopted a bi-frontal stimulation paradigm, assuming that increasing activation in one hemisphere and decreasing activation in the other can led strong behavioral effects.</p><p>Data reviewed above suggest that the right lateral prefrontal cortex is particularly involved in processing affective information and in dealing with conflicting visual perspectives. On this basis, we could hypothesize that anodal (activating) stimulation of the right hemisphere coupled with cathodal (inhibiting) stimulation of the left hemisphere has strongest modulatory effects on social cognitive and affective abilities than the opposite stimulation pattern. On the basis of evidence showing gender related differences on social cognition, we could expect a differential effect of tDCS in males and females [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], but available data do not allow to make precise predictions about its direction.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixteen healthy right-handed participants (age-range 22&#x02013;30; 8 male) were enrolled for the study.

For sham stimulation, the electrodes were placed at the same positions as for active stimulation, but the stimulator was only turned on for 20 s; participants thus felt the initial itching sensation associated with tDCS but received no active current for the rest of the stimulation period.</p><p>An off-line stimulation paradigm was used since previous work suggests that effects are more robust than on-line stimulation, at least for anodal stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

Results showed that in males, but not in females, explicit recognition of fearful facial expressions was significantly faster after anodal F4/cathodal F3 stimulation with respect to anodal F3/cathodal F4 and sham stimulations. In both males and females, instead, anodal F4/cathodal F3 stimulation negatively affected the tendency to adopt another&#x02019;s point of view when the onlooker observed the actor reaching for the target object in the visual perspective taking task.</p><p>Previous neuromodulation studies suggested a preeminent role of the left DLPFC in processing facial expressions, although with some mixed results. In tasks requiring conscious or unconscious processing of emotional faces, Van Honk et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] reported that low frequency, inhibitory rTMS over the right DLPFC increased selective attention to fearful faces, but only when facial expressions were consciously processed, likely due to enhanced activity of the contralateral, left prefrontal cortex. In a tDCS study, Vanderhasselt et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found that anodal stimulation over the left DLPFC enhanced performance for positive but not for negative faces in a task in which participants had to identify the word corresponding to or opposite to an emotional facial expression. In the same vein, Nitsche et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] used bi-hemispheric tDCS and compared anodal, cathodal and sham stimulation over the left DLPFC during explicit identification of emotional faces. Results showed that identification of emotional faces was improved by anodal left tDCS stimulation; this improvement was greater for positive emotional faces. However, it is worth underlining here that Nitsche et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] also found faster RTs under cathodal left tDCS with respect to sham stimulation; according to the authors the accompanying anodal right prefrontal tDCS might have contributed to this finding.</p><p>Before interpreting our data in light of the postulated role of lateral prefrontal cortex in emotional face processing, it is important to underline that bilateral tDCS over the DLPFC can also modulate response of the occipito-temporal cortex to recognition of non-emotional faces. In particular, Lafontaine et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] showed that right anodal/left cathodal stimulation of DLPFC yielded faster recognition than the right cathodal/left anodal and sham conditions in a facial identity recognition task, consistent with a right hemisphere dominance for face processing [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. These observations raise the possibility that our results showing a positive effect of anodal right/cathodal left stimulation on emotional expression recognition might be ascribed to a general facilitation for face processing. However, this post-hoc explanation would imply a generalized improvement of emotional expression recognition, independently from their valence, whereas it could hardly account for the specific effect of tDCS on the ability of male participants to recognize fearful expressions. Our results showing a selective effect of anodal right/cathodal left stimulation on fear recognition might be compatible with the valence theory of emotional processing [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], but we did not find that the reverse electrode arrangement (anodal left/cathodal right) influenced recognition of positive facial expressions, a pattern that would have strongly supported the model. Moreover, the valence theory does not make any prediction on gender related differences.</p><p>Gender related differential responses to tDCS-related have been reported in a recent study investigating the effects of tDCS applied over the superior temporal cortex in males and females during processing of facial expressions [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Results showed that females were significantly more accurate than males, independently from the stimulation condition, and that tDCS led to opposite effects on processing sad and happy faces in males and females. In our study females were significantly more accurate than males in recognizing all emotional faces, consistent with previous evidence [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], but only in males anodal right/cathodal left stimulation enhanced processing of threatening faces. Recently, Weisenbach et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] observed that in recognizing fearful expression males and females activate similar regions, including frontal, parietal and temporal areas, but with different lateralization. Indeed, females generally demonstrated left-sided activation in frontal regions and right-sided activation in temporal regions, whereas males showed bilateral activations of frontal regions, but no temporal activation [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We might suggest that the prevalent involvement of frontal areas while processing threatening faces in males contributed to explain the effect of stimulation over DLPFC in males observed in the present study.</p><p>A relevant point of the present study is the different pattern of results elicited by stimulation over DLPFC in affective and cognitive tasks. Interestingly, we found that anodal right/cathodal left stimulation enhanced processing of fearful faces but interfered with performance on the cognitive task by reducing the onlooker&#x02019;s tendency to adopt another individual&#x02019;s point of view. Recently, Ramsey et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] demonstrated that DLPFC respond during perspective judgments from both one&#x02019;s own or another&#x02019;s point of view, consistent with previous studies showing that the right lateral prefrontal cortex is involved in selecting the appropriate perspective and in inhibiting the irrelevant one [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, other fMRI evidence revealed stronger activation of lateral prefrontal cortex for other- compared with self-perspective judgments [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], thus implying that prefrontal regions could differently respond to self and others&#x02019; point of view. In the present visual perspective experiment, participants were explicitly required to judge the visual scene from their own (self) or the actor&#x02019;s (other) point of view. We found that, in the other-perspective, anodal right/cathodal left stimulation interfered with task performance, inhibiting the &#x0201c;altercentric tendency&#x0201d; and favoring one&#x02019;s own viewpoint when participants observed the actor grasping the target object. Thus, we might suggest that such &#x0201c;enhanced egocentrism&#x0201d; can be related to increased inhibitory control of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex over domain-specific neural systems involved in mental simulation of others&#x02019; actions, such as the mirror neuron system [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It has been suggested that sharing action representation via simulation may be a first step for more advanced mind-reading abilities [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], whereas higher level mentalizing implies further computations based on the ability to distinguish self from others&#x02019; perspective [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In this sense, mentalizing is closely related to cognitive control of the shared action simulation system; thus, mirroring of actions arises first, but subsequently a cognitive control mechanism has to come into play [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. One possible speculative interpretation would imply that the &#x0201c;enhanced egocentrism&#x0201d; we found here might be related to inhibition of shared action representations induced by stimulation over the right DLPFC. Moreover, an alternative interpretation should be also taken into account. Indeed, considering the large size of the electrodes, and the proximity of stimulated DLPFC to a crucial node the action-observation system, i.e. the inferior frontal gyrus [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], one could conjecture that our electrode configuration exerted a direct inhibitory effect over the action simulation system via the cathodal stimulation in the left hemisphere, thus interfering with simulation of the actor&#x02019;s action and reducing the tendency to adopt his viewpoint. Although disentangling between the two alternative interpretations needs a direct testing, we could maintain that inhibition of the action simulation system seems to prevent participants to adopt others&#x02019; perspective.</p><p>In conclusion, in the present study we found that anodal right/cathodal left stimulation over DLPFC can speed-up males&#x02019; responses to threatening faces whereas it interferes with the ability to adopt another&#x02019;s viewpoint in both males and females. Although the small sample size might represent a limitation of the study, our sample was comparable to that used in previous studies investigating gender-related differences in response to tDCS [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Therefore, we believe that our results allow us to infer that stimulating activity of cognitive control areas can lead to different effects on social cognitive skills depending on the affective vs. cognitive nature of the task, and on the gender-related differences in neural organization of emotion processing. These findings fit neuropsychological and neurofunctional evidence showing that these two components can dissociate from each other [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but our pattern of results is opposite to that previously reported in the TMS study by Kalbe et al. [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Future studies should clarify mechanisms sub serving the dynamic interplay between affective and cognitive mentalizing. In such studies it will be also important to understand whether and how individual differences in empathy or emotion recognition (beyond those related to gender) can influence neural and behavioral correlates of social cognition, and whether brain stimulation protocols can interact with behavioral training in shaping social interactions (see [<xref rid="pone.0126448.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] for behavioral data on the effect of expertise on emotion recognition).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0126448.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Dataset (in. xls format) containing all raw data for the Visual Perspective Taking task (VPT), and for the Recognition of Emotional Facial Expressions task (Emotions), in four separate worksheets.</title><p>The file also includes a fifth worksheet containing all legends to raw data worksheets.</p><p>(ZIP)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0126448.s001.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0126448.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
