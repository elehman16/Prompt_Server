We implemented this phase II study to test the hypothesis that vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, is superior to placebo in terms of reducing the risk of postpartum diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Women with insulin-requiring GDM were randomized to either placebo or 50&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin twice daily for 24 months followed by a 12-month observation period (EudraCT: 2007-000634-39). Both groups received lifestyle counseling. The primary efficacy outcomes were the diagnosis of diabetes (American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria) or impaired fasting glucose (IFG)/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Between 2008 and 2015, 113 patients (58 vildagliptin, 55 placebo) were randomized within 2.2&#x02013;10.4 (median 8.6) months after delivery. At the interim analysis, nine diabetic events and 28 IFG/IGT events had occurred. Fifty-two women withdrew before completing the treatment phase. Because of the low diabetes rate, the study was terminated. Lifestyle adherence was similar in both groups. At 24 months, the cumulative probability of postpartum diabetes was 3% and 5% (hazard ratio: 1.03; 95% confidence interval: 0.15&#x02013;7.36) and IFG/IGT was 43% and 22% (hazard ratio: 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.26&#x02013;1.19) in the placebo and vildagliptin groups, respectively. Vildagliptin was well tolerated with no unexpected adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study did not show significant superiority of vildagliptin over placebo in terms of reducing the risk of postpartum diabetes. However, treatment was safe and suggested some improvements in glycemic control, insulin resistance, and &#x003b2;-cell function. The study identified critical issues in performing clinical trials in the early postpartum period in women with GDM hampering efficacy assessments. With this knowledge, we have set a basis for which properly powered trials could be performed in women with recent GDM.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number at ClinicalTrials.gov</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ctgov:NCT01018602" id="intref0010">NCT01018602</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0015a"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0015a">Treatment with vildagliptin suggested positive effects on &#x003b2;-cell function and HbA1c.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020a"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0020a">Treatment with vildagliptin was safe.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025a"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0025a">Contraindication of vildagliptin during lactation led to exclusion of women with early postpartum diabetes.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030a"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0030a">Slow enrolment and high drop-out rates are major challenges in studies of women with GDM.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Prevention</kwd><kwd>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>Postpartum diabetes</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Life-style</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group id="kwrds0015"><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>DPP4 inhibitor, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>GDM, gestational diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>GIP, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide</kwd><kwd>GLP-1, Glucagon-like peptide-1</kwd><kwd>IFG, impaired fasting glucose</kwd><kwd>IGT, impaired glucose tolerance</kwd><kwd>ITT, intention-to-treat</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs in about 13% of pregnancies worldwide <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and is associated with adverse short- and long-term outcomes in mothers and their offspring <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although it resolves soon after delivery in many cases, women with GDM are at increased risk of developing diabetes in the postpartum period <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Diet and exercise are recommended to manage postpartum diabetes risk. However, the overall adherence to diet and exercise recommendations is poor. Relatively few studies have been undertaken to examine whether it is possible to reduce the risk of postpartum diabetes in women with prior GDM through pharmacotherapy <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, no pharmacotherapy intervention trial has been conducted in women with GDM during the first year after delivery, when the risk of developing postpartum diabetes is greatest <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The pathogenesis of GDM is still unknown, but there is evidence that impaired insulin secretion contributes to hyperglycemia during pregnancy in a large proportion of women with prior GDM <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Therefore, we reasoned that interventions aimed at improving/preserving insulin secretion in the early postpartum period may help to prevent postpartum diabetes in women with GDM, particularly in those who required insulin during pregnancy.</p><p id="p0015">Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an important mediator of insulin secretion and glycemic control <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and several dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors, which prevent GLP-1 degradation, have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. GLP-1 analogues and DPP4 inhibitors also have beneficial effects on islet function and &#x003b2;-cell preservation <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. To date, however, no trial has assessed whether DPP4 inhibitors can prevent risk of postpartum diabetes in women with a recent history of GDM. Considering these properties of DPP4 inhibitors, we performed an investigator-initiated phase II study to test the hypothesis that administration of vildagliptin, a representative DPP4 inhibitor, within 1 year after delivery is superior to placebo in terms of reducing the risk of postpartum diabetes in women with prior insulin-requiring GDM. We chose a 2-year treatment period and a 1-year follow-up period because we found that many diabetic events in women with prior GDM occurred within 1 year of delivery in our previous study <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and considering the cost and feasibility of longer-term studies. Both groups received repeated lifestyle counseling, including dietary and physical activity counseling, which is recommended in the postpartum follow-up of women with GDM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Design</title><p id="p0020">This study was performed as an investigator-initiated, phase II, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, and was conducted at the Forschergruppe Diabetes e.V., Munich-Neuherberg, Germany.

Based on an expected rate of postpartum diabetes of 61% over 3 years in the placebo group, as observed in the German Gestational Diabetes Study <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, we calculated that enrolling 70 participants to each group would provide 80% power to detect a 50% hazard reduction of postpartum diabetes over 3 years with a two-sided &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a drop-out rate of 15%. We projected to complete the enrollment of 140 women within 4 years of starting the study.

The primary and secondary outcomes were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle for all randomized patients who had taken at least one dose of study drug and had some post-baseline data for the primary efficacy parameters. Safety laboratory variables were presented as the median with interquartile range, together with the number and percentage of participants with values outside normal range, which were compared between the two groups using Fisher's exact test. The numbers of women with and without adverse events likely related to the study drug were compared between the two group groups using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Demographic, anthropometric, and metabolic variables at baseline were compared using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test or the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Missing data were not imputed, unless the value of a secondary outcome variable or safety variable was missing at screening, in which case the baseline value was used instead, or vice versa (as appropriate).</p><p id="p0080">All analyses were performed on a significance level of &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05 (two-sided) without correction for multiple testing, and were carried out using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Participants</title><p id="p0085">Of 155 women screened between 2008 and 2015, 113 were allocated to treatment within 2.2&#x02013;10.4 (median 8.6) months after delivery, including 58 women to vildagliptin (median age at baseline visit: 35.8 years) and 55 to placebo (median age at baseline visit: 33.1 years).

Of the 50 women who discontinued the study or were lost to follow-up during the treatment period, six in the vildagliptin group and three in the placebo group did so because of a new pregnancy, while two in the vildagliptin group and one in the placebo group discontinued because they developed diabetes according to the ADA 1997 criteria (study endpoint).

Because we excluded women with rapid progression to diabetes, our study might not reflect the true incidence of postpartum diabetes in women with prior GDM.</p><p id="p0140">We must also acknowledge possible limitations of the study design, including the difficulty in recruiting the desired sample size. Based on our experience, only approximately 30% of women with GDM require insulin during pregnancy, which limits the potential population of eligible participants. Additionally, there was a relatively high discontinuation rate; it is possible that some women developed diabetes, IGT, or IFG after discontinuation. Finally, the study did not include a molecular mechanistic part to elucidate potential disease related pathways.</p><p id="p0145">Several recent studies have provided evidence to suggest that lifestyle interventions may reduce the risk of postpartum diabetes in women with prior GDM <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Both groups in our study received intensive diet and exercise interventions throughout the trial.

One study, the TRIPOD study <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, assessed the efficacy of troglitazone compared with placebo for the prevention of postpartum diabetes in 266 women with a history of GDM who were enrolled up to 4 years after delivery. In that study, the incidence of diabetes was reduced by 50% in the troglitazone group. However, the study was terminated early because troglitazone was removed from the market after reports of severe adverse events. The Diabetes Prevention Program <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> investigated the impact of intensive lifestyle interventions and metformin on the incidence of diabetes in people with elevated BMI, IGT and elevated fasting glucose, including 350 women with a history of GDM. In that study, participants were randomized to treatment at a mean of 12 years after delivery. Among women with prior GDM, the progression to diabetes was 35% lower in the intensive lifestyle intervention group and 40% lower in the metformin group compared with placebo suggesting that metformin may have a similar efficacy compared to intensive lifestyle interventions for reducing the risk of postpartum diabetes. Unlike the TRIPOD and Diabetes Prevention Program, we found no significant benefit of the study drug (in our case vildagliptin).</p><p id="p0155">In addition to assessing the efficacy of vildagliptin, we also examined its safety in terms of adverse events and laboratory variables in this cohort of women. The safety data, including the types of adverse events, were generally consistent with the results of clinical trials of vildagliptin <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> and suggest that there are no significant safety concerns associated with administering vildagliptin at a dose of 50&#x000a0;mg twice daily in this cohort of women.</p><p id="p0160">In conclusion, in our study, administration of vildagliptin did not achieve a significant reduction in the risk of postpartum diabetes compared with placebo in women with prior insulin-requiring GDM at the time of the interim analysis. However, our study identified the critical issues in performing clinical trials in the early postpartum period in women with GDM hampering efficacy assessments. These included 1) slow enrollment, 2) high rates of discontinuation, 3) later than planned enrollment of participants because vildagliptin was contraindicated during lactation leading to the exclusion of women who developed diabetes before randomization and 4) the combination with active life style intervention reducing overall diabetes rates. Our experience in this study highlights the challenges encountered in studies of women with GDM. We believe that with this study we have set a basis for which properly powered trials could be performed in women with recent GDM.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0165">SHu contributed to the lifestyle component of the study, interpreted the results, and drafted the manuscript.
