Wii games in addition to neurodevelopmental treatment in patients with cerebral palsy.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty hemiparetic cerebral palsy patients (16 females, 14 males;
mean age, 6&#x02013;15 years) were included in the study and divided into two groups: a
neurodevelopmental treatment+Nintendo Wii group (group 1, n=15) and a neurodevelopmental
treatment group (group 2, n=15). Both groups received treatment in 45-minute sessions 2
days/week for six weeks. Use of the upper extremities, speed, disability and functional
independence were evaluated using the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test, Jebsen
Taylor Hand Function Test, ABILHAND-Kids test, and Pediatric Functional Independence
Measure (self-care) before and after treatment. [Results] There were statistically
significant improvements in all parameters for group 1 and group 2 (except quality of
function) after six weeks of treatment. Intergroup analysis showed that group 1 was
superior to group 2 in mean change differences in the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test.
[Conclusion] Our results showed that neurodevelopmental treatment is effective for
improving hand functions in hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To provide a enjoyable,
motivational, safe, and effective rehabilitation program, the Nintendo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Wii may
be used in addition to neurodevelopmental treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Virtual reality</kwd><kwd>Nintendo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Wii</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of neurological disability in children<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, affecting approximately 1 in 1,300 live
births<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. At an early age, the most
affected parts of upper extremity involvement are the wrist and hands. Abnormal hand
postures such as thumb adduction and/or flexion with limited wrist extension are the primary
manifestations of hand involvement. Daily living activities and functional independence are
affected by increased tonus of the upper limb, impaired posture and function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In children with CP, neurodevelopmental treatment (NDT) is the most widely used treatment
approach, which aims to maximize the child&#x02019;s potential to improve motor functions while
preventing musculoskeletal complications<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the literature, it has been reported
that intensive neurodevelopmental treatment is effective for improvement of gross motor
function, hand functions, and the quality of upper-extremity movement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual
rehabilitation is a relatively new method that has been adopted by physical therapists who
specialize in CP treatment. In recent years, there has been growing interest in therapeutic
use of the Nintendo Wii and Wii Fit (Wii) as virtual rehabilitation tools. Although limited
in number, some studies have suggested that use of these devices, could result in
significant therapeutic gains in motor function for children with cerebral palsy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The theories of motor control and motor learning emphasize the importance of including
motivating, repetitive, purposeful exercises with games and fun to support development in
the rehabilitation of children with CP<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. During standard physiotherapy sessions,
it can be difficult to motivate a child and encourage participation in activities.
Therefore, physical therapists need various motivational techniques and methods to gain the
most benefit from exercises applied to improve limb use<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Virtual reality games can be motivating and entertaining for the
paediatric age group, thereby holding the interest of the child during treatment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, whilst also improving upper extremity skills and control<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>,
skills required for daily living activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and speed of upper extremity use<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the literature, there are studies that have evaluated use of
theNintendo Wii and similar games consoles for improvement of upper extremity functions in
patients with various diagnoses<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, but there are very few that have
investigated the effectiveness of use of technological systems to improve upper extremity
functions in children with CP. The current study aimed to determine the effects on quality
of upper extremity skills, movement speed of the upper extremity, disability, and functional
independence as a result of adding virtual reality games to a neurodevelopmental treatment
program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 33 children with spastic hemiparesis were evaluated, and 30 were included in
this study between June and September 2014 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow chart describing the progression of participants through the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-774-g001"/></fig>). The inclusion criteria were a) aged between 6 and 15&#x02005;years, b) level 1&#x02013;3 of the
Manual Ability Classification System, c) level 1or 2 of the Gross Motor Function
Classification System<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, d) ability to
grasp and release an object, and e) no history of surgery or botulinum toxin application to
the upper extremity in the previous 6 months. Parents or legal guardians read and signed an
informed consent form before the study, and the Marmara University Health Sciences Institute
Ethics Committee approved the study (02.05.2014-13).</p><p>The children were divided into two groups on the basis of arrival at the clinic. We used
simple randomization with a random number generator (1&#x02013;15, group 1; 16&#x02013;30: group 2). The
first 15 children were assigned as group 1, and the program applied was NDT+Wii. The second
15 children were assigned as group 2 and received NDT<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> only. Treatment in both
groups was applied by a physical therapist for 45 minutes per session, twice a week, for 6
weeks. The patients in group 1 played virtual reality games of tennis, baseball, and boxing
(each game 5 minutes) for 15 minutes in addition to the standard neurodevelopmental
treatment in each treatment session, wich was focus on the hemiplegic hand. Two experienced
physical therapists selected the games for moving to the hemiplegic upper extremity. All
children were trained by the same therapists during all sessions. The patients who attended
school received treatment outside of school hours.</p><p>The NDT Program for both groups was applied according to each child&#x02019;s individual needs and
included tonus regulation, support of sensation, perception and motor development,
facilitating normal movement for upper extremity activities, upper extremity functional
skills training, and daily living activities such as getting dressed and eating.</p><p>Before starting the Nintendo Wii games, the patients were informed about the content of
each game and had one practice session, during which the children were supported verbally
and physically until they achieved the correct movements.</p><p>In this study, use of the upper extremity was evaluated using the Quality of Upper
Extremity Skills Test (QUEST), which has been tested for validity and reliability in
children with neuromotor dysfunction. This test indicates four domains: dissociated
movement, grasp, weight-bearing, and protective extension<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hand function speed was assessed with the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), which
has been shown to be reliable and normative for children<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, the
subtests to assess hand function included turning over cards 3 &#x000d7; 5 inches (7.5&#x02005;cm &#x000d7; 12.5&#x02005;cm)
in size, simulated feeding, picking up small common objects, stacking checkers, picking up
large objects, and picking up large heavy objects. The time (in seconds) taken to perform
seven fine motor hand tasks was measured.</p><p>Hand disability was assessed using the ABILHAND-Kids test, which has been found to be valid
and reliable in children with CP. Turkish translation of the ABILHAND-Kids test was
performed by the authors. In this test, 21 mainly bimanual, activities are rated by the
children&#x02019;s parents on a 3-point scale (0=impossible, 1=difficult, 2=easy), describing their
child&#x02019;s perceived difficulty in performing each activity. Total maximum score was 42 and
show the activities were easy<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional independence was assessed using the WeeFIM. This is a useful tool for assessing
functional status in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities; it includes 18 items
scored on a 7-level ordinal scale. The reliability and stability of the scale has been
proven<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study, the WeeFIM self-care domain was
assessed.</p><p>All assessments were performed twice: once at the start of the treatment program and again
at the end of the 6-week program. In addition, a user satisfaction questionnaire was
administered to the patients in group 1. This questionaire assessed parameters related to
virtual reality games including the level of difficulty of the game, motivation, cognitive
abilities, and physical effort of the player<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.18.0 for Windows. A value of p&#x0003c;0.05 was
considered statistically significant for all analyses. Baseline characteristics were
compared using the independent samples t test and the chi- square test. A comparison of the
groups was made using the independent samples t-test for the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function
Test and the Mann-Whitney U test for the Quality of Upper Extremity Skills Test,
ABILHAND-Kids test, and WeeFIM with an intention-to-treat analysis of the difference between
the baseline and final scores with a 95% confidence interval. The paired sample t-test was
used to compare JTHFT outcomes before and after treatment. While the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
test was used to compare other outcomes before and after treatment. The Mann-Whitney U test
was used to compare improvements and differences between the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>From the 33 patients with CP who were referred, 30 were included in the study for

ability, and level of independence in activities of daily living were comparatively
investigated in the children with hemiparetic CP. In the study, improvements were achieved
in functional ability, speed, manual ability, and the dissociated movements subgroup of the
QUEST results in the group in which NDT (45&#x02005;min) was applied for 6 weeks. On the other hand,
improvements were observed in the results of all hand functions, speed and manual ability,
and all subgroup scores of the QUEST scale in the group in which NDT+NW (30&#x02005;min+15&#x02005;min) was
applied. The satisfaction questionnaire applied to the NDT+NW group showed that the children
were extremely satisfied with the practice. Higher success rates were achieved in terms of
speed in the group in which Nintendo Wii was added to NDT when compared with the NDT only
group.</p><p>NDT is a global therapeutic approach that addresses all requirements of a child and aims to
increase the child&#x02019;s functionality and participation in daily life. Although this approach
is not a therapeutic modality only for hand functions, it does include some activities in
the session that address daily use of the hand<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
the literature, there are few studies that contain sufficient evidence and show the healing
effect of the NDT approach on upper extremity functions of children<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, our study is important. However, the
absence of a comparable &#x0201c;no treatment&#x0201d; control group is a limitation decreasing the power of
our results. Data from the literature suggest that the use virtual reality positively
affects participation of children in treatment and provides motivation and adaptation<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous studies focusing on the upper extremity in CP, the study
periods were 4<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, 6<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> and 8 weeks<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, as in the literature, we
preferred a study period of 6 weeks to compare Nintendo Wii and NDT practices. On the other
hand, time spent on virtual reality generally varied between 20 minutes and 3, 5 hours, 3&#x02013;5
days per week in the studies conducted using virtual reality<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. As it has also been suggested in the literature, we thought that
the Nintendo Wii, as a game-based approach, might be a useful part of rehabilitation for
children with CP. Therefore, in our study, we evaluated the contribution of the Nintendo Wii
to the upper extremity when used for a period of time period (15&#x02005;min) during a routine NDT
treatment session<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Similar to our study, Shin et al. applied 15 minutes of Nintendo Wii game play in addition
to 30 minutes of conventional neurologic treatment twice a week in children with cerebral
palsy and obtained significant differences in eye-hand coordination and visual motor speed
in comparison of a virtual reality training group with a conventional neurological physical
therapy group<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The children in our study also regarded the virtual reality games as a reward given at the
end of NDT practices, but not as a treatment, which may be accepted as a condition that may
increase motivation and cooperation. It was also clinically observed that the subjects in
our study were more motivated to participate in the activities during the NDT session. This
was also observed in the satisfaction questionnaires completed by the NDT+NW group at the
end of the study. Since computer games have recently become an important from of
entertainment, which may be addictive, in the lives of children lives, this interest and
positive motivation in the children were expected.</p><p>In addition, the effort of the children to move quickly during Nintendo Wii practice to
score in the game and play better versus the computer might be the reason for the higher
scores in the NDT+NW group when compared with the NDT only group. It might be accepted as a
limitation that we obtained no records of the scores obtained by the children in the games
at the beginning and end of the study. Comparison of the scores between the beginning and
end of treatment might objectively show the development of the child&#x02019;s ability to play the
game. On the other hand, a powerful aspect of our study is that all cases had homogeneously
hemiplegic type cerebral palsy.</p><p>The QUEST has been used to measure the results in studies on virtual reality<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the posttreatment QUEST scores of all participants in
the NDT+NW group were better compared with those of the NDT group (p&#x0003c;0.05). We think that
achieving a statistically significant increase in NDT+NW group with regard to weight bearing
and protective extension scores at the end of 6 weeks might be related to the effort of the
children to move their arms to better grasp and use the Nintendo Wii game console. During
the practice, it was also clinically observed that some children were unable to firmly grasp
Nintendo Wii game console at the beginning of treatment, but were better able to grasp and
control the Wii Nunchuk at the end of 6-week treatment period. The posttreatment increase in
QUEST grasps scores especially supports this clinical observation.</p><p>In our study, JTHFT scores improved in both groups when compared with those for the to
pretreatment period. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the
two groups in terms of JTHFT results, it was observed that the NDT+NW group completed the
test 6 seconds earlier, on average, at the end of the 6-week treatment period. This outcome
indicates that the use Nintendo Wii games was more effective than NDT in increasing the
speed of movement. In general, an important question about virtual reality practices is
about whether achieved gains &#x0201c;contribute to real life activities.&#x0201d; In our study, among the
cases tested by a method that includes measurements obtained using functional real life
activities, such as the JTHFT, the better results in the Nintendo Wii group represent
evidence showing that gained obtained by virtual environment therapies might be transmitted
to real life. There are also some other studies presented in the literature demonstrating
that similar successful results have been achieved regarding the transmission of through
virtual reality therapy skills gained here to real life<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In our study, independence of the children was evaluated with the WeeFIM, which revealed
similar developments in both groups in terms of eating, care, bathing, and the upper and
lower trunk dressing fields. There is one study in the literature that included a case with
hemiplegic CP and showed results similar to our findings in terms of improvement in daily
self-care activities<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, a
posttreatment improvement was observed in both groups in terms of the scores of the
ABILHAND-Kids which was previously used in studies in which virtual reality was applied to
measure specific daily life skills of the hand<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, while no significant difference was
present between the groups. We could measure these functional gains in our study only at the
questionnaire level. We suggest that magnetic resonance imaging of this kind of gain might
increase the objectivity and power of further studies.</p><p>The part of the user satisfaction questionnaire concerning the difficulty of the Nintendo
Wii games, all children in the NDT+NW group in our study stated that they could &#x0201c;win the
games&#x0201d; in spite of their physical limitations. This situation may indicate that the games
strongly motivated the children who tried the virtual reality games, in spite of their
physical limitations. Some children stated that the games were more tiring than the other
methods applied in NDT. Although they were very tired, all children stated that playing with
the Nintendo Wii was much more fun when compared to conventional therapy. In addition, all
cases specified that the games were attractive and that they lost track of time during
therapy. We interpreted this situation as indicating that supporting traditional therapies,
which become boring and monotone for children during long rehabilitation periods in children
with CP, with virtual reality games might increase the motivation of children in therapy.
Virtual reality games, which have become a part of daily life, make children perform desired
activities voluntarily and in a more motivated way. These results suggest that the children
were very pleased with the virtual reality games added to therapy.</p><p>The game console used in this study relies mostly on use a controller, it was observed that
the children with CP sometimes lost control of the controller due to excitement-related
increased spasticity and that the device failed to sense their movements. We think that
further studies are required that, include a higher number of participants and use more
current systems with sensors sensitive to not only movements of a controller but also all
body movements.</p><p>In conclusion, application of Nintendo Wii virtual reality games combined with NDT had
benefical effects on upper extremity functions, upper extremity speed, and independence
level in daily life activities in the children with hemiplegic CP. The increase in speed was
more prominent in the NDT+NW group than in the NDT group. Since the Nintendo Wii increases
motivation and provides on opportunity for enjoyable therapy, we think that it increases
adaptation of children to rehabilitation programs and that it may be added to conventional
treatment programs. Use of virtual reality as a treatment modality for improving
functionality in children is considered a rich study field in which further results may be
obtained from randomized studies with larger sample sizes and control groups.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Himmelmann</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: Epidemilogy of cerebral palsy.
