</p><p content-type="indent">In the English stop smoking services, smokers motivated to quit may receive support in specialist clinics, primary care, pharmacy, or other settings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Previous studies reported that smokers receiving support in specialist centers tended to have a higher quit rate at 4 weeks after quit dates, compared to those receiving support in other settings from professionals for whom smoking cessation was only a part of their work.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> However, a recent study using routine monitoring data found little difference in quit rates between different types of smoking cessation advisors, except that smoking cessation support by nurses tended to be less effective than by specialist advisors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Previous studies have only compared short-term smoking outcomes. For longer-term smoking outcomes, it has been assumed that the rate of smoking relapse would be similar among short-term quitters, irrespective of the type of smoking cessation support provided.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> There is a lack of evidence to compare the longer-term smoking outcomes between different types of smoking cessation advisors.</p><p content-type="indent">In a randomized controlled trial of self-help materials for smoking relapse prevention (ISRCTN: 36980856),<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> we recruited 1407 short-term quitters and conducted follow-up interviews at 3 and 12 months after quit dates. Participants in the treatment group received a set of eight self-help booklets for relapse prevention, and those in the control group were sent a single leaflet that is currently used in practice. It was found that there was no difference between the intervention groups in prolonged smoking abstinence from month 4 to 12 (37% vs. 39%, <italic>P</italic> = .51), and main findings of the trial will be published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the trial, we also collected data on the type of stop smoking services (specialist services, or from general practice nurses, pharmacists, or community health trainers). In a secondary analysis, we examined whether there was a difference in longer-term smoking abstinence at 12 months between quitters who received smoking cessation treatment in different settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Study participants were those included in a randomized controlled trial of self-help material for smoking relapse prevention.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The target population for this trial was people who had stopped smoking, as verified by carbon monoxide (CO) reading, at 4 weeks after the quit date, following the provision of cessation support from NHS stop smoking services. The biochemically verified 4-week quitter is defined as a treated smoker who reports abstinence from at least day 14 after the quit date to the 4-week follow-up point and who blows an exhaled CO reading of less than 10 ppm.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Quitters who were pregnant, unable to read booklets in English, from families at the same address, or younger than 18 years were excluded.</p><p content-type="indent">We recruited CO-validated short-term quitters from August 2011, and initially recruited participants only from specialist stop smoking clinics. In May 2012, participant recruitment was expanded to other settings, including pharmacies, general practice, and health trainer services. Smoking cessation advisors in specialist stop smoking centers are more highly trained in delivering smoking cessation interventions.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In contrast, smoking cessation counseling is only a small part of the role of practice nurses and pharmacists. Health Trainers also have a wider role, providing general support for health behavioral changes, including stopping smoking, dietary changes, reducing alcohol intake, and increasing physical activity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">The trial achieved the recruitment target by June 2013, and included a total of 1407 eligible short-term quitters. Three participants died before the 12-month follow-up and were excluded from the analysis. Of the 1404 participants, there were 1088 participants from specialist stop smoking clinics, and 316 from nonspecialist cessation services (including 220 from general practices, 57 from health trainers, and 39 from pharmacy). The follow-up rate was 86% at 12 months, and the rate of CO verification was 85% for participants who reported abstinence at the 12-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Data Collection and Variables</title><p>Four weeks after the quit date, stop smoking advisors gathered baseline information from participants who had consented to participate in the study, including participants&#x02019; demographic characteristics and smoking history (including previous quit attempts, number of cigarettes per day, time of the first cigarette after waking up, living with a smoking partner or not). Study participants were then followed up by researchers at 3 and 12 months after quit dates. The follow-up interviews were conducted by telephone and involved researchers administering a questionnaire which asked questions about the participant&#x02019;s smoking status and process variables. In addition, at the 3 and 12-month follow-up, we asked participants whether they used smoking cessation medications during 2 and 3 months after the quit date (For more details about questions asked and response options, please see the baseline and follow-up questionnaires in an online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ntr.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ntr/ntv148/-/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.).</p><p content-type="indent">The primary outcome in the study was defined as prolonged abstinence from months 4 to 12, with no more than five cigarettes in total, and confirmed by CO &#x0003c; 10 ppm at the 12-month follow-up.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> At the 12-month follow-up, participants who reported smoking abstinence during the past 7 days were invited to take a CO test. Participants came to a clinic or a researcher visited them at home for this test. To optimize CO test rates, a shopping voucher (&#x000a3;20) was offered to each of the participants who attended the CO test at the 12-month follow-up. Participants who declined biochemical verification or who did not respond to follow-up were classified as relapsed. However, according to the trial protocol<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and Russell standard,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> participants who died or were known to have moved away from the study areas were excluded from the numerator and denominator, because their smoking status were not available at the final follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We used <italic>t</italic> test for continuous variables and Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables to compare differences between stop smoking services in baseline characteristics and the use of cessation medications.

We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to investigate the association between continuous smoking abstinence from 4 to 12 months and the type of smoking cessation services participants had accessed, adjusted for possible confounding factors. The confounding factors used in the multivariable analysis were age, sex, married or living with a partner, education level, unemployed or not, receipt of free prescription, previous quit attempts, managed to quit at least 4 weeks before, less than 10 cigarettes per day, first cigarette within 5 minutes after waking, living with a smoking partner, use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or varenicline during 2 to 3 months after the quit date. The dependent variable was the prolonged CO-validated smoking abstinence from 4 to 12 months, and independent variables included type of stop smoking advisors (specialist vs. other), age, gender, marital status, level of education, in receipt of free prescription, previous quit attempts, level of nicotine dependence, and use of smoking cessation medications during 2 to 3 months after the quit date.

The difference in the proportion of smoking abstinence at 12 months was on average 7% between the specialist and nonspecialist services, which has important public health implications. Assuming the same quit rate (37%) at 4 weeks after the quit date,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> the corresponding rate of prolonged abstinence from month 4 to 12 in people who set a quit date will be 14.4% and 11.8%, respectively. The difference in prolonged abstinence among people who set a quit date is likely to be larger than 2.6% if the support from specialist advisors is associated with a higher short-term quit rate than the support from nonspecialist advisors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">The observed difference in longer-term smoking abstinence between specialist and nonspecialist services in this study is unlikely to be caused by confounding factors. The association between smoking abstinence at 12 months and support from specialist advisors remained statistically significant after adjusting for participant characteristics, smoking history variables, and the use of smoking cessation medications (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">Previous studies have explored possible reasons for varying short-term outcomes by different smoking cessation settings and type of advisors in the English stop smoking services. Firstly, specialist advisors have received more training in smoking cessation counseling, compared to other health care professionals,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and a study found that success rates of smoking cessation treatment were associated with increased uptake of a national evidence-based training programme by advisors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In addition to more extensive training, McDermott and colleagues<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> reported that specialist advisors received more supervision and showed greater adherence to evidence-based practice. Finally, it was found that group based sessions were more common in specialist centers than in other settings,<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and support provided in specialist clinics may be more intensive, compared to that provided in nonspecialist settings. For example, smoking cessation treatment delivered by pharmacists in Glasgow was considered to be of &#x0201c;medium-intensity&#x0201d;.<sup><xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">The above reasons may also be pertinent in explaining the reduced risk of longer-term smoking relapse in short-term quitters who received support in specialist centers. Compared with nonspecialist support, behavioral support from specialist advisors might have provided more effective knowledge and skills for clients to cope with urges to smoke. It was found that reported attempts by participants to do something to cope with urges were associated with a lower risk of smoking relapse.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> We further analyzed data and found that the proportion of participants who attempted to do something to cope with urges was 89.9% in participants from the specialist services and 84.5% in those from nonspecialist services.</p><sec id="s8"><title>Limitations</title><p>This was a secondary analysis of data from a trial, and it is possible that the effects observed are due to confounding factors that were not measured or adjusted for. The study recruited many more short-term quitters from specialist services (<italic>n</italic> = 1088) than from nonspecialist services (<italic>n</italic> = 316). Therefore, quitters from pharmacies, general practice, and health trainer services were combined in the main analysis and a comparison between different nonspecialist settings could not be conducted because of the small sample size. It also raises a question about the sample&#x02019;s representativeness to all short-term quitters from nonspecialist smoking cessation services. In addition, the level of training and experience amongst staff who provide smoking cessation support in pharmacies, general practice, and health trainer services may be very different.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Implications for Practice and Research</title><p>Findings from this study suggest that support from specialist smoking cessation advisors is associated with not only an increased short-term quit success, but also a reduced longer-term smoking relapse risk among short-term quitters. The most meaningful public health target of smoking cessation programmes is a lowered prevalence of smoking in population, rather than simply a counting of short-term quitters most of whom will relapse in 12 months. Although smoking cessation support in any setting is cost-effective,<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> specialist counseling, as an intervention that improves longer-term outcomes, should be emphasized.</p><p content-type="indent">Findings from this study have important public health and clinical implications, as currently there is a lack of cost-effective interventions for the prevention of smoking relapse in short-term quitters.<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In the English stop smoking services in 2012/2013, 33% of smokers motivated to quit received support in specialist clinics, 39% in primary care, 21% in pharmacy, and 7% in other settings.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> The total number of people who set a quit date in nonspecialist services was 485 245 in 2012/2013 in England.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> If the rate of prolonged abstinence was increased by 2.6%, there would be 12 616 more people who were abstinent at 12 months. Therefore the use of specialist smoking cessation services should be encouraged to result in more quitters with longer-term abstinence. However, it should be stressed that smoking cessation support from nonspecialist advisors is still cost-effective.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> A large proportion of smokers motivated to quit have chosen to receive cessation support from general practice, pharmacy, and other nonspecialist advisors, based on individual preferences, such as perceived convenience. Health care professionals who provide smoking cessation counseling in nonspecialist settings should receive more training, or be allowed more time to provide smoking cessation counseling, in order to improve short-term and longer-term outcomes. Further research is needed to investigate reasons for the difference in longer term outcomes between specialist and nonspecialist cessation support, and whether enhancing generalist skills in nonspecialist advisors can reduce longer term relapse.</p><p content-type="indent">In summary, longer-term smoking relapse appeared to be reduced in smokers who received support from specialist smoking cessation advisors, compared with those who received support from nonspecialist advisors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
