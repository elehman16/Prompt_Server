This technique has been used for treating heroin addiction, but has not been systematically tested for other drugs of abuse. This study aims to investigate the effects of TEAS on drug addiction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Volunteers who were either cocaine-dependent (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) or cannabis-dependent (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) but were not seeking treatment for their dependence participated in a within-subject, single-blind study. Treatment consisted of twice daily 30-minute sessions of TEAS or sham stimulation for 3.5&#x02009;days. The active TEAS levels were individually adjusted to produce a distinct twitching response in the fingers, while the sham stimulation involved 2 minutes of stimulation at threshold levels followed by 28 minutes of stimulation below the detection levels. The participants recorded their drug use and drug cravings daily. At 1 hour after the last morning session of TEAS or sham stimulation, a cue-induced craving EEG evaluation was conducted. Event-related P300 potentials (ERPs) were recorded, sorted, and analyzed for specific image types (neutral objects, non-drug-related arousing images, or drug-related images).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>TEAS treatment did not significantly reduce the drug use or drug cravings, or significantly alter the ERP peak voltage or latency to peak response. However, the TEAS treatment did significantly modulate several self-reported measures of mood and anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this pilot study with a limited sample size suggest that the acupoint stimulation techniques and protocol used in this trial alone do not significantly reduce cravings for or use of cocaine or cannabis. The findings that TEAS modulates mood and anxiety suggest that TEAS could be used as an adjunct in a multimodal therapy program to treat cocaine and cannabis dependence if confirmed in a full randomized controlled clinical trial.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Drug abuse and dependence are medical problems that have impacts on the personal, social, and economic fabric of society. Searches for effective therapies have been, and continue to be, important areas of research in neuroscience and pharmacology, as these disciplines seek to develop a greater understanding of the biological basis of drug abuse. Although there are several approved interventions for treating tobacco, alcohol, and opioid addiction, there remains a lack of effective medical treatments for cocaine and cannabis abuse.</p><p>Traditional acupuncture methods involving the insertion of needles at specific points on the body have been used for centuries to treat a variety of maladies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A review of controlled clinical trials by the World Health Organization has documented that drug dependence (specifically alcohol, cocaine, opiates/heroin, and tobacco dependence) is a condition for which acupuncture may have therapeutic benefits, but additional studies are warranted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Owing to the widespread use of acupuncture techniques to treat abuse problems related to alcohol, nicotine, and opiates, numerous researchers have attempted to systematically assess its usefulness in treating cocaine abuse. Most commonly, auricular acupuncture techniques (involving needle insertion at specific locations on the outer ear) have been tested with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although a well-controlled study on methadone-maintained cocaine-dependent subjects showed a significant decrease in cocaine-positive urine samples after 8&#x02009;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], a larger-scale study by the same research group concluded that acupuncture was no better than a needle-insertion control condition or a relaxation control condition in these dually-dependent subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two systematic reviews of the available literature concluded that the currently available acupuncture techniques are not effective in treating cocaine abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Alternative strategies involve application of electrical stimulation to needles inserted into traditional acupuncture points or simply application of electrical stimulation <italic>via</italic> electroconductive pads on the skin at these acupoints. These techniques have been found to be effective in reducing the severity of heroin withdrawal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Evidence for the possible effectiveness of these techniques for cocaine dependence may be inferred from an animal study, which showed that cocaine-induced conditioned place preference in rats was blocked by application of electroacupuncture at 100&#x02009;Hz, but not at 2&#x02009;Hz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Neither traditional needle insertion nor electrical stimulation has been assessed in cocaine- and cannabis-dependent individuals.</p><p>Transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation (TEAS) has been shown to promote the release of endorphins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], which may be the basis of its effectiveness for opiate addiction, and also lead to the release of a variety of neuropeptides that control important brain functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This study aims to explore the feasibility of TEAS as a possible means for reducing drug use and drug cravings in cocaine- and cannabis-dependent subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Cocaine- and cannabis-dependent individuals who were not seeking treatment for their dependence were recruited by advertisements in local newspapers and on the internet. The protocol and informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the McLean Hospital Institutional Review Board. The participants were briefed regarding the purpose and requirements of the study, and then given time to read the informed consent form in detail. After an opportunity to ask questions and ensure understanding, written informed consent was obtained. The participants underwent a physical examination by a physician and a mental health examination, including a Structured Clinical Interview according to DSM-IV criteria (SCID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], under the supervision of a clinical psychologist. The inclusion criteria for participation consisted of being physically healthy, having no Axis I psychological disorder (<italic>i.e.</italic>, serious mental disorder such as major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia), and meeting dependence criteria for either cocaine or cannabis. Dependence was assessed during the SCID by evaluating whether a maladaptive pattern of substance use was occurring. Specifically, the interviewer evaluated each participant for tolerance, withdrawal, loss of control, preoccupation with obtaining and using the drug, impacts on social, occupational, or recreational activities, and use despite physical harm. Individuals were excluded from participation if they had abnormal blood and urine chemistry values, had an abnormal electrocardiogram, were taking prescription medications, or had a history of head trauma or major head injury. Four individuals did not qualify after the physical examination and mental health assessments, and two were excluded from the data analysis because they did not report any drug use during the baseline period. Of the remaining 20 participants who completed the study (11 men, 9 women; mean age, 33.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.2&#x02009;years; age range, 21 &#x02013; 49&#x02009;years), nine met the criteria for cocaine dependence (three crack cocaine users) and 11 met the criteria for cannabis dependence. The individuals were paid for their participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Equipments</title><p>TEAS was delivered by a Han&#x02019;s Acupoint Nerve Stimulator (HANS) (Hans International Inc., China). This battery-operated device delivered electrical stimulation <italic>via</italic> two pairs of outputs to electroconductive pads placed at acupoints used in previous studies of heroin addiction and treatment of withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Dr. Ji-Sheng Han, the developer of the HANS device, personally trained the research staff to use the device and provided advice for the frequencies, durations, and placements to be used based on his extensive work in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Acupoints are shown in Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and are described in more detail below. The stimulation comprised alternating 3-second intervals of pulses at frequencies of 2 and 100&#x02009;Hz using intensities that were sufficiently strong to elicit a slight, but noticeable, twitch in the index finger or thumb of each hand. The mean intensity for the PC-6/TH-5 acupoint was 9.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7&#x02009;mA (range, 5.7 &#x02013; 12.7&#x02009;mA), while that for the LI-4/PC-8 acupoint was 12.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.0&#x02009;mA (range, 7.7 &#x02013; 18.1&#x02009;mA). For the sham stimulation, the participants received stimulation at detectable threshold levels (approximately one-half of the &#x02018;twitch&#x02019; levels) for 2 minutes, followed by stimulation at the undetectable level of 1&#x02009;mA for the remaining 28 minutes of the session.

The targeted acupoints were as follows (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>): PC-6 (<italic>Neiguan</italic>), 2 inches (<italic>i.e.</italic> 2 <italic>cun</italic>) proximal to the palm between the palmaris longus tendon and flexor carpi radialis tendon; TH-5 (<italic>Waiguan</italic>), 2 inches (<italic>i.e.</italic> 2 <italic>cun</italic>) proximal to the skin crease on the back of the wrist between the ulna and radius bones; LI-4 (<italic>Hegu</italic>), at the midpoint of the second metacarpal bone on the radial side; and PC-8 (<italic>Laogong</italic>), midway between the second and third metacarpals on the palmar side.</p></sec><sec><title>EEG recordings</title><p>The cue-induced craving EEG evaluation investigated brain event-related potentials (ERPs) and specifically probed the production of the P300 wave response while the participants viewed photographs of objects from three categories: neutral (furniture such as chairs, lamps, baskets); non-drug-related arousing (shark attack, pointed gun, ferocious barking dog); and drug-related. The drug-related photographs were specific to the participant&#x02019;s drug of choice (scenes of drug paraphernalia and drug use). An oddball visual procedure presented the images in a pseudorandom order using the following proportions: 60% common/frequent neutral pictures and 40% target/rare pictures (20% drug-related and 20% arousing). Two successive rare images were never presented. The images were displayed for 750&#x02009;ms at 1-second intervals. The participants were asked to differentiate between drug scenes and non-drug scenes (neutral or arousing) by pressing a corresponding button on a computer mouse. The first EEG/ERP session was conducted after a short acclimation period in the recording chamber. A second EEG/ERP session was conducted 26 minutes later, after the participants had handled neutral objects such as common office items (<italic>e.g.</italic>, pens, paper, staplers) for 7 minutes. A third EEG/ERP session was conducted 26 minutes later, after the participants had handled drug-related objects (<italic>e.g.</italic>, drug paraphernalia). The cocaine-dependent participants were allowed to handle paraphernalia associated with smoked (crack) or snorted cocaine. The cannabis-dependent participants were allowed to handle and smell a used pipe that contained residual byproducts of burned marijuana. At four times during the ERP sessions, the participants answered two questions of &#x0201c;Would you use cocaine (or marijuana) now if you could?&#x0201d; (Yes/No) and &#x0201c;What is your desire to use cocaine (or marijuana) right now?&#x0201d;. The responses to the latter question were evaluated using a 100-mm visual analog scale from &#x02018;none at all&#x02019; to &#x02018;extreme&#x02019;. Regarding the timing, the questions were asked before and after the participants handled the neutral objects before the second EEG/ERP session, and before and after the participants handled the drug-related objects before the third EEG/ERP session.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>ERPs were analyzed using Brain Vision Analyzer version 1.05.0004 (Brain Products GmbH, Germany).

The results of the present pilot study suggest that TEAS does not cause robust changes in measures of drug use and daily drug cravings in cocaine- and cannabis-dependent participants who were not seeking treatment for their dependence. Neither drug use nor drug cravings were significantly decreased during 3.5&#x02009;days of TEAS treatment. However, several interesting changes in other mood states were revealed, which may collectively play a role in drug abuse treatment strategies. Several ratings in the daily mood assessments were reduced in the cocaine- and cannabis-dependent participants, and the response to the drug-related pictures during the EEG assessment in the cocaine-dependent participants showed a nominal, but not statistically significant, reduction following TEAS treatment.</p><p>We analyzed the EEG/ERP P300 profiles for peak amplitude and latency to peak response with particular interest in the responses to drug-related cues for cocaine or cannabis. The altered peak voltage of the P300 EEG/ERP response in the cocaine-dependent participants may indicate a reduced response to drug-related cues. Despite a lack of statistical significance, the reduction in the P300 ERP amplitudes during the presentation of cocaine cues in the cocaine-dependent participants was consistent and remarkable, given the relatively small sample size and relatively short duration of TEAS treatment in the present study. Although subjective drug cravings and drug use in the cocaine-dependent participants was not reduced by TEAS treatment, examination of the subjective mood assessments in the cocaine-dependent participants revealed that TEAS treatment led to significant reductions in self-reports of anxiety, tension/agitation, and irritability, while concentration was improved. The present examination of the effects of TEAS treatment on cannabis cue reactivity and cravings assessed by the EEG/ERP P300 profiles for peak amplitude and latency to peak response in the cannabis-dependent participants did not reveal altered responses to cannabis-related cues. Similarly, subjective cannabis craving and self-reported use did not change as a result of TEAS treatment in the cannabis-dependent participants. TEAS treatment resulted in significant reductions in irritability and tension/agitation in the cannabis-dependent participants. These changes in the mood ratings may be of particular interest for cannabis dependence, because changes in these measures were previously identified as hallmarks of cannabis withdrawal during early abstinence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Collectively, the findings indicate that TEAS treatment did not result in robust reductions in the EEG/ERP cue reactivity to drug-related pictures in either the cocaine- or cannabis-dependent participants. However, the observed reductions in negative mood measures resulting from TEAS treatment may have direct relationships with the modest reductions in drug cue reactivity observed for cocaine dependence. Improvements in these behavioral events may be useful in treatment settings, as previously noted by Meade <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These authors previously demonstrated that, in addition to positive effects of TEAS as an adjunct treatment, there were marked improvements in mental health and self-reported physical health as a result of TEAS treatment compared with sham treatment during an outpatient follow-up period after inpatient opiate detoxification.</p><p>Several limitations of our study should be noted. The first is the duration of the assessment period for drug use, particularly for the cocaine-dependent participants. Significant alterations in cocaine use may not be observable during a 3-day assessment period. Since cocaine use is typically episodic and highly variable from day to day in many cocaine abusers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a true assessment of use may require several weeks. The brief drug-use assessment period would not appear to be a limitation for the cannabis-dependent subjects, because their use was regular and multiple times per day. Second, for practical reasons and equipment limitations, our treatments in this outpatient study were only administered twice a day, and only separated by 3 to 4 hours. Although changes in brain endogenous opioid levels have been observed from minutes to 1 hour after stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the effects on cocaine place preference can last for 24 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], a proposal of three treatments per day separated by approximately 6 hours may be the most effective way to produce a maximal and sustained neurochemical alteration (Dr. Ji-Sheng Han, personal communication). Hence, there may be differential effects of TEAS treatment administered three times a day at 6 hours apart, compared with our TEAS treatment delivered only twice a day at 3 to 4 hours apart. Similarly, while a previous study of opioid dependence demonstrated positive effects of TEAS treatment using a similar number of TEAS treatment days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], more robust findings from studies on opioids and positive findings for other drugs of abuse may result from TEAS periods with a greater number of treatment days. Third, the present study used alternating stimulation at 2 and 100&#x02009;Hz. Although this method reliably increases endogenous opioids that activate mu, sigma, and kappa opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], antagonism of the effects of cocaine within the opioid system may primarily rely on the activation of kappa receptors. Ren <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] showed that stimulation at 100&#x02009;Hz, which acts primarily on kappa receptors, caused increases in the dynorphin levels and was effective for attenuating cocaine-induced conditioned place preference in rats. Finally, we chose to recruit individuals who were not seeking treatment for their dependence as a more rigorous test of the procedure. Additional studies will be needed to address these limitations, increase our sample size, and adjust the experimental protocols to explore the potential efficacy of TEAS on cocaine and cannabis use and cravings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Pharmacological and alternative medicine treatments for cocaine and cannabis abuse have not been developed to date. The present results suggest that the TEAS protocol used in this trial alone is not sufficient to significantly alter cocaine and cannabis use, drug cue reactivity, or drug cravings in cocaine- or cannabis-dependent individuals who are not seeking treatment for their dependence. However, it may be premature to state TEAS treatment is ineffective for use in cocaine or cannabis dependence, until TEAS treatment has been evaluated under a range of parameters, including longer treatment durations and different frequencies, and the contribution, if any, to reductions in negative moods can be assessed. Future assessments will need to evaluate the ability of TEAS to contribute to more comprehensive treatment regimens.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SEL designed the study as the principal investigator, and provided critical input for the manuscript preparation.
