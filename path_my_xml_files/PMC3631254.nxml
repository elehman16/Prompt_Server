A pioneering paper reported an analgesic effect in healthy humans after 30 minutes of CNP-stimulation using three nested whole head coils. We aimed to devise and validate a stimulator with a novel design entailing a multitude of small coils at known anatomical positions on a head cap, to improve applicability. The main hypothesis was that CNP delivery with this novel device would also increase heat pain thresholds. Twenty healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, sham-controlled, crossover study. Thirty minutes of PEMF (CNP) or sham was applied to the head. After one week the other treatment was given. Before and after each treatment, primary and secondary outcomes were measured. Primary outcome was heat pain threshold (HPT) measured with thermal quantitative sensory testing. Other outcomes were warmth detection threshold, and aspects of cognition, emotion and motor performance. As hypothesized heat pain threshold was significantly increased after the PEMF stimulation. All other outcomes were unaltered by the PEMF but there was a trend level reduction of cognitive performance after PEMF stimulation as measured by the digit-symbol substitution task. Results from this pilot study suggest that our device is able to stimulate the brain and to modulate its function. This is in agreement with previous studies that used similar magnetic field strengths to stimulate the brain. Specifically, pain control may be achieved with PEMF and for this analgesic effect, coil design does not appear to play a dominant role. In addition, the flexible configuration with small coils on a head cap improves clinical applicability.</p><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Dutch Cochrane Centre <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=1093">NTR1093</ext-link>

The best known method is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and uses strong (1&#x02013;2 T) and short (&#x0003c;1 ms) pulses. In 1985 Barker <italic>et al</italic>. described the induction of involuntary movement by stimulation of the motor cortex which indicates that TMS is able to induce action potentials in the brain <xref rid="pone.0061926-Barker1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Weaker magnetic stimulation can be achieved with small or large coils, either commercially available or custom built. This technique often uses pulsed stimulation and is then referred to as pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) stimulation. Recently, some evidence has been found that exposure to MRI systems may change mood <xref rid="pone.0061926-Rohan1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, brain metabolism <xref rid="pone.0061926-Volkow1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and brain activation <xref rid="pone.0061926-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In humans PEMF appears to have both analgesic <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and antidepressant <xref rid="pone.0061926-Martiny1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> effects.</p><p>Often commercial stimulation systems (e.g. NeoSync, Inc., PEMF Systems, Inc., CNP Therapeutics Inc.) use a limited number of small coils while in research the use of one or more Helmholz coils is often reported <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Helmholz coils are large coils that fit around the head and generate a relatively homogeneous magnetic field. The disadvantage of few coils as well as of very large coils is that it is difficult to investigate which stimulation sites in the brain are most effective for inducing a specific effect. Large coils are also impractical due to their size and weight which impedes their wide spread therapeutic use in either a clinical or even an extramural i.e. domestic setting. By far the most practical stimulation system for wide spread clinical and extramural use would be a small magnetic stimulator that is easy to use and able to selectively stimulate specific brain areas. It should also be able to generate any type of magnetic wave to maximize applicability. The use of multiple light coils on a head cap eliminates subject motion relative to the coils and the coils may be positioned over known anatomical sites. We selected the 10/20 system as used in EEG for the positioning of the coils because this allows for easy coupling of newly found knowledge to EEG findings and to functional neuroanatomy because the brain structures under the electromagnets are known <xref rid="pone.0061926-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. One of our aims was the construction of such a stimulation system.</p><p>The complex neural pulse (CNP<sup>TM</sup>) <xref rid="pone.0061926-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> has been used as a PEMF at low field strength and it was shown to have analgesic efficacy in snails <xref rid="pone.0061926-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, rats <xref rid="pone.0061926-Martin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and humans <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. A recent study in humans applied PEMF with the gradient coil of an MR scanner and found a negative correlation between field strength and brain activation in a network of brain areas that respond to pain <xref rid="pone.0061926-Robertson2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. A second aim of the present study was to investigate the analgesic potency of the CNP when administered with our own device.</p><p>The underlying mechanism of PEMF induced analgesia is poorly understood. There is some evidence for endogenous opioid mediation of PEMF analgesia in animals<xref rid="pone.0061926-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061926-Prato1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, but in humans the mechanism is largely unknown. It is known that mood has a strong influence on pain experience <xref rid="pone.0061926-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and improved mood is thus a potential mediator of PEMF analgesia, especially because PEMF was reported to improve mood in depressed patients <xref rid="pone.0061926-Martiny1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Further, dopaminergic tone is correlated to mood and also sensitive to PEMF and TMS <xref rid="pone.0061926-Pogarell1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061926-Strafella1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. In addition, dopamine has a modulatory effect on pain (for review see <xref rid="pone.0061926-Potvin1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>) making dopaminergic tone another, although related, possible mediator of PEMF analgesia. Non-invasive assessment of dopaminergic tone in humans requires PET or SPECT imaging. However, there are behavioral markers that are safer, quicker, cheaper and more practical: the speed of finger tapping and the size of handwriting are both highly significantly correlated with central dopaminergic tone as established by PET or SPECT<xref rid="pone.0061926-Volkow2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061926-Knstler1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Our final aim was to find evidence for mediation of an analgesic effect by mood or dopamine release.</p><p>We applied the CNP <xref rid="pone.0061926-Thomas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and studied its effects on the experience of experimentally induced heat pain in healthy volunteers. We also assessed emotional state as a potential mediating factor of analgesia and aspects of motor and cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This research has been approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen.

The within-subjects design was balanced for treatment order. All subjects received a sham and an active treatment at the same time of the day with one week in between. By using a random number generator on the stimulus PC, neither the subject nor the experimenter was aware of the nature of the treatment. The code was broken after all twenty subjects had been treated twice. Also, two field strengths were tested in order to investigate dose (field strength) effects on the outcome parameters: HIGH (amplitude 1.1 mT) and LOW (amplitude 0.4 mT). Half of the subjects received HIGH and half received LOW as their active treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2d7"><title>Intervention</title><p>During a session the volunteers were seated behind a desk while wearing the treatment cap. Each session consisted of four blocks of fifteen minutes each. The blocks were identical in all aspects, except that during the first and last block only zeroes were sent to the DAC. During the second and third block either PEMF (LOW or HIGH field, one option per subject) or sham (all subjects) was applied through all electromagnets so that a total of 30 minutes of PEMF or sham stimulation was applied in each session.

This does not have a direct influence on the first time derivative of the field strength, which is proportional to the induced current according to Faraday's law. Every integer was converted to a voltage and presented for approximately 3 ms, resulting in a wave duration of just under 2.5 s. For the LOW treatment all numbers in the digital wave were divided by two (the relationship between this digit and the resulting field strength is not linear).

The effect size as indicated by Cohen's d is 'medium' to 'large'. During sham exposure HPT increased by approximately 1&#x000b0;C. In addition, the PEMF effect added approximately 0.7&#x000b0;C to the HPT. Thus the HPT increasing effects of PEMF were similar in magnitude to the habituation effect that developed over the course of the experiment. Taking into consideration that the thermode temperature increased by 0.3&#x000b0;C/s, treated subjects allowed the already hot thermode to warm up for an additional 2 to 3 seconds on average.</p><p>Our PEMF effects on tQST results are in agreement with a previous study <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> which used a very similar time varying magnetic pulse. Despite a significant number of methodological differences (within-subjects vs. between-subjects, nineteen radial electromagnets vs. three orthogonal Helmholz coils) they found a similar result to ours, being an increased HPT due to PEMF treatment and no treatment effect on WDT. They also observed that PEMF effects were more pronounced in women which is compatible with the fact that our effect was robust and that our population was mainly (90%) female. The increased HPT also confirms that the current arrangement of coils, using the international coordinate system derived from EEG, is effective for the induction of experimental analgesia. The trailing zeros in the CNP as described in the patent <xref rid="pone.0061926-Thomas3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> do not seem to be necessary for its analgesic effect because we omitted them in this study.</p><p>This study shows that the PEMF effect appeared to be quite specific for HPT. PEMF treatment had no effect on WDT, indicating that the ability to detect warmth, a non-noxious thermal stimulus, remained unaltered by the pulsating magnetic field. This is in agreement with the literature <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and it is a very advantageous property for an analgesic treatment: to only reduce pain without reducing a person's sensitivity. Finger tapping speed, handwriting, PANAS and POMS results were all unaffected by the PEMF treatment.</p><p>The digit to symbol substitution task showed a non-significant treatment effect with worse performance after PEMF than after sham. The fact that this did not reach significance was because we did not have a hypothesis about cognition so this is a result from an explorative analysis with a conservative multiple comparisons correction. However, there is some biological plausibility because it was recently shown that cognitive control and sensory processing can both be influenced simultaneously by one intervention or manipulation <xref rid="pone.0061926-Gard1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These considerations combined with the need for analgesic treatments without cognitive side effects, motivate the future study of cognitive performance after PEMF treatment.</p><p>In order to gather information concerning the working mechanism of the induced analgesia, we also measured two emotional parameters and two motor parameters that are sensitive to dopaminergic tone. No treatment effects on the emotional state were found so we have no evidence that emotional changes were mediating the PEMF effects on HPT. We also found no treatment effects on the two behavioral indices of dopaminergic tone. Taken together these findings suggest that PEMF analgesia is not mediated by changes in emotion or in central dopaminergic tone.</p><p>The fact that pain tolerance was increased does not identify a single neuroanatomical structure as the mediating location because the level of pain tolerance is the end result of the total function of the anterolateral somatosensory system: nociceptors, thin fibers, dorsal horn, ventral commissure, spinothalamic tract, periaqueductal grey and reticular formation, ventromedial, mediodorsal and intrathalamic thalamus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. The latter two are involved in the emotional aspects of pain such as tolerability and suffering. Therefore, these are plausible areas for mediation of increased pain tolerance and in fact a relatively recent study found support for the notion that brain activation in insula and anterior cingulate cortex as measured with fMRI was decreased by PEMF stimulation with the CNP<xref rid="pone.0061926-Robertson2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The mechanisms by which electromagnetic fields can influence biological systems are not yet fully understood. An abundance of mechanisms have been proposed and a large number of them have been confirmed experimentally (for review see e.g. <xref rid="pone.0061926-Challis1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> or <xref rid="pone.0061926-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>). The most established mechanism is induction of an electrical potential due to changing magnetic flux density (Faraday's law). As a result ion motion (current) is altered, which in turn induces changes in synaptic potentials. Because synaptic potentials determine the likelihood of an action potential, this is a plausible mechanism for PEMF effects on neuronal activity: PEMF <italic>per se</italic> may not induce action potentials like TMS does, but it can change the temporal probability of action potentials. A recent paper found evidence for magnetic sensitivity in the low mT range of cryptochrome, a protein that is expressed throughout the tree of life including humans <xref rid="pone.0061926-Maeda1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Human cryptochrome has indeed been shown to be sensitive to magnetic fields <xref rid="pone.0061926-Foley1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Cryptochrome is thus a candidate mediator of the analgesic <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and antidepressant <xref rid="pone.0061926-Martiny1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> effects of PEMF on humans. Mediation of PEMF effects by cryptochrome, being a protein sensitive to both light and magnetic fields, could also explain why PEMF effects were reported to be highly dependent on lighting conditions <xref rid="pone.0061926-Prato2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>We found no differences between the effects induced by the two field strengths: apparently the intensities were equipotent. Dose-dependency of PEMF effects is generally very steep and has been described for different systems to occur below 1 mT <xref rid="pone.0061926-Robertson2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, below 500 nT <xref rid="pone.0061926-Prato3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and even below 50 nT <xref rid="pone.0061926-Cuppen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. It appears that the two field strengths used in our study (0.4 and 1.1 mT) both induced the maximum effect.</p><p>Concerning the penetration depth of our stimulation, it is often heard that TMS penetrates 1&#x02013;2 cm, although H-coils can reach up to 6 cm <xref rid="pone.0061926-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Such statements are incomplete and inaccurate because what is implied is that TMS can induce action potentials at these depths. It is unknown whether magnetic fields have to induce action potentials in order to be effective at modulating biological functions. On the contrary, weak pulsed fields (PEMF) are effective in humans <xref rid="pone.0061926-Shupak1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0061926-Martiny1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> and it is highly unlikely that the direct induction of action potentials in the brain plays a role here. The magnetic permeability of biological tissues is very similar to that of air or vacuum meaning that the main factor determining the field strength of low frequency PEMF in the brain, apart from the current and the coil design, is the distance to the coil.</p><p>Thresholds for PEMF effects on living systems have been estimated at 500 nT <xref rid="pone.0061926-Prato3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and even 50 nT <xref rid="pone.0061926-Cuppen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Flux density was measured in our study at five distances from the coils with flux density values between 1 mT and 0.1 mT. These values fit very closely to an exponential dependence of flux density on distance. Extrapolating using this exponential dependence predicted flux densities of 500 and 50 nT to be reached at 2.2 and 2.9 cm from the coil respectively. This strengthens the notion that our stimulator induces biologically relevant magnetic fields in the brain <xref rid="pone.0061926-Okamoto1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>In terms of safety, our newly designed magnetic stimulator conformed to the assessment criteria of the Dutch Work Group for the Classification of Instruments in University Hospitals (Wibaz) and is a class I, type B device according to the IEC 601-1988 norm. This indicates that the device is electrically safe to be used on humans. With regard to neurological safety, epileptic seizures are the main serious adverse event that can potentially be induced by magnetic stimulation. However, the risk of inducing seizures is controllable because it is a function of frequency and field strength<xref rid="pone.0061926-Wassermann1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Importantly, the stimulator described here falls well below the field strength described in the above paper: our field strength was not 100&#x02013;220% <xref rid="pone.0061926-Wassermann1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> of the motor evoked potential threshold, but in the order of 0.05%. Therefore it seems highly unlikely that induction of epileptic seizures is a risk with the current setup. None of the volunteers could detect the stimulation or had adverse effects or other complaints so that the PEMF procedure appears to be completely safe.</p><p>A strength of this study is that we provide data from an actual measurement of the magnetic field whereas this is frequently omitted in PEMF reports. Additionally, we confirmed our prediction that HPT would increase after PEMF treatment and we measured many additional parameters. This study was sham-controlled and volunteers detected no difference so it was truly double-blind for the whole duration of the experiment. Although the treatment groups (PEMF-sham and sham-PEMF) were not fully balanced with respect to age, gender and handedness, the use of a crossover design precluded confusing group effects for treatment effects. In the paired design every subject served as their own control thus reducing the obscuring effects of intersubject variability.</p><p>As a limitation, the generalizability of this trial is limited because it was performed in a relatively small group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;20) consisting mostly of young women. Another limitation is that although the device permits considerable anatomical specificity of the PEMF stimulation, for this pilot we stimulated all locations simultaneously. Future studies should aim to elucidate the relative contribution of the individual electromagnets.</p><p>In summary, we built a magnetic stimulator capable of producing fluctuating magnetic fields with arbitrary temporal patterns within the 0&#x02013;300 Hz frequency range. The use of an established coordinate system allows studies with anatomical specificity and integration with existing (EEG) literature. The use of nineteen small electromagnets makes it possible to stimulate specific neuroanatomical targets with the aim of modulating their function. This setup allows double-blind, sham-controlled experiments with arbitrary wave shape magnetic stimulation. These advantages, in addition to low cost and high safety, make this technology widely applicable for functional and clinical studies of the brain. As expected PEMF stimulation of the brain with this device caused increased pain tolerance in healthy subjects. At the same time, sensitivity to non-noxious thermal stimuli remained unchanged. We found no evidence for changes in emotional state and motor parameters that correlate with dopaminergic tone, thus it is unlikely that these would have mediated the changes in pain sensation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0061926.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
