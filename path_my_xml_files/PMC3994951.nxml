Several genetic studies (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) have identified loci associated with diabetic nephropathy, and recent evidence suggests that diabetes and its complications may also involve epigenetic factors (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Epigenetic mechanisms triggered by hyperglycemia and related diabetic conditions may be particularly important since long-term complications appear to develop in some patients with diabetes even after improved glucose control.</p><p>The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) (1983&#x02013;1993) demonstrated that intensive therapy aimed at near-normal levels of glycemia (HbA<sub>1c</sub> level) profoundly reduced the development and progression of microvascular complications in patients with type 1 diabetes compared with conventional therapy aimed at maintaining clinical well-being (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). After DCCT end, the cohort was followed up annually in the observational Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) study (1994 to present) when all subjects were encouraged to practice intensive therapy. Since year 4 of the EDIC, both groups have maintained mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of &#x0223c;8% (64 mmol/mol). Surprisingly, despite nearly equivalent glycemic control during the EDIC, complications continued to develop in subjects in the original DCCT conventional therapy group at significantly greater rates than in participants in the original intensive therapy group (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). This phenomenon has been termed &#x0201c;metabolic memory.&#x0201d; Similar &#x0201c;legacy effects&#x0201d; of prior strict glycemic control were also observed in the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Thus, an early period of better glycemic control appears to have sustained influence on long-term complications, and the adverse effects of early hyperglycemia may be &#x0201c;imprinted&#x0201d; on target tissues over time. Recently, epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the damaging effects of hyperglycemia and in experimental models of metabolic memory (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>Epigenetics refers to mechanisms that can modify gene expression and phenotype without changes in the underlying DNA sequence (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Although different cell types in a person are assumed to have identical DNA sequences, they possess distinct differences in their epigenetic information, such as DNA methylation and post-translational modifications (PTMs) of histone proteins contained in the chromatin. Epigenetic modifications can occur when individuals are exposed to environmental factors, such as infections and nutritional changes, and can predispose them to diseases such as diabetes (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Nucleosomes, the basic subunits of chromatin, consist of octamers of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, wrapped by DNA. PTMs of histones (e.g., acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitylation) form an epigenetic layer together with DNA methylation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), which affects gene transcription. Acetylation of histones at lysine residues is generally associated with transcriptionally active genes, whereas lysine methylation leads to gene activation or repression, depending on the specific site and level of methylation (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Alterations in histone PTMs and their interactions with other nuclear proteins at gene promoters or other regulatory regions can lead to relatively stable epigenetic changes that alter chromatin structure. In turn, this can lead to long-term dysregulated gene expression and disease progression.</p><p>Recent studies using vascular and inflammatory cells treated in vitro with high glucose (HG), or target cells and tissues derived from models of diabetes complications, provide strong evidence that alterations in epigenetic histone PTMs play key roles in diabetes-induced inflammation and vascular complications, and potentially in the metabolic memory phenomenon (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). However, studies have not yet been performed directly in humans with diabetes and metabolic memory. To examine whether epigenetic mechanisms are related to glycemic history, the progression of complications and metabolic memory in human diabetes, we explored variations in the profiles of key histone PTMs at promoter regions in peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes obtained from selected EDIC cohort subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><p>The human research study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at City of Hope National Medical Center and the EDIC clinics.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Subjects and Experimental Design</title><p>The DCCT enrolled 1,441 subjects who were followed up for an average of 6.5 years until study closeout in 1993.

ChIP-enriched DNA samples and no antibody controls were purified from monocytes and lymphocytes of each subject. Five sets of ChIP-enriched DNA samples (H3K9Ac, H3K4Me3, and H3K9Me2 in lymphocytes; and H3K9Ac and H3K4Me3 in monocytes) from the 60 patients were obtained (299 samples total; one monocyte H3K4Me3 ChIP from the control group failed). Each sample was then labeled and hybridized to Roche Nimblegen human 720 K RefSeq promoter tiling arrays (ChIP-chip) to profile these histone PTMs at promoter regions (&#x02212;3,200 to 800 base pairs [bp] relative to the transcription start sites [TSSs] of 22,542 RefSeq genes) genome wide.

Probe-level Cy5/Cy3 log2 ratios on each array were shifted to render the Tukey biweight mean of log2 ratios to 0. The complete data from all the samples from case and control subjects in each data set were then subjected to quantile normalization. For H3K4Me3 and H3K9Me2, Loess normalization was initially applied to each sample to correct dye bias found on some of the samples by MA plots. Regions enriched with histone modifications (i.e., containing at least four consecutive probes with log2 ratio greater than the 85th percentile of all the probe-level log2 ratios on each array) were identified using TAMAL (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) in each of the 60 samples. Commonly H3K9 acetylated regions among all these samples were then designated as regions acetylated in at least 25% of samples and at least 350 bp in length. The associations between acetylation and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels at different time periods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) in these commonly acetylated regions were analyzed using Pearson correlation coefficients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> legend).

Hypermodified regions in control subjects were similarly identified at commonly modified regions in the control subjects. The comparisons were not adjusted for batches because of good technical reproducibility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 4</ext-link>), the sample processing (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>), as well as the normalization applied for systemic bias correction.

As a first step toward understanding the link between epigenetics and metabolic memory in humans, we examined whether there were specific differences in genome-wide PTMs of promoter histones in monocytes and lymphocytes between subjects whose complications progressed and those whose complications did not (case vs. control subjects). Among case subjects drawn from the conventional group with a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 10.2% (88 mmol/mol) during the DCCT, complications progressed markedly in the EDIC, during which the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level was 8.7% (72 mmol/mol). Conversely, among control subjects drawn from the intensive therapy group with a mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level of 6.4% (46 mmol/mol) during the DCCT, complications showed no progression in the EDIC, during which the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level rose to 7.1% (54 mmol/mol). The conventional group of the entire DCCT/EDIC cohort showed progression of complications during the EDIC even though the HbA<sub>1c</sub> level improved from &#x0223c;9% (75mmol/mol) during the DCCT to &#x0223c;8% (64 mmol/mol) during the EDIC, and the intensive therapy group showed substantially less progression even though the HbA<sub>1c</sub> level rose from &#x0223c;7% (53 mmol/mol) during the DCCT to &#x0223c;8% (64 mmol/mol) during the EDIC. Thus, our case and control subjects represent the extremes of the respective original conventional and intensive therapy groups in which the metabolic memory effect was initially documented (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and thus provided a good platform for this study.</p><p>The rationale for studying monocytes and lymphocytes was as follows. These cells have inflammatory and immune response properties and can be obtained in a relatively noninvasive fashion during a regular visit. Next, the epigenome, unlike the genome, is cell type&#x02013;specific. Moreover, evidence shows that inflammation and abnormal immune responses accompanied by monocyte and lymphocyte infiltration play major pathogenic roles in diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), two complications evident in our case group, but not in the control group. Finally, reports (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) show that hyperglycemia itself can induce histone lysine acetylation and methylation in monocytes at inflammatory- and diabetes-related gene loci.</p><p>As the first study to profile multiple histone modifications at promoters genome-wide in lymphocytes and monocytes of participants from a diabetes clinical trial, we analyzed the initial overall correlations across the five histone PTM data sets. This revealed high correlations between the same active marks (H3K9Ac and H3K4Me3) in different cell types (monocytes and lymphocytes), modest correlations between the two active marks in the same cell types, and poor correlations between the repressive mark (H3K9Me2) and either of the active marks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1">Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8</ext-link>). Notably, through identification of promoter histone&#x02013;modified regions genome-wide, we found significantly greater H3K9Ac-enriched regions in the monocytes of case subjects than in those of control subjects, whereas the other PTMs showed no significant differences. Furthermore, we identified 38 H3K9 hyperacetylated promoters in case subjects, none of which was differentially modified in the other PTM data sets. Exploratory evaluation of the functional relevance of these 38 hyperacetylated hotspots revealed they were enriched for several diabetes and diabetes complication&#x02013;related pathways, including TNFR2 signaling. Of note, recent studies show that circulating TNFR1 and TNFR2 levels predict renal function decline in type 1 diabetes (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Of the affected gene promoters detected in case subjects, many were regulated by the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, including key inflammatory genes, transcriptional factors, and others involved in inflammatory and immunological pathways known to operate in diabetes complications (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). This suggests that systemic deregulation induced by histone acetylation at multiple levels in the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway could be related to metabolic memory.</p><p>The associations of HbA<sub>1c</sub> with H3K9Ac levels of the case-control groups combined were further analyzed. The mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> level over extended periods (e.g., DCCT and EDIC combined) was significantly associated with H3K9Ac levels in monocytes among &#x0003e;6,000 commonly acetylated regions across 60 samples. Although this may be expected since we observed hyperacetylation in case subjects, and the case-control groups were defined on the basis of differential HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels during DCCT, interestingly, additional analyses separately among case and control subjects in case hyperacetylated regions showed somewhat stronger correlations with HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels among case subjects (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 5</ext-link>). These results are consistent with those of prior analyses from the DCCT (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) showing a nonlinear relationship between HbA<sub>1c</sub> level and the progression of complications, such that the risk increases exponentially with increasing HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels.</p><p>Our current studies link diabetes complications to the histone acetylation of a set of genes related to inflammation in vivo. Moreover, the acetylation level was correlated with the history of Hb1Ac levels. These results, together, support a possible epigenetic mechanism for metabolic memory, whereby prolonged hyperglycemia may have a cumulative effect over time on H3K9 hyperacetylation in key genome regions that once acetylated, may remain relatively stable and are transmitted by unknown mechanisms. One obvious question here is whether the hyperacetylation of the promoters correlates with increased expression of the corresponding genes. We did not observe significant correlations between them when we profiled gene expression (Affymetrix) in 12 monocyte samples (7 case and 5 control subjects) (data not shown). This could be due to the limited number of samples tested. However, because we also did not find any significant differences in levels of circulating cytokines (serum) between 30 case and 30 control subjects at blood draw (data not shown), we speculate that, unlike the demonstrated epigenetic H3K9Ac levels, gene expression levels at the time of blood draw may not clearly reflect differences between case and control subjects. But, the acetylation could sensitize or render genes more susceptible to self-perpetuating changes in expression in response to external stimuli. Because H3K9Ac level is associated with relaxed chromatin and active genes, higher H3K9Ac levels occurring around a set of complication-related gene promoter regions may lead to a more open or poised chromatin state at these regions. Support also comes from our recent transcriptomic profiling of monocytes, which showed that most genes induced by HG have high levels of promoter H3K9Ac even in the normoglycemic state and are thus preselected or poised for activation by hyperglycemia (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Interestingly, among our 38 case hyperacetylated promoters, the expression of <italic>TNF</italic>,<italic> LTA</italic>,<italic> STAT1</italic>, and <italic>CARD8</italic> were all induced by HG (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>).</p><p>Thus, the most likely scenario is that these genes are more poised for activation in the case group compared with the control group, contributing to various diabetes complications in the long term. This could be a consequence of the early exposure to hyperglycemia (measured by HbA<sub>1c</sub> level), which is known to be associated with increased rates of long-term diabetes complications. Recent evidence indicates that the enzymes mediating histone modifications (writers) are more likely to be inherited epigenetically than the modification itself (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), suggesting that, in our study, key histone H3K9 acetyltransferases may be playing a role. It is also likely that observed acetylation differences are due to either DNA methylation or other heritable epigenetic changes at distant transcription factors, or microRNA-encoding regions. An epigenetic mechanism is also supported by previous experimental models of metabolic memory (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Further investigation is needed to better understand the biological meaning of these phenotypes (hyperacetylation), and their association with diabetes complications and metabolic memory.</p><p>Our results suggest an association between epigenetic changes and microvascular complications, and that hyperglycemia-induced epigenetic changes can potentially explain part of the metabolic memory phenomenon. However, alone they do not prove it, because from a cross-sectional study of this nature one can only infer correlations, not causation. A limitation is that we did not select samples of case and control subjects with different levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> during the DCCT, but equivalent levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> at DCCT baseline and during EDIC. Thus, hyperglycemia prior to the DCCT or during the EDIC could be partly responsible for epigenetic changes that affected the course of complications during the DCCT (or even earlier) and the EDIC. Second, given that case and control subjects were selected on the basis of HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels (high vs. low) during the DCCT and progression of complications (yes vs. no) during the EDIC, any differences in epigenetic changes in case versus control subjects would be expected to also be accompanied by correlations of those changes with HbA<sub>1c</sub> level. Third, the case and control subjects also differ with respect to other characteristics, such as blood pressure and lipid levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), which in turn may have caused some epigenetic differences, and the resulting associations with HbA<sub>1c</sub> level may be secondary to the association of HbA<sub>1c</sub> with these factors. Unfortunately, the sample size is relatively small to conduct multiple linear regression analyses adjusting for any impact of these different factors to provide a more definitive assessment of these relationships. Ideally, an epigenetic profiling of a much larger fraction of the cohort would be needed to address these issues.</p><p>In conclusion, we conducted comprehensive epigenomic profiling using cells from two selected subsets of DCCT/EDIC participants who experienced different rates of complications following a period with different levels of hyperglycemia to explore an epigenetic mechanism for metabolic memory in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Our results suggest that this metabolic memory phenomenon can in part be explained by increased epigenetic differences at key complication-related genes among individuals with higher HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels that may contribute to further progression of complications during EDIC.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db13-1251/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="equal"><p>F.M., Z.C., and S.G. contributed equally to this study.</p></fn><fn id="fn3"><p>See accompanying article, p. <related-article related-article-type="companion" id="d35e1301" vol="63" page="1460" ext-link-type="pmc">1460</related-article>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>Article Information</title><p><bold>Acknowledgments.</bold> The authors thank Dr. David Nathan (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and the Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) publications committee for many helpful discussions and critical comments; the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation for their invaluable support; and all of the study participants for their generosity and interest in the study.
