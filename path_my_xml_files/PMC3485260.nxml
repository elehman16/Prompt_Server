Bone fragility and increased susceptibilities to bone fracture especially in the hip, spine and wrist are common outcomes <xref rid="pone.0048090-NIH1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Worldwide, osteoporosis is a huge health and social concern as approximately 200 million women suffer from this chronic disease <xref rid="pone.0048090-Lane1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In the United States, it is estimated that about 44 million people at age of 50 and older suffer from osteoporosis or low bone mass <xref rid="pone.0048090-Boonen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Postmenopausal women have four times the risk to develop osteoporosis than men due to decreased estrogen levels after menopause and represent the highest risk population <xref rid="pone.0048090-Looker1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Etiological risk factors associated with osteoporosis include poor nutrition, imbalanced cytokines and hormones, and the aging process <xref rid="pone.0048090-Inada1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048090-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. It has been noticed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in the aging process, and contributes greatly to osteoporosis <xref rid="pone.0048090-Syed1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048090-Isomura1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Roles of ROS in the pathology of osteoporosis have been reviewed in detail by Manolagas <xref rid="pone.0048090-Manolagas1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, including influences of the generation and survival of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, disturbance of FoxOs in early mesenchymal progenitors and Wnt signaling pathway, which led to decreased osteoblastogenesis. Excess ROS can damage DNA to form 8-hydroxy-2&#x02032;-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), an oxidative biomarker that has been widely used in human studies to indicate the oxidative stress status <xref rid="pone.0048090-Valavanidis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048090-Pilger1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Green tea polyphenols (GTP, extract of green tea) have shown its osteo-protective effects via decreasing oxidative stress, increasing activity of antioxidant enzymes, and decreasing expression of proinflammatory mediators in rodent models <xref rid="pone.0048090-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and the beneficial effects of GTP on bone health has been reviewed recently <xref rid="pone.0048090-Shen2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Biomarkers of green tea consumption using green tea components have been validated in human studies <xref rid="pone.0048090-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and the GTP supplementation has demonstrated chemopreventive effects on cancer <xref rid="pone.0048090-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, cardiovascular diseases <xref rid="pone.0048090-Jochmann1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and neurodegenerative diseases <xref rid="pone.0048090-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. However, limited information is available about the beneficial effect of consumption of tea or its bioactive components (i.e., GTP) on bone health in postmenopausal women. On the other hand, Tai Chi (TC) exercise, a form of low to moderate intensity mind-body exercise with aerobic and muscular fitness activity, has been demonstrated to potentially benefit bone health in several human studies <xref rid="pone.0048090-Woo1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048090-Qin1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The potential mechanisms include slowing the decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) <xref rid="pone.0048090-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, reducing the oxidative damage, and enhancing the enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) <xref rid="pone.0048090-Goon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Nevertheless, the information on effects of GTP and TC, especially their combined effects, on oxidative stress status of postmenopausal women is lacking.</p><p>In this study, a 6-month placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted to examine the pharmacokinetics of GTP and effects of GTP and TC on mitigation of the oxidative damage biomarker in 171 study participants, who were recruited from a large community pool including 1,065 postmenopausal women.

Study Participants and Design</title><p>The detailed flow of the trial is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048090-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The study participants were screened and enrolled in 2007 from Lubbock, Texas and the surrounding area. The trial was conducted in 2007&#x02013;2008. The study followed the randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trial guidelines from National Institute of Health (NIH). Briefly, a total of 171 community-dwelling postmenopausal women were recruited to participate in this 6-month trial. The recruited participants were randomized in a stratified method based on age (&#x02265;65 or &#x0003c;65 years old), history of green tea consumption, and history of mind-body exercise and assigned to one of the four treatment groups: Placebo group (age: 57.6 (7.5), mean (SD)): medicinal starch 500 mg daily; GTP group (age: 56.5 (5.5), mean (SD)): GTP 500 mg daily; Placebo+TC group (age: 58.3 (7.7), mean (SD)): medicinal starch 500 mg daily and 24-move simplified Yang-style TC training (60 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week), and GTP+TC group (age: 57.6 (6.7), mean (SD)): GTP 500 mg daily and 24-move simplified Yang-style TC training (60 minutes per session, 3 sessions per week). A daily dose of GTP or placebo material was administered as two capsules (250 mg each). Daily consumption of such a GTP dose (500 mg) was equivalent to 4 cups of green tea (about 500 mL). During intervention, all participants were provided with 500 mg elemental calcium and 200 IU vitamin D (as cholecalciferol) daily. The complete study protocol has been reported in detail previously <xref rid="pone.0048090-Shen3" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Inclusion criteria in this study included: postmenopausal women (at least 2 years after menopause) with osteopenia (mean lumbar spine and/or hip BMD T-score between 1 and 2.5 standard deviation (SD) below the normal sex-matched areal BMD of the reference database; normal function of thyroid, liver, and kidney; and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-D, &#x02265;20 ng/mL)). Women were excluded if they had a disease condition or were taking medication known to affect bone metabolism; history of cancer except for treated superficial basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; uncontrolled intercurrent illness or physical condition that would be a contraindication to exercise; depression; cognitive impairment; and if unwilling to accept randomization. Written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before enrollment and the study was approved by the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Institutional Review Board.</p><fig id="pone-0048090-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0048090.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flow chart of the trial.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0048090.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>2. Randomization and Blinding</title><p>A central allocation schedule for randomization was prepared through a computer-generated random sequence of the four treatment allocations. Treatment assignments were then made from separate randomization sequences created for each stratum. Placebo or GTP capsules dispersion was conducted by the site research pharmacist according to the patient&#x02019;s randomization assignment. Research staff and medical staff were unaware of the treatment assignment. Sample analysis, data collection and statistical analysis were blinded to the technical personnel.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>3. Sample Size</title><p>Data from previous studies were used for calculation of sample size. The effect size of 0.75 was assumed based on the baseline mean and standard deviation (SD) values for the primary outcome of urinary 8-OHdG (7.5&#x000b1;2.5 pmol/mL) <xref rid="pone.0048090-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Equal sample size for each group was assumed. The main comparisons are expected to be made as follows: placebo vs. GTP; placebo vs. placebo+TC; and placebo vs. GTP+TC. The sample size was calculated based on detecting a 25% change in urinary 8-OHdG, as compared to placebo group, with a power of 0.8 at &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05. An assumed correlation coefficient of 0.80 between baseline and follow-up measurements within a treatment group was used. The sample size for each group was estimated to be 32 for urinary 8-OHdG based on a previously reported method <xref rid="pone.0048090-Hedeker1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, a total sample size of 128 participants is needed which requires 151 participants at an attrition rate of 15%.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>4. Chemicals and Instruments</title><p>GTP capsules and placebo agents were supplied by Zhejiang Yixin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. China (GTP IND no. 77,470 by FDA of USA). The main GTP components were 46.5% of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), 21.25% of epigallocatechin (ECG), 10% of epicatechin (EC), 7.5% of epicatechin-3-gallate (EGC), 9.5% of gallocatechingallate (GCG), and 4.5% of catechin with the purity higher than 98.5%. Authentic standards of EC, ECG, EGC, and EGCG, beta-glucuronidase, sulfatase, and tetrahydroxyfuran (THF) were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Burdick &#x00026; Jackson (Muskegon, MI). Ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, and sodium dihydrophosphate (NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4) were products of Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). An ESA HPLC-CoulArray system (Chelmsford, MA) was used for detection of GTP components and metabolites as well as urinary 8-OHdG.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>5. Blood and Urine Sample Collection and Processing</title><p>All participants reported to Clinical Research Center at Texas Tech University Medical Center for blood/urine collection. The blood samples were collected between 7&#x02236;00 and 10&#x02236;00 a.m. after an overnight fast with abstinence of food, drink, nicotine, and caffeine. Blood was drawn from a superficial arm vein with a syringe, transferred to a vacutainer, allowed to clot at room temperature, and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min within 2 hours of collection to separate plasma or serum. Urine samples were also collected in acid-washed polyethylene containers. After the total volume of the urine sample was measured to an accuracy of 0.1 ml and recorded, urine was aliquoted. All plasma and urine samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C before analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>6. Extraction of Serum and Urinary GTP</title><p>The protocol for serum GTP extraction was previously published <xref rid="pone.0048090-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Briefly, 200 &#x000b5;L serum samples were incubated with beta-glucuronidase (500 units) and sulfatase (20 units) at 37&#x000b0;C for 45 min to release the conjugated GTP components before repeated extraction with 400 &#x000b5;L methylene chloride to remove proteins and lipids. The aqueous phases were pooled for twice extraction with 700 &#x000b5;L ethyl acetate, and the organic phase was vacuum-dried with a Labconco Centrivap concentrator (Kansas City, MO) and reconstituted for HPLC-ECD analysis.</p><p>Urinary GTP extraction followed a previously established protocol <xref rid="pone.0048090-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Briefly, thawed urine samples were centrifuged and 1 mL supernatant was taken for 60 min incubation with beta-glucuronidase (500 units) and sulfatase (2 units) at 37&#x000b0;C to release conjugated GTP, then directly extracted twice with ethyl acetate. Organic phases were pooled, dried <italic>in vacuo</italic>, and reconstituted in 15% acetonitrile before analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>7. HPLC-ECD Analysis of Serum and Urinary GTP Components</title><p>The method for analyzing serum and urinary GTP conjugates was modified from previously established protocols <xref rid="pone.0048090-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. GTP analysis was conducted in the ESA HPLC-CoulArray system (Chelmsford, MA). The mobile phases consisted of buffer A (30 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>:ACN:THF at 98%: 1.8%: 0.2%, v/v, pH 3.35) and buffer B (15 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>:ACN:THF at 30%: 63%: 7%, v/v, pH 3.45). The Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18 (5 micron, 4.6&#x000d7;250 mm) was used and maintained at 35&#x000b0;C during separation. Flow rate was set at 1 mL/min and a gradient was generated to separate the GTP components within 60 min. The 8 channels of the CoulArray detector were sequentially set at &#x02212;90, &#x02212;10, 70, 150, 230, 310, 380 and 450 mV potentials for the detection of GTP components. The main peaks appeared at &#x02212;10 mV (EGC), 70 mV (EC, EGCG), and 150 mV (ECG). Calibration curves for individual standard GTP component were generated separately, and EGC, EC, EGCG, and ECG were eluted at around 14, 21, 24, and 29 min, respectively. Quality assurance and quality control procedures included analysis of one authentic standard for every set of five samples and simultaneous analysis of a quality control sample daily. The limits of detection were 1.0 ng/mL urine for EC and EGC and 0.5 ng/mL serum for EGCG and ECG, respectively. Urinary GTP components were adjusted by creatinine level to eliminate the variation in urine volume. Urinary creatinine concentration was determined colorimetrically with a Diagnostics Creatinine Kit (Sigma Co).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>8. Measurement of Urinary 8-OHdG</title><p>The procedure for 8-OHdG analysis was modified from established protocols <xref rid="pone.0048090-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Urinary 8-OHdG was extracted from 1 mL urine with the Oasis&#x000ae; HLB 3 cc (60 mg) cartridge. The eluents were dried under ultra-pure N<sub>2</sub> stream and reconstituted in buffer (10 mM ammonium acetate in 2% MeOH, pH 4.3) for analysis with the ESA HPLC-CoulArray system. The HPLC column for 8-OHdG analysis was Waters YMC basicTM column (S3 &#x000b5;m, 4.6&#x000d7;150 mm). The mobile phases consisted of buffer A (10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.3) and buffer B (100% methanol). Flow rate was kept at 0.8 mL/min and a linear gradient (0&#x02013;40% MeOH in 15 min) was applied for chromatographic separation with the peak of 8-OHdG eluted at around 9.5 min. The CoulArray Detector was set at 270, 300, 330, and 360 mv, with the highest peak appeared at 330 mv channel. Authentic standard 8-OHdG was used for qualification by retention times and response patterns, and quantification by calibration curves. Quality assurance and quality control procedures included analysis of one authentic standard for every set of five samples and simultaneous analysis of a spiked urine sample daily. The limit of detection for 8-OHdG was 1 ng/mL urine. The amount of 8-OHdG was adjusted by urinary creatinine concentrations, which was also determined with a Diagnostics Creatinine Kit (Sigma Co).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>9. Statistical Analysis</title><p>All of the data generated were stored in an Excel database and analyzed with SAS software version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Median, mean, standard deviations (SD) and range were calculated for concentrations of 8-OHdG, EC and EGC in urine, and EGCG and ECG in serum. The values were expressed as median and mean &#x000b1; SD unless otherwise stated. To assess the efficacy of GTP, TC, or GTP+TC intervention arms, the statistical evaluation focused on the comparisons among different treatment arms and different time points. For the parameters that were normally distributed (serum EGCG and ECG), repeated measures ANOVA and Bonferroni correction were used to compare differences among means of different times separately for serum EGCG and ECG. For the parameters that were not normally distributed (urinary EC, EGC and 8-OHdG), the Kruskal-Wallis test of one-way ANOVA followed by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare the differences among different treatment groups; and the Friedman&#x02019;s test followed by Wilcoxon signed rank test with Bonferroni correction was used to compare the differences among different time points (urinary EC, EGC and 8-OHdG) given the dependence of measurements. For urinary EC and EGC, the test of difference between GTP and GTP+TC groups at the same time point was done by Wilcoxon rank sum test with Bonferroni correction. To evaluate the effect of dose and time interactions on treatment arms, a nonparametric model for analysis of repeated measurements was applied as previously described <xref rid="pone.0048090-BrunnerE1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

In postmenopausal women, the reduced estrogen level might be a key factor in boosting the ROS level because estrogen has been reported to be able to diminish production of ROS and stimulate the activity of glutathione reductase <xref rid="pone.0048090-Almeida1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. The ability of green tea and GTP as potent ROS scavengers has been well recognized as the basis for its biological activity <xref rid="pone.0048090-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048090-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Previous studies by others and ours showed strong evidence of protective effects of GTP on the capacity of bone formation due to its anti-oxidative stress potentials <xref rid="pone.0048090-Salah1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048090-RiceEvans1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. An animal study shows that urinary excretion of 8-OHdG is a reliable indicator of oxidative stress in postmenopausal rats <xref rid="pone.0048090-Isomura1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. More importantly, urinary 8-OHdG concentration has also been widely used as a DNA oxidative damage biomarker in many human studies <xref rid="pone.0048090-Valavanidis1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, . In this study we observed a significant decrease in urinary 8-OHdG concentrations in postmenopausal women appearing at 1- to 6-months after the GTP intervention as compared to the placebo control group, which further suggests evidence of oxidative stress in the study participants. The result of this study is consistent with the previous finding in HBsAg carrier groups, which also showed statistically significant reduced urinary 8-OHdG after 3-months GTP intervention at 500 mg or 1,000 mg/day <xref rid="pone.0048090-Luo1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>TC exercise has been characterized as a moderate intensity mind-body exercise, coupling muscular activity with an internally directed focus, producing a temporary self-contemplative mental state <xref rid="pone.0048090-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In this study, the TC exercise significantly decreased urinary 8-OHdG concentrations after 3-months intervention as compared with the control group. The effect of exercise on oxidative stress has been reviewed <xref rid="pone.0048090-Finaud1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. It was reported that high-intensity exercise increased oxidative stress biomarkers, including 8-OHdG and malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified low-density lipoprotein in humans, whereas moderate exercise tended to decrease both indices of oxidative stress <xref rid="pone.0048090-Goto1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A recent study has also demonstrated that TC exercise stimulated endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, SOD) and reduced oxidative damage markers (MDA) in middle-aged adults <xref rid="pone.0048090-Goon1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. These reports support our observation that TC, a moderate exercise, reduced oxidative stress in postmenopausal women.</p><p>This is the first study to investigate the combined effects of GTP and TC on oxidative DNA damage in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. An additive effect of GTP supplementation and TC exercise on suppression of oxidative stress was found, as evidenced by a 40% reduction of urinary 8-OHdG in the TC group and 60% reduction in the GTP group alone and a 73% reduction was observed in the GTP+TC group. Results of this study further suggest that a combinative intervention strategy, including dietary supplementation and moderate exercise, may be more effective in promoting bone health in postmenopausal women with osteopenia.</p><p>The strength of our study was in its design as a randomized and placebo controlled clinical trial that could limit the biases usually introduced through the design and data acquisition. Limitations to this study included a relatively small sample size that might limit the statistical power, such as parameters after 1-month of intervention. A wide inter-individual variation found in concentration of biomarkers measured may be due to the individual variations in GTP metabolism enzymes, endogenous susceptibility factors, and/or DNA repair capacity; the large variation in urinary 8-OHdG levels (43.9&#x000b1;42.1 ng/mg creatinine) has also been reported previously in females <xref rid="pone.0048090-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, which supports this finding in our study. The stratified randomization and non-parametric analysis used could limit potential biases (randomization) and increase the power of detecting the differences (non-parametric model analysis). The intent to treat (ITT) analysis could benefit the comparison; however, considering the comparable compliance and adherence rates for the treatment groups, the effect of dropouts might be minimal. On the other hand, the exclusion of dropouts into statistical analysis may not severely affect the statistical power as an originally estimated 140 participants (34 participants for each group) would be sufficient for a power of about 0.90 for the outcome of urinary 8-OHdG level.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides evidence that 500 mg GTP supplement, Tai Chi exercise, either alone or together, can effectively reduce an oxidative stress biomarker in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Based on the putative role of oxidative stress in osteoporosis and the observed beneficial effects on bone health as published previously, these intervention strategies hold the potential as an alternative tool to benefit the bone health in postmenopausal women which deserves further long-term human studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0048090.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
