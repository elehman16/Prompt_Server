This pragmatic randomised study was done to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted community-based care program aimed at optimizing evidence-based management in patients at risk for osteoporosis and fractures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 12-month randomized trial performed in Ontario, Canada. Eligible patients were community-dwelling, aged &#x02265;55 years, and identified to be at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures. Two hundred and one patients were allocated to the intervention group or to usual care. Components of the intervention were directed towards primary care physicians and patients and included facilitated bone mineral density testing, patient education and patient-specific recommendations for osteoporosis treatment. The primary outcome was the implementation of appropriate osteoporosis management.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>101 patients were allocated to intervention and 100 to control.

It affects over 200 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], an estimated 10 million people in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], 4 million people in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and 1.4 million people in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Fragility fractures are the clinical consequence of osteoporosis. While vertebral fractures can cause back pain, loss of height and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], hip fractures have a more significant impact on quality of life leading to loss of function, and admission to long-term care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It is estimated that 1 in 5 people who suffer a hip fracture will die during the first year and less than one third gain their pre-fracture level of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, the economic impact of this condition is considerable, with the total acute care cost of osteoporosis estimated to be over $1.3 billion per year in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], $20 billion in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and over &#x020ac;30 billion in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given that the proportion of people aged 65 and older is increasing, this will likely lead to an even more significant burden of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A substantial body of evidence supports the use of various interventions for the detection and treatment of osteoporosis in high risk patients, and the prevention of related fractures including therapy with calcium, vitamin D, and drugs that decrease bone resorption or increase bone formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For example, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of future osteoporosis-related fracture by 40 to 60% with fracture reduction apparent within a year of starting treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Despite the incorporation of this evidence from randomized trials into clinical practice guidelines, these interventions are considerably underutilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A systematic review found that the proportion of individuals with a fragility fracture who received a diagnostic test for osteoporosis or a diagnosis from a physician ranged from 1.7% to 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, rates of osteoporosis treatment among elderly patients with a fracture of the wrist, hip or vertebrae are less than 10 to 20% in the year following fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>These care gaps highlight the finding that additional effort is needed to ensure that appropriate knowledge translation is achieved to optimize management of osteoporosis in patients at risk of fragility fractures. This study was designed to help fill this knowledge to practice gap. The primary objective of this study was to determine if a multicomponent, community-based strategy could optimize the evidence-based management of people at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Between March 2003 and January 2006, we conducted a randomized trial of a multifaceted community based intervention to optimize care of patients at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures.

The study represented a partnership among consumers, providers and other stakeholders interested in reducing the evidence to practice gap. It was conducted by the Group Health Centre (GHC), a not-for-profit health service community centre, in partnership with Sault Area Hospital (SAH), a facility with 250 active beds.</p><p>Patients were eligible for inclusion in the study if they were community-dwelling, aged 55 years or older, able to give informed consent, and were identified to be at risk for future fracture according to one of the following criteria:</p><p>1. attended the hospital Fracture Clinic for a non-pathological fracture of the vertebrae, hip or wrist or had a BMD in the past year with a T-score of &#x02264;-2.0</p><p>2. attended the hospital Emergency Department with a fall and found to be at high risk for falls as defined by a Timed Up and Go [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] result of greater than 14 seconds; or,</p><p>3. were self-referred or referred by a health care provider because of perceived high risk of fracture and identified as a high risk for falls defined by a Timed Up and Go result of greater than 14 seconds.</p><p>Patients already receiving appropriate pharmacological therapy for osteoporosis as outlined in the Osteoporosis Canada guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention was multifaceted and consisted of providing evidence-based management strategies for osteoporosis to both the patients and their primary care providers. Following randomization, a bone mineral density (BMD) test was facilitated for participants during the intervention if it had not been done within the past year, and the results were sent to the primary care physician along with relevant prescribing information based on the Osteoporosis Canada guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. A complete list of the patient's medications was compiled from two sources and provided to physicians: (1) the patient's pharmacy records; and (2) home visits conducted by the study nurses. Medications associated with increased risk of fracture were identified, and physicians were asked to assess this list of flagged medications (Appendix). The nurse assessed participants allocated to the intervention group in their home and completed the Berg Balance Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], the InterRAI Screener [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], a medication review and an assessment for orthostatic hypotension</p><p>Patients received personalized counseling from the research nurse about osteoporosis, including a written summary of the proposed management plan. They also received educational materials on calcium and vitamin D, risk factors for osteoporosis, and their BMD results. For those few individuals without a primary care physician, the same materials were provided but patients were encouraged to visit a walk-in clinic or the emergency department.</p></sec><sec><title>Allocation and Blinding</title><p>Eligible patients were randomized using a computer generated randomization scheme under supervision of the study biostatistician, into an immediate intervention protocol (IP) group or to usual care. 6 months after randomization participants in the usual care group received the intervention and were thus described as the delayed intervention protocol (DP) group. Patients, treating physicians and outcomes assessors could not be blinded to the fact that patients were participating in an osteoporosis improvement study. All patients were followed-up at 6 and 12 months after the completion of the initial assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes and Data Collection</title><p>The primary outcome under investigation was appropriate osteoporosis management based on the 2002 clinical practice guidelines for osteoporosis in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This was the most current evidence-based guideline available for use at the time of study onset and was generally consistent with current US and UK guidelines. Measurements of outcomes were obtained through patient records (obtained through the Electronic Medical Record) and pharmacy data. A standardized chart review of the Electronic Medical Record was the primary source of data for both groups.</p><p>Secondary outcomes included appropriate osteoporosis management at 12 months and disease-specific quality of life measured using the OPTQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], a quality of life questionnaire for people with osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size and Analysis</title><p>Local pilot data suggested that 40% of people would receive appropriate osteoporosis medications at 6 months. We determined a minimal clinically important difference of 20% and with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, power of 0.80, the patient as the unit of allocation and analysis, and assuming a loss to follow-up of 10%, a total sample size of 200 patients was needed.</p><p>Relative risks with 95% confidence intervals were calculated to assess outcomes between the IP group and the usual care group at 6 months. Fisher's Exact Test was used to evaluate differences in outcomes between the IP group and the DP group at 12 months.

Similarly, a controlled trial by Majumdar et al reported appropriate use of osteoporosis medications to be 40% in the intervention group versus 10% in the usual care control, but only patients with a wrist fracture were eligible for inclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A more recent trial of a case manager for patients with hip fracture found similar results to what was observed in our study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. With the improvements in care delivery observed in the current study, the appropriate osteoporosis treatments were utilized in over one-half of individuals with receipt of the intervention. This result is better than that achieved in most other studies of interventions to enhance implementation of osteoporosis management in broad populations of at-risk patients rather than restricted to patients with recent fracture. Randomized intervention studies directed at physicians and/or patients at high risk of osteoporosis-related fractures conducted by Solomon and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and by Elston Lafata and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] found that screening and treatment rates were either unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or improved by less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. And a recent study of a falls-and-fracture nurse coordinator found that neither falls nor osteoporosis management were enhanced with this intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Thus, the present study achieved an effect size substantially larger than recent studies of similar design.</p><p>The strengths of this study included a randomized study design; an intervention targeted at high-risk patients; the successful partnership between numerous distinct community stakeholders; and that we were able to 'replicate' the intervention's effects 6 months later in the DP group. Moreover, multiple health care providers and community health service groups collaborated in a coordinated assessment and treatment program to deliver evidence-based and timely interventions. Economic analysis of this study is currently underway.</p><p>The limitations of this study included: a short follow-up period of 6 months, which did not allow for longer-term results such as fracture data; and, no blinded outcomes assessors. The lack of blinding of the outcomes assessors could result in bias such as overestimation of the impact of the intervention. However, the primary source of data collection was the administrative data obtained from the Group Health Centre Electronic Medical Record. Even if we consider the lower limit of the confidence interval (for use of appropriate pharmacological therapy [RR] 2.09, 95% <bold>CI 1.29 </bold>to 3.40) as the effect size, we consider this a clinically important change. Given that there is evidence that appropriate management of osteoporosis decreases fractures, it was felt that the use of appropriate management as the primary outcome was relevant. Indeed, when the evidence-base is well-established (such as in osteoporosis management), process-of-care measures are more sensitive to changes in quality of care than outcomes such as mortality or clinical events and are widely recognized as acceptable and appropriate endpoints for quality improvement studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, it is critical that the health care community address the deficiencies that exist with respect to knowledge translation and management of osteoporosis given the significant burden of disease related to fractures. This randomized, community-based study supports implementation of a co-ordinated osteoporosis management strategy for improved care in at-risk individuals, although long-term follow-up should be considered. Many of the assessment and treatment protocols used in this study could be employed in existing clinics and programs to enhance osteoporosis care in a community setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.
