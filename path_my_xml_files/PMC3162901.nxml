In the more severe forms-bleeding from the lungs and acute respiratory distress syndrome-the lethality is high. The treatment proposed for leptospirotic pneumonitis includes just care for patients in critical condition. Clinical and experimental studies point to the involvement of immunological mechanisms in the physiopathology of lung damage caused by leptospirosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate pulse treatment with methylprednisolone &#x000d7; placebo for leptospirotic pneumonitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This is a randomized double-blind clinical trial to test the efficacy of pulse treatment with methylprednisolone in patients with leptospirotic pneumonitis, compared with a placebo. The patients are recruited from three hospitals in the city of Recife, in the Brazilian State of Pernambuco. The exclusion criteria include patients aged under 15 years, a history of hypersensitivity to the use of corticosteroids, the presence of active infection of fungal, tuberculous or bacterial origin apart from the infection by leptospira itself, the presence of hemoconcentration or atypical lymphocyte count on admission to hospital, the presence of co-morbidities that could be responsible for the radiological and gasometric alterations used to diagnose leptospirotic pneumonitis, evidence of recent cranial trauma, neurosurgery, peptic ulcer, and participation in another clinical trial. The patients are followed until they are discharged from hospital or die. The intervention consists of endovenous pulse treatment with 1 g methylprednisolone for three consecutive days in the study group and a placebo in the control group. The primary end-point is mortality from leptospirotic pneumonitis. The secondary end-points are: evolution of lung disease; the occurrence of nosocomial respiratory infection; duration of mechanical ventilation; duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay; duration of hospital stay; occurrence of other infection-related complications; other respiratory complications; and adverse effects of methylprednisolone. The study is designed to recruit 266 patients and has a statistical "power" of 80% to detect a 50% reduction in mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Lung involvement in leptospirosis is a serious manifestation, with a high and variable mortality rate.

It is caused by spirochetes of the genus <italic>Leptospira </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In Brazil, it is a serious public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Clinical manifestations of leptospirosis are variable, ranging from sub-clinical infection or anicteric and self-limited fever to severe and potentially lethal disease with massive pulmonary hemorrhage or acute adult respiratory distress syndrome (SARA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The lungs are involved in leptospirosis in 16 to 70% of cases in different series and the frequency of such involvement has been on the rise and is becoming the main cause of death from the disease, in Brazil and in other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mortality rates for severe lung involvement may be as high as 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Current treatment for leptospirotic pneumonitis is restricted to the basic care provided for patients in a critical condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The pathogenesis of such involvement has not yet been clearly established, although knowledge of the physiopathology of leptospirotic pneumonitis suggests the participation of immunological mechanisms in the development of pulmonary forms of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two principal mechanisms have been suggested: vasculitis mediated by toxins and an exaggerated immune response in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. On the basis of evidence that immunological mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of lung involvement, high doses or a pulse of dexametasone or methylprednisolone have been used in patients with severe lung involvement in leptospirosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The aim of this article is to describe the design and methods to be used for a randomized double-blind clinical trial to evaluate the use of pulse treatment with methylprednisolone compared with a placebo in patients with lung involvement in letptospirosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial - RCT--which evaluates the efficacy of the use of pulse therapy with methylprednisolone compared to a placebo in patients with lung involvement in leptospirosis.

Respiratory auscultation is used to determine the presence of crackles.

It is measured again on the fifth day and categorized as having improved when the value is equal to or greater than 300 and as having declined when the value is less than 300.</p><p>The evolution of hematometry is measured by way of hematocrit and hemoglobin levels and considered when there is a decrease of over three percentage points in hematocrit and 1 g/dl in hemoglobin, with no evidence of blood loss. The intensity of bleeding from the lungs is categorized as slight, when the hematocrit loss is more than three and less than five percentage points, moderate when greater than five but less than ten percentage points, and severe when it is greater than ten percentage points. The evolution of hematometry is evaluated on the fifth day of the patient's follow-up and is categorized as having improved when there has been no drop in hematometry or when it is kept in levels considered acceptable, when blood transfusion is necessary.

During the study, the recruitment of patients from other hospitals will be allowed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, according to the resolutions of the National Health Council (FR - 167386) and was monitored by an external data monitoring committee throughout.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was calculated on the basis of a statistical significance (alpha error) of 5%, a power of 80%, corresponding to a beta error of 20%. The expected mortality for leptospirotic pneumonitis is 30%. For a reduction of 50% in mortality, the expected mortality in patients treated with corticosteroids would be 15%. The sample size calculated was 133 patients for each group. The same parameters were used to obtain statistical significance and a standard deviation of 21 days for duration of mechanical ventilation, giving an expected sample of 33 patients per group. For the duration of ICU stay variable, the same parameters were used to obtain statistical significance and a standard deviation of 8 days, giving an expected sample of 23 patients per group.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The patients with clinical symptoms of leptospirosis admitted to ICUs and hospital wards covered by the study are evaluated by doctors involved in the study to establish the extent to which they meet the criteria for diagnosis of leptospirosis and leptospirotic pneumonitis. Once this has been established, the patient is informed of the study and inclusion depends on his or her consent (signed informed consent), or, if this is not possible, on that of their relatives or legal guardians. The randomization was carried out in advance by drawing lots. The groups to which the patients are allocated are placed in sealed numbered envelopes that are only opened after the informed consents have been signed. The envelopes are opened by a third party not involved in assistance of the patients. Block randomization within each severity stratum is performed in each hospital unit. The degree of severity is stratified according to the APACHE II score. Blocks of ten are used.</p></sec><sec><title>Operationalization of the Study</title><p>The study involves three hospitals and their respective intensive care units and wards for internal medicine and infectious diseases. A coordinating physician is assigned to each hospital to organize evaluation, inclusion and follow-up of the patients for the duration of the study. Two supervising doctors oversee the development of the study by way of monthly meetings with the coordinators of each hospital. To ensure that the study is double-blind, the preparation of the methylprednisolone and of the placebo is carried out in each hospital's pharmacy, duly coded and known only to the nurse involved in the study. The patients in the control group receive an infusion of saline solution identical in volume to that of the dilution received by the intervention group. The nurse involved in the study fill in a card identifying which patients received the placebo and which the methylprednisolone. This card is stored by a physician who did not treat the patients nor takes part in the investigation and will only be opened at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Standardization of Treatments</title><p>All the patients included receive the conventional treatment for leptospirosis, which is the basic care provided for severely ill patients, such as volemic reposition, antibiotics, control of hemodynamics, correction of electrolytic and acid-base disorders, transfusion of hemoderivatives, hemodialysis, early and adequate nutrition, oxygen treatment, and artificial ventilation, when necessary, along with others that are commonly recommended. Decisions regarding the use of drugs and invasive or non-invasive procedures are taken by the patients' attending physicians, in accordance with current good medical practice, based on data from the literature. In view of the high doses of corticosteroid used, all patients are given an anti-parasitic drug (albendazol) and gastric protection (H2 blocker). The specific items of the treatment of leptspirosis are standardized as follows:</p><p>&#x02022; Volemic reposition and the use of vasoactive drugs for lungs congested by pneumonitis follow the criteria established in the algorithms given in Appendices II and III.</p><p>&#x02022; Treatment with antibiotics involves the administration of crystalline penicillin at a dose of 1,500,000 international units every six hours for all patients, regardless how long they have had the disease, or with a 1 g dose of ceftriaxone every twenty-four hours in those allergic to penicillin or where the use of penicillin is not possible. Antimicrobial treatment for associated infections is carried out according to specific recommendations<sup>13,14,31</sup>.</p><p>&#x02022; The recommendation for platelet transfusion is calculated on the basis of one unit of platelet concentrate per 10 kg of the patient's weight, every twelve or eight hours, according to the following criteria: a platelet count (PC) less than or equal to 20,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>even in the absence of bleeding; a PC of less than or equal to 50,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>in cases of more severe bleeding and/or when invasive surgery or biopsies are required<sup>15 </sup>and PC &#x0003c;100,000/mm<sup>3 </sup>in cases where major surgery has been performed.</p><p>&#x02022; Hemodialysis is carried out according to the recommendations outlined in the algorithms contained in Appendices II and III.</p><p>&#x02022; Mechanical ventilation, where necessary, is used in controlled volume mode (VCV with a flow rate of 6 ml/kg, to generate a maximum plateau pressure of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and a maximum inspiratory peak of 45 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) or controlled pressure (PCV with maximum pressure of 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O), and with final positive expiratory pressure sufficient to maintain the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) (the ideal PEEP calculated according to the routine of the hospital ubit: PEEP curve X static complacency; pressure curve X volume; or a test of different PEEPs under SpO<sub>2 </sub>monitoring)<sup>2,3,18,42</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Double data enter is performed using EPI INFO Version 6.0, giving rise to two datasets that can be compared to detect possible typing errors. The dataset is subsequently checked for consistency. The distribution of potential confounding factors in the two treatment groups are compared to check randomization.</p><p>The main analysis will be carried out through comparison of the various outcomes in the two groups, by calculating the percentage distribution and the relative risk. The 95-% confidence interval and the chi-squared test will be used to test statistical association. The t-test will be used to compare the means. The results are considered statistically significant when the p-value is less than 0.05. The efficacy of the intervention is calculated according to the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="1471-2334-11-186-i1.gif"/></disp-formula></p><p>Patients randomly included in the study who, for whatever reason, including transfer to another hospital, do not receive the treatment for which they were assigned are considered to belong to the group to which they were allocated <bold>(intention to treat analysis)</bold>. These will be deemed treatment failure. The patients who do not receive confirmation from the laboratory of diagnosis of leptospirosis will still be included in the analysis.
