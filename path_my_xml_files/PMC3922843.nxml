These endoscopic interventions are minimal invasive treatment options usually done with sedation on an outpatient basis. The aim of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine sedation compared to the standard used propofol TCI sedation during endoscopic oesophageal interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study will be performed as a randomized controlled trial. The first 64 consenting patients will be randomized to either the propofol or the dexmedetomidine group. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires (PSSI, CSSI) (see abbreviations) about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SO<sub>2</sub>, ECG, NIBP, exCO<sub>2,</sub> NICO, sweat conductance measurement, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels and pain and sedation score measured by questionnaires is the primary outcome parameter. Respiratory and hemodynamic complications are surrogate parameters for the secondary outcome parameter &#x0201c;safety&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The acceptance level among patients after propofol sedation is high. Dexmedetomidine is a relatively new representative for procedural sedation. Has this new form of conscious sedation the potential to be safer and more effective for patients and endoscopists than propofol during endoscopic oesophageal interventions?</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial is registered in the ISRCTN Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN68599804/">ISRCTN 68599804</ext-link>). It will be conducted in accordance with the protocol and in compliance with the moral, ethical, and scientific principles governing clinical research as set out in the Declaration of Helsinki (1989) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP). The Departments of Anesthesiology and Gastroenterology &#x00026; Hepatology of the Academic Medical Center of Amsterdam are responsible for the design and conduct of the trial.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Procedural sedation</kwd><kwd>Dexmedetomidine</kwd><kwd>Endoscopic oesophageal intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Early neoplasias in Barrett&#x02019;s oesophagus bear the risk of developing carcinoma (5.1&#x02013;7 per 1000 person-years) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The last two decades, endoscopic treatment has evolved as a valid and less invasive alternative to surgical resection in patients with a low risk of lymph node metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The cornerstone of endoscopic therapy is endoscopic resection (ER), allowing curative removal and histological staging of neoplasia. To prevent recurrences it is important to eradicate all intestinal metaplasia. One approach is radiofrequency ablation (RFA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>However, these procedures are long lasting, uncomfortable and stressful for most patients. Furthermore, they require patients being sedated, but easily arousable in order to provide excellent view to the oesophagus. Conscious sedation is a strategy for improving patient safety and comfort during these procedures. In particular, propofol is known to provide excellent sedation with a rapid onset and termination of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, the most important disadvantage of propofol is the risk of a rapid change from conscious to deep sedation or even general anesthesia with consecutive cardiopulmonary depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, other pharmacological agents that induce an adequate level of sedation without respiratory depression are of increasing interest to clinicians. Dexmedetomidine, a short-acting selective alpha<sub>2</sub>-agonist, possesses anxiolytic, hypnotic, and analgesic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine are easily arousable, yet appear calm and comfortable. When they remain unstimulated, patients return to a hypnotic state. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine provides hemodynamic stability and appears to have no clinically important adverse effects on respiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this trial is to determine the safety and effectiveness of dexmedetomidine compared to the in our hospital standard used propofol sedation, both administered by anesthesia nurses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study takes place at the Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology in the Academic Medical Center (AMC) of the University of Amsterdam beginning July 2012 to Augustus 2013.

An intravenous line is inserted, and 500 ml NaCl 0,9%, glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg and lidocaine 50 mg are administered. Five minutes before insertion of the endoscope, the pharynx is sprayed with 10% xylocaine spray (xylocaine 10%, Astra). 2 L/min of oxygen will be administered by a nasal mask from start of sedation till the end of the endoscopic procedure.</p><p>Group 1 will receive sedation using a propofol Target Controlled Infusion (TCI) system. This TCI system is weight and age adapted pre-programmed using the Marsh pharmacokinetic model to attain a user defined propofol blood target level.</p><p>Sedation among group 2 will be addressed with dexmedetomidine.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (Dexdor&#x000ae;: Orion corporation, Finland) will be started with a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg intravenously over 10 min. After this loading bolus, procedure is started and dexmedetomidine continued throughout the procedure within the range of 0.7 -1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h titrated to a targeted level of sedation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

Additionally sweat production as a sign of stress will be recorded with a wearable ambulatory skin conductance measurement and recording tool suitable for monitoring hot flashes. Furthermore, non invasive cardiac output (NICO) is measured using a Nexfin monitor.</p><p>We will record total procedure time, all drugs, drug amounts and time of administration, time from the end of the procedure until Observer&#x02019;s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4, any respiratory and cardiovascular problems and all actions visibly taken to prevent or treat these problems, such as chin lift/jaw thrust, stimulating the patient, temporary mask ventilation, etc. The following were considered as significant events: a decline in SpO<sub>2</sub> to less than 90%, breathing frequency less than 6 breath/min, or an increase of etCO<sub>2</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;50 mmHg; a change in heart rate to less or more than 20% of baseline or occurrence of any arrhythmia&#x02019;s; blood pressure less or more than 20% of the first blood pressure determined.</p><p>At arrival in the recovery room patients will be monitored by pulse oximetry (SO<sub>2</sub>), ECG and NIBP only.</p><p>The level of recovery from anesthesia and the return of psychomotor fitness will be assessed using the modified Aldrete Score directly at the end of the procedure, at arrival in the recovery room, 30 and 60 min later.

So we decided to use the NRS to estimate patients&#x02019; pain. However, we had to recognize, that the use of a self reporting score -even in only conscious sedated patients- is sometimes complicated and unreliable because of lack of comprehension and communication tools. Therefore, we decided to use a modified version of the Behavioural Pain Scale for not-intubated patients (BPS-NI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] as an additional rating method to assess the pain level among patients with altered level of consciousness. The BPS &#x02013; IN evaluates three behavioural domains (i.e., facial expression, movements of upper limbs and vocalization). Each domain contains four descriptors which are rated on a 1&#x02013;4 scale, and the total BPS value ranges from 3 (no pain) to 12 (most pain).</p><p>Patients with a NRS&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;4 or BPS-NI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;7 will be given an dose of 100 &#x003bc;g alfentanil.</p><p>The amount of alfentanil and propofol used as an adjunct for conscious sedation will also be recorded as part of this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title><bold><italic>Trieger test</italic></bold></title><p>Patients have to accomplish the Trieger test (before and 30 minutes after the procedure) as a means of psychomotoric recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For the Trieger test, patients have to connect points forming a figure with a line using a pen. Missing points as well as the distances of the line from the true points are noted and rated as score post/preprocedural.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>Before procedure patients and GE&#x02019;s have to fill in a questionnaire concerning basic information and specific expectations of the procedure.</p><p>Following the procedure and before discharge, patients and gastroenterologist are urged to fill in questionnaires modified from the Patient Satisfaction with Sedation Instrument (PSSI), respectively Clinical Satisfaction with Sedation Instrument (CSSI), which provide feasible, reliable, and valid assessment of procedural sedation satisfaction for outpatients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Vargo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] developed this score system with finally 4 subscores to describe patients and 3 subscores to describe endoscopists&#x02019; satisfaction. Subscores for the PSSI contain questions about sedation delivery, procedural recall, sedation side effects, and global satisfaction. Subscores for the CSSI refer to corresponding issues among gastroenterologists: Sedation administration, recovery/ post-op and global satisfaction.</p><p>Patients and endoscopists could classify their satisfaction or dissatisfaction during the procedure on a questionnaire ranging from 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;very satisfied to 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;very dissatisfied.</p><p>A follow-up telephone call will be made 24 h later asking questions from part two of the PSSI questionnaire concerning global satisfaction.

Sample size calculation is based on a former study (PAGE- study, ISRCTN 83950185). This study shows significant and thus important differences between the study-groups within the validated patient and gastroenterologists questionnaires. Within these questionnaires the maximum number of points patients or endoscopists can award, is seven reaching from 1 (highly satisfied) to 7 (very dissatisfied). With a true difference between two groups of 0.5 a sample size of 27 subjects per group was necessary to demonstrate a statistical significance for global satisfaction (patient and gastroenterologist) at an &#x003b1; of 0.05 and a 1-&#x003b2; of 0.8. If the calculated drop out is 20%, the estimated sample size will be 32 patients per group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses will be performed using PASW statistics (version 18.0).</p><p>All data will be checked for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnonov test.

However, it is still a matter of discussion which form of sedation is necessary and safe: conscious or deep sedation.</p><p>Propofol TCI combined is a tool for deep sedation, with high levels of acceptance and satisfaction among patients and gastroenterologist, but at a great risk of cardiopulmonary depression. This is the reason why its application in many countries is still limited to anesthesia providers. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha<sub>2</sub> agonist that provides anxiolyse and cooperative sedation without respiratory depression. Hashiguchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] performed a study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) to investigate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine for sedation of patients undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The results of this randomized study demonstrate that dexmedetomidine was as safe and effective as midazolam for producing and maintaining adequate short-term sedation in patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy. Unfortunately, length and sort of upper GI were not described.</p><p>Takimoto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] compared dexmedetomidine with propofol and midazolam for sedation of 90 patients during endoscopic submucosal dissection of gastric cancer and found dexmedetomidine safe and effective. However, in this study only HR, NIBD, ECG and SO2 were monitored in intervals of 10 min and patient and endoscopist satisfaction was not mentioned.</p><p>Mazanikov et al.
