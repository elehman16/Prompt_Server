The main causes for shivering intra/post-operatively are temperature loss, decreased sympathetic tone and systemic release of pyrogens.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Shivering increases expenditure of cardiac and systemic energy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] resulting in increased oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production, lactic acidosis and raises the intraocular and intracranial pressure. It also interferes with haemodynamic monitoring intraoperatively.</p><p>Regional anaesthesia produces vasodilatation, which facilitates core to peripheral redistribution of heat. It also increases sweating threshold and decreases vasoconstriction and shivering threshold.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Intra- and post-operative management of shivering are usually done by external heating (forced air warming, warming blankets, warmed fluids) or pharmacological interventions. Various drugs from different groups like opioids, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) antagonists, N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, cholinomimetics and biogenic amines have been used in the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Shivering under neuraxial anaesthesia is a common problem faced by anaesthetists; therefore, a randomized double-blind study was conducted using commonly available drugs like ketamine, clonidine and tramadol to assess their efficacy when used prophylactically to control shivering under neuraxial blockade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After institutional approval and informed consent, 200 patients of ASA grade 1 and 2, belonging to either sex, aged between 18 and 65 years, undergoing lower abdominal or lower limb surgery were included in the study. Exclusion criteria were any patients suffering from neuromuscular disease, hyperthyroidism, history of cardiopulmonary disease, psychological disease, refusal to participate or temperature &#x0003e;38&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;36.5&#x000b0;C. Following a detailed pre-anaesthetic checkup along with relevant investigations, patients were brought to the operation theatre (OT) and relevant monitoring attached. All the patients were pre-loaded with Ringer lactate 10 mL/kg before giving neuraxial blockade. The study drug was coded and presented to the anaesthetist not involved in the management of the patient and administered by intravenous (i.v) route just before giving the block. The study drug and saline were pre-heated to 37&#x000b0;C before administering them to the patient. The patients were randomized into four groups of 50 patients each as follows:</p><p>Group P: Patients received 10 mL normal saline</p><p>Group K: Patients received ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. diluted to 10 mL in saline</p><p>Group C: Patients received clonidine 75 mcg i.v. diluted to 10 mL in saline</p><p>Group T: Patients received tramadol 0.5 mg/kg i.v. diluted to 10 mL in saline.</p><p>The i.v. fluids used were pre-heated to 37&#x000b0;C before using them for the patients. The temperature of the OT was maintained at 24&#x000b1;1&#x000b0;C for all the patients. Neuraxial anaesthesia was instituted at either L3-4 or L4-5 interspaces using 2.8 mL (14 mg) of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% (with 8.5% dextrose) using a 25 gauge quincke's spinal needle. During the intraoperative period, after noting the baseline parameters, pulse rate, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), oxygen saturation, temperature (core and surface) and level of sensory block were assessed at 5-min intervals. Sensory block was assessed every 5 min till there was no change in the level of anaesthesia, and every 15 min thereafter. The core temperature was measured by a nasopharyngeal thermometer and surface temperature by an axillary thermometer.</p><p>Shivering was graded using a scale validated by Tsai and Chu[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] : grade 0=no shivering, 1=piloerection but no visible shivering, 2=muscular activity in only one group, 3=muscular activity in more than one muscle group but not generalized and 4=shivering involving the whole body. During surgery, the shivering scale was recorded at 5-min intervals up to 90 min of surgery. The prophylaxis was regarded as ineffective if the patients exhibited grade 3 shivering any time during the study and then i.v. pethidine 25 mg was administered as a rescue drug.</p><p>Side-effects such as hypotension, nausea, vomiting, hallucinations and sedation were also recorded. Hypotension was defined as a decrease in mean blood pressure (MBP) of more than 20% from the baseline. Hypotension was treated with i.v. incremental bolus dose of mephentermine 3 mg and a further i.v. infusion of Ringer lactate. If patients developed nausea and vomiting, i.v. metoclopramide 10 mg was administered. Hallucination as a side-effect was defined as a false sensory experience where the patients reported that they saw, heard, smelled, tasted or felt something that was non-existent. The attending anaesthetist also assessed the degree of sedation on a 5-point scale.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] 1=fully awake and oriented, 2=drowsy, 3=eyes closed but arousable to command, 4=eyes closed but arousable to mild physical stimulation and 5=eyes closed but unarousable to mild physical stimulation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All parameters were analyzed using SPSS 11.0 and STAT 9.0 software. The data among groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. The within-group data were analyzed using repeated-measure analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni's <italic>post hoc</italic> testing. The incidence of shivering and side-effects were compared using the chi-square test. The data was expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD. A value of <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Further, with the power of 80% and at the 5% significance level, it can be concluded that the sample size of 50 is sufficient enough to evaluate the effectiveness of prophylactic use of intravenous ketamine, clonidine and tramadol in controlling shivering and for analyzing any side-effects of the drugs used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The demographic profile and the median level of sensory blockade in all the four groups were comparable [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. When the hemodynamic parameters (heart rate and mean blood pressure) were compared, the patients in the ketamine group had a higher heart rate and mean blood pressure during the first 30 min of observation as compared with the other three groups; however, thereafter, the two were comparable in all the four groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. Hypotension occurred in 20% (10/50), 12% (6/50), 16% (8/50) and 12% (6/50) patients in the placebo, ketamine, clonidine and tramadol groups, respectively, which was statistically insignificant (<italic>P</italic>=0.631). Bradycardia occurred in two (4%), one (2%), three (6%) and two (4%) patients in the placebo, ketamine, clonidine and tramadol groups, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.791).

Ketamine is a competitive receptor antagonist of NMDA, which has a role in thermoregulation at various levels. It increases blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output because of direct sympathetic stimulation and inhibition of norepinephrine uptake into the post-ganglionic sympathetic nerve endings, and may decrease core to peripheral redistribution of heat.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Ketamine may cause side-effects such as hallucination. Tramadol is a centrally acting analgesic that has weak opioid agonist properties. It also inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine uptake in the spinal cord and is effective in the treatment of post-operative shivering after regional and general anaesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Tramadol may cause nausea and vomiting. Tramadol has a low risk of respiratory depression, tolerance and dependence. Clonidine is a centrally acting &#x003b1;2, agonist and the anatomic target of its anti-shivering effect can be found at three levels. It decreases the thermoregulatory threshold for vasoconstriction and shivering as the hypothalamus contains high-density &#x003b1;2 receptors. It also reduces spontaneous firing in locus coeruleus &#x02013; a pre-shivering centre in the pons. The &#x003b1;2 receptors also get activated to release dynorphine (opioid agonist), nor epinephrine and acetylcholine. The depressor effects of these neurotransmitters at the dorsal horn modulate cutaneous thermal inputs in addition to noxious and mechanoreceptive transmission.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Clonidine can cause hypotension and bradycardia as a side-effect.</p><p>In our study, the incidence of shivering was 54% (in the placebo group), which is comparable with the incidence reported by Sagir <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Bilotta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Dhorigol <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, Sia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] reported a lower incidence of shivering (40%), but conducted the study under extradural blockade with 15&#x02013;20 mL of 2% mepivacaine, with a median level of sensory blockade of T9 as compared with T7 in control group in our study. Moreover, the spinal anaesthesia causes a two- to three-level higher level of autonomic blockade than the sensory level achieved, as compared with extradural, in which autonomic blockade is the same or one level higher than the sensory level achieved.</p><p>Previous studies investigating the anti-shivering role of ketamine, clonidine and tramadol have shown similar results as our study. Sagir <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] also found ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. to be effective in controlling shivering under neuraxial blockade. Dal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] witnessed significant results with ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. to prevent shivering under general anaesthesia. Gangopadhyay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] concluded that ketamine 0.5 mg/kg i.v. was effective in preventing shivering under spinal anaesthesia. Sia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] found clonidine to be an effective drug when used prophylactically at 1 mcg/ kg i.v. to control shivering under neuraxial blockade. Tewari and others found oral clonidine 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g to be an efficacious drug in controlling shivering under neuraxial blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Dhorigol and others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] also found oral clonidine 150 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g to be effective in controlling shivering during subarachnoid block when used prophylactically. Bilotta[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Chan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] found tramadol to be a promising drug in doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 0.25 mg/kg i.v., respectively, in controlling shivering under neuraxial blockade. Gangopadhyay and others[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] found promising results with tramadol 1.0 mg/ kg i.v. in preventing shivering under spinal anaesthesia.</p><p>There was a greater fall in core body temperatures in the placebo group as compared with the ketamine, tramadol and clonidine groups in our study. This trend in core temperature is similar with the trends reported by Sagir[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and Tewari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Greater fall in core temperature in the placebo group as compared with the other groups may be because of the study drug effect.</p><p>In our study, the incidence of side-effects was not significantly different among the groups. Tramadol has the potential to cause nausea and vomiting, but the incidence of nausea and vomiting in the study groups was comparable with the placebo group. Similar results are reported in the literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] However, Gangopadhyay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] observed a significant number of cases (20/30) of nausea and vomiting with tramadol; this high number of cases in the tramadol group could be explained by the fact that they used tramadol at 1 mg/kg i.v. as compared with 0.5 mg/kg i.v. in our study. Clonidine is known to cause hypotension and bradycardia, but the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia in the study groups was comparable with the placebo group, which was in concordance with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Ketamine is known to cause hallucinations, but none of the patients complained of hallucination in any of the groups. Studies done in the past support our findings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Ketamine causes significant grades 3 and 4 sedation as compared with placebo, clonidine and tramadol. Clonidine also has the potential to cause sedation, but, in our study, clonidine did not cause any significant sedation as compared with placebo. Ketamine causes a significant amount of sedation, which may be beneficial to us as it increases patient comfort, maintains cardiorespiratory stability, improves surgical conditions and prevents recall of unpleasant events during the surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that giving either ketamine 0.5 mg/ kg, clonidine 75 mcg or tramadol 0.5 mg/kg i.v. prophylactically just before neuraxial blockade significantly decreased the incidence of shivering without causing any major side-effects. Using ketamine may be more beneficial as it improves the hemodynamic profile by its sympathomimetic effects and it sedates the patient effectively, which increases patient comfort during surgery, maintains cardiorespiratory stability and prevents recall of unpleasant events during the surgery.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank all the
