After 10 minutes of high fresh gas flow, the flow was reduced to 1 L/min.

However, there were controversies over its ability deliver positive pressure ventilation, particularly under reduced gas flow rates and for prolonged procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>]</p><p>Postoperative airway complications such as sore throat, cough and difficulty in swallowing are common complaints following either endotracheal tube (ETT) or LMA.

Fifty-nine, non-smoking, ASA I and II patients, aged between 19 to 50 years old were scheduled for elective surgical procedures during general anesthesia with an expected duration of anesthesia 60 minutes or more, (operations lasted less than 45 minutes, have been excluded). Patients were randomly enrolled to participate in this study, after taking informed patient consent. A power analysis was performed to determine the number of patients needed to detect a 50% difference in the leak fraction between the two airway devices based on the previously published variability of the leak fraction when an LMA device (n = 24) is used. A mean leak fraction of 0.25 with a standard deviation of 0.15, an alpha error of 0.05, and a power of 80% were used in the calculation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] Because we expected some exclusions and failure to follow-up during the course of the study, we increased the number of the sample size of each group to (n = 31) as one with unexpected difficult airway and two patients scheduled for LMA insertion but failed due to abnormal anatomy and were intubated where excluded.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: expected difficult airway, recent history of sore throat or common cold within the last 10 days, patients with known allergy to latex, patients with full stomach. Patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 7.5 mg 1 hour before surgery. In all patients, anesthetic induction was performed with propofol (Diprivan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>1% Astra-Zeneca, Madrid) 2-3mg/kg, fentanyl 2&#x003bc;g/kg, cisatracurium (Nimbex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> -GlaxoSmithKline, S.A. Spain) 0.15mg/kg. Mask ventilation with 100% oxygen (6 Ls/min), and isuflorane 2 &#x000b1; 0.5 Vol% started for 2.5 -3 minutes. Intubation or laryngeal mask insertion was achieved after ensuring suitable conditions. Lubricated, sterile ETTs (R&#x000dc;SCH), manufactured by R&#x000dc;SCH Uruguay Ltd. of ID 7.5 (for women) and 8 (for men) and laryngeal mask airways (LMA-Classic&#x02122;) of size 4 (for women) and size 5(for men) were used. Cuff inflation of ETT was adjusted to be close to 25 cm H<sub>2</sub> O using Endotest (R&#x000dc;SCH) that was connected to the tube for continuous pressure readjustment (the cuff pressure changed and readjusted during surgery but we did not record its incidence).While LMA was inflated until "just seal" obtained, adequacy of seal was decided on the basis of auscultation of anterior neck and ballottement of pilot balloon[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] (the position of the LMA was verified clinically only and we depend on disappearance of leakage during its inflation but we did not measure its cuff pressure).</p><p>Lungs were mechanically ventilated with 35:65% oxygen and nitrous oxide. Maintenance of anesthesia was achieved with isoflurane (Abbott) 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.50 Vol % in fresh gas flow of (6 Ls/min) for 10 minutes to deliver sufficient isoflurane and N<sub>2</sub>O during the high-uptake period. Flows were, then reduced to 1 L/min; isoflurane vapor setting to 1.0 &#x000b1; 0.5 Vol %. In case of insufficient anesthesia, fentanyl (50-100 &#x003bc;g) was given. German Dr&#x000e4;ger (Julian) anesthesia machines were used, and the patients' were ventilated mechanically at respiratory rate 11 per min, tidal volume (ml) = weight (Kg) &#x000d7; 8 ml, positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) 3 cm water, The anesthesia delivery system (Dr&#x000e4;ger Medizintechnik GmbH 23542 L&#x000fc;beck, Germany) was modified with soda&#x02013;lime CO<sub>2</sub> absorber. All patients were monitored using electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure, inspiratory and expiratory N<sub>2</sub>O, and isoflurane concentrations; and the peak and plateau ventilatory pressure, End-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> analysis were also monitored continuously by the anesthesia machine but only recorded: after induction, 10, 20, 40, 60, 90, and 110 minutes later. The occurrence of rebreathing (inspiratory CO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e; 5 mmHg) and system leakage were monitored by the anesthesia machine (system leakage must not exceed 100 ml/min). Any attempts to increase fresh gas flow secondary to leakage (when the ventilator bellows fail to rise to the top of its clear plastic enclosure during expiration) were noticed and recorded. A short period of high fresh gas flow (2.5 Ls/min) was then applied, to overcome this problem. If correctable, the fresh gas flow was reduced again to 1 L/min.</p><p>Isoflurane was discontinued eight minutes before the end of surgery and the flow increased to 6 Ls/min 100% O<sub>2</sub>to wash-out anesthetics. After removal of the airway device, patients were transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The incidence and severity of cough, sore throat, and difficulty in swallowing were assessed separately one hour after removal of airway device using visual analogue scale (VAS) {0 = no complaint &#x02192; 10 = worst imaginable complaint}</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methodology</title><p>Analysis of data was done by IBM computer using SPSS (statistical program for social science) as follows:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Description of quantitative variables as mean, SD and range</p></list-item><list-item><p>Description of qualitative variables as number and percentage.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Chi-square test was used to compare qualitative variables</p></list-item><list-item><p>Unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare a quantitative variable between two independent groups in parametric data.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P</italic> value &#x0003e; 0.05 insignificant</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 significant</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 highly significant</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty-nine patients (30 of them were managed using ETT and 29 with LMA) were included in this study.

The net result of our study showed that LMA was as effective and safe as ETT in majority of patients enrolled in the study (only 6.9 % of LMA patients developed initial airway leakage that has been shown to be correctable by transient increase in fresh gas flow). The absence of significant CO<sub>2</sub>- rebreathing in all LMA-patients and insignificant difference in anesthetics uptake between both groups re-inforced this suggestion.</p><p>The LMA is an established method of airway control during spontaneous ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] On the other hand, some earlier studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] failed to confirm this proposal during controlled mechanical ventilation, until a mass survey of 11,910 patients had been published in 1996[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>] and demonstrated the efficacy and safety of LMA during controlled mechanical ventilation, mentioning that the earlier controversies may be related to the lack of experience of proper usage and insertion.</p><p>Few studies have tested the feasibility of the LMA under low flow conditions. M&#x000f6;llhoff <italic>et al</italic>. in 1996[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] used LMA during low and minimal &#x02013;flow anesthesia in patients undergoing short elective gynecological surgery. There was no ETT- control group in this study. Similarly, Honemann and his colleagues in 2001[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] compared LMA to ETT under minimal flow conditions in relatively lengthy operations. The results of both studies were supporting the concepts of efficacy and safety of LMA. In the later study significant initial leak were reported in 15.4 % of LMA &#x02013;patients in comparison to only 6.9 % reported in our study.</p><p>There are accumulating evidences supporting the use of LMA size 4 for females and size 5 for males. AS a sex-related formula is a more successful strategy than the manufacturer&#x02032;s weight-based recommendations in avoiding air leak from the gap between the mask and pharynx[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT19">19</xref>] This also was found to decrease the incidence of postoperative airway complications resulting from pharyngeal wall ischemia and lingual nerve injury due to over inflation of small size LMA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT20">20</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, in spite of continuous optimization of ETT-cuff pressure to be around 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, the incidence of cough and sore throat in intubated patients were shown to be significantly higher than those occurring with LMA, 13.3% of ETT-patients complained of cough and 20% of them complained of sore throat in comparison to 0% and 3.4% in LMA-patients respectively. The VAS in patients reporting sore throat showed a greater degree in ETT-patients. On the other hand, there were minimal differences between both groups regarding swallowing problems. One study failed to show any protective effect of limiting ETT-cuff pressure on post-intubation sore throat incidence.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT21">21</xref>] Another recent study mentions that mechanical irritation and stretch caused by ETT cuff, even in low pressure conditions, can stimulate the sensory C and afferent delta fibers present in the larynx and trachea and eliciting postoperative airway symptoms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>] On the other hand, there was no evidence that LMA&#x02013;cuff pressure monitoring and limitation is necessary during LMA anesthesia. Expansion of LMA &#x02013;cuff secondary to diffusion of N<sub>2</sub>O does not cause displacement of the cuff from the hypo- pharynx and is self-limiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT23">23</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, the laryngeal mask airway has been proved to be effective and safe in establishing an airtight seal during controlled ventilation under low fresh gas flow of one L/min. The laryngeal mask airway induced less coughing and sore throat during the immediate postoperative period than did the ETT in-spite of optimization of its cuff pressure.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
