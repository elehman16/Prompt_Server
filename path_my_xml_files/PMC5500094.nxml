We conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of an electric blanket plus a forced-air warming system on rewarming in children with postoperative hypothermia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods:</title><p>We recruited 346 children (aged&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;3 years) who were admitted to a PACU after surgery and diagnosed with hypothermia between March and August 2016. They were randomly divided into 3 groups: group C (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;108, rewarmed with only a regular blanket), group E (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;123, rewarmed with a regular blanket plus an electric blanket), and group EF (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;115, rewarmed with an electric blanket plus a forced-air warming system). From the beginning of rewarming, the rectal temperature was recorded every 5&#x0200a;minutes for the first half hour, then every 10&#x0200a;minutes up to when the patient left the PACU. The primary outcome was the rewarming time of children (from the beginning of rewarming to recovery of normothermia). The rewarming rate, increase in temperature (compared with the beginning of rewarming), hemodynamics, recovery time, and incidences of adverse effects were recorded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>There were no significant differences among the 3 groups in terms of the baseline clinical characteristics, use of narcotic drugs, intraoperative temperature, and hemodynamics (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;.05).

In group C, the children were covered with regular blanket (except for their heads). In group E, the children were rewarmed with a regular blanket plus an electric blanket (Stihler Electronic, Stuttgart, Germany); they were completely covered except for their heads. The electric blanket was prewarmed for 30&#x0200a;minutes and then controlled at 37&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C to 40&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C during the rewarming process. In group EF, the children were rewarmed with an electric blanket plus a forced-air warming system (Bair Hugger 750, Germany). The electric blanket setting was as same as in group E, and the forced-air warming system was controlled at 38&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C during the rewarming process.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>All patients with postanesthesia hypothermia were treated using oxygen inhalation with moist oxygen.

When the rectal temperature was &#x02265;36&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, rewarming was considered to be successful.

At the same time, the incidence of arrhythmia, shivering, nausea, and vomiting was reduced among these patients compared with those in the other 2 groups.</p><p>Mild hypothermia, which often occurs during and after operations, developed among the children immediately after the induction of general anesthesia. There are many reasons for this phenomenon, including a combination of anesthetic-induced impairment of thermoregulatory control, a cool operating room environmental temperature, an internal redistribution of heat within the body, inspiration of dry and cool anesthetic gases, evaporation of surgical skin preparations, and infusion of cool fluids.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> To summarize, hypothermia occurs when heat loss exceeds metabolic heat production. Cutaneous heat loss is mainly the result of convection and radiation (which make up 85% of the total heat loss) from the patient to the environment. Heat loss from conduction and evaporation account for&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;15% in most circumstances.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Previous studies have shown that intraoperative hypothermia is minimized by at least 2&#x0200a;hours of active skin-surface warming before anesthesia in volunteers using a forced-air warming system and in surgical patients using an electric blanket.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> However, such prolonged prewarming is impractical for most patients, especially for children undergoing short operations.</p><p>Children often have difficulty in maintaining normal body temperatures in environments that would be comfortable for adults, as they regulate their body temperature less efficiently than adults.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> One study showed that a naked baby exposed to a cool operating room environmental temperature, which is usually set to 23&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, suffers the same heat loss as a naked adult at 0&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Normothermia in infants is an axillary temperature of 36.5&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C to 37.5&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C, as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics. In addition, the World Health Organization define scold stress as temperatures of 36.0&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C to 36.5&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C and frank hypothermia as all temperatures &#x0003c;36.0&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses suggests that core temperatures &#x0003c;36&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C cause thermal discomfort, and these temperatures are associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality rates of the American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> As a result of all these factors, we defined postoperative hypothermia as a core temperature (rectal temperature) &#x0003c;36&#x0200a;&#x000b0;C.</p><p>Numerous studies have examined the validity of different rewarming methods for children during anesthesia and surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> However, there have been no guidelines or recommendations issued for rewarming methods for use in PACU for the management of postoperative hypothermia among children. Therefore, we conducted this prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the combination of an electric blanket plus a forced-air warming system on rewarming in children with postoperative hypothermia.</p><p>Methods to keep a patient's body temperature at normothermia levels during surgery include covering the patient's head and body with a blanket, increasing the ambient room temperature, warm intravenousor skin irrigation solutions, and using external warming devices. Forced-air warming has been proven to be the most effective method to maintain normothermia among children undergoing surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Although the cost of a forced-air warming system is more than that of a regular blanket or an electric blanket, it is often worthwhile shortening the patient's stay in the PACU and reducing the risk of the increased costs of treating complications associated with postoperative hypothermia.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> we found that the rewarming time, rewarming rate, and increase in rectal temperature in group EF (treated with both an electric blanket and a forced-air warming system) were all significantly increased compared with the children treated with only a regular blanket or only an electric blanket. As a result, both the HR and MAP in group EF were significantly increased at T7, T8, and T9 (T7: 115&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;8 vs 118&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;9 vs 126&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;9&#x0200a;beats/min, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01; T8: 123&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;7 vs 122&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;9 vs 135&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;7&#x0200a;beats/min, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;.01; T9: 126&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;9 vs 127&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6 vs 138&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;8&#x0200a;beats/min). However, there was no significant difference among the 3 groups in the incidence of hypoxemia (9 vs 10 vs 11, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.915), hypotension (7 vs 11 vs 9, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.785), or hypertension (16 vs 18 vs 15, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.914).</p><p>We also found that the children in group EF had lower incidences of arrhythmia (16 vs 15 vs 5, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.027), shivering (32 vs 26 vs 12, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.002,), nausea (29 vs 27 vs 15, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.034), and vomiting (12 vs 8 vs 2, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.016) compared with the patients in groups C and E. However, the incidences of arrhythmia and shivering were still higher than in previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> The reasons for this may include the short length of the operations involved in this study and the different types of patients recruited, surgeries performed, and precise methods of rewarming selected.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup></p><p>There are several limitations associated with our study. First, the study is a small prospective randomized controlled trial, and a large multicenter prospective trial is necessary to verify the effect of the combination of an electric blanket plus a forced-air warming system on rewarming among children with postoperative hypothermia. Second, we only included children with short operations (&#x0003c;30&#x0200a;minutes). Operation time varies greatly according to the type of surgical procedure, and further research is required on children undergoing lengthy complex surgery. Third, we failed to consider hyperthermia as a complication during the postoperative period. Although none of the children in our study developed hyperthermia, this variable should be included in future study protocols.</p><p>In summary, the combination of an electric blanket and a forced-air warming system was shown to be an effective rewarming method for children with postoperative hypothermia. In addition, the incidences of arrhythmia, shivering, nausea, and vomiting were reduced in these patients compared with those in the other 2 groups. However, further multicenter prospective studies are still necessary to verify the effect of this composite technique on rewarming among children with postoperative hypothermia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiology, BMI = body mass index, HR = heart rate, IQR = interquartile range, MAP = mean arterial pressure, PACU = postanesthesia care unit.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>XL, YS, and ZZ conceived and designed the trial.
