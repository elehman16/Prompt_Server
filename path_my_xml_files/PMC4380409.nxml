Blood was sampled at baseline, after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and 6, 12 and 24h post-CPB. Plasma was analysed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in an untargeted approach. Peptides demonstrating differential expression (p&#x0003c;0.01) were subjected to tandem LC-MS/MS and protein identification. Corresponding proteins were identified using the NCBI protein database. There was no difference in age (7.3&#x000b1;3.5vs6.8&#x000b1;3.6 months)(p=0.89), weight (7.7&#x000b1;1.8vs7.5&#x000b1;1.9 kg)(p=0.71), CPB time (104&#x000b1;7vs94&#x000b1;7 min)(p=0.98) or aortic cross-clamp time (83&#x000b1;22vs75&#x000b1;20 min)(p=0.36). No peptides were differentially expressed at baseline or immediately after CPB. There were 48 peptides with higher expression in the RIPC group 6h post-CPB. This was no longer evident at 12 or 24h, with one peptide down-regulated in the RIPC group. The proteins identified were: inter-alpha globulin inhibitor (42.0&#x000b1;11.8 vs 820.8&#x000b1;181.1, p=0.006), fibrinogen preproprotein (59.3&#x000b1;11.2 vs 1192.6&#x000b1;278.3, p=0.007), complement-C3 precursor (391.2&#x000b1;160.9 vs 5385.1&#x000b1;689.4, p=0.0005), complement C4B (151.5&#x000b1;17.8 vs 4587.8&#x000b1;799.2, p=0.003), apolipoprotein B100 (53.4&#x000b1;8.3 vs 1364.5&#x000b1;278.2, p=0.005) and urinary proteinase inhibitor (358.6&#x000b1;74.9 vs 5758.1&#x000b1;1343.1, p=0.009). These proteins are involved in metabolism, haemostasis, immunity and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We provided the first comprehensive analysis of RIPC-induced proteomic changes in children undergoing surgery.

The concept has since evolved into a clinically applicable protection known as remote IPC (RIPC) where ischemia of peripheral tissue, including skeletal muscle, could protect distant organs from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This can be applied non-invasively in various clinical scenarios.</p><p>The first clinical application of RIPC in humans was reported in a randomized clinical trial (RCT) in children undergoing heart surgery and demonstrated cardiopulmonary protection with decreased inotrope requirement, decreased airway resistance and decreased troponin levels [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Subsequently, the RIPC-induced myocardial protection was demonstrated in other RCTs [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recent meta-analysis of the RCTs also demonstrated significant myocardial protection by the RIPC against IR injury in patients undergoing heart surgery with cardioplegic arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to these studies with positive findings, the impact of RIPC on myocardial protection in the setting of chronic hypoxia in children is less clear. Our two recent RCTs demonstrate that in chronically hypoxic children with cyanotic heart disease, a high proportion of proteins are in phosphorylated form and RIPC does not further enhance phosphorylated protein signalling in myocardium or circulating leukocytes in children undergoing Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) repair [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] or provide myocardial protection [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. To dissect the molecular impact of the RIPC in children with cyanotic heart disease, we performed a further proteomic analysis of the RIPC-induced changes in plasma of children undergoing repair of ToF [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0122778.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0122778.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><p>This double blind RCT was approved by the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital Human Research Ethics committee and conducted in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Statement on ethical conduct in human research.

Although the mechanisms through which RIPC confers protection have not been fully elucidated, there is evidence that RIPC induces circulating humoral mediators [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We have previously demonstrated that RIPC induces global genomic changes in healthy adult volunteers and in children undergoing heart surgery [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We have also previously shown that RIPC modifies the proteomic profile in the plasma of healthy adult volunteers and gained the first clinical insights into the proteins that may be altered during the RIPC stimulus and at 15 min and 24 h after applying the RIPC stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. We therefore extended this concept into the clinical setting to test the hypothesis that RIPC modifies the plasma proteomic response in children undergoing repair of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). This is the first study to describe the global proteomic response to RIPC in the plasma of children with congenital heart disease undergoing heart surgery. We have identified potential candidate proteins involved in the RIPC mechanism that require confirmation with further studies.</p><p>There were no differences in clinical outcomes between the RIPC group and the control group [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which may be attributed to the fact that chronic hypoxia may already activate the pathways involved in RIPC, so that further augmentation is not possible. This finding is supported by evidence suggesting that RIPC has little effect on the phosphorylation levels of pro-survival protein pathways that are involved in RIPC from the resected right ventricular outflow tract tissue of these patients [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Our results are in contrast to studies on the effect of ischemic post conditioning via invasive aortic clamping and de-clamping following reperfusion which showed clinical benefit including decreased morbidity, reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit stay and inotrope requirement in patients undergoing ToF repair [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Thus, clinical application of the RIPC and its variants still remains a controversial issue and further mechanistic insights are required.</p><p>In the current study, the most pronounced proteomic changes between control and RIPC groups occurred at 6 hours after CPB. The 48 peptides with significant higher levels in the RIPC group at 6 hours after CPB were matched to 6 proteins. Four of these 6 proteins were previously found to be differentially expressed in our study of the effect of the RIPC stimulus in healthy adult volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These 4 proteins were inter-alpha globulin inhibitor, fibrinogen preproprotein, complement C4B and apolipoprotein B. These findings consistent with our previous study suggest that there is a common mechanism of protection by RIPC. How these proteins could be linked to the RIPC specific protection is beyond the scope of this study and warrants further investigation. The functions of these proteins have previously been described and are as follows.</p><p>The protease inhibitors in blood control proteolysis during complement activation, coagulation, fibrinolysis and inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Inter-alpha globulin inhibitor is an acute phase protein known to be involved in inflammation. It increases in concentration in response to tissue injury. We found up-regulation of inter alpha globulin inhibitor during the RIPC and at 15 min after the RIPC and it is down-regulation at 24 h after the RIPC in our previous study in healthy adult volunteers [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding of early up-regulation has since been confirmed by Pang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] who reported a greater than 2-fold increase at 1 hour post RIPC stimulus in 60 healthy adult volunteers. In the current study, we found increased levels of inter-alpha globulin inhibitor at 6 h after the CPB, but not at the 12 h or 24 h after CPB. These findings suggested that the inter-alpha globulin inhibitor is involved in the early response to the RIPC stimulus, but returns to the baseline within the first 24 hours. Inter-alpha globulin inhibitor regulates activation and adhesion of leucocytes during inflammation and it also has protease inhibitory activity [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Inter-alpha globulin inhibitor is also known to render tissue more resistant to damage from oxygen derived free radicals [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Higher levels in the RIPC group may indicate that RIPC-induced protection against oxidative stress.</p><p>Fibrinogen preproprotein has previously been demonstrated as being anti-inflammatory in local ischemic preconditioning during acute pancreatitis in rats [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The cleavage products of fibrinogen regulate cell adhesion and migration, have vasoconstrictor and chemotactic activities and are mitogens for several cell types [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Increased levels of fibrinogen preproprotein at 6 h post CPB may imply decreased cleavage products of fibrinogen as there were higher levels of its precursor. Thus, higher levels of fibrinogen may reflect decreased plasma protease activity and, as such, decreased activation of leucocytes. Furthermore, preconditioning ischemia attenuates platelet activation and aggregation characterized by a decrease in platelets aggregating with fibrinogen [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, an anti-inflammatory property of fibrinogen preproprotein in clinical surgery deserves further investigation.</p><p>Similarly, the complement C3 precursor was found to be up-regulated at 6 h after CPB. This was confirmed by ELISA. In our preclinical study, we found complement C3 to be up regulated at 15 min post RIPC stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Complement factors play a key role in the inflammatory process. When cleaved, complement C3 precursor causes contraction of smooth muscle, increases vascular permeability and chemotaxis and causes histamine release from mast cells and basophilic leukocytes [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Complement C3 precursor has been implicated in a number of cellular pathways including the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C (PKC), protein kinase B (Akt) and mitogen activated protein kinase /extracellular signal- regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) pathways, which have also been implicated in RIPC [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Complement C4B is important in controlling inflammation, where deficiency and low serum levels are associated with increased susceptibility to inflammation, including systemic lupus erythematosus [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Complement C4B has anti-inflammatory properties [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Increased levels of this protein in the RIPC group 6 h after CPB suggest that RIPC could have an anti-inflammatory effect. This suggests a role for involvement of the complement system in response to RIPC.</p><p>Apolipoprotein B levels were high in the RIPC group at 6 hours after CPB in the current study. The precise role of Apolipoprotein B in RIPC is unknown. We have shown apolipoprotein expression to be increased in adults in response to the RIPC stimulus [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, subsequent studies have confirmed the upregulation of apolipoproteins in response to RIPC in an animal model [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and have also shown that administration of apolipoprotein prior to prolonged coronary artery occlusion resulted in decreased myocardial infarct area that was as effective as RIPC [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Finally, increased level of urinary proteinase in the RIPC groups was an interesting observation. These inter alpha globulin inhibitors are degraded by neutrophils to form urinary proteinase inhibitors [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Urinary proteinase inhibitor confers anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-&#x003b1; and interleukin 6, and chemokines [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The urinary proteinase inhibitors decrease lipopolysaccharide induced neutrophil activation [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and have been used therapeutically for patients with inflammatory disease [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Administration of exogenous urinary proteinase inhibitors warrants testing in an animal model.</p><p>This is the first examination of RIPC induced proteomic changes in the plasma of children with cyanotic heart defects. The results of this study indicate that the RIPC stimulus in children undergoing ToF repair evokes a global proteomic response that peaks at 6 h post-CPB and returns to baseline within the first 24 h. This study provides preliminary insights into the proteins involved in RIPC mediated cellular protection. The observed proteomic changes are consistent with our previous observation in healthy volunteers and may play an integral role in the response to RIPC.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>Limitations</title><p>Removal of albumin and Ig-G from plasma allowed for a more thorough analysis of the remaining proteins. This approach did, however, come at a sacrifice as other proteins with an isoelectric point between 5.2 and 6.8 were excluded from the analysis. There may be proteins that we excluded from our analysis that may be important in RIPC associated mechanisms that were not analysed in our study due to the fractionation process that we used.</p><p>This study was limited to measuring relative changes in the levels of peptides between the two groups at the various time points and as such involved denaturation and trypsin digestion of the proteins into peptides, therefore, we were unable to assess post translational modifications such as phosphorylation.</p><p>Anaesthetic drugs may impact on RIPC responses [<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0122778.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], and differentiating the impact of the drugs from RIPC can only be achieved through RCT&#x02019;s in which the anaesthetic techniques are identical and the only variable is the presence or absence of RIPC. Whether the RIPC leads to clinically important improvements in outcome, will then need to be considered across the range of surgeries and anaesthetics. This study was not powered to detect differences in echocardiogram assessment of diastolic dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We provided the first comprehensive analysis of RIPC-induced proteomic changes in children undergoing heart surgery.
