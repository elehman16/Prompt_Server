Only a few studies have studied the effectiveness of the interventions and there is no information on the sustainability of the effects. Study aims were to investigate both the short (2-month) and long-term (2-year) effects of email-based training for mental health and lifestyle.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Persons who completed an &#x02018;Electronic Health Check&#x02019;, as advertised in a TV program, were offered a chance to participate in email-based interventions. The baseline questionnaire was completed by 73 054 people, with 42 761 starting interventions, and 16 499 people participating in at least one of the follow-ups. Persons who did not choose to start the interventions served as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At baseline, the intervention group had a higher level of stress and lower gratitude and confidence in the future than the control group. Both groups showed improvement in the level of stress, but improvement was more marked in the intervention group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001 for both time points). In confidence in the future and gratitude, people who chose interpersonal interventions showed significant improvements at both time points (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), whereas those choosing lifestyle interventions showed improvement only at the 2-month follow-up. Participants who had done the exercises according to instructions had the most sustained improvements in measures of psychological health at the 2-year follow-up. As for lifestyle, people who had started lifestyle interventions increased their exercise (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001 at both time points).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Internet-based interventions are feasible for mental health promotion and should be available for people interested in improving their psychological well-being and lifestyle.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40359-016-0125-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Web-based</kwd><kwd>Online</kwd><kwd>Intervention</kwd><kwd>Happiness</kwd><kwd>Wellbeing</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003406</institution-id><institution>Tekes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Promoting psychological well-being, besides being important in its own right, may also improve psychological resilience, decrease the risk of mental disorders, increase productivity at work and even promote physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Well-being is not just absence of mental disorders, it is rather a broad concept that includes happiness as well as other factors that make up a good life, and it includes both affective and cognitive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Lyubomirsky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] stated that approximately 50&#x000a0;% of happiness is genetically determined and 10&#x000a0;% is determined by circumstances, whereas 40&#x000a0;% of happiness is composed of what a person does or thinks; therefore, this 40&#x000a0;% can be influenced, and in this article we focus on factors that can be influenced.</p><p>Research on how to improve well-being has been done especially within the positive psychology tradition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many simple exercises have been effective in enhancing well-being and increasing resilience to everyday stress, such as exercises to increase gratitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], to increase optimism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], to promote forgiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], to do good deeds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and to decrease rumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Gratitude has been shown to strongly influence subjective well-being, and exercises to increase gratitude have appeared effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Optimism refers to expecting positive outcomes in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and is related to happiness, better subjective well-being and better coping in stressful situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Earlier studies have shown that especially stress and optimism have a strong impact also on physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Previously our research group has shown strong links between confidence in the future, as part of optimism, and healthy lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Lyubomirsky et al. have also suggested that interventions to increase well-being may be most successful when participants are self-selected, when they know about the intervention goals, are motivated and make efforts to reach them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The availability of therapists and the scarcity of financial resources, for example, limit the use of traditional face-to-face psychotherapeutic interventions for improving psychological well-being. The internet provides a venue for improving psychological well-being in larger populations with easy access and low requirements for financial and personnel resources. Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have provided support for the use of internet-based therapy, with or without therapist contact, in the treatment of various psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety disorders or occupational stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Internet-based interventions on stress reduction comprise a wide variety of exercises, from mindfulness-based exercises to time management, and these interventions have mostly appeared effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Several studies have also shown that internet-based healthy lifestyle interventions may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in weight management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], in increasing physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], in reducing alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and in smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>A few earlier studies have also provided preliminary support for using web-based solutions in the promotion of well-being in the general population. Seligman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] showed that three out of five happiness exercises, namely identifying three good things in a day, writing and delivering a letter of gratitude and using signature strengths in a new way, were able to increase well-being, and for two of them the effects were still evident in a 6-month follow-up. In a randomized controlled trial using a cognitive-behavioral tool, Powell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] showed improvement in well-being in a 12-week follow-up in the intervention group compared to controls. In a study with 435 self-selected adults, both writing about best possible selves and making gratitude lists improved subjective well-being compared to writing to-do-lists, and the effect was maintained in the one-month follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A study with a 6-month follow-up noticed that self-compassion and optimism exercises were able to increase happiness in persons vulnerable to depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. While the studies have provided support for web-based interventions, sample sizes have been relatively small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, because follow-up times have mostly been short, at usually a couple of months up to half an year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], more information is needed on the sustainability of the intervention effects. Since the effect sizes have not been large in previous studies, the intervention can be meaningful for an individual or on a population level only if the interventions have long-term effects on well-being.</p><p>We have previously reported the results of a randomized trial on email-based exercises in happiness, physical activity and readings based on the Finnish Happiness-Flourishing Study (FHFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In that study, with approximately 3000 participants at the baseline but with a 60&#x000a0;% attrition rate, there was improvement in psychological well-being and a decrease in depressive symptoms in the happiness exercises group and in the physical activity group, but similar improvement was evident also in the active control group receiving only readings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The authors concluded that email-based exercises appear as a promising new tool for reducing well-being disparities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Since then, a new TV program was started which focused on promoting resilience to daily stressors, optimism and gratitude. In the TV program, five Finnish celebrities received each a coach with expertise in improving well-being, and each of the celebrities had their own episode, which showed their training. The program advertised a website where people were able to fill in a questionnaire on their health, lifestyle and psychological well-being, resulting in a feedback report. The report included an estimate of the average life expectancy and the risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke or diabetes within next 10&#x000a0;years, as well as a description of one&#x02019;s life habits that impact on health and ways to influence them. People were then offered a chance to start an email-based intervention intended to enhance well-being and additional exercise programs based on their own preferences.</p><p>The general aim of the study was to explore the feasibility of this new, freely accessible intervention for improving wellbeing in the general population. More specifically we investigated the level of interest for this kind of intervention and the effectiveness of the intervention both in the short-term and in the long-term in persons who have by themselves sought the intervention. In addition, we investigated whether adherence to the intervention influenced the effectiveness of and satisfaction with the intervention.</p><p>The hypotheses were:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Intervention improves wellbeing (operationalized as the level of stress, confidence in the future, and gratitude) both in the short-term and in the long-term when compared to their level before the intervention and to people who filled in the questionnaire without participating in the exercises.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention improves health-related habits both in the short-term and in the long-term term when compared to their level before the intervention and to people who filled in the questionnaire without participating in the exercises.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adherence to the exercises improves the effectiveness of the intervention.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Recruitment and study procedure</title><p>Participants for the present study were recruited through a reality TV program, where five Finnish celebrities received training from five mental health professionals to promote resilience to daily hassles and adversities, optimism and gratitude, presented from October 2012 to January 2013. Part of the TV program was a freely accessible website, where people could test their health, lifestyle, psychological wellbeing and stress coping. The site was also advertised through the web pages of the Finnish Broadcasting Company, through the public health portal of the Finnish Medical Society/Duodecim Medical Publications Ltd and also through various social media channels (Facebook etc.).</p><p>The questionnaire at the website provided a health check report that was sent to the participant&#x02019;s email if they gave the address. On the website, participants were offered the possibility to participate in the training. The participants were informed that the responses in the questionnaire are used in a study into the effectiveness of the intervention, and the persons who give an email address would be contacted again. When participants were contacted again, they were asked to fill in the questionnaire to produce additional information for the research into the email-delivered training. The participants did not receive any compensation for their participation.</p><p>Adults (age 18&#x000a0;years or over) who completed the questionnaire between 10 September 2012 and 2 December 2012 were included in this study sample. All persons who participated in the baseline assessment and who had given permission to be contacted again were emailed and requested to complete a similar online questionnaire two months after the baseline assessment and between 25 August and 18 September 2014. Thus, the final follow-up time was approximately two years from the baseline. The non-responders were reminded of the follow-up surveys once.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Altogether 73 054 persons completed the questionnaire of whom 42 761 persons (58.4&#x000a0;%) entered the training (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

At the baseline, participants choosing the intervention (hereafter the intervention group) were slightly younger, had more years of education, were more often employed and in a relationship, and had less confidence in the future, less feelings of gratitude and more stress than those who only filled in the questionnaire (hereafter called the control group). The intervention group had less binge drinking and daily smoking, and they consumed vegetables and/or fruits daily more often than the control group, but they were physically less active. Women chose the intervention more often than men, which may explain part of these differences.

Our results are comparable to previous studies offering positive psychological interventions via the Internet, many of which have found these interventions effective at least in the short term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>The intervention group had a common wellbeing intervention targeting coping with stress, and this seemed to be effective: Both those who had additionally chosen lifestyle-interventions and those who had chosen interpersonal interventions reported lower levels of stress at the 2-month and 2-year follow-ups. The wellbeing intervention also had elements aimed at increasing gratitude and confidence in the future, and both seemed to have had an effect on the intervention group at the 2-month follow-up. The group that in addition had chosen interpersonal interventions had maintained more of that improvement by the 2-year follow-up. This finding accords with the central role of social relationships for positive mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and also with previous findings of the positive effect of having multiple exercises in an online positive psychological intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>As for lifestyle, the largest improvements were seen in the lifestyle intervention group in physical exercise and daily use of vegetables or fruits, but all groups had improved by the 2-year follow-up. This accords with previous studies which have suggested that internet-based lifestyle interventions may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Previous studies of internet-based wellness approaches have found more positive results on these variables in non-randomized than in randomized trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While this may indicate a selection bias, it may also be that motivation has a crucial effect in internet programs targeting lifestyle improvement, as it has in positive psychological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Even assuming that people who had been able to improve their lifestyle were more likely to respond in the follow-up, the sustained improvement in the physical exercise group in the 2-year follow-up was encouraging.</p><p>We found that people who reported having done at least part of the exercises according to the instructions had long-lasting improvement in perceived level of stress, gratitude and optimism. This accords with previous research which found that the effortful pursuit of happiness-enhancing web-based interventions improved their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Our intervention differs from most previous studies in providing individual emails and combining multimedia platforms to motivated individuals in a wide age-range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. With the aim of motivating individuals via perceived autonomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], we combined positive psychology interventions with the possibility to choose from other lifestyle interventions, such as tobacco cessation. A number of validation studies have been completed on the individual exercises in our intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The central premise of the intervention is to address individual positive resources. A combination of exercises is more likely to resonate in individuals than a single exercise that may not appear relevant to some subgroups. Previous studies have successfully combined multiple exercises into effective interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>The study had limitations. The study groups are not representative of the Finnish adult population. Most of the respondents were women with a relatively high level of education, and their lifestyle was healthier than in the general population on average. For example, less than 15&#x000a0;% were current smokers, compared to 27&#x000a0;% of men and 19&#x000a0;% of women in the general population in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These characteristics resemble those found by Parks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] for online happiness seekers. Attrition between the baseline survey and the two follow-ups was large, and it was selective in that people with poorer health habits were less likely to respond in the follow-up. The study was not originally designed as a clinical trial but as a follow-up study. People enrolled in the intervention on the basis of their own interest and were allowed to choose additional interventions freely. It was not possible to study the effects of all possible intervention combinations that the participants had chosen. Therefore, the results of the follow-up should be interpreted with caution. However, it has been suggested that positive psychology interventions may be most successful when participants know about the intervention and commit to it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while it has been suggested that using multiple positive activities simultaneously can inhibit adaptation to their hedonic benefits by bolstering variety and novelty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Besides a lack of randomization, another limitation entailed not being able to assess other possible factors that might influence, for example, stress levels and using single items to assess constructs. Moreover, some of the positive effect observed in the control group could be due to the TV-program, another interesting method for influencing positively the mental, physical, and social health of the population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, internet-based interventions are easy to access, there is a potential to reach and engage a large number of people, and the cost related to the programs is smaller than in face-to-face services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. In this study, over 70 000 Finns completed the electronic health-check and over 40 000 started interventions, demonstrating that there is interest in these kinds of services. Therefore, the interventions can be cost-effective and are a feasible method of mental health promotion. Mental health promotion should become a public health priority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] because of the substantial burden related to mental and substance use disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and because positive psychological wellbeing may also improve physical health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The positive results found in this large observational study suggest that internet-based interventions should be available for people interested in improving their psychological wellbeing and lifestyle.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa.
