The study aimed to establish the fungicidal, efficacy and safety profile of Calmagen&#x000ae; dermaceutical cream and lotion containing AMYCOT&#x000ae; as a topical treatment in patients with severe to very severe presentations of fungal skin (tinea) and nail infections (onychomycosis).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind, parallel, single centre study was conducted on 28 subjects with severe to very severe tinea or onychomycosis. All patients were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 for treatment or placebo group. Subjects in the treatment arm received Calmagen&#x000ae; cream or lotion, while subjects in the placebo arm received a similar inert topical preparation. Tinea subjects were treated with cream for four weeks, while onychomycosis subjects were treated with lotion for 12&#x000a0;weeks. Mycological cure, the primary endpoint, was assessed by three parameters: KOH (potassium hydroxide) smear, fungal culture and live spore count. Clinical cure was defined as Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) response of &#x02018;cleared&#x02019; or &#x02018;excellent&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">All three parameters constituting mycological cure were confirmed in 92.8% (13/14) of subjects in the treatment arm, while all 14 subjects in the placebo arm remained positive for KOH smear. Calmagen&#x000ae; cream and lotion treatment showed a significant improvement in all three parameters: KOH smear, (95% CI (Calmagen): 79.4, 100.0; 95% CI (placebo): 0.0, 0.0; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001); fungal culture (95% CI (Calmagen); 100.0, 100.0; 95% CI (Placebo): 17.0, 100.0; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0019); and live spore count (95% CI (Calmagen): 100.0, 100.0; 95% CI (Placebo): 17.0, 100.0; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0019). Clinical cure was achieved in all subjects in the treatment arm while none in the placebo arm were clinically cured.

Currently available antifungal drugs have varied mechanisms of action affecting synthesis of membrane/cell-wall components (echinocandins), membrane permeability (amphoterecin-B, azoles, allylamines), synthesis of nucleic acids (flucytosine), and microtubule/mitotic spindle function (griseofulvin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Agents, which disrupt the cell wall/membrane are generally fungicidal while inhibitors of fungal cell division are fungistatic. The fungicidal property of antifungals seems to depend on the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">There are several oral or topical antifungal agents for the management of dermatophytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, dermatophytosis usually requires long-term therapy with allylamines (e.g. terbinafine) and azoles (e.g. ketoconazole, miconazole) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dermatophytosis is often successfully treated with topical antifungal agents. However, if not properly treated, these infections may become chronic, requiring oral antifungal drugs, which are often associated with hepatotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, complications like bacterial superinfection, lichenification and maceration can occur. Therefore, there is a need for prompt and effective treatment of dermatophytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Of all dermatophytoses, onychomycosis remains resistant to most antifungal therapies. Currently available topical therapies are not very effective because of poor penetrability through the nail or being fungistatic. However, the US FDA has recently approved tavaborole and efinaconazole for topical use in treatment of mild to moderate onychomycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Calmagen&#x000ae;, a novel antifungal cream and lotion, has shown promising results in preclinical studies and medically supervised non-randomised human trials. It is listed with the Australian Therapeutics Goods Authority and approved by Health Canada under the brand, Mycolixin&#x000ae;.</p><p id="Par22">The active component of Calmagen&#x000ae; is AMYCOT&#x000ae;, a bioactive extract, derived from <italic>Arthospira maxima</italic> (Spirulina), a filamentous cyanobacterium used as food for centuries. Extracts of <italic>Arthospira maxima</italic> have been documented to possess antimicrobial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. AMYCOT&#x000ae; has been extracted through a proprietary process of physiologically and mechanically stressing the cyanobacterium, which induces release of molecules with antimicrobial activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In vitro studies have shown that AMYCOT&#x000ae; is effective against fungi such as <italic>Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum</italic>, including the yeasts, <italic>Candida albicans</italic> and <italic>Malassezia furfur</italic> and the bacterium, <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Preliminary chemical analysis of AMYCOT&#x000ae; (unpublished results) shows a diversity of molecules present in the extract &#x02013; fatty acids, carbohydrate and proteins &#x02013; all of which are known to have anti-fungal properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. One of AMYCOT&#x000ae;&#x02018;s unique fungicidal properties includes enzymatic hydrolysis of chitin, the structural component of the fungal cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The actual molecule(s) responsible for chitin hydrolysis has not yet been isolated. However, AMYCOT&#x000ae;&#x02019;s potent fungicidal property can possibly be attributed to the synergistic effects of the aforementioned bioactive molecules.</p><p id="Par24">Efficacy was further demonstrated against acne, deep nail bed infection, chronic varicose ulcers, and burns. Additional studies confirmed that AMYCOT&#x000ae; was effective against tinea (unpublished results) and onychomycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The current study was conducted to establish the fungicidal, efficacy and safety profiles of Calmagen&#x000ae; dermaceutical cream and lotion as a topical treatment in patients with severe to very severe presentations of tinea and onychomycosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par26">This clinical study was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded and parallel group, single centre study. The clinical study protocol was written in English but was also explained in a language (Hindi and Kannada) the volunteer subjects understood. The Informed consent form (ICF), which also included the study information for the patients, was also printed in Hindi and Kannada and provided to the subjects. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The Committee for Evaluation of Protocols for Clinical Research (CLINICOM), an independent ethics committee in Bangalore, India approved the study (Protocol MA-CT-09-12) on 22 January 2010 in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p id="Par27">The study was conducted at a single centre at the Apollo Clinic Bangalore, India. Males and females aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, with tinea of combined severity (itching, erythema and scaling) score of &#x02265;8 or with severe or very severe onychomycosis and who had provided the written informed consent and consent for taking photographs of the affected region were enrolled in the study. These subjects were also diagnosed with positive KOH smear, positive fungal culture test with identification of dermatophyte and presence of live spores. Patients who received any oral or topical tinea treatments one week prior to screening or had ingested any drug in the week prior to start or during the treatment were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria are summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study disposition</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12906_2017_1970_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par28">The study coordinator (Manipal Acunova) randomized the subjects to either treatment (Calmagen&#x000ae; dermaceutical cream [12% AMYCOT&#x000ae;] or lotion [8% AMYCOT&#x000ae;]) or placebo arm in a 1:1 ratio, according to a computer-generated list by block randomization (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A random number was allocated to each box of study medication and the study site dispensed the study medication in sequential order as the patients qualify for study participation. The study coordinator kept one set of sealed envelopes containing the treatment codes while a second set was kept at the study site with the corresponding study medication. All patients and the investigator involved in conducting the study were blinded to treatment codes. Upon completion of the study, all sealed envelopes were returned to the study coordinator.</p><p id="Par29">Subjects with tinea applied either Calmagen&#x000ae; or placebo cream twice daily to the affected area of skin for a period of four weeks. Subjects with onychomycosis applied either Calmagen&#x000ae; or placebo lotion twice daily over the face of the nail and under and around the margins and cuticle for 12&#x000a0;weeks. An additional observation phase of 12&#x000a0;weeks was undertaken for subjects with onychomycosis, during which the lotion was applied only once daily. After the observational phase (month six), the change in surface area and severity of target lesions in onychomycosis subjects were evaluated.</p><p id="Par30">The primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of subjects who had achieved mycological cure at the end of the study. Mycological cure included assessing KOH smear, fungal culture and live spore counts, by obtaining scrapings from the lesion and analysed with standard methods as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Direct microscopic examination of the above specimen was performed to detect fungal spores or hyphae. The investigator assessed the secondary endpoints during scheduled visits. The secondary efficacy endpoints included (i) reduction in size and severity score of target lesion (tinea or onychomycosis), (ii) clinical cure defined as IGA response of &#x02018;cleared&#x02019; or &#x02018;excellent&#x02019;, (iii) improvement in lesions assessed by photographic record. Assessment of Onychomycosis severity scores was based on clinical practice opinions and the Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis (SCIO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Scoring of the severity of Tinea lesions were based on clinical experience and adapted from Reyes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Safety evaluation included assessment of adverse events and assessment of vital signs.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par31">The sample size for this study was computed based on the results from a previous open label, non-comparative multi-centre study on the 1% oxiconazole cream and lotion anti-fungal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. From the aforementioned study (Jerajani et al.), the observed 81% cure rate for the experimental drugs and an assigned 10% IGA response of &#x02018;cleared&#x02019; or &#x02018;excellent&#x02019; for the placebo group were used as parameters to determine the sample size in the present study using a two-group Fisher&#x02019;s-exact test of equal proportions. Based on these assumptions, there is over 95% power to detect a significant difference between the Calmagen&#x000ae; and placebo groups with 14 subjects per group (28 subjects overall) at 5% level of significance, and assuming a 20% dropout rate.</p><p id="Par32">All patients who received the study treatment and had at least one efficacy measurement subsequent to the baseline visit, were included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population which was the primary population for efficacy analysis. Patients who completed both the baseline and end of treatment visits and who had no major protocol violations were included in the per-protocol (PP) population, which was the secondary population for efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint was also analyzed for the per-protocol (PP) population which includes all randomized patients who complete both the baseline visit and end of treatment visit and who have no major protocol violations. Since all subjects completed the study without protocol violations, the PP and mITT populations were essentially the same. All secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed for the mITT and PP populations. Safety data were analyzed for Safety Population, which included all patients who have received at least one application of study drug.</p><p id="Par33">The parameters for the primary endpoint were analysed using the two proportions (Binomial) test. For the secondary endpoint, analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used to evaluate the reduction in size and severity score of the target lesion of tinea, or extent and severity of onychomycosis compared to the baseline at the end of the study. Summary of the IGA responses and improvements in lesions assessed by photographic record response of &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;No&#x02019; were recorded.</p><p id="Par34">For safety evaluation, all patients who were randomized and dispensed study medication (Intention-to-treat [ITT] population) were included in the analysis. A <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.

This study confirms findings of a previous investigator-initiated open label study, which showed that Calmagen&#x000ae; lotion (8% AMYCOT&#x000ae;) is effective in the management of onychomycosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A total of 10 patients with onychomycosis were treated with Calmagen&#x000ae; lotion topically twice daily for three months.

Calmagen&#x000ae; cream and lotion formulations are based on cosmetic excipients registered with INCI (International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients), which makes application of Calmagen&#x000ae; cream and lotion easier on the skin and nail without any adverse reactions. In contrast, most of the chemical-based anti-fungals have reported skin irritations as a commonly reported adverse event. In patients with <italic>Tinea cruris</italic>, complete clearance was observed in 21.2% treated with luliconazole cream 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In another study, Global Evaluation Response revealed that skin lesions were completely cleared with Whitfield&#x02019;s ointment + oral fluconazole and butenafine cream in 98% patients with tinea. However, Whitfield&#x02019;s ointment caused burning and redness, oral fluconazole caused gastritis, while no adverse events were reported with topical butenafine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Terbinafine and sertaconazole resulted in complete cure in 100% subjects with <italic>Tinea cruris</italic> and <italic>Tinea corporis</italic> at the end of 3&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. While both topical as well as oral formulations of antifungal drugs are available, topical treatments are preferred in superficial tinea because of high cure rates with 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks of therapy. Additionally, systemic absorption with topical drugs is minimal, and adverse effects are limited to skin reactions at the site of application, which are usually mild and transient. However, oral antifungal drugs such as terbinafine can cause serious adverse effects like hepatotoxicity and Stevens&#x02013;Johnson syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">Onychomycosis is more challenging to treat compared to other superficial dermatophytoses, because of difficulties in drug penetration through the nail. The US FDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) approved tavaborole and efinaconazole for topical treatments against mild-to-moderate onychomycosis in 2014. In two phase III studies on 10% efinaconazole topical solution, mycological cure rates of 55.2% and 53.4% and complete cure rates of 15.2% and 17.8% at week 52, were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In another efinaconazole study, a mycological cure rate of 56% and clinical treatment success of 43% were observed after week 52 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. According to Canadian guidelines, efinaconazole is recommended only in treating mild and moderate onychomycosis, but not in severe cases (where terbinafine is preferred) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In two phase III studies on 5% tavaborole topical solution, mycological cure was observed in 31.1&#x02013;35.9% and complete cure of only 7&#x02013;9% at week 52.

Although Calmagen&#x000ae; has shown promising efficacy and safety, there is a need for a larger multi-centre, randomized trial for each formulation of Calmagen&#x000ae;, benchmarking it against other standard antifungal drugs. Nevertheless, this study confirms that Calmagen&#x000ae; cream and lotion containing AMYCOT&#x000ae; are potentially safe and efficacious, representing a natural alternative for the management of severe to very severe tinea skin and fungal nail (onychomycosis) infections.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cm</term><def><p id="Par8">Centimetre</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IGA</term><def><p id="Par9">Investigator Global Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INCI</term><def><p id="Par10">International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par11">Intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KOH</term><def><p id="Par12">Potassium hydroxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIC</term><def><p id="Par13">Minimum inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mITT</term><def><p id="Par14">Modified intention-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCIO</term><def><p id="Par15">Scoring Clinical Index for Onychomycosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par16">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>USFDA</term><def><p id="Par17">United States Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Wanda MacKinnon and Danny Goldman for critical reading of the manuscript, and giving their valuable inputs for improvisation of the manuscript.
