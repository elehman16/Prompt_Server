This study sought to compare the effectiveness and safety of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) (lisinopril) vs. an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (losartan) for the treatment of cardiomyopathy (CM) in boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
Background: 
Development of CM is universal in boys with DMD. ACE-I and ARB have both been suggested as effective treatment options. ARBs have been associated with skeletal muscle regeneration in a mouse model of DMD. The question of which, if either, is more effective for CM treatment in DMD remains. The purpose of this multicenter double-blind prospective study was to compare efficacy and safety of lisinopril versus losartan in the treatment of newly diagnosed CM in boys with DMD.
Methods: 
Echocardiographic technician inter- and intraobserver variability were tested on 2 separate days on 2 different boys with DMD CM. Results were compared with paired t-testing.
Twenty-two boys with newly diagnosed DMD CM (echocardiographic ejection fraction (EF) 10% EF drop. Three boys in the aCE-I group had 3 visits, due to study funding termination. Two were withdrawn because of low EF. All their data are included in the analysis for as long as they remained in the study. Mean EF&#x02019;s were similar at baseline (47.5%- ACE-I, 48.4%- ARB). After 1 year each group significantly improved to 54.6% and 55.2% respectively (p=.02). There was no difference between the 2 treatment groups at 1 year.
Conclusions:
Inter-observer and intra-observer reliability studies showed no differences between echocardiographers on serial examinations. 
EF improved equally in the two groups. There is no therapeutic difference in EF improvement between lisinopril and losartan over the one-year duration for treatment of boys with DMD-related CM.

The two boys, aged 9 years and 17 years, were asked to volunteer for these studies after parents signed IRB approved consent and the patients signed assent. The boys chosen for this testing were known to be difficult to examine because of body habitus. Each boy was compensated monetarily ($50) for his participation. A cardiologist made patient assignments and monitored these sessions (HDA). A standard protocol was followed with the technicians measuring left ventricular dimensions and planimeterizing the 4 chamber apex view for derivation of EF using Simpson&#x02019;s rule. The examinations were blinded and were then re-read and remeasured by one of the investigators (HDA) and data were recorded.</p><p>Inter- and intra-examiner results were compared using paired t-testing.</p><p>Study entry</p><p>DMD patients of any age were considered for enrollment. Inclusion criteria included a clinical course consistent with DMD, a proven mutation of the DMD gene or muscle dystrophin levels of &#x0003c;5% on muscle biopsy, a Doppler echocardiogram with EF &#x0003c;55% within 30 days of study initiation, and the ability to cooperate with testing.</p><p>Glucocorticoid treatment was acceptable, including either daily or weekend dosing of prednisone or deflazacort. Treatment with metoprolol or an equivalent beta-blocker was also acceptable. It was previously established that concomitant beta-blocker therapy did not seem to alter EF improvement results in patients treated with an ACE-I , although the study cited was not designed or powered to test the effect of beta blocker alone <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. We did not have genotypic information from all centers. We did not have information regarding ambulatory status or respiratory support.</p><p>Patients who were currently taking either lisinopril &#x02264; 5 mg, losartan &#x02264; 25 mg or enalapril &#x02264; 5 mg were eligible for enrollment after a two-week washout if their repeat echocardiogram showed an EF &#x0003e; 40% but &#x0003c; 55% (considered as a washout cohort). Exclusion criteria included patients with an EF &#x02265; 55% or &#x02264; 40% after washout; current treatment with &#x0003e; 5 mg lisinopril, &#x0003e; 25 mg losartan, or &#x0003e; 5 mg enalapril; or manifest skeletal deformities or pulmonary anatomical variants that precluded consistent measures by Doppler echocardiography.</p><p>All subjects were enrolled under Institutional Review Board-approved protocols. Consent (adults) and assent (boys between ages 9-18) forms were signed by all participants, and stored at Nationwide Children&#x02019;s Hospital (NCH) as well as at participating sites.The study's IRB number is IRB09-00051.</p><p>Echo data</p><p>All echoes were initally read at the patient&#x02019;s home site by the participating pediatric cardiologist. They were then cross-read and confirmed at the primary site by 2 of the authors (HDA, PTT). EF was measured using the biplane Simpson&#x02019;s rule using images obtained from the apical 4 chamber view <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. The bullet method (area-length) was used for EF calculation in 2 patients from one site <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. The echo core site readers and the home site physicians and coordinators had absolutely no knowledge as to which drug the patient was receiving.</p><p>All echo-derived data were recorded on a standardized sheet, and data were finalized and entered into a dedicated database at the primary site (NCH Bioinformatics Core). All data were stored in strict adherence to HIPAA regulations regarding patient privacy. Numbers were provided to individual centers and patients were enrolled using an appropriate code.</p><p>Drug protocol</p><p>Randomization was performed by the NCH Investigational Drug Pharmacy. With entry into the study, the boys were given a capsule that contained either lisinopril or losartan, prepared by the research pharmacist at Nationwide Children&#x02019;s Hospital. The contents of the capsule looked identical, no matter which drug they contained. None of the study investigators (the cardiologist, neurologist, and site study coordinators) had knowledge of which drug was in the capsule.</p><p>Lisinopril dosage was as close to 0.07 mg/kg as possible; losartan dosage was as close to 0.7 mg/kg as possible; generally at 5 mg/day (lisinopril) or 25 mg/day (losartan). The capsules were taken daily and the subjects returned for follow up at 4 monthly intervals. Any siblings enrolled in the study received the same drug (one occurrence).</p><p>Examination and history were standardized, and most subjects had at least four evaluations (baseline, and three subsequent visits 4 months apart). At each follow-up visit, a standard questionnaire included inquiry into the most common potential adverse effects, including dizziness, cough, syncope, and headache. Blood pressures were measured and the patient was examined. The container containing the capsules was returned and any remaining capsules were returned to the research pharmacist. The patient was then provided with a 4-month refill of capsules, with dosage adjusted based on the result of the repeat echocardiogram. No change in dosage was made if the EF was within 5% of the original EF, dosage was doubled if the EF decreased 5-10%, and the patient was discontinued from the study if the EF decreased &#x0003e; 10%. Allergy to the medication was another reason for termination.</p><p>Treating physicians were unblinded only at the termination of the study, or if the patient was discharged from the study, in which case the treating cardiologist provided ongoing care was informed as to which drug was employed. The investigators at the primary site remained blinded to the drug used.</p><p>Data analysis</p><p>Ejection fraction was the primary data endpoint. All the outcome measures were normally distributed. EF was serially compared at each visit with baseline using paired t- tests within each drug group. Baseline EF and at the last (usually 4<sup>th)</sup> visit were compared between the ACE-I and ARB groups using two sample t-test and corroborated with mixed model analysis. Baseline age was nonparametric and was compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Comparison of the presence of steroid treatment or &#x003b2;-blocker treatment was made using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The relative effect of two medications on EF was analyzed by mixed model adjusting on age, steroid status, visit number and baseline EF.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main finding of this prospective double-blinded study is that there is no therapeutic difference between lisinopril and losartan over one-year&#x02019;s duration of treatment of boys with DMD-related CM. Each drug significantly improved systolic function at one year. Our results suggest that since the drugs are equally effective either can be safely used to treat the CM of DMD.One of the losartan patients was removed from the study due to an allergic reaction. His data are included. The other patient dropped below the acceptable EF decrease for continued blinded administration, but his was the only discontinuance of 10 total patients receiving losartan. We feel that this situation is more consistent with the natural history of the disease than drug toxicity; nonetheless, his data are included in the analysis until the time that he was removed from the investigation.Three of the lisinopril treated boys had three visits but did not have a fourth due to termination of funding of the study. Two lisinopril treated boys from the same center did not fit the protocol as their initial EF was less than 40% and were discontinued when this was discovered.</p><p>Our results also confirm the utility of echocardiography in DMD trials. In the current era of advanced imaging, such as cardiac MRI, it can be tempting to dismiss echocardiography as an imaging modality in this patient population due to the difficulty of obtaining adequate imaging. We do not intend to underscore the importance of advanced imaging in this population, as it can yield additional information such as ventricular myocardial fibrosis and strain/strain rate analysis. However, cardiac MRI imaging does have drawbacks, especially in the research arena. A cardiac MRI, is typically a longer study, and as such may require sedation/anesthesia in order to obtain optimal imaging. In addition, if gadolinium is given to evaluate for late-gadolinium enhancement, a peripheral IV is required. Also, there is additional cost required in obtaining a cardiac MRI.</p><p>Our inter-rater and intra-rater reliability studies showed no differences between echocardiographers on serial examinations. No study was cancelled due to inability to perform the examination, even on patients who were difficult to position, demonstrating that echocardiography can be utilized to monitor CM in this challenging patient population. While echocardiography may not be suitable to all cardiac research endeavors in this population, our results demonstrate that reliable and reproducible echocardiographic data can be obtained, and echocardiography should not be dismissed as an imaging modality, even in the patient with DMD who has difficult acoustic windows.</p><p>Our study did have several limitations. First, this study only evaluates the short-term benefit of either drug over the course of 1 year. Many patients with DMD are treated for CM for far longer than 1 year, but given our results, we are unable to speculate regarding the long-term benefits of either medication. We would expect that given the progressive nature of the disease, CM would continue to progress in both groups, and that one of these medications may prove to delay progression better than the other.</p><p>Additionally, while the study is randomized and double-blinded, our numbers are still small despite this being a multi-center study. This is likely limited, in part, by the inclusion criteria of a required washout period for those on lower-dose lisinopril or losartan and by the exclusion of those patients on higher doses of either drug.</p><p>Given our entry criteria to evaluate the effects of these drugs on boys with CM associated with DMD, we are also unable to predict whether one of these medications may be cardioprotective if initiated prior to the development of gross cardiac dysfunction.</p><p>In conclusion, there is no difference between the effects of lisinopril versus losartan on EF improvement in DMD boys with CM. The drugs were safe. Thus, this study opens the opportunity to study muscle function in younger boys with DMD to see if the skeletal muscle improvement seen in the mdx mouse following treatment with an ARB might also be demonstrated in DMD boys. <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
