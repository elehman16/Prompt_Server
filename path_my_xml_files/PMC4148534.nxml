Trough level monitoring of immunosuppressants is insufficient to estimate the individual intensity of immunosuppression. We have already shown that virus-specific T cells (Tvis) correlate with control of virus replication as well as with the intensity of immunosuppression. The multicentre IVIST01-trial should prove that additional steering of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better graft function by avoidance of over-immunosuppression (for example, viral infections) and drug toxicity (for example, nephrotoxicity).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The IVIST-trial starts 4&#x000a0;weeks after transplantation. Sixty-four pediatric kidney recipients are randomized either to a non-intervention group that is only treated conservatively or to an intervention group with additional monitoring by Tvis. The randomization is stratified by centre and cytomegalovirus (CMV) prophylaxis. In both groups the immunosuppressive medication (cyclosporine A and everolimus) is adopted in the same target range of trough levels. In the non-intervention group the immunosuppressive therapy (cyclosporine A and everolimus) is only steered by classical trough level monitoring and the antiviral therapy of a CMV infection is performed according to a standard protocol. In contrast, in the intervention group the dose of immunosuppressants is individually adopted according to Tvis levels as a direct measure of the intensity of immunosuppression in addition to classical trough level monitoring. In case of CMV infection or reactivation the antiviral management is based on the individual CMV-specific immune defense assessed by the CMV-Tvis level. Primary endpoint of the study is the glomerular filtration rate 2&#x000a0;years after transplantation; secondary endpoints are the number and severity of viral infections and the incidence of side effects of immunosuppressive and antiviral drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This IVIST01-trial will answer the question whether the new concept of steering immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels leads to better future graft function. In terms of an effect-related drug monitoring, the study design aims to realize a personalization of immunosuppressive and antiviral management after transplantation. Based on the IVIST01-trial, immunomonitoring by Tvis might be incorporated into routine care after kidney transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>EudraCT No: 2009-012436-32, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN89806912">ISRCTN89806912</ext-link> (17 June 2009).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Kidney transplantation</kwd><kwd>Immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>Virus-specific T cells</kwd><kwd>Personalized immunosuppressive therapy</kwd><kwd>Viral infections</kwd><kwd>Pediatric transplantation</kwd><kwd>Cytomegalovirus</kwd><kwd>Antiviral therapy</kwd><kwd>Over-immunosuppression</kwd><kwd>Immunomonitoring</kwd><kwd>Drug-monitoring</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>After solid organ transplantation (Tx), immunosuppressive treatment disrupts the individual balance between virus replication and cellular immune response. This leads to an elevated risk of severe viral complications due to primary infection or reactivation (for example, cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus (ADV), or herpes-simplex-virus (HSV)). CMV is known as a major pathogen after kidney Tx, whereas the importance of ADV and HSV is still unclear, especially in children. Because of high costs and severe side effects, antiviral treatment should be restricted to patients with high risk of viral diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Due to missing appropriate diagnostic methods, the optimal timing of antiviral therapy/prophylaxis remains a subject for debate. Virus load and virus serology are insufficient to predict the individual risk and to decide upon the necessity and duration of antiviral prophylaxis and therapy. Virus-specific T cells (Tvis) have been shown to play a significant role in the control of virus replication. Therefore, they may serve as a prognostic marker for virus-induced diseases after Tx. Preliminary studies have found that the risk of post-transplant CMV-induced disease correlated with the individual number of CMV-Tvis. Reduced frequencies of CMV-Tvis in transplant recipients are associated with increased incidence of infectious complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. After adult kidney Tx, symptomatic CMV reactivations are preceded by a decrease in CMV-CD4+ Tvis frequencies and an increase in CMV load
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Gamadia and colleagues determined the kinetics and characteristics of CMV-Tvis in the course of primary CMV infections in adult renal transplant recipients: in asymptomatic individuals the CMV-CD4+ Tvis response preceded the CMV-CD8+ Tvis response, whereas in symptomatic individuals the CMV-specific effector memory CD4+ T cell response was delayed and only detectable after antiviral therapy
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, Tvis may represent a diagnostic tool to predict the individual risk for virus complications after solid organ Tx and enable a selective post-transplant prophylaxis. It has been shown that after Tx &#x02013; the time of maximal immunosuppressive therapy &#x02013; levels of Tvis are lower than later after Tx. Accordingly it may be speculated that the amount of Tvis correlates with the extent of immunosuppression. Consequently, immunosuppressive therapy might better be steered by addition of this parameter than by measuring blood levels of immunosuppressants alone.</p><p>Studies concerning CMV-Tvis after kidney Tx in adult renal transplant recipients and healthy individuals were carried out in Homburg (Saar), Germany
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in Los Angeles, USA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], in Uppsala, Sweden
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] as well as in Amsterdam, The Netherlands
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] by cytokine flowcytometry and tetramer staining. Additionally, Sester and colleagues compared levels of CMV-Tvis in long-term kidney, heart and lung transplant recipients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CMV-Tvis in adult heart recipients were also evaluated in Stanford, California, USA
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and in Berlin, Germany
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Duarte, California, USA, La Rosa and colleagues investigated CMV-Tvis response after adult liver Tx
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Concerning ADV-Tvis after solid organ Tx, there are only a few studies available: in Homburg (Saar), Germany, the level of ADV-Tvis were investigated in adult renal transplant recipients and healthy individuals by cytokine flowcytometry
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA, Olive and colleagues analysed ADV-Tvis response of healthy adults by ELISPOT and flow cytometry
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>No studies for HSV-Yvis after solid organ Tx have been conducted to the best of our knowledge.</p><p>The only large trial of Tvis in pediatric kidney recipients has been carried out to evaluate polyoma BK virus-specific T cells in a cooperation of Italian centers for Pediatric Nephrology and the department of virology in Basel, Switzerland
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. No pediatric studies exist for CMV-, ADV- or HSV-Tvis after solid organ Tx. Until now, to our knowledge, no trials have been conducted that base the adoption of immunosuppressive therapy not only on drug trough levels but also on the grade of suppression of Tvis.</p><p>After solid organ Tx, immunosuppressive treatment causes an increased risk of severe viral complications. Monitoring of the grade of immunosuppression is most often performed by blood levels of immunosuppressants. Virus load and serology are insufficient to predict the individual risk of viral infections and to decide on the necessity and duration of antiviral prophylaxis and therapy. Tvis have been shown to correlate with control of virus replication as well as with the intensity of immunosuppression. Therefore, they may serve as an indicator of the level of immunosuppression as well as a prognostic marker for virus-induced diseases after Tx. Using cytokine flow cytometry we are able to monitor Tvis with specificity for different virus types.</p><p>In future this method should be established as routine use in order to develop new strategies to steer and individualize immunosuppressive therapy, to avoid severe infections, to improve post-transplant management of viral infections and to optimize the individual timing of antiviral therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The general aim of the trial is a prolongation of renal graft function and reduction of viral infections after kidney Tx by monitoring of Tvis followed by therapeutic intervention. Therefore, the primary endpoint is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (cystatin C; Schwartz and Filler formula) 2&#x000a0;years after Tx. Secondary endpoints are reduction in viral infections after kidney Tx, optimization of the individual timing of antiviral therapy, optimization of the immunosuppressive therapy, reduction of nephrotoxic effects of cyclosporine A (CsA) and antiviral agents by optimized dosing, and premature study discontinuations due to adverse events.</p><p>According to the legislation, &#x0201c;patients suffering from rare conditions should be entitled to the same quality of treatments as other patients&#x0201d;
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We interpret this in a way that randomized evidence for treatment decisions should be provided. Even if it is clear from the beginning that it will be difficult to achieve &#x0201c;significant&#x0201d; results at the end, the randomized comparison is obviously much less prone to bias than findings from prospective observational studies, or retrospective comparisons. In consequence the estimators and confidence intervals that will be calculated from this study will be in every case more informative than from uncontrolled studies.Therefore the study was planned as a multicenter, randomized, open-labeled study recruiting 64 children during the first 2&#x000a0;years after kidney Tx. This study is designed to improve the post-transplant steering of immunosuppressive drugs (CsA and everolimus) and the post-transplant management of CMV infections by quantitation of Tvis from whole blood samples. Based on specific cellular activation and induction of intracellular cytokines the levels of Tvis for different virus types (CMV, ADV, HSV) will be measured using flow cytometry (see below). In the non-intervention group, the immunosuppressive therapy is only based on classical trough level monitoring and the antiviral treatment is performed according to center practice. In the intervention group, the immunosuppressive and the antiviral therapy will be additionally adapted to the levels of Tvis. The study design is summarized in Figures&#x000a0;

Renal function will be measured at each visit by GFR.</p><p>The primary analysis will be conducted on the intention-to-treat population. All analyses are based on two-sided hypotheses using a significance level of 5%. The precise primary hypothesis of the study is that the GFR 24&#x000a0;months after kidney Tx is significantly larger in the intervention group compared to the non-intervention group and will be tested by an analysis of covariance. The primary analysis model consists of the GFR 24&#x000a0;months after Tx as the dependent variable. Treatment strategy, including the intervention and the control treatment, a covariable including patient&#x02019;s baseline GFR and two other factors (the CMV prophylaxis (yes/no) and the center) are used for stratification purposes. The estimate, as well as the two-sided 95% confidence interval, for the difference in mean intervention group/non-intervention group for the primary endpoint will be provided from the analysis of covariance model. Superiority will be concluded if the lower boundary of this confidence interval is larger than 0. Differences in the number of viral infections will be analyzed using a generalized linear model based on the negative binomial distribution. As soon as the primary hypothesis can be rejected, the reduction in the number of viral infections will be assessed as a confirmatory analysis.</p><p>Furthermore, secondary analyses will investigate the treatment effect in the strata of CMV prophylaxis and the center. In addition, interaction between treatment strategy and the CMV prophylaxis will be investigated descriptively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sample size and power considerations</title><p>The clinical hypothesis is that GFR values 24&#x000a0;months after kidney Tx will be higher in the intervention group compared to the non-intervention group.</p><p>Due to the orphan condition under investigation, sample size calculation is feasibility driven and describes under which circumstances this trial can be formally successful.</p><p>The total sample size of this study is limited to 64 patients; that is, 32 patients per treatment group. The effect of the therapy is considered as relevant if the difference between the therapy groups in mean GFR is at least 7.5&#x000a0;ml/min per 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> with a standard deviation of 15&#x000a0;ml/min per 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. With these assumptions, the power to reject the null hypothesis of no difference between treatment groups with a two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test for two independent samples and a significance level of 5% (two-sided) is 50%. To reach a power of 80% in the same setting, a treatment effect of 10.672&#x000a0;ml/min per 1.73&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> has to be achieved. It is assumed that stratification for CMV prophylaxis and center and adjustment for patient&#x02019;s baseline will lead to an increase in power.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of Hannover Medical School (reference number 5067&#x000a0;M) as the leading center and the Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel, as well as by the ethics committee of the University of Cologne, the Medical Board of Hamburg and the University of Rostsock as secondary committees who reported to the leading committee. A data safety monitoring committee (DSMC) has been implemented from the beginning of the trial consisting of a pediatric pulmonologist, a transplant surgeon and an adult nephrologist.

In a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled study, the IVIST01-trial will test the hypothesis that additional steering of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy by Tvis levels will improve renal graft function and survival by individualizing post-transplant management and avoiding over-immunosuppression and drug toxicity. This novel concept of immunomonitoring by Tvis might optimize future steering of immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy and thereby become an important step towards personalized immunosuppressive and antiviral therapy in terms of an effect-related drug monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p>A total of 35 patients from two centers have been recruited (status as of 1 July 2014); 20 patients have finished the study, five patients became drop-outs (one patient in the control group died by drowning in the bath tub). All safety reports suggest continuing the trial as planned. Recruitment was slower than originally intended; therefore, the study was changed from a monocenter to a multicenter trial in 2012. Actually half of the anticipated patient numbers have been reached. The first additional center has started recruitment. With the two additional centers starting to recruit patients, the end of recruitment can be estimated for 2015.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ADV</term><def><p>adenovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMV</term><def><p>cytomegalovirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CsA</term><def><p>cyclosporine A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSMC</term><def><p>data safety monitoring committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EBV</term><def><p>Epstein-Barr virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFR</term><def><p>glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSV</term><def><p>herpes-simplex-virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IFN</term><def><p>interferon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Ig</term><def><p>immunoglobulin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC-MS/MS</term><def><p>liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass-spectrometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p>tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tvis</term><def><p>virus-specific T cells</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Tx</term><def><p>transplantation.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>TAG, LP, AG, CF and AK designed the trial, and TAG and LP obtained research funding.
