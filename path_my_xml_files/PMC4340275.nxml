The aim of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3-weekly or weekly doses of <italic>nanoparticle albumin-bound</italic>-paclitaxel compared with weekly doses of Cremophor-based paclitaxel in patients with unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to first-line chemotherapy comprising fluoropyrimidines. A total of 730 patients will be enrolled from 72 institutions.

Paclitaxel (PTX) is the most commonly used agent in second-line chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) in Japan (<xref rid="HYU205C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="HYU205C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>In Japan, the standard first-line of treatment for unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer is systemic chemotherapy consisting of S-1 (oral fluoropyrimidine) plus cisplatin or S-1 alone. According to the SPIRITS (<xref rid="HYU205C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and JCOG9912 (<xref rid="HYU205C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) trials, the combination of S-1 plus cisplatin is the most frequently prescribed chemotherapy regimen for gastric cancer. However, standard second-line chemotherapy is not well established. Several Phase III studies have shown a survival benefit with second-line chemotherapy when compared with best supportive care (BSC) (<xref rid="HYU205C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="HYU205C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>A previously conducted Phase III trial (WJOG4007) compared weekly doses of PTX and irinotecan in previously treated gastric cancer patients. In this trial, no benefit in the overall survival (OS) was demonstrated with irinotecan (experimental arm) compared with weekly doses of PTX (control arm). Furthermore, PTX resulted in a better survival benefit than irinotecan did. The authors concluded that both chemotherapies were reasonable second-line treatment options (<xref rid="HYU205C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>PTX, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, is widely used to treat breast, lung, gastric and ovarian cancers. The Cremophor&#x000ae; (solvent polyethoxylated castor oil)-containing PTX formulation has been approved, and it is prescribed worldwide. However, premedication with steroids and antihistamines- and H2-receptor blockers is essential before the administration of Cremophor-based PTX to reduce allergic reaction, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions in the clinical setting.</p><p><italic>Nanoparticle albumin-bound</italic>-paclitaxel (<italic>nab</italic>-PTX) is a 130-nm nanoparticle albumin-bound PTX formulation that does not require Cremophor or anhydrous ethanol. <italic>Nab</italic>-PTX thus reduces the risk of hypersensitivity reactions and does not require steroidal or antihistamine premedication. Furthermore, because the <italic>nab</italic>-PTX formulation does not contain alcohol, it can be administered to patients with poor alcohol metabolism (<xref rid="HYU205C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), thereby preventing alcohol-induced hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, <italic>nab</italic>-PTX can be administered in shorter period of time (30 min) and without the need for special intravenous (i.v.) tubing; as such, polyethylene-lined i.v. bags composed of polyvinyl chloride can be used for <italic>nab</italic>-PTX administration (<xref rid="HYU205C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="HYU205C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>).</p><p>A Phase II trial investigating the efficacy of 3-weekly doses of <italic>nab</italic>-PTX for AGC, by using the response rate (RR) as the primary endpoint, indicated promising results with a RR of 27.8% (95% confidence interval: 16.5&#x02013;41.6%). The clinical response observed with second-line <italic>nab</italic>-PTX treatment appears to be comparable to that obtained in prior PTX trials (<xref rid="HYU205C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), although no direct comparison of the data has been performed.</p><p>In response to the results of this Phase II trial, we designed an investigational-drug arm-based Phase III trial with the purpose of establishing whether there is evidence to support 3-weekly doses of <italic>nab</italic>-PTX. In addition, weekly <italic>nab</italic>-PTX was included as another investigational-drug arm; based on the WJOG4007 trial, we judged it was appropriate to use weekly doses of Cremophor-based PTX as a control arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Details of the ABSOLUTE Trial protocol</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purpose</title><p>This study was designed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of 3-weekly <italic>nab-</italic>PTX, weekly <italic>nab</italic>-PTX, and weekly Cremophor-based PTX for the treatment of patients with unresectable or recurrent gastric cancer refractory to prior chemotherapy containing fluoropyrimidines.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study setting</title><p>This trial is a multiinstitutional (72 institutions), prospective, open-label, randomized Phase III trial commencing in January 2013 in Japan.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint is OS, and the secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, overall response rate, disease control rate, quality of life (using the EQ-5D system) and safety.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Prior to enrollment in the study, patients must fulfill all the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

Assuming that the median OS with <italic>nab</italic>-PTX is not less than that with weekly PTX by &#x0003e;30% of the difference between weekly PTX and BSC (<xref rid="HYU205C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="HYU205C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), the upper non-inferiority margin is calculated to be 1.25 for the HR. The overall significance level is set at 0.05, and the primary analysis will be performed by using the Holm method for multiple comparisons. To test the hypotheses with an 80% power, a registration period of 18 months, and a minimum follow-up period of 12 months, 230 patients per arm or 690 patients in total are required for analysis. Considering the possibility that 5% of the enrolled patients will be excluded from the analysis, the number of patients to be enrolled is set at 730. Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the <italic>A-arm</italic>, <italic>B-arm</italic> or <italic>C-arm</italic> via a minimization method with docetaxel-containing first-line treatment, peritoneal metastasis, and ECOG PS as the allocation factors.</p><p>The primary analysis will aim to test the following two comparisons with respect to the OS:

If the upper limit of the 97.5% confidence interval is below the non-inferiority margin of 1.25 for a comparison with a lower <italic>P</italic> value of the two, it will be judged that the <italic>nab</italic>-PTX regimen of the first comparison has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to weekly PTX. If the <italic>nab</italic>-PTX regimen of the first comparison is demonstrated to be non-inferior to weekly PTX, a non-inferiority test of another comparison will be performed by using the non-inferiority margin of 1.25 and a 95% confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Interim analysis and monitoring</title><p>No interim analysis is planned.
