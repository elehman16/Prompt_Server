Patients underwent annual assessments, including colonoscopies, to detect the time from randomization to the earliest occurrence of &#x02265;20 polyps (&#x0003e;2 mm in size) or colorectal malignancy. The study was terminated early due to low rate of observed endpoints combined with a lower than expected enrollment rate. Descriptive results are provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 106 randomized patients, 55 were treated with celecoxib (mean age 12.6 years; 52.7% female) and 51 were given placebo (mean age 12.2 years; 54.9% female). Disease progression (&#x02265;20 polyps, &#x0003e;2 mm in size) was observed in seven (12.7%) and 13 (25.5%) patients, respectively. The median time to disease progression was 2.1 years in the celecoxib group and 1.1 years for placebo. No patient developed colorectal cancer. The rate of adverse events (AEs) was similar in both groups (75.5% and 72.9%, respectively). Three patients in the celecoxib group (none in the placebo group) experienced serious AEs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In children with FAP, celecoxib was a well-tolerated treatment that was associated with a lower rate of colorectal polyposis and a longer time to disease progression compared with placebo.

Neither the timing of this surgery nor the procedure itself has been standardized in pediatric patients with FAP.<xref rid="b4-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Factors such as the presence of symptoms, polyp burden, psychosocial implications, and physical maturity, to name a few, must be considered before the decision to carry out this surgery is made.</p><p>Although surgery is effective in the prevention of colon cancer, it comes with a risk of mortality and postoperative complications.<xref rid="b5-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Moreover, surgery does not prevent the development of rectal or ileal pouch polyposis. In one long-term follow-up study, 7/34 (21%) children treated with an IRA required proctectomy for either rectal cancer or advanced rectal polyposis, and 2/7 (29%) FAP patients treated with IPAA had postoperative pouch polyposis within one decade of surgery.<xref rid="b7-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Another study in patients who had undergone IPAA for FAP 10 years previously found that 42% of patients had developed adenoma of the pouch.<xref rid="b8-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The use of chemoprevention for FAP has been reviewed previously.<xref rid="b9-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The goal of this therapy is to prevent, or lead to the regression of, colorectal adenomas and to prevent postoperative recurrence.

Of those randomized, 53 (96.4%) patients received treatment with celecoxib and 48 (94.1%) patients received placebo (safety population); 64 patients were from the US, 35 were from Europe, and 7 were from Hong Kong, Israel, and South Africa.</p><p>Out of the 106 randomized patients, 85 were still active in 2013, when the study was terminated. The other 21 patients were discontinued prior to 2013, as follows: 2 in 2009, 3 in 2010, 5 in 2011, and 11 in 2012. Discontinuations were considered related to study drug treatment (treatment failure or related AE resulting in discontinuation) occurred for nine (16.4%) patients in the celecoxib group (three patients for AEs, six patients for treatment failure) and 11 (21.6%) patients in the placebo group (all due to treatment failure).

No patients in the placebo group experienced SAEs. One patient in the celecoxib treatment group reported SAEs after completion of treatment that were considered by the investigator and sponsor as related to the study drug treatment. These were <italic>Escherichia</italic> sepsis, maternal exposure, and delivery of a premature baby. Despite taking oral contraceptives, this patient became pregnant during the study and gave birth, prematurely, ~9 months after study visit 3 (Year 1).

The study endpoint, progression of polyposis to &#x02265;20 polyps &#x0003e;2 mm in size in 1 year, was determined to be of clinical significance and of prudent safety by a consensus of investigators before the study was incepted. Fewer children with FAP who received 16 mg/kg/day doses of celecoxib reached the primary endpoint than patients who received placebo. Furthermore, celecoxib was associated with a slower rate of disease progression compared with placebo, with the time to disease progression being on average 1 year longer for patients who received celecoxib than those who received placebo. No patients in either group developed colorectal cancer during the study and celecoxib was generally well tolerated. However, the long-term impact of celecoxib on colorectal polyposis in children with FAP is unknown, because the study was terminated early due to the low occurrence of disease progression observed over the course of the study.</p><p>The results of this study, while limited by early termination, are valuable to clinicians and patients. Delaying disease progression in FAP is important as it affords a potential opportunity for children and parents to delay the timing for colectomy. Elective surgery is usually undertaken at an age of 16&#x02013;20 years;<xref rid="b12-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> however, the optimal timing has not been determined.<xref rid="b4-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Decisions about the timing of surgery should take into account psychosocial factors so as to minimize disruption to the child&#x02019;s personal development. In some cases, delaying surgery so that it causes the least disruption to educational or work activities is necessary.<xref rid="b12-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> After IPAA, there is usually a permanent effect on the patient&#x02019;s bowel function, and in some cases sexual function can be altered.<xref rid="b3-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> It is therefore important that patients are educated in advance about the possible quality of life changes post-surgery so that their expectations can be managed.<xref rid="b3-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Although the use of COX-2 selective and nonselective NSAIDs as potential adjunctive therapies for patients with FAP who have undergone prophylactic surgery has been recommended,<xref rid="b13-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> the application of these treatments in a pediatric population has not been rigorously tested. The Children&#x02019;s International Polyposis (CHIP) trial was designed to provide long-term efficacy and safety data on celecoxib for the reduction of the number of polyps in children with FAP. The ages of patients in this trial were representative of the age at which screening is carried out in children with polyposis.<xref rid="b14-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The study of chemoprevention in children with FAP is important for clinical practice, where early intervention may lead to slower progression of polyposis, which may translate to improved outcomes such as a delay in surgery or fewer polypectomies. Earlier studies of chemoprevention in FAP with NSAIDs focused predominantly on adult populations<xref rid="b15-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and found them to be useful adjuncts to endoscopy.</p><p>Previous trials<xref rid="b4-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and cohort studies<xref rid="b19-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> have provided some evidence for the efficacy of celecoxib in FAP, but they were limited by both small sample size and relatively short duration. In a Phase I dose-escalation study in 18 children, three cohorts of patients received celecoxib at sequential doses of 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg/day, or placebo for 3 months. The number of polyps increased in the placebo and 4 mg/kg celecoxib groups by a median (range) of 17.5 (&#x02212;5 to 63) and 5.5 (2&#x02013;17) polyps, respectively. In patients treated with celecoxib at 8 and 16 mg/kg doses, there was a median decrease in the number of polyps by &#x02212;7.0 (&#x02212;2 to &#x02212;16) and &#x02212;17.5 (&#x02212;2 to &#x02212;48), respectively (<italic>p</italic>=0.011), confirming a dose-dependent response with celecoxib in FAP.<xref rid="b4-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The chemopreventive attributes of celecoxib have also been evaluated in a short-term study of adults.<xref rid="b15-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In this trial, a 6-month treatment period was selected, based on previous studies with sulindac, an NSAID that acts on both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes and has also been shown to reduce the number and size of colorectal polyps.<xref rid="b16-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In total, 77 patients with FAP received 400 mg celecoxib twice daily or placebo. In the active treatment group, there was a significant 28% reduction in the mean number of colorectal polyps (<italic>p</italic>=0.003) and a 31% reduction in polyp burden (<italic>p</italic>=0.001), compared with placebo.<xref rid="b15-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Although NSAIDs are very commonly used drugs, long-term use at relatively high doses has been associated with increases in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular risk.<xref rid="b20-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> As a result, there is a need to assess the relative long-term risks and benefits of celecoxib in different clinical settings, including patients with or without vascular disease and in those with adenomas;<xref rid="b21-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> few studies have investigated the long-term effects of NSAIDs in children. The Adenoma Prevention with Celecoxib trial examined the efficacy and safety of celecoxib for preventing sporadic colorectal adenoma in &#x0003e;2,000 adults who were at high risk for colorectal cancer. Celecoxib was an effective agent in the trial but could not be recommended because of potential cardiovascular AEs.<xref rid="b18-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A 5-year follow-up of the trial noted that cardiovascular AEs were particularly associated with a history of atherosclerotic heart disease.<xref rid="b22-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is not clear whether there are specific populations who may benefit from adenoma prevention with a COX-2 selective NSAID.</p><p>Because FAP is incurable and associated with substantial morbidity and tumor-related mortality, a safe and effective agent to manage the disease is desperately needed. Understanding of the utility of chemoprevention in the colorectum of patients with FAP has progressed over the last 40 years, due to several studies that have shown a short-term benefit of NSAIDs on polyp burden.<xref rid="b4-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-ceg-10-177" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Despite this, the search continues for a chemopreventive agent that is both effective and nontoxic. This study, despite being terminated prematurely, determined that at a median of 2 years of treatment there was a 50% reduction in the number of pediatric patients who met the primary outcome of disease progression in the celecoxib arm compared with patients in the placebo arm. Although it was not possible to confirm the statistical significance of celecoxib&#x02019;s efficacy, the safety results indicate that celecoxib was a well-tolerated treatment in this population of children with FAP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><p>All Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees for sites that screened patients are listed below:
