It is one of the major problems in dentistry. On the basis of clinical features, it can be compared with Krimidanta which is one among the eight diseases of tooth. In the management of <italic>Krimidanta</italic>, <italic>Krimighna</italic>, <italic>Vataghna</italic> and <italic>Ushna Veerya dravyas</italic> are to be used which can relieve the toothache and discoloration. In this study, the trial drugs used were <italic>Jatipatradi Gutika</italic> for <italic>Pratisarana</italic> and <italic>Yavanadi Churna</italic> for oral administration. In this study, the patients of <italic>Krimidanta</italic> (dental caries) were selected from OPD of Shalakya Department and allotted randomly in different groups. In Group A, the patients were treated with <italic>Jatipatradi Gutika</italic> for <italic>Pratisarana</italic> for 30 days. In Group B, the patients were treated with <italic>Yavanadi Churna</italic> orally and Group C patients were treated with combined therapy for 30 days.

Generally, the disease <italic>Krimidanta</italic> is neglected by the patients till the pathogenesis become irreversible. It is observed that patients are worried of the time consuming and lengthy treatment like scaling, filling, root canal treatment and consulting the dentist regularly. Improper management in early stage leads the disease to the chronic phase. Dental caries is a problem related to the improper oral care; if at an early stage, the condition is neglected by the patients, the disease finally results in tooth loss. Dental caries affects mostly the population between the ages of 14 and 20 years, during which decay activity is the highest.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Though many theories are put forth to understand the exact mechanisms of caries formation, still the exact mechanism is not known. Dental caries is a microbial disease of the calcified tissues of the teeth, characterized by decalcification of the inorganic portion and destruction of the organic substances of the tooth.</p><p>Toothpaste was used by a majority of the patients (67.57%). This indicates that common toothpaste has no role in curing the disease. Exactly 51.35% of the patients were found to clean their teeth only once in a day, indicating lack of importance of oral hygiene after taking food or meals. It results in bacterial growth at the place of food collection, resulting in a dental plaque. Halitosis was observed in 70.27% of the patients, which indicates the disease <italic>Krimidanta</italic> itself. In modern dentistry, it has also been mentioned that the tooth is the primary host factor. It has been proved that the caries susceptibility of a tooth is inversely proportional to its fluorine, calcium and tin contents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] A bolus of food on the occlusal or incisor surface of a tooth, the area on the tooth surface where the food can stagnate for more time, is called non-self-cleansable area. It is highly susceptible for dental caries.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Probable mode of action of drugs</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Jatipatradi Gutika</title><p>On reviewing the properties of the drug <italic>Jatipatradi Gutika</italic>, it is seen to contain predominantly <italic>Katu</italic> (25%) and <italic>Tikta</italic> (40%) <italic>Rasa</italic>. <italic>Jatipatradi Gutika</italic> is <italic>Krimighna</italic>, <italic>Shodhana</italic>, <italic>Kledopuyahara</italic>, and with its <italic>Veerya</italic> being <italic>Ushna</italic>, it is <italic>Kapha Vata Shamaka</italic>.

The <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> has <italic>Pitta Shamaka</italic> properties. <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> helps in removing the debris, fetor and thus ultimately improves and maintains the oral hygiene.
