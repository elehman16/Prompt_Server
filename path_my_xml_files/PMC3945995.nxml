The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2009&#x02013;2010 found that 26.7% of two to five year olds were either overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Compared to children with healthy weights, children who are overweight or obese at three to five years of age are five times more likely to be overweight or obese in adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and are at greater risk of chronic health problems later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interventions to address the obesity epidemic can reach the majority of young children if they are delivered through child care programs, where over 60% of preschool-age children in the United States (U.S.) spend an average of 30&#x000a0;hours per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Many studies conducted in child care centers show that children are not getting the recommended number of healthy foods and sufficient time for physical activity. Several nutrition and physical activity studies of child care programs showed that the majority did not have written policies on nutrition and physical activity, and those that had written policies did not meet current national recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. A study of meals served to 117 two to five year olds in 20 child care centers found that children did not consume the recommended amounts of whole grains, fruits, or vegetables and exceeded recommended amounts of saturated fats and sugar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Child care providers frequently rely on their own nutrition and physical activity habits rather than their knowledge of national recommendations, such as <italic>Caring for our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Early Care and Education Program</italic>s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] on health and safety policies for child care programs. At the same time, healthy child care center food policies, by themselves, do not necessarily translate into healthy eating practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Studies have shown that, with the addition of professional training, child care providers can effectively implement childhood obesity prevention practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Improving the diets of preschool-age children is a critical component of preventing unhealthy weight gain early in life. According to the 2002 and 2008 U.S. representative sample of 3,273 preschool-age children in the Feeding Infants and Toddlers Studies, young children consumed diets high in saturated fats or added sugars and low in dietary fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In another U.S. nationally representative sample of 2,442 children two to eight years of age, children with diets high in energy density, such as foods with added sugars and fats compared to fruits and vegetables, were more likely to be overweight or obese rather than normal weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, many preschool-age children&#x02019;s beverage intake does not meet current dietary recommendations. In a U.S. representative sample of two to five year old children, a 24-hour dietary recall revealed that high sugar beverages were consumed by nearly half of the children - 46% drank 12 ounces of whole milk, 44% drank 5 ounces of fruit-flavored drinks, and 39% drank 3 ounces of soda on average in a given day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Addressing physical activity in child care programs is also important in preventing early childhood obesity. Research studies have shown that preschool-age children in child care centers do not regularly engage in the recommended 60&#x000a0;minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], while other studies found they spend the majority of their time in sedentary behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. One study found that children spend more time in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity when child care programs have moveable playground equipment (e.g., balls, tricycles), lower use of electronic media, and larger playgrounds compared to programs without these characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Intervention studies in child care centers in the U.S. have had mixed results in decreasing the prevalence of children who are overweight or obese. Only two out of seven intervention studies achieved this goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The 14-week Hip-Hop to Health Jr. Obesity Prevention Effectiveness Trial for African American preschool-age children in child care centers reported significant decreases in body mass index (BMI) in children in the intervention versus control groups when the program was delivered by trained early childhood educators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. &#x0201c;Eat Healthy, Stay Active&#x0201d;, a six-month, quasi-experimental pilot intervention consisting of educational programs and activities for parents, staff and preschool-age children in six Head Start programs, showed a statistically significant decrease in child BMI and percent of obese children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The Head Start Program is a U.S. federally-funded program that promotes the school readiness of children ages birth to five from low-income families by enhancing their cognitive, social and emotional development. Other intervention studies showed no change in children&#x02019;s BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>In a study of the impact of the Child and Adult Care Food Program, there was no statistically significant difference in weight-for-height percentile of preschool children in one urban center participating in the program compared to children who brought their meals and snacks from home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Also, in a culturally-tailored obesity intervention with classroom-based movement activities, staff development and peer-led parent education posters on nutrition and physical activity for Head Start programs serving primarily Mexican-American children, there was no significant difference in BMI between the children in the intervention or control centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The children in the two Head Start centers participating in a six-month intervention of staff and parent trainings and activities showed no significant decrease in standardized BMIs (zBMIs) compared to same-age children in one comparison Head Start center [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In Healthy &#x00026; Ready to Learn, a randomized control trial in four Head Start programs with a 24&#x000a0;week multi-level intervention program comprised of parent and teacher education and child activities, there were no significant changes in BMI in the intervention versus control programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The Nutrition And Physical Activity Self-Assessment for Child Care (NAP SACC) is an intervention designed to enhance nutrition and physical activity environments in child care settings by improving the nutritional quality of food and beverages, the amount and quality of physical activity, staff-child interactions, and center nutrition and physical activity policies and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The program has been used by a number of states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and incorporated into the U.S. public health campaign Let&#x02019;s Move [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The program was initially pilot-tested by trained nurse child care health consultants (CCHCs) in North Carolina in a randomized, controlled study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. At the time of our study, NAP SACC had been associated with positive environmental nutrition and physical activity outcomes in a variety of child care programs, but there were no published studies that reported changes in children&#x02019;s BMI.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the NAP SACC intervention conducted by trained nurse child care health consultants in licensed child care centers in three states. CCHCs are child health professionals with specialized training in child care health and safety issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. They conduct health and safety assessments, provide educational workshops in child care, consult with the directors on health and safety issues, and provide resources to help the center improve the quality of their health and safety policies and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This paper will address the following objectives:</p><p>1. To determine if the NAP SACC workshops as delivered by nurse CCHCs improve child care providers&#x02019; or parents&#x02019; nutrition and physical activity knowledge.</p><p>2. To determine if child care center participation in the NAP SACC intervention delivered by nurse CCHCs improves the number and quality of written nutrition and physical activity policies, nutrition and physical activity practices, and children&#x02019;s BMI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A seven-month (2009&#x02013;2010) randomized control trial (RCT) was conducted in three states, California (CA), Connecticut (CT), and North Carolina (NC). Forty-two child care centers were recruited, of which 24 centers did not meet the inclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria included English-speaking director, on-site kitchen, racial/ethnic diversity among the children, participation by at least 60% of families, and a population of children in care primarily comprised of low-income children between the ages of three and five years of age. None of the centers enrolled in the study had participated in the NAP SACC program previously. One control center which withdrew when it was unable to complete the required number of study questionnaires was replaced with a matched center prior to intervention. Exclusion criteria for enrolling children included chronic illnesses or conditions that affected nutritional status, severe food allergies, gastrointestinal disorders or mobility impairment.Previously trained nurse CCHCs in each of the three states were hired for the purposes of this study. All received additional training in the NAP SACC intervention from one of the co-investigators. CCHCs from CA and NC recruited the convenience sample centers for their respective states while CT centers were recruited by the CT principal investigator, who is also a CHCC. The centers were matched on size and the proportion of children eligible for income subsidies and then randomly assigned to the NAP SACC intervention or control group. Six centers were enrolled in each state. In CT, two small control centers under the same ownership were merged for the analysis. A total of 17 centers had complete data, including nine intervention and eight control centers (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-14-215-1"/></fig><p>Each of the centers received $500 for its participation in the study. The intervention center directors were asked to purchase equipment or supplies to support physical activity. The control centers received the delayed NAP SACC intervention in year two of the study.</p><sec><title>NAP SACC intervention</title><p>The CCHCs facilitated five, one-hour NAP SACC workshops for child care providers and other staff (e.g., cooks, administrators) at each of the intervention centers on (1) childhood obesity, (2) healthy eating for young children, (3) physical activity for young children, (4) personal health and wellness, and (5) working with families to promote healthy behaviors. Seven of the intervention centers also received the parent workshop, &#x0201c;Raising Healthy Kids.&#x0201d; The workshops were held in the child care centers. In addition, the CCHCs worked with the center directors to write or update the center&#x02019;s nutrition and physical activity policies. They also provided at least monthly on-site consultations and additional phone or email consultations and distributed posters and information sheets on nutrition and physical activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The posters were displayed in the child care centers, and the information sheets were given to the child care providers and parents. All of the materials presented and written for the project supported NAP SACC&#x02019;s best practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Examples of some common issues addressed during the consultation visits were the type of milk served, healthy snacks, and ideas for structured physical activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement</title><p>Data collection occurred at baseline and seven months post-intervention at all centers. In each state a research assistant blinded to group assignment completed the center&#x02019;s written policy assessments, center-level observational measures, and child-level height and weight measurements. One additional research assistant was trained by a co-investigator to complete the NAP SACC measures of nutritional intake and physical activity based on observations of individual children in all three states. This research assistant was blinded to group assignment and observed and recorded the foods offered at meals and snacks and the physical activity of a randomly selected group of children in each of the 17 enrolled centers. A 90% inter-rater reliability with the co-investigator was achieved before baseline data collection was initiated.</p><sec><title>Demographics</title><p>Center directors, child care providers and parents completed demographic questionnaires, including information on ethnicity, education, and employment. The family&#x02019;s total yearly gross income was divided by the number of persons in the household to determine whether the family fell within the 2010 U.S. Federal Poverty Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>CCHC activity</title><p>In addition to the aforementioned measures, the CCHCs completed a daily encounter form to report on their consultation activities, content covered, mode of communication, and travel time.</p></sec><sec><title>Provider and parent knowledge</title><p>Child care director, provider, other staff, and parent knowledge were measured before and immediately after each workshop using four multiple choice questions per workshop. Examples of two knowledge questions were, &#x0201c;How many minutes of active play each day do health professionals recommend for 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;year olds? (a) 30&#x000a0;minutes (b) 45&#x000a0;minutes (c) 60&#x000a0;minutes (d) 90&#x000a0;minutes (e) 120&#x000a0;minutes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Which of the following food groups should be eaten regularly? (a) whole grains (b) low fat dairy products (c) lean meat and beans (d) all of the above.&#x0201d; The questionnaires were developed by the study staff for this study, and content validity was assessed by the investigators. No psychometric tests were conducted. Separate mean scores were calculated for the pre- and post-workshop questionnaires for each intervention center and then analyzed by change over time.</p></sec><sec><title>Nutrition and physical activity policies</title><p>The policies on nutrition (11 items), sanitation for food preparation and food service (9 items), and physical activity (4 items) were evaluated by trained, blinded research assistants using the standardized California Childcare Health Program (CCHP) Health and Safety Policies Checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] to determine if the center&#x02019;s written policies adhered to <italic>Caring for Our Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards; Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Program</italic>s, Second Edition (NHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Examples of some of the content required in a high quality policy on nutrition include: (1) healthy beverages are available all day, (2) menus are varied, (3) foods from different cultural groups are offered, (4) three week cycles of menus are planned for, and (5) child care providers eat with the children, provide family style meals, and encourage conversation during meals. To summarize the data collection procedures, each center&#x02019;s written policy was first rated as present or not. If the written policy was present, individual components of the policy were each rated as yes (present) or no (not present) based on specific NHS content. Each policy was then summarized as a mean calculated as the number of components present divided by the number of components rated. The mean policy scores were calculated for each center and then aggregated by treatment or control group. This policy measurement technique was used in another study and shown to be a valid measure of the effect of CCHC interventions on child care center environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Nutrition and physical activity practices</title><p>Center-level nutrition and physical activity practices were assessed for the child care providers and children by different observational measures. A modified version of the Environmental Physical Activity Observation (EPAO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] was completed by each state&#x02019;s research assistant to observe child care provider behaviors supporting healthy eating and physical activity in children. The measure included all of the eight items on the EPAO &#x02018;eating occasions-staff behavior&#x02019; subscale and six out of seven items on the EPAO &#x02018;physical activity-staff behavior&#x02019; subscale. The items were rated as either yes or no. The nutrition items included center-level observations of staff sitting with children during meals and snacks, talking with children about healthy foods, and eating the same food as the children. An example of a nutrition item is, &#x0201c;Did staff sit with children during lunch?&#x0201d; The six physical activity items included center-level observations of staff joining in active play, making positive comments about physical activity, providing prompts to increase physical activity, and offering formal physical activity lessons. An example of a physical activity item is &#x0201c;Did staff make positive statements about physical activity?&#x0201d; The observations were conducted over two to three hours during one day at each center. Although these items were modified from a reliable instrument, they were not previously validated in the format included in this study. Mean scores for the nutrition and physical activity scales were calculated for each center and then aggregated by treatment and control centers.</p><p>The Observation System for Recording Activity in Preschools (OSRAP) was completed by a trained and blinded research assistant to measure center-level physical activity over the course of a typical day. Eight children at each center, randomly selected by a statistician at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), were observed in 15-second intervals for a total of 12 to 16&#x000a0;minutes per child; the observations were conducted over an eight hour day. Data were aggregated as the mean percent of physical activity intensity (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;stationary to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;fast); types of activity (quiet, TV/screen, manipulative, gross motor); location of activity (classroom, gym, outdoor playground, outside general, eating, transition); context of activity (teacher directed, child initiated); interactions (none, child peer, provider, other adult); and prompts (none, increase activity, decrease activity). The OSRAP has been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and has been compared favorably with accelerometer data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The Diet Observation in Child Care (DOCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which is a validated method for recording child-level nutrition in two to five year olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], was completed by one research assistant on the first three of the eight randomly selected children at each center to represent center-level nutrition. The trained and blinded observer recorded the types and portions of all foods and beverages served to target children during the observation day. The foods offered were categorized as grains, vegetables, fruit and 100% fruit juice, proteins, milk, snack foods, sweets, sweetened drinks, water, and condiments/seasonings. The percent of healthy foods offered within each category was calculated as the number of healthy foods served divided by the total number of foods offered in that category. An aggregate percent of healthy foods was calculated as the proportion of all whole grains, low fat meats and beans, dark green or orange vegetables, fruits and 100% fruit juice, and low- or non-fat milk served divided by all foods and beverages offered. The observations of food offered during lunch, not breakfast and snack, were included in the analysis because of greater consistency across the centers and minimal missing data since not all centers offered breakfast or snacks.</p></sec><sec><title>Body mass index (BMI)</title><p>The research assistants selected children at the pre-intervention period for height and weight measurements from center-specific randomly ordered lists of enrolled children. The total at the pre-intervention period, 268 of the 552 (49%) children enrolled in the study, was limited by availability of resources. Of the 268 children measured, 37% were from CA, 28% from CT and 35% from NC. However, to maximize the number of children with both pre- and post-intervention measurements, children who were measured pre-intervention were prioritized for post-intervention measurement, and as many as possible of the remaining available enrolled children who had not been measured at the pre-intervention period were measured post-intervention, bringing the total to 336, 34% from CA, 37% from CT, and 29% from NC. There were 211 children (63% of 336) with measurements at both the pre- and post-intervention periods, 38% from CA, 28% from CT, and 34% from NC. Two of these children were extreme outliers (greater than 3 standard deviations from the mean). Consistent with recommendations from the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], these two were excluded from analyses, resulting in a total of 209 children.</p><p>The research assistants used a Seca&#x02122; 213 Portable Foldable Stadiometer to measure height. The Tanita HD 351 digital scale was calibrated daily and used to collect the children&#x02019;s weights without their outer layers of clothing or shoes. BMI was calculated by dividing a child&#x02019;s weight in kilograms by height in meters squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s (CDC) program for SAS was used to calculate zBMI, an age- and sex-specific standardized measure of BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

State child care licensing regulations and child care programs&#x02019; written policies are needed to ensure that children attending child care are given opportunities to engage in recommended structured and unstructured physical activities along with time outdoors to engage in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. The IOM recommends that state child care regulations establish requirements for child care programs&#x02019; physical activity standards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

We did, however, observe a trend toward serving healthier lunches in the intervention versus control centers. In an earlier NAP SACC intervention conducted by 30 CCHCs in NC, there were significant and positive changes in healthy food as measured by the EPAO in the intervention centers compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other intervention studies, which did not include CCHCs, found mixed results. In a randomized control trial of high risk preschool-age children, a six-month family intervention of weekly parent and child groups for families with preschool-age children showed that children in the intervention group had lower zBMIs and consumed fewer calories from carbohydrates compared to the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. A quasi-experimental study of a center-based physical activity intervention for primarily Mexican-American children attending Head Start programs showed that children in the intervention groups consumed more fruits, vegetables, and low-fat milk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. On the other hand, a randomized control trial of a teacher-based weight control intervention for African American preschool children in child care centers found only one significant, positive change in dietary intake (percent of calories from saturated fat) for the intervention versus control centers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The food served in our study&#x02019;s child care centers was similar to that reported in observational studies from North Carolina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Oklahoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and New York City [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These studies reported daily offerings of healthy foods such as fruits, non-fried vegetables, whole grains, and reduced-fat milk. In a survey of 1,583 Head Start centers nationally, 70% reported serving only nonfat or 1% fat milk, and 91% reported serving fruit and healthy vegetables every day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Although other studies show similar foods being served in child care programs, there are inconsistent findings in intervention studies&#x02019; measurement of nutritional data and results.</p><p>The finding of high levels of sedentary behavior among our study children was consistent with other observational studies of preschool-age children&#x02019;s physical activity in child care.

Most of the studies of preschool-age children in child care centers show that the children were not engaged in the recommended 60&#x000a0;minutes of activity each day when in child care, including structured, unstructured, and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Future evaluations of interventions in child care programs targeted at improving physical activity and increasing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity should use objective methods of physical activity measurement and evaluate both the processes and outcomes of the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>BMI</title><p>The magnitude of the decrease in mean children&#x02019;s zBMI in the intervention centers compared to the control centers (0.14 in the child-level analysis, 0.26 in the center-level analysis) is consistent with observed child-level BMI or zBMI change in other nutrition and physical activity intervention studies with children of the same age. A systematic review of seven studies of obesity prevention programs lasting 12 or more weeks for children from infancy to five years of age that included appropriate BMI or zBMI data reported an overall child-level zBMI decrease of -0.26 (CI&#x02009;=&#x02009;-0.53 to 0.00) compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. One recent center-level quasi-experimental study with preschool-age children in child care showed a child-level zBMI decrease of 0.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These center- or group-level interventions had similar or higher levels of zBMI change as our center-level intervention. In this study, we included the 209 children with usable, matched data at the pre- and post-intervention periods in the aggregated center-level data. This approach provided equal weights for each center in the model and was appropriate for our center-level design. Our nutrition and physical activity data were also collected at the aggregate level and summarized only at the center level. This different approach to the study design, data collection and analyses yielded similar effect sizes of center-level zBMI change as other studies reporting on child-level zBMI change.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this study found many positive effects of the NAP SACC intervention, there were some limitations. First, there were no repeated physical activity, nutrition, or height and weight observations conducted over multiple days at each pre- or post-intervention time point; thus the observations had limited test-retest reliability within each center. Second, there was a limited impact on parent nutrition and physical activity at home, since there was low parent attendance at the one parent workshop provided. Third, some centers had more child-level data and some states had more centers contributing to the final analyses. Fourth, some known confounders of children&#x02019;s BMI, such as parent BMI and child-level accelerometer and sleep data were not collected. Fifth, although the pre-intervention heights and weights included children randomly selected in each site and data were missing at random, the unbalanced design may have underestimated our results. There were more children with post-intervention heights and weights, but only children with matched data were included in the center-level analyses of zBMI. Lastly, there was a historical cohort effect on both the intervention and control centers given obesity prevention campaigns at the national level (i.e., Let&#x02019;s Move Child Care) and legislation (i.e., Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act) in the U.S. that promoted healthy nutrition and physical activity in child care during the study period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings support the use of child health professionals such as CCHCs as effective change agents in child care centers through the use of the NAP SACC program. To increase child care centers&#x02019; access to CCHCs, federal, state and local funding and training are needed to strengthen the CCHC network. Federal government recommendations for child care programs support nutrition and physical activity programs that include the NHS recommendations and IOM policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] included in this project. These programs should be implemented and supported locally and statewide through regulations and quality rating and improvement systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Parent education is also important to ensure that there are consistent nutrition and physical activity practices at home and in the child care programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Several studies found that educational workshops are an effective approach to increase parent knowledge, but more research is needed to determine how to increase parent involvement.</p><p>Future studies should include a larger sample of centers and repeated measures of nutrition and physical activity practices, including objective accelerometer measures of physical activity and valid, standardized measure of both quantity and quality of the food consumed in child care programs over several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Future research also needs to focus on strategies to increase parent involvement in childhood obesity prevention. Interventions should be targeted to help child care providers and parents become role models for preschool-age children and help the children develop healthy nutrition behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. To address the public health crisis of childhood obesity, we need to recruit, train and deploy more child health and nutrition professionals to provide nutrition and physical activity interventions in child care programs.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BMI: Body mass index, weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>); CA: California; CCHC: Child care health consultant; CCHP: California childcare health program; CDC: Centers for disease control and prevention; CT: Connecticut; DOCC: Diet observation in child care; EPAO: Environmental physical activity observation; IOM: Institute of medicine; NAP SACC: Nutrition and physical activity self-assessment for child care; NHS: National health and safety standards; NC: North Carolina; OSRAP: Observation system for recording activity in preschools; RCT: Randomized control trial; UNC: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; zBMI: Age- and sex- specific standardized measure of BMI.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest or competing financial or non-financial interests to report.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AA contributed to all aspects of the project, led the CA arm of the project and wrote the manuscript.
