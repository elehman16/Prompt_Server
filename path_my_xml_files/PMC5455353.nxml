For the trial ACOSOG Z1031B, the protocol was amended to include a tumor Ki67 determination after 2 to 4 weeks of AI.

We therefore postulated that an early switch from AI to neoadjuvant chemotherapy could produce better clinical outcomes for tumors that responded poorly to AI. Conversely, adjuvant AI alone may be sufficient to prevent relapse in tumors highly responsive to neoadjuvant AI.</p><p>Pathologic complete response (pCR) after systemic chemotherapy remains a controversial clinical trial end point,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> and alternatives are needed, particularly in ER-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#x02013;negative disease (HER2-negative), where pCR rates are low. Data from a neoadjuvant study comparing letrozole and tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer&#x02014;P024 (Preoperative Treatment of Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Patients with Letrozole: A Randomized Double-Blind Multicenter Study)<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>&#x02014;was previously used to generate the Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI).<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> PEPI requires pathologic stage (tumor size and nodal status), in addition to levels of the protein encoded by the <italic>MKI67</italic> gene (Ki67), and Allred ER score measured on the surgical specimen (with surgery conducted during uninterrupted endocrine therapy). Patients with a PEPI score of 0 (pT1 or pT2, pN0, Ki67 &#x02264; 2.7%, Allred score &#x0003e; 2) from the P024 trial were found to have a low risk of relapse. Similar findings were observed in the neoadjuvant IMPACT trial (Immediate Preoperative Anastrozole, Tamoxifen, or Combined with Tamoxifen)<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, but no subsequent validation efforts have been reported.</p><p>The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z1031A randomized phase II clinical trial was designed to determine which AI (anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane) should be recommended for future testing against chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting (ACOSOG is now a part of the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology). The major initial finding from ACOSOG Z1031A was that half of the patients who were considered candidates for mastectomy or inoperable before neoadjuvant AI therapy had successful breast-conserving surgery.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> When the enrollment in ACOSOG Z1031A was complete, an amendment was introduced (ACOSOG Z1031B) that triaged patients with tumors exhibiting a Ki67 &#x0003e; 10% in a tumor biopsy 2 to 4 weeks after starting AI to standard chemotherapy. The hypothesis being tested was that the pCR rate would be at least 20% in this AI-resistant population. Herein, we report the pCR results from ACOSOG Z1031B as well as the time to recurrence by PEPI status among all ACOSOG Z1031 patients who completed neoadjuvant AI treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Establishment of an Early Ki67 Cut Point for Triage to Chemotherapy</title><p>An on-treatment Ki67 threshold for switching from neoadjuvant AI therapy to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was established using data from the Preoperative Letrozole study (POL)<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and the IMPACT trial.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> A Ki67 value of &#x0003e; 10% at 1 month in the POL study was associated with a higher PEPI score (<italic>P</italic> = .01), a smaller number of patients in the PEPI-0 group (<italic>P</italic> = .08), and worse relapse-free survival (<italic>P</italic> = .0016). Similarly, the IMPACT data confirmed that a 2-week Ki67 &#x0003e; 10% predicted a higher PEPI score (<italic>P</italic> = .001), smaller numbers of patients in the PEPI-0 group (<italic>P</italic> = .004), and worse relapse-free survival (<italic>P</italic> = .008; Data Supplement; Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="TA.1">Table A1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Figure A1A</xref>, online only). Combining these studies revealed only one PEPI-0 case among 51 patients with a 2- to 4-week Ki67 value of &#x0003e; 10%. Thus, according to the PEPI model, patients with a Ki67 value of 10% at 2 to 4 weeks had a &#x0003c; 2% chance of a favorable PEPI score that would allow them to safely avoid chemotherapy under current guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Patient Eligibility</title><p>Eligible patients were postmenopausal with invasive breast cancer (clinical stage T2 to T4c, N0 to N3, M0). Additional criteria have been previously described.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> This study was supported by the Clinical Trials Support Unit and approved by the institutional review boards of all participating institutions. Each participant signed an institutional review board&#x02013;approved, protocol-specific informed consent in accordance with federal and institutional guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Treatment Schema</title><p>Patients enrolled in ACOSOG Z1031B underwent a core breast biopsy for Ki67 determination after 2 weeks of AI therapy. If the Ki67 was &#x02264; 10%, the patient continued AI therapy for another 12 to 14 weeks and then proceeded to surgery. Women whose 2-week Ki67 level was &#x0003e; 10% were offered either a National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#x02013;approved neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen or surgery at the discretion of their providers and/or the patients. If the biopsy core contained insufficient tumor to perform the Ki67 assay, patients could elect to undergo a repeat biopsy at 4 weeks or continue on AI therapy. If severe treatment-related toxicity was reported or the patient refused further AI therapy, surgery was recommended. Within 14 days of registration, patients underwent a complete physical examination with tumor assessment. Every 4 weeks, patients underwent a physical examination, toxicity assessment, and tumor assessment using February 2000 WHO criteria. If tumor progression was suspected, ultrasound or mammogram was required, and neoadjuvant AI was discontinued if progression was confirmed. Blood and biopsy specimens for correlative studies were collected at baseline, 2 to 4 weeks after the start of neoadjuvant AI treatment, on discontinuation of neoadjuvant treatment, and at surgery. For patients with PEPI = 0 disease, management without chemotherapy was recommended but not mandatory to determine the acceptability of this recommendation.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>AI Treatment</title><p>Before the release of the ACOSOG Z1031A results,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> eligible patients were randomly assigned to 16 to 18 weeks of neoadjuvant AI with exemestane 25 mg once daily, letrozole 2.5 mg once daily, or anastrozole 1 mg once daily. After the release of the data, patients could choose either letrozole or anastrozole treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Statistical Considerations</title><p>The primary end point for ACOSOG Z1031B was the pCR rate among the women who after 2 weeks of neoadjuvant AI therapy had a tumor Ki67 level of &#x0003e; 10% and switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. pCR was defined as histologic evidence of no invasive tumor cells in the surgical breast specimen or ipsilateral lymph nodes. A one-stage phase II clinical trial design was chosen to assess the pCR rate. With a sample size of 35 and a one-sided &#x003b1; = 0.10, a one-sample binomial test of proportions would have a 90% chance of declaring success with a pCR rate of at least 20% compared with the null hypothesis that the pCR was 5% (at least four pCRs were needed to conclude pCR rate &#x02265; 20%). A 90% binomial confidence interval for the true pCR was also constructed. On the basis of the IMPACT study, it was estimated that 235 eligible women would need to enroll to obtain 35 women with a 2-week Ki67 &#x0003e; 10% willing to switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The long-term PEPI outcome study cohort excluded women from both ACOSOG Z1031A and Z1031B who withdrew consent not having started neoadjuvant AI, had metastases or bilateral invasive breast cancer at registration, failed to undergo surgery, had alternative therapy before surgery, had radiographic confirmed disease progression or new primary disease during neoadjuvant AI, failed to have sentinel lymph node or axillary lymph node dissection, or lacked sufficient tissue to obtain a Ki67 or Allred score. In addition, ACOSOG Z1031B patients with 2- or 4-week Ki67 &#x0003e; 10% who remained on AI were excluded. Time to breast cancer recurrence (TBCR) was defined as the time from surgery to first local, regional, or distant disease recurrence. Patients without documented disease recurrence were censored at the date of their last disease evaluation. TBCR was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Stratified Cox modeling (with cohort and adjuvant chemotherapy use as strata) was used to assess whether TBCR differed with respect to PEPI 0 status.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The Alliance Statistics and Data Center conducted data collection and statistical analyses.

If the score was between 2.7% and 10%, point counting was conducted using an ocular grid, at least three high-power fields with a minimum of 100 cells scored. Retrospective analysis of ACOSOG Z1031A used the iScan Coreo scanner (Ventana) with the Companion Algorithm Ki-67 (30-9) software. The imaging approach required three to 10 areas of interest be selected at 4&#x000d7; magnification excluding ductal carcinoma in situ, vessels, and lymphocytes and avoiding perinecrotic or necrotic areas. The image analysis result was reviewed to ensure the software was correctly differentiating between benign and malignant cells, and, if not, the case was triaged to visual point counting. The visual point counting approach required color photomicrographs with a background grid taken at 40&#x000d7; of at least three fields selected based on invasive tumor content and the quality of the histology, not on Ki67 staining pattern, to obtain tumor cell count of at least 200.

PEPI integrates residual disease burden and the cell cycle (Ki67) response providing a simple approach to deescalating adjuvant treatment after neoadjuvant AI for patients in the PEPI = 0 category. These patients, who had a risk of relapse of 3% with a median follow-up of approximately 5 years, are therefore unlikely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. A weakness of the study is that the relapse risk estimate is based on only 119 cases; thus, PEPI validation efforts should continue.</p><p>Concerns regarding the variability in Ki67 analysis have been discussed extensively.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The imaging analysis approach to Ki67 estimation used for the ACOSOG Z1031A cohort is promising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3C</xref>), but conclusive data using this methodology await the results of the ALTERNATE trial.</p><p>The low pCR rate for ACOSOG Z1031B patients who switched to neoadjuvant chemotherapy contradicts the hypothesis that AI-resistant proliferation in ER-rich tumors is associated with enhanced chemotherapy response. The muted chemotherapy response was unlikely because of the Ki67 assay failure to capture highly proliferative tumors, because an independent examination of tumor cell cycle activity with a multigene proliferation score indicated significantly higher expression of cell cycle&#x02013;dependent genes when the Ki67 was &#x0003e; 10% at 2 to 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figs 4C and 4D</xref>). Low chemotherapy responsiveness could reflect the postmenopausal status of the patient cohort,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> the high ER content of tumors eligible for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or the use of endocrine therapy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, the latter hypothesis seems unlikely because, unlike prior studies that raised this concern,<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> endocrine therapy was not administered concurrently with chemotherapy.</p><p>Our data provide further support for an assessment of prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer on the basis of post&#x02013;neoadjuvant endocrine therapy tumor characteristics. Triaging patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the basis of failure to suppress Ki67 is feasible but highlights the relative chemotherapy-resistant nature of strongly ER-positive yet AI-resistant disease in postmenopausal women and the early relapse risk faced by patients in this category in all three studies where this question can be examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig 3D</xref>; Data Supplement). The development of new treatment options for intrinsically AI-resistant disease will likely depend on new insights into the molecular basis for primary endocrine therapy resistance.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health Grants No. U10CA180821 and U10CA180882 (to the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology), U10CA180857, U10CA180858, U10CA180870, U10CA180833, and legacy grants CA31946, CA33601, CA105409, U10CA031983, U10CA037347, U10CA047577, U10CA077440 with grants R01-CA095614 to M.J.E., U24-CA114736, U24CA196171, U10-CA076001, and U01-CA114722 from the National Cancer Institute; the Breast Cancer Research Foundation; a Komen St Louis Affiliate Clinical Trials Grant; and support for Z1031 from Pfizer and Novartis and image analysis support for the iScan Coreo scanner from Roche Diagnostics.
