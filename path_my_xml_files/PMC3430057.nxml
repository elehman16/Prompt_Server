Subsequently, ACTH stimulation test was performed using 0.25 mg of synthetic corticotropin (Synacthen, Novartis, Germany) administered intravenously and serum samples were obtained for cortisol before corticotropin administration and 30 and 60 minutes following it.

The outcomes were assessed during the first 28 days or until hospital discharge. Telephone follow-up was conducted after hospital discharge. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality from all causes. The secondary endpoints were adverse occurrences including possible complications of drug therapy and morbid events such as the progression of initial infection and the development of secondary infection. All medications given to the patients, any complications, reversal of organ system failure the duration of hospitalization, the mortality rate, and causes of death were recorded and compared between the groups.

Logistic regression was used to calculate the odds ratios of risk factors and a log-rank test was used to evaluate factors associated with survival. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability to discriminate between patients who survived and those who died. An optimal cut off was obtained considering the combination of highest sensitivity and specificity. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and differences were considered significant when p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>Results</title><p>Fifty five patients (36 males and 19 females) with the presumptive diagnosis of sepsis were enrolled in this study.

The median age of the patients was 70 years (range 20-91), and 31 patients (56.4%) died in the hospital from refractory shock and/or multiple organ failure within 28 days. Placebo patients were younger than steroid patients, and more males than females were tested in the steroid group. In all patients, the mean APACHE II and initial SOFA scores were 20.7 and 8.9, respectively. Community-acquired infection was present at 70.9% (39/55) of patients and nosocomial infection was present at 29.1% (16/55) of the patients. Twenty-two patients (40%) had documented bacteremia. The major sources of infection were urinary (46.4%) or pulmonary (42.8%).

Although the majority of cortisol levels were between 5.6 and 114.6 &#x003bc;g/dl, there was a wide range of cortisol levels in our patient population.

Consistent with some of the previous studies, we showed GH resistance and decreased DHEAS levels associated with increased severity of sepsis. Peripheral resistance to GH action (probably due to decreased GH-receptor expression), manifested by high basal GH concentrations with low IGF-I, has been reported in patients with critical illnesses including traumatic brain injury.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> This response seems to be an adaptive response because GH is an anabolic hormone and in the acute phase of critical illness catabolism is the initial response to serve fuel for vital organs. DHEA and DHEAS are the most abundant steroids secreted by the adrenal cortex. It is known that during any stressful condition when higher cortisol synthesis is required, DHEAS synthesis shifts to cortisol synthesis. Serum DHEAS concentration is low in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, but limited data are present on DHEAS levels in critically ill patients. Extremely low DHEAS concentrations have been demonstrated in septic shock and in multiple trauma patients, frequently showing adrenal insufficiency, suggesting DHEAS as a prognostic marker and a sign of exhausted adrenal reserve in critical illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref> However we could not demonstrate any significant association between GH or DHEAS levels and mortality in either univariate or multivariate analysis. One of the important findings in the present study was the association of high ACTH levels with mortality in multivariate analysis. Based on these data, it is tempting to speculate that the central activation of HPA axis increases proportionally with the severity of sepsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></p><p>Considering sepsis as a continuous stress situation, some authors proposed a basal plasma cortisol concentration &#x0003e; 20-25 &#x003bc;g/dl as appropriate for critically ill patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> whereas others have proposed a cutoff value of 15 &#x003bc;g/dl.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> In the present study, basal cortisol levels &#x0003e; 20 &#x003bc;g/dl were significantly associated with hospital mortality (65.9% mortality in patients with basal cortisol &#x0003e; 20 &#x003bc;g/dl vs. 28.6% mortality in patients with basal cortisol less than 20 &#x003bc;g/dl; p = 0.027).

Some authors believe that the conflicting reports reflect a bimodal distribution of mortality related with random cortisol levels during sepsis, with the highest mortality rates observed in patients with extremely low cortisol levels (&#x0003c; 25 &#x003bc;g/dl) or very high levels (&#x0003e; 45 &#x003bc;g/dl).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> In our opinion, a high basal cortisol is enough evidence to show that adrenal is adequately responding to stress and excludes the need for exogenous stimulation. Moreover, high serum cortisol concentration on first day is an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with sepsis.</p><p>The reported prevalence of adrenal insufficiency varies widely (from 10% to 71%) in critically ill patients, depending on the population of patients studied and the diagnostic criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> Based on our present and previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> AI is probably not uncommon amongst patients with sepsis (10.9%, 16.3%, and 2.5%, respectively). The prevalence of AI in our studies were relatively low compared to other studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref> The explanation for this seemingly contradictory finding may lie in the fact that most of the sepsis patients in this study had raised cortisol levels. Overall mortality rate in septic patients with AI in this study was low (1 of 6, 16.7%), but the small number of patients suggests this to be a topic for further study.</p><p>It is usually considered that a single plasma cortisol determination, with the exception of the very low (&#x0003c; 15 &#x003bc;g/dl) and high values (&#x0003e; 34 &#x003bc;g/dl), has no predictive value on patient outcome in septic shock and is not predictive of the adrenal ability to respond in stress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> For this reason, evaluation of the activation of the HPA axis in critically ill patients is largely based on stimulation tests. In recent years, several authors have proposed a syndrome of RAI in sepsis in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> This pattern is encountered in approximately one-third of patients with sepsis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> We report here that the overall incidence of RAI in patients with sepsis was 36.4% (55 patients) which was similar among survivors and non-survivors (37.5% and 35.5%, respectively; p = 0.999). RAI may be more relevant to the prognostic value of a low response to corticotropin. However, it has been challenged by reports suggesting that the corticotropin test is not reproducible in critically ill patients. In addition, most studies performed on patients with sepsis displayed no prognostic value of the test.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></p><p>Recent clinical trials on stress doses of hydrocortisone in patients with septic shock showed beneficial effects on hemodynamics<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> and mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref> In the study by Bollaert et al., these effects were not related to RAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> On the other hand, the prognostic importance of a high serum cortisol level may be different in patients receiving corticosteroid replacement therapy due to the influence of the corticosteroid drug. In contrast to other studies, our study was performed on patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock using moderate-dose prednisolone with or without vasopressor support. The administration of prednisolone did not affect the levels of cortisol in this study since it was given to the patients after ACTH stimulation test.</p><p>The main finding of the present study was that the administration of moderate-dose of prednisolone for 10 days had no significant effect on the rate of death in patients with sepsis at 28 days. These results are in marked contrast to those of the study by Annane et al. in which a 7-day treatment with low doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone significantly reduced the risk of death in patients with septic shock and RAI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> However, in our present and previous studies, prednisolone proved of no statistically significant benefit in patients who did not respond to corticotropin. At 28 days, there were 11 deaths in the 20 nonresponder patients given prednisolone compared with 20 deaths in the 35 responder patients given placebo (55% and 57.1%, respectively; p = 0.999). Sixteen of the 27 patients given prednisolone died as did 15 of the 28 patients who received placebo (59.3% and 53.6%, respectively; p = 0.787).</p><p>There were several limitations in the present study. First, in the steroid replacement group, mean age, APACHE II scores, and percentage of septic shock was significantly higher than the placebo group. This factor might be one possible cause of the ineffectiveness of steroid replacement therapy. Another limitation was lack of adequate number of patients in the subgroups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Moderate-dose steroid treatment did not affect mortality. Higher basal cortisol and peak cortisol levels were found more estimable mortality indicators compared to RAI. In addition, the study revealed that ACTH was one of the best indicators of mortality. We are of the opinion that the borders regarding which patients require steroid treatment should be more clearly drawn, that more optimal methods should be tested for diagnosis of RAI, and that hormonal changes in sepsis should be evaluated in a larger group of patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Authors&#x02019; Contributions</title><p>OY and BA designed the study and directed its implementation, contributed to the analysis, interpretation of the data, and to the redaction of the manuscript.
