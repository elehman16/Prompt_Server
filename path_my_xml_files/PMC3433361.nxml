Parents find it difficult to address the reported barriers to optimal child feeding, and to improve child dietary patterns. To impact at the population level, nutrition interventions need to be easy to disseminate, have a broad reach and appeal to parents while overcoming the barriers parents face when trying to improve child feeding behaviours. The Feeding Healthy Food to Kids (FHFK) Randomised Control Trial (RCT) examines the impact of providing low cost, self-directed nutrition and parenting resources to rural parents, on child dietary intake and parent&#x02013;child feeding practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Up to 150 parents of two-to-five year old children will be recruited in five rural Australian towns. Eligible, consenting parents will be randomly allocated to intervention or 12-month wait-list control groups. Intervention group parents will receive an interactive nutrition CD and parenting DVD, and be provided with instructions for optimal resource utilisation. Intervention and control group participants will also receive a generic nutrition and physical activity brochure and a physical activity resource to blind participants to group allocation. Primary outcome measures are dietary intake of vegetables (serves/day), fruit and energy dense nutrient poor foods (serves/day and %Energy). Secondary outcome measures are total energy (kCal), other food groups (serves/day and %Energy), key nutrients (mg/day), child feeding domains and parenting style domains.</p><p>Analysis of dietary outcome measures, child feeding and parenting domains will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis and compared at baseline, three and 12&#x02009;months using the random effects model, using STATA software. Details of the methodological aspects of recruitment, inclusion criteria, randomisation and statistical analysis are described.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper will add to existing research examining child feeding practices and dietary intake of young children, by specifically focusing on the efficacy of an RCT that has the potential to be implemented at a population level. The correlation of the RCT outcomes with parents&#x02019; perceptions about child feeding practices and children&#x02019;s dietary intake of their children in a subsequent qualitative study will further contribute to this emerging area of research.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian Clinical Trials Registration Number: ACTRN12609000356268</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dietary intake</kwd><kwd>Child/ren</kwd><kwd>Feeding</kwd><kwd>Parent</kwd><kwd>Nutrition education</kwd><kwd>Resources</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Poor childhood nutrition is a more pervasive and insidious risk factors for chronic disease than childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Eating habits established in childhood track through to adulthood, so a childhood diet that is dominated by energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, low in fruit and vegetables is likely to persist into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The two most common dietary inadequacies reported in analysis of young children&#x02019;s dietary intake within Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] are inadequate total consumption (and variety) of vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and excess consumption of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and beverages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Both are risk factors for increased risk of chronic conditions, including specific cancers, type II diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>As the &#x02018;gate-keepers&#x02019; of the child&#x02019;s eating environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], parents are important agents of dietary behaviour development. This is particularly true for pre-school children aged two to six years, as a large proportion of their food is consumed within the home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Engagement of parents is therefore critical in any early childhood nutrition intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Parents consistently report child nutrition to be amongst their highest priorities and responsibilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, a disparity exists between parental desire for a balanced diet for their child/ren and actual child dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Factors contributing to poor dietary intake amongst children include poor maternal nutrition knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and role modelling of energy-dense, nutrient-poor food consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods can easily be misrepresented in food advertising as being core foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Additionally, parents tend not to make a connection between children&#x02019;s dietary intake and longer term health consequences in the absence of obvious risk factors, such as childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Parents also underestimate the weight status of their own children, and are often unaware of what body weight and height proportion constitutes overweight and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Birkett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] has reported that parent concern for disease prevention, home food availability and parental attitudes, beliefs and practices related to child feeding all impact significantly on a child intake. Maternal self-efficacy has also recently been reported to positively impact on child eating behaviours while authoritative parenting style has consistently been associated with optimal child feeding and eating patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Dietitians and public health experts invest considerable time and effort in developing nutrition resources and education programs for parents of young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although nutrition interventions should be grounded in health behaviour theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], this is rarely the case. They are often &#x02018;stand alone&#x02019; or single-strategy interventions, and their efficacy is rarely evaluated in the community or population setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Effective nutrition education resources and programs need to have a broad reach, and appeal to parents. It is vital that these strategies promote enablers, and overcome the barriers to parent engagement in health behaviour change, particularly those related to child feeding and nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Web-based and self-directed resources could replace face-to-face education to improve reach and engagement and their development has been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Two studies from the US Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program provide strong evidence for a self-directed educational approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>In rural areas of Australia there is reduced availability of and access to paediatric nutrition health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] Therefore, a self-directed nutrition program is an attractive option for parents and health care providers who reside in rural areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Increasingly, rural people are becoming technology literate and have improved access to computers, electronic home entertainment and high speed internet connections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Interactive nutrition and parenting resources have the capacity to be provided across whole populations.</p><sec><title>Study aim</title><p>The aim of this study is to describe the study protocol of a randomised controlled trial that is designed to determine the efficacy of providing self-directed nutrition education resources to rural parents.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Approval for the study was obtained from Hunter New England (HNE) Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Ethics Research Committee in 2009.</p><p>HNEHREC Reference No: 08/12/17/4.02 NSW HREC Reference No: HREC/08/HNE/403.</p><p>HNE SSA Reference No: SSA/08/HNE/UoN; H-2009-0106.</p><p>The trial was registered with the Australian Clinical Trials Registration in 2009, trial number ACTRN12609000356268.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrolment in the FHFK study.</p></sec><sec><title>Design - randomized control trial</title><p>A prospective randomized control trial (RCT) to measure the impact of providing parents of pre-school aged children with self-directed nutrition and parenting resources on selected dietary and child feeding factors variables, following intention-to-treat principles, with secondary per-protocol analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection criteria</title><p>The criteria for inclusion in the RCT are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for recruitment into the feeding healthy food to kids randomized controlled trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="center"/><col align="center"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="center"><bold>Inclusion Criteria</bold></th><th align="center"><bold>Exclusion Criteria</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Parent aged 18 years or over (mother, father or primary carer)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Parent under 18 years old<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Child aged under two years or over six years<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Eldest child in family who is aged between two and five years (inclusive)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Child commenced primary school<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="bottom">Chronic health condition that significantly impacts on child&#x02019;s dietary intake<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left" valign="top">Parents from designated study localities or surrounding areas.</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Additional study children from same family</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited primarily from Children&#x02019;s Services (Long Day Care Centres, Pre-schools, Family Day Care, in-home care, Playgroups) and by Early Childhood health professionals who have direct contact with parents of children in target age group, and work in study locations.

The ATES is currently being tested for reliability and relative validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and demonstrates acceptable accuracy for ranking nutrient intakes in Australian toddlers 2 to 4&#x02009;years. Additional validation studies are currently underway.</p><p>The ATES tool is used by parents to record their child&#x02019;s frequency of consumption of a comprehensive, defined list of foods over the previous six month period. Each question contains between four and eight categorical responses. Parents will complete the ATES at baseline, 3&#x02009;months and twelve months.

Data demonstrating whether the study yields positive long-term results will provide direction for future health promotion and research and increase the capacity for the implementation of well-designed RCTs to address the lack of quality low intensity nutrition interventions targeted at parents of young children in rural areas.</p><p>The FHFK study is one of the first randomized controlled trials to determine the impact of a population level nutrition resource intervention on the dietary intake of Australian children. The FHFK RCT extends current research into early childhood nutrition by (i) examining the child feeding practices of parents in a community setting, using a theory based intervention model that could be applied at a population level (ii) having a 12-month follow-up period, thereby allowing assessment of medium term intervention effectiveness; (iii) including several important secondary outcomes (child feeding practices, parenting styles, dietary intake), and (iv) inclusion of a representative sample of rural parents of children aged two to five years, a demographic group previously under-represented in childhood nutrition studies.</p><p>The study builds on previous research into the role of parents in children&#x02019;s dietary intake. Although studies in Australia and the USA have examined the impact of intensive nutrition interventions on the dietary intake of toddlers and primary school aged children, there has not been an extensive study of dietary intake of children aged between two and five years, particularly at a population level and particularly those living in rural areas. Although numerous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] have identified changes in dietary intake as a result of face-to-face education, and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] have use web based programs to influence parent&#x02019;s child feeding practices, little analytic attention has been paid to influencing children&#x02019;s dietary intake through low intensity interventions based on distribution of low cost resources that can be delivered at a population level.</p><p>Feeding Healthy Food to Kids addresses this issue by analysing the dietary intake of two to five year old children, using a validated food frequency questionnaire that has been completed by parent proxy. As such, this study provides additional insight into the potential for a parent-focused nutrition intervention to influence the dietary intake of rural pre-school aged children. The analytic focus on the relative contribution of core food groups and energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods, and comparison of actual dietary intake with child feeding and parenting practices adds a further contribution to the body of research in the field of children&#x02019;s dietary intake and child feeding.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CC, KD, TB were responsible for the design of study, the dietary and child feeding intervention and this paper.
