can decrease the K-ARS scores of symptomatic ADHD children. [Methods] Eighty-one out of
1,123 children surveyed using the K-ARS, a parents&#x02019;-reported questionnaire, led to 16 of
these 81 children being showed scores of &#x02265;19, and measurement of binocular function
diagnosed as having convergence insufficiency. The 16 children were divided equally into a
control group and a vision therapy group. [Results] After vision therapy for 12 weeks,
near point convergence (4.38&#x000b1;0.69&#x02005;cm) significantly neared compared to the near point
convergence before vision therapy (11.50&#x000b1;2.28&#x02005;cm), and both the break point (32.38&#x000b1;2.53 &#x00394;)
and recovery point (19.75&#x000b1;2.11 &#x00394;) of near positive fusional vergence significantly
improved compared to their values before vision therapy (15.88&#x000b1;2.64 &#x00394;, 6.38&#x000b1;6.70 &#x00394;,
respectively). Near exophoria after vision therapy (7.81&#x000b1;2.00 &#x00394; BI) significantly
decreased compared to its value before vision therapy (12.00&#x000b1;1.16 &#x00394; BI). The K-ARS scores
referring to symptomatic ADHD significantly decreased after vision therapy (17.13&#x000b1;2.84)
compared to before vision therapy (23.25&#x000b1;1.49). [Conclusions] Convergence insufficiency
symptoms are closely related to symptoms screened for ADHD, and vision therapy to improve
vergence movements is an effective method of decreasing the K-ARS scores.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Convergence insufficiency</kwd><kwd>Vision therapy</kwd><kwd>ADHD</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Convergence is one of the most important binocular functions of stereopsis and is a common
vision disorder characterized by excess and insufficiency. Convergence insufficiency (CI)
has great potential to induce exophoria at near<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The adverse impact of CI, during near
viewing, results in typical symptoms including double vision, blurred vision, eye strain,
difficulty with concentration, and slow reading<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. These symptoms are closely related to
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the academic achievement of school
children<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several investigators have
concluded that children with ADHD exhibit more visual and quality-of-life symptoms than
children without ADHD. Some of the symptoms of ADHD overlap with those of CI. The symptoms
frequently reported in CI such as loss of concentration when reading, or reading slowly, are
similar to behaviors associated with ADHD (inattentive type), such as failure to complete
assignments, and trouble of concentration in class<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A diagnosis of ADHD for a child has an impact not only on the life
of the child, but also on the family, the school, and society as a whole<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. For a complete diagnosis, a medical
evaluation should be performed. Furthermore, an evaluation of binocular functions should be
made, because some visual problems may be the cause of a child&#x02019;s academic underachievement
and/or lack of concentration<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, the relationship between CI and ADHD has been
investigated<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the effect on ADHD
of convergence improvement has rarely been studied. We are confident that symptomatic ADHD
with CI can be significantly relieved by continuous and self-conscious training for vergence
improvement, because vergence movements are controlled by voluntary motor innervation.</p><p>In this study, we selected children with symptomatic ADHD, as reported by their parents on
the Korea-ADHD Rating Scale (K-ARS) questionnaire, and CI evaluated by a binocular function
test, and investigated whether vision therapy (VT) for improvement of vergence movement can
relieve the symptoms of ADHD evaluated by K-ARS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>For the selection of children with symptomatic ADHD, a total of 1,123 parents participated
in a questionnaire survey using the K-ARS<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Their children, ranging from 8&#x02013;13 years
of age, were attending the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th grades of a public primary
school in G City, Korea. A child is identified with symptomatic ADHD when their score is &#x02265;19
on the K-ARS questionnaire<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number
of subjects reporting K-ARS scores &#x02265;19 totaled 81 children. The binocular functions test
found that 16 of these 81 exhibited CI without accommodative dysfunctions. These 16 children
were divided equally into a control group and a VT group. Each subject and his or her parent
provided informed consent to participation in this study after receiving an oral explanation
of its method. The study was conducted in adherence to the ethical principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects were without physical problems, receiving no medical
care, taking no medication, and exhibiting no signs of strabismus, or amblyopia.</p><p>Measurements of binocular functions are as follows. The examiner corrected refractive
errors by subjective refraction with a phoropter (CV-3000, Topcon, Japan) using a decimal
visual chart (ACP-7, Topcon, Japan) at 5&#x02005;m (25&#x02013;35 lux of interior illuminance and 110&#x02013;120
lux of chart illuminance). The near point of convergence (NPC) was measured using a fixation
stick (Bernell, Indiana, USA) and a ruler. The examiner moved (1&#x02013;2 cm/sec) the target toward
the midpoint of the subject&#x02019;s eyes from 40&#x02005;cm away. When the subject reported a double
target or one eye lost target fixation, the distance measured from the midpoint of eyes to
target was recorded as NPC. The fusional vergence facility (FVF) was measured using flipper
lenses mounted 3 &#x00394; base in (BI)/12 &#x00394; base out (BO) and Vectogram 9 (Bernell, Indiana, USA)
at 40&#x02005;cm. The examiner placed the 12 &#x00394; BO lenses in front of subject&#x02019;s eyes and as soon as
the subject reported that the print became single and clear, flipped the lenses to 3 &#x00394; BI.
The number of full cycles that consisted of both the BI and BO lenses in 60 seconds was
recorded as FVF. A 6 &#x00394; base up (BU) was placed over the left eye and a 12 &#x00394; BI was placed
over the right eye in the subject who was seated behind the phoropter. A vertical arrow
target was held at 40&#x02005;cm from the subject by the examiner. Subjects were instructed to keep
the target clear at all times. If subjects didn&#x02019;t see target dissociation vertically, the
examiner adjusted the Risley prism over the left eye until dissociation occurred. The
examiner then checked the relative direction of the upper target to the lower one, right or
left. The horizontal prism over the right eye was slowly moved until the subject said that
two targets were aligned vertically. At this point, prism power and base direction were
recorded as horizontal phoria. The horizontal vergence at near and at distance was measured
using an isolated vertical line of 0.7 letters with subjects seated behind the phoropter.
Risley prisms set to zero were placed before both eyes. The examiner instructed the subject
to look at the target and try to keep it clear, and introduced the BI prism before both eyes
at a speed of approximately 1 prism diopter per second. As prism is added, the total amount
of prism before the two eyes was noted when the subject reported the line of letters had
broken into two (break point of negative fusional vergence; NFV). After overshooting the
break point slightly by adding a little more prism in the same direction, the examiner
instructed the subject to acknowledge when the target became single again, and reduced prism
until the subject reported the target was single (recovery point). The total amount of prism
before both eyes was noted. The examiner repeated the measurement with the BO prism before
both eyes (positive fusional vergence; PFV).</p><p>Major eligibility criteria for VT were: high exophoria at near (6 &#x00394; or greater), exophoria
at near at least 4 &#x00394; greater than at distance, a receded NPC break (6&#x02005;cm or greater), or
insufficient PFV at near; or failing Sheard&#x02019;s criterion (PFV less than twice the near
phoria<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>), or minimum PFV &#x02264; 15 &#x00394; BO
blur or break. The program of VT was composed of three phases lasting for 12 weeks, which
were divided into home-based VT and office-based VT (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> The program of vision therapy for children having symptomatic ADHD and

Each subject in the VT
group was instructed how to perform their therapy both at home and with a practitioner every
week, and performed 30 minutes of the program, five days a week, at home and at the
practitioner&#x02019;s office. To arouse the children&#x02019;s interest in VT, different types of tools
were used for the same training. The subjects in the control group continued living their
typical day-to-day lives without VT. After VT for 12 weeks, the questionnaire survey using
K-ARS was answered again by the children&#x02019;s parents.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA). The
Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the mean difference of binocular functions before
and after VT, and ANCOVA was used to compare the mean difference of symptomatic ADHD by
K-ARS scores before and after VT while adjusting for differences at baseline. The two tests
were analyzed using a 95% confidence level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The changes of NPC and FVF after VT over 12 weeks are given in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Changes of near point of convergence and fusional vergence facility after vision

children<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. CI causes symptoms of
asthenopia, blurred vision, and the sensation that words and letters run away in reading or
near work<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some patients complain of
near diplopia, nausea, or occasional headaches<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many cases of CI show poor or delayed reading, or simply lag
behind in schoolwork. CI could impede the academic achievements of patients with ADHD. This
implies that CI has the possibility of being a comorbid disorder in ADHD patients.
Considering that CI is a treatable disorder, management with orthoptic intervention may help
patients with ADHD who also suffer from CI<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, it is not obvious that the successful treatment of CI
improves symptomatic ADHD. In the present study, we found that improvement of convergence
functions significantly decreases the K-ARS scores of children with symptomatic ADHD.</p><p>The parents&#x02019; K-ARS questionnaire for symptomatic ADHD is based on the DSM-IV criteria for
ADHD, and 5 of the 9 symptoms of inattention could also be applicable for CI<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our K-ARS questionnaire survey of 1,123
parents found the percentage of children with reported scores of &#x02265;19, suggestive of ADHD
symptoms, was 7.2%. Of these, 19.5% had CI without accommodative dysfunctions.</p><p>To achieve optimum improvement of CI, clinical guidelines suggest the length of treatment
of office-based therapy should generally be 12&#x02013;24 weeks<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the shortest recommended duration is 12 weeks<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. These suggestions were made for both
home-based and office-based treatments, such as computer vergence therapy and pencil
push-up, for children with symptomatic CI. In the VT program of this study, the duration of
therapy was 12 weeks, and both home-based and office-based therapies were conducted for the
subjects. Scheiman et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
only office-based vergence/accommodative therapy and home reinforcement resulted in
significant improvements in symptoms between visits (p&#x0003c;0.001). The rate of improvement
was more rapid for clinical signs (NPC and PFV) than for the symptoms of the children
undergoing treatment for CI. NPC and PFV improved to within their normal ranges after 12
weeks of VT. Borsting et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> documented
that successful treatment of CI induced a significant decrease in exophoria at near
(p&#x0003c;0.001). The important markers of improvement in CI are NPC, PFV, and exophoria at
near. In our results, the NPC after VT (4.38&#x000b1;0.69&#x02005;cm) significantly neared, compared to
before VT (11.50&#x000b1;2.28&#x02005;cm), to within its normal ranges. The break point (32.38&#x000b1;2.53 &#x00394;) and
recovery point (19.75&#x000b1;2.11 &#x00394;) of PFV at near after VT significantly improved compared to
before VT (15.88&#x000b1;2.64 &#x00394;, 6.38&#x000b1;6.70 &#x00394;, respectively). The exophoria at near after VT
(7.81&#x000b1;2.00 &#x00394; BI) significantly decreased compared to before VT (12.00&#x000b1;1.16 &#x00394; BI). Although
the near exophoria after VT remained outside of its normal range, high exophoria &#x0003e;6 &#x00394;,
the other criteria, such as PFV less than twice the near phoria, or minimum PFV &#x02264;15 &#x00394; BO
blur or break, had improved to within their normal ranges. In the successful treatment
conducted by Borsting et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, even when
the near exophoria significantly decreased, the mean of exophoria after 12 weeks of
treatment was high (8.90 &#x00394;). Thus, our results indicate that CI is improved by a VT program.
With these improvements in CI, the K-ARS score of symptomatic ADHD significantly decreased
after VT to 17.13&#x000b1;2.84, a score below the level, 19, suggestive of ADHD. Moreover, the
significant decrease K-ARS score after VT was not dependent on the relief of a specific
symptom, but was based on the relief of various symptoms.</p><p>Based on our results, binocular dysfunction should always be considered in conjunction with
the questionnaire survey for diagnosis of ADHD symptoms, especially, insufficient
convergence, because several questions in the survey of ADHD symptoms could also be used in
the diagnosis of symptomatic CI. Though a VT program for successful improvement of CI,
including both long-term and maintenance therapy is needed<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, improvements in NPC, PFV, and horizontal phoria were coincident
with improvements in symptomatic ADHD of children. Consequently, the results of this study
demonstrate the beneficial impact of treating children with CI on symptomatic ADHD based on
parental report.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Borsting</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rouse</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Deland</surname><given-names>PN</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Association of symptoms and convergence and accommodative
