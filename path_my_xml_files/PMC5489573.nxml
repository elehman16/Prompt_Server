The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the residual effects of eszopiclone on the physical and cognitive functions of healthy elderly people in the early morning and the day following drug administration. Four men and six women aged 63&#x02013;72&#x000a0;years were administered eszopiclone 1&#x000a0;mg or placebo in a randomized, double-blind and crossover design. Measures of objective parameters and subjective ratings were obtained at 4:00, 6:00, and every 2&#x000a0;h from 6:00 to 16:00&#x000a0;hours. For the timed up-and-go test, the main effects of time were seen. For the critical flicker fusion, eszopiclone had significantly worse results compared to placebo in early morning (4:00). There were no significant differences between eszopiclone and placebo in other objective assessments. For the sleep latency, eszopiclone had significantly shorter results compared to placebo (eszopiclone vs placebo&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28.4 vs 52.5&#x000a0;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.047). Feeling of deep sleep and the number of wake after sleep onset did not show any significant differences between eszopiclone and placebo. Based on the above results, the changes of physical and cognitive functions in the healthy elderly after taking hypnotics, it was found that eszopiclone 1&#x000a0;mg is likely to be unharmful for the healthy elderly. Further studies of elderly insomniacs with midnight awakenings are needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hypnotics</kwd><kwd>Residual effects</kwd><kwd>Benzodiazepine</kwd><kwd>Critical flicker fusion test</kwd><kwd>Eszopiclone</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Japanese Society of Sleep Research 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Previous studies have reported that the prevalence of insomnia is 8&#x02013;18%, and females are more prevalent than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].

The association between the residual effects of hypnotics and road traffic accidents is often researched in Western countries, and it has been reported that the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics increases the odds ratio of traffic accident risk up to 1.19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par5">In the elderly, the sensitivity to the drugs increases and blood concentration tends to rise because metabolic capacity declines. For this reason, the association between the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics in the elderly and the risk of falls and fracture is well established, and the use of hypnotics is often discussed as a public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Some research evaluated the effects of hypnotic on the physical and cognitive functions in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but research on the elderly is few [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Uemura et al. reported a significant difference in some functions between the use of hypnotics and placebo in the healthy elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

According to a regional survey in Japan in 2008, brotizolam, zolpidem, and rilmazafone are the top three of the most prescribed hypnotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The common feature of these hypnotics is the short half-life effects.</p><p id="Par9">These short-acting hypnotics are considered to have no residual effect after 8 hours of sleep.

For the sleep latency, eszopiclone had significantly shorter results compared to placebo (eszopiclone vs placebo&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28.4 vs 52.5&#x000a0;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.047) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). There were no significant differences between eszopiclone and placebo in feeling of deep sleep and the number of wake after sleep onset (WASO).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par28">Uemura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and Ito et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] examined the effects on the next day of hypnotic to healthy young people. Zolpidem and zaleplon were reported to have significantly better results than those of placebo in CFF. However, in the present study using eszopiclone, CFF at 4:00&#x000a0;hour had better results than placebo. Since eszopiclone has a long half-life compered to zolpidem and zaleplon, the CFF test at 4:00 was affected by the drug efficacy (t1/2 eszopiclone&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.8&#x02013;5.1&#x000a0;h, t1/2 zolpidem&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.7&#x02013;2.3&#x000a0;h, t1/2 zaleplon&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Although CFF results at 4:00&#x000a0;hour were worse in the subjects with eszopiclone, the other objective parameters, such as, TUG, FRT and body sway test, were the same as those with placebo; therefore the risk of falls would not be changed in these two conditions. In addition, the CFF result at 4:00 would be considered to be the main effect of eszopiclone and would contribute to the maintenance of sleep.</p><p id="Par29">Uemura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] have reported that ultrashort-acting hypnotics zolpidem and triazolam did not affect cognitive motor function the next day for the elderly. This result is consistent with present study except for CFF result. Suda et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] reported that administration of eszopiclone to healthy young people improved their memory function the next day; however, no significant difference was seen in our study with the elderly. This was due to the difference in the original memory functions of the young and the elderly. Although feeling of deep sleep and the number of WASO were not improved, significant shortening of sleep onset latency was observed by the administration of eszopiclone compared to that of placebo. In subjective assessments, there were no significant differences in SSS, alertness, well-being, and fatigue on the following day.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par30">We are aware of several limitations of this study: small sample size, only a short-term observation, and lack of objective assessment of sleep such as PSG or actigraphy. In addition, the examinations were conducted on the healthy elderly only at 4:00 in the early morning, and the influence on insomniacs at midnight was not considered. Therefore, these results were different from those of patients with chronic insomnia and midnight urinations. Further studies of elderly insomniacs with midnight awakenings are needed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par31">Based on the above results of the changes of physical and cognitive functions in the healthy elderly after taking hypnotics, it would be recognized that eszopiclone 1mg is likely to be unharmed for the healthy elderly.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Ms. Airi Yamada for writing and editing the English for this paper.</p></ack><notes
