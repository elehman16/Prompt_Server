                    month period completed a baseline questionnaire. At 18 months, children at or
                    below the 20th centile on an expressive vocabulary checklist entered the

                    sessions), and most reported high satisfaction with the programme. Interim
                    outcomes at age 2 years were similar in the two groups. Similarly, at age 3
                    years, adjusted mean differences (intervention&#x02212;control) were &#x02212;2.4 (95%

                    toddlers was feasible and acceptable, but little evidence was found that it

                optimise their responsive behaviours (for example, responding to the child&#x02019;s focus
                of interest) and provide rich language input (for example, expanding the child&#x02019;s

                arm), longer term follow-up (at least 12 months), studies in children aged under 2
                years, and consideration of &#x0201c;the balance of benefits and harms of using brief,
                formal screening instruments . . . for . . . language delay in the primary care
                setting.&#x0201d; The trial reported here was planned to consider each of these factors and,
                specifically, an evidence gap for population based selective prevention. Selective
                prevention involves offering a low intensity intervention to a relatively large
                minority of the population with an identified strong risk factor, rather than to the
                smaller group that might meet diagnostic criteria if detailed assessment were
                available.</p><p>We report the outcomes in 2 year olds and 3 year olds of a parent based language
                promotion programme in Melbourne, Australia, that targets 18 month old toddlers at
                risk of language delay by virtue of the absence or near absence of spoken words. We
                chose this entry point because we wanted to offer a true selective prevention
                (rather than early treatment) intervention; our universal services have very high
                capture rates at this age; parents are typically very concerned about absence of
                language at 18 months and so would be very motivated to participate; the programme
                would not be stigmatising, because of its overtly preventive nature and the fact
                that 20% of all children would be involved; and, if the programme was rolled out in
                Australia, the upcoming 2 year old well child visit (the last until age 3.5 years)
                could act as a funnel into more detailed assessment and individual referral for
                those who did not seem to benefit from the preventive programme.</p><p>The Hanen Centre developed the preventive programme &#x0201c;You Make the Difference&#x0201d;, a

                screening approach delivered to all toddlers with slow early development of
                expressive vocabulary would improve children&#x02019;s language development outcomes at 2
                and 3 years (the primary outcome) and reduce behavioural problems (particularly

                toddlers identified by population based screening as being at risk of language delay
                by virtue of having few or no spoken words at 18 months. The programme would be
                costly to provide at a population level, as it would involve around a quarter of the
                population of toddlers each year. It would also be unnecessary because, although
                these slow to talk toddlers had low mean language scores at age 2, by 3 years they
                had achieved mean expressive, receptive, and vocabulary scores very similar to
                population norms.</p><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of study</title><p>Strengths of the study include a high population reach and uptake in communities
                    across the demographic spectrum, careful pilot testing of the programme&#x02019;s
                    protocol to ensure acceptability and feasibility, random allocation to groups,
                    excellent uptake and retention, blinding of outcome assessment, and large sample
                    size (a weakness in the literature for trials of childhood language<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). Language outcomes were directly
                    assessed with standardised measures, supplemented by parents&#x02019; evaluations and
                    measures of children&#x02019;s behaviour to investigate the programme&#x02019;s broader
                    effect.</p><p>Several limitations must also be considered. Firstly, although the introduction
                    outlines our good reasons for getting children to enter the trial at 18 months,
                    this may simply be too young; too many children go on to spontaneously develop
                    normal language (that is, the specificity is low). This is supported by the near
                    normal mean language scores (table 2<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2"/>)
                    achieved by age 3 years but was far from evident in the literature when we
                    planned the trial. Perhaps prevention should be earlier and universal, with
                    intervention offered only once language delay is definitely present&#x02014;that is,
                    only to older children. More recent reports indicate that later screening at 2.5
                    years may yield higher specificity and that interventions targeting 2-3 year old
                    children identified as late talkers can be effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref> Either way, our findings have
                    implications for policies on whether and when countries screen for language
                    delay, a subject for which stronger evidence is sorely needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Secondly, little is known about the selection of risk factors for language delay.
                    We chose parents&#x02019; report of development of expressive vocabulary, on the basis
                    of the best evidence available.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>

                    detects toddlers with no or small spoken vocabularies and has been the entry
                    criterion for other trials in this age group,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> although its long term predictive validity has been both

                    but, rather, we should have targeted other aspects such as receptive language.
                    However, at age 2, our sample&#x02019;s mean receptive language score of around 90 was
                    very similar to their low mean expressive language score, with rapid gains in
                    both receptive and expressive scores towards the population mean of 100 by age 3
                    years. Furthermore, as receptive language is by definition less &#x0201c;overt&#x0201d; than
                    spoken language, screening may also be more challenging.</p><p>Thirdly, the tests of interaction were not specified in advance, and we had no
                    hypothesis as to what the nature of the interaction might be (which subgroups
                    were most likely to respond differentially to the intervention). As the overall
                    estimated comparison between the trial arms did not indicate an effect, the
                    interaction findings, if true, would suggest benefit for receptive language to
                    one subgroup but harm for the other, which has no strong basis. We take the view
                    that these interaction results are most likely due to chance.</p><p>Finally, the intervention may have been insufficiently intensive in uptake,
                    number of sessions received, or dose of intervention per session.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> Although we consider the uptake to be
                    high for a population programme based on screening, only 57% of intervention
                    families participated in at least four of the six weekly sessions; however,
                    retrospective analyses indicate that those most in need (with lower vocabulary
                    scores) were more likely to attend the programme. Even for parents who attended,
                    six weeks may have provided insufficient exposure to consolidate the responsive
                    interaction strategies. Longer interventions over 10-12 weeks have yielded
                    positive outcomes with similar parent based interventions for more highly
                    selected at risk and late talking children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>; in contrast, low intensity may have
                    explained the limited efficacy in Glogowska&#x02019;s randomised trial of community
                    based speech and language therapy in older preschool children presenting
                    clinically (whose language did not normalise over the follow-up period).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref> However, the normal mean language and
                    vocabulary scores achieved by both intervention and control children by age 3
                    years suggest that natural resolution, rather than our intervention&#x02019;s intensity
                    being too low, explains the null findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title><p>Studies with both positive and null findings need to be considered in making

                    pressure to respond earlier to a range of language concerns in young children.
                    We caution against assuming that good interventions will remain effective when
                    translated to the population level. This study shows the wisdom of doing
                    rigorous trials to avert the considerable waste of governments&#x02019; and families&#x02019;
                    resources that may otherwise occur.</p><p>Interventions of greater intensity, delivered at a different age, or both may yet
                    prove helpful, although we recognise that this may put them out of the reach of
                    implementation in the population. Alternatively, efforts may need to focus on
                    improving both the sensitivity and specificity of measures to target
                    interventions better to the young children most at risk of lasting language
