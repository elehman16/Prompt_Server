The objectives of periodontal regenerative therapy are to reconstitute the bone, cementum, and periodontal ligament on a previously diseased root surface. Numerous therapeutic modalities for restoring periodontal osseous defects have been investigated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Many of these procedures include the use of bone grafts and bone replacement materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] For the last few decades, demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) has been used alone and in combination with other treatment modalities for periodontal regeneration. The presence of bone morphogenetic proteins contained within DFDBA aids in mesenchymal cell migration, attachment, and osteogenesis. DFDBA has both osteoinductive and osteoconductive activity and the ability to create and maintain the space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>A different approach to periodontal regeneration is the use of polypeptide growth factors. These factors, abundant in alpha granules of platelets, may control the growth of cells and hence, the number of cells available to produce a tissue. Platelet rich plasma (PRP) is an autologous concentration of platelets in plasma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] PRP has been used to enhance the clinical outcome obtained by using bone grafts with and without guided tissue regeneration in the treatment of intrabony defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] However, there are potential risks associated with the use of PRP.</p><p>Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF), a second generation platelet concentrate has been introduced by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>. in 2001 that has several advantages over PRP.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Choukroun's PRF, a second generation platelet concentrate is an autologous leukocyte and PRF material. It requires neither anticoagulant nor bovine thrombin. This is produced in a totally natural manner, without using anticoagulant during blood harvest nor bovine thrombin and calcium chloride for platelet activation and fibrin polymerization. It has eliminated the redundant process of adding anticoagulant as well as the need to neutralize it. The absence of anticoagulant implies the activation in a few minutes of most platelets of the blood sample in contact with the tube walls and release of the coagulation cascades. The protocol is very simple and of low cost. PRF is a matrix of autologous fibrin, in which are embedded intrinsically a large quantity of platelet and leukocyte cytokines during centrifugation leading to their progressive release over time (7-11 days), as the network of fibrin disintegrates.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clinically compare autologous PRF combined with DFDBA to DFDBA alone in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this 6 month follow-up interventional study, a total of 10 systemically healthy patients undergoing periodontal therapy at the Department of Periodontology, Govt. Dental College and Hospital, Patiala (Punjab) were selected for the study. Intraoral periapical radiographs (IOPAs) were taken to confirm the presence of suitable bony defects for the selection of subjects.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were the presence of two almost identical interproximal intrabony defects, one on either side of arch based on radiographic observations with clinical probing depth of at least 6 mm in teeth without furcation involvement.</p><p>Patients with any systemic disease that contraindicate periodontal surgery, patients having insufficient platelet count for PRF preparation, patients with coagulation defect or anticoagulation treatment, pregnant or lactating mothers, a smoker or an alcoholic patient, those with unacceptable oral hygiene after the re-evaluation of phase I therapy were excluded from the study. In addition, teeth with endodontic involvement, or Miller grade II or greater mobility were also excluded.</p><p>It was made clear to the potential subjects that participation was voluntary. Written informed consent was obtained from those who agreed to participate.</p><p>A general assessment of selected subjects was made through their history, clinical examination and routine investigations. All subjects were treated with the initial phase I therapy involving oral hygiene instructions, scaling and root planning. Following phase I therapy the subjects were re-evaluated after 6 weeks, and those who still satisfied the selection criteria were finally taken up for the study.</p><p>Selected sites were randomly divided into two groups. In Group I, mucoperiosteal flap elevation followed by the placement of DFDBA was done. In Group II, mucoperiosteal flap elevation followed by the placement of homogeneous mixture of PRF with DFDBA was done. Probing pocket depth, gingival marginal position and clinical attachment level of the selected sites were recorded using customized acrylic occlusal stents at baseline before surgery and again recorded at 3 months and at 6 months post-operatively. Site-specific plaque index and sulcus bleeding index were recorded at baseline and again at 3 months, at 6 months post-operatively. For measuring radiographic parameters, IOPAs of each defect was exposed at baseline before surgery and again recorded at 6 months post-operatively using extension cone paralleling instrument (paralleling technique) using 1 &#x000d7; 1 mm calibrated grid. Radiographic measurements were taken using a vernier caliper to achieve accuracy of 1/10 mm in measurement. The measurements included the distance from cemento enamel junction to the base of defect, distance from cemento enamel junction to the alveolar crest and the distance from the alveolar crest to the base of the defect [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Intraoral peri-apical radiograph at baseline (Group I)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-361-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Intraoral peri-apical radiograph at baseline (Group II)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-361-g002"/></fig><p>Using above measurements, following parameters were calculated as:</p><p>Defect fill: It was calculated as the difference between the values of the distance from the cemento enamel junction to the base of defect at 6 months and baseline.</p><p>Alveolar crest resorption: It was calculated as the difference between the values of the distance from the cemento enamel junction to the alveolar crest at 6 months and baseline.</p><p>Defect resolution: It was calculated as the difference between the values of the distance from the alveolar crest to the base of the defect at 6 months and baseline.</p><p>After taking informed consent of the patient, a 10 ml blood sample of the patient without anticoagulant was taken in a test tube and centrifuged immediately at 3000 rpm for 10 min.</p><p>The resultant product consisted of the following three layers</p><p>

</p><p>The platelet rich fibrin clot was recovered and was cut in few millimeter fragments and mixed with DFDBA to get a homogeneous mass.</p><p>All patients were operated under local anesthesia with a solution of 2% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline. Anesthetic solution was administered by either nerve block or local infiltration to adequately anesthetize the surgical site. The patients were then subjected to periodontal flap surgery.</p><p>Periodontal flap surgery was done by giving sulcular incision and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected both on facial and lingual side. Thorough debridement and root planning of the exposed root surface was performed by hand instrumentation. In Group I, the rehydrated DFDBA was then carried to the defect and carefully packed into the defect. In Group II, after proper debridement [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], autologous PRF was prepared. PRF clots were recovered and were cut in few millimeter fragments and mixed with DFDBA to get a homogeneous mass. The grafted mixture was properly condensed in the defect to the level of surroundings bony walls [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>]. The flap was adapted back to its original position and suturing was done using non-resorbable silk thread (3-0) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>]. The surgical site was dried using gauze and Coe-pak was then applied.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Intrabony defect after flap reflection</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-361-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Mixture of platelet-rich fibrin and demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft placed in the intrabony defect</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-361-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Sutures placed</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-361-g005"/></fig><p>Amoxycillin 500 mg thrice a day was prescribed for 5 days.

DFDBA is shown to be both osteoconductive and osteoinductive. Urist <italic>et al</italic>. showed through numerous animal experiments that DFDBA could stimulate the formation of new bone by osteoinduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] That is, the graft material induces host undifferentiated mesenchymal cells to differentiate into osteoblasts with subsequent formation of new bone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Moreover, DFDBA also provides a scaffold for osteoconduction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] DFDBAs have repeatedly demonstrated significant improvements in soft and hard tissue clinical parameters for the treatment of intraosseous periodontal defects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Recently, the use of growth factors in periodontal regeneration has shown promising results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Growth factors are a class of natural biologic mediators that regulate key cellular events in tissue regeneration including cell proliferation, chemotaxis, differentiation, and matrix synthesis via binding to specific cell surface receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Platelet alpha (&#x003b1;) granules form an intracellular storage pool of growth factors including platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor &#x003b2; (including &#x003b2;<sup>-1</sup> and &#x003b2;<sup>-2</sup>-isomers), vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor-1.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>A combination of PRF with DFDBA demonstrated better results in probing pocket depth reduction and clinical attachment level gain as compared to DFDBA alone in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. This result may be attributed to beneficial effects of PRF. PRF has been introduced by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>. in 2001. PRF consists of a fibrin matrix polymerised in a tetramolecular structure; the incorporation of platelets, leukocytes, and cytokines; and circulating stem cells. Slow fibrin polymerization during PRF processing leads to the intrinsic incorporation of platelet cytokines and glycan chains in the fibrin meshes. This result implies that PRF, unlike the other platelet concentrates, is able to progressively release cytokines during fibrin matrix remodeling.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] It is also found that PRF organizes as a dense fibrin scaffold with a high number of leukocytes concentrated in one part of the clot. Leukocytes seem to have a strong influence on growth factor release, immune regulation, anti-infectious activity, and matrix remodeling during healing. It is an optimal matrix for migration of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It permits a rapid angiogenesis and an easier remodeling of fibrin in a more resistant connective tissue. Such a mechanism might explain the clinically observed soft tissue healing properties of PRF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] However, histological studies are needed to establish the exact nature of this clinical attachment gain.</p><p>In our study, PRF does not seem to have any additional favorable effect on defect fill and defect resolution in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. However, various <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown a beneficial effect of PRF on bone healing like its effect on proliferation and differentiation on osteoblasts (Ehrenfest <italic>et al</italic>. 2009, He <italic>et al</italic>. 2009).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] When mixed with the graft, PRF fragments serve as a biological connector between bone particles. Moreover, the gradual release of cytokines plays a significant role in the self-regulation of inflammatory and infectious phenomena within the grafted material.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Thus, in the present study PRF with DFDBA demonstrated better results in probing pocket depth reduction and clinical attachment level gain as compared to DFDBA alone in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. This result may be attributed to beneficial effects of PRF. However, histological studies are needed to establish the exact nature of this clinical attachment gain. PRF does not seem to have any additional favorable effect on defect fill and defect resolution. However, various <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown a beneficial effect of PRF on bone healing.</p><p>Within limits of the study, it can be concluded that future long-term studies with a large sample size and utilization of advanced radiological techniques should be carried out to further explore the role of PRF in the management of periodontal intrabony defects and to verify the results of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies in a clinical study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
