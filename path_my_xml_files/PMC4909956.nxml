We excluded children with severe dehydration, shock and hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, those who were not dehydrated or were mildly dehydrated. Parents signed informed consent before entry into the study and the study was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Tabriz University of Medical Sciences prior to entrance into the study.</p></sec><sec id="cesec50"><title>Enrollment and Intervention</title><p>Eligible patients were children with moderate dehydration or vomiting due to gastroenteritis who had not responded to an oral rehydration therapy. They were randomly assigned to each of the study groups: rapid intravenous rehydration or standard 24 hour intravenous therapy. They were allocated in a 1:1 ratio for each group. Nine patients in the intervention group were excluded from the study due to electrolyte abnormalities. In the intervention group, 54 patients received metoclopramide prior to admission and 49 patients in the control group received metoclopramide as well; this was not significantly different between two groups (p=0.7).</p><p>The intervention group received 20&#x02013;30 cc/kg of a crystalloid solution over 2 hours. Four hours after the initiation of IV therapy, the patients were visited by the attending physician at which time they were discharged or admitted.</p><p>Follow up information was collected on day 3 following admission. Patients in the control group were also visited at this time to control their vomiting.</p></sec><sec id="cesec60"><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization sequence was generated by the statistical adviser of the research program. A computerized randomizer was used for this purpose.</p></sec><sec id="cesec70"><title>Outcome Measure</title><p>The primary outcome measure was resolution of vomiting in children with gastroenteritis receiving rapid intravenous rehydration.</p></sec><sec id="cesec80"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Student's T-test and chi square tests were used for quantitative and qualitative data. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to be significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Results</title><p>During the study period, 150 patients met the enrollment criteria and were enrolled in the study (75 to rapid rehydration and 75 to standard rehydration). The two groups were similar regarding sex, age and weight (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). At two hours, 84% (63) of children given rapid IV rehydration had rehydrated or experienced resolution of vomiting and were discharged. 16% (12) were admitted to the ED (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Patients in the rapid rehydration group received 20&#x02013;30 cc/kg of isotonic solution over 2 hours and patients in the standard 24 hours rehydration group had received about 30&#x02013;35 cc/kg of intravenous solution over four hours according to their degree of dehydration which is not significantly different between two groups. This demonstrates that rapid intravenous rehydration can result in a substantial reduction of ED admissions. Among 63 patients who were discharged, 2 cases had recurrence of vomiting and were readmitted.</p><p>In 62 patients of the control group, vomiting resolved after 4 hours and only 3 had persistent vomiting for more than 12 hours. Comparing the two groups regarding the resolution of vomiting, chi square test did not indicate a significant difference between the two groups (p&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="cesec100"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that rapid intravenous rehydration is as effective as standard rehydration regimens in the treatment of dehydration and vomiting in children with gastroenteritis, and it can thus prevent unnecessary admissions to EDs and reduce unnecessary expenses. In cases where oral rehydration therapy fails, intravenous rehydration is a necessary alternative for dehydrated babies. A few studies have also reported an effective rehydration with administration of fluids in amounts of 20&#x02013;40 cc/kg over varying periods.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[8]</sup></xref> Considering its benefits, this method of treatment is being adopted into clinical practice.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Almost all children in our study recovered without complications and only 2 cases had recurrence of vomiting and were admitted.</p><p>Some pediatric nephrologists believe that the prolonged deficit therapy is outdated, and they believe in the implementation of high volume fluid resuscitation.<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[5]</sup></xref> Although multiple studies have shown usefulness and effectiveness of rapid IV rehydration,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the amounts and rates of fluid administration have not been defined. In our study, we administered 20&#x02013;30 ml/kg of fluids over two hours; this was well tolerated by patients and no significant complications were observed. In the study by Phin et al. on moderately dehydrated children, significant reductions were observed in the admission rates and number of discharges in a period of eight hours or less in the intervention group compared with the control group; no significant differences in the rates of re-presentation or rate of procedures were observed.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[12]</sup></xref> Freedman et al.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>[9]</sup></xref> have compared rapid versus standard IV rehydration and concluded that resolution of dehydration after two hours was the same in both groups and they suggested avoidance of using rapid rehydration due to possible complications. We did not encounter any significant complications during our investigation. However, this needs to be investigated further in larger multicenter trials.</p><sec id="cesec110"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rapid rehydration in children dehydrated from gastroenteritis is effective in reducing admission rates and lengths of stay in emergency departments. According to the results of this study this method can be used safely in pediatric patients with dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis.</p></sec><sec id="cesec120"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study was performed to show the preliminary advantages of rapid intravenous rehydration regimens. The analysis of serious complications and its safety and the rate and volume of fluids administered requires further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="cesec130"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This article is extracted from the MD Thesis of Atefe Ahmadzade.</p></sec><sec id="cesec140"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>The authors declare that there is no potential conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bonadio</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Acute infectious enteritis in children.
