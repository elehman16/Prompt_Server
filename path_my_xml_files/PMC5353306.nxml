The aim of this study is to compare the effects of early inhomecare (PreHomeCare) including video consultations and mobile applications with those of inhospital consultations regarding breast feeding, parental confidence and parent&#x02013;infant interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised controlled intervention study will be conducted in four neonatal departments offering PreHomeCare (ie, premature infant inhomecare) in Denmark. Parents of hospitalised premature infants who fulfil the inclusion criteria for PreHomeCare will be randomised during hospitalisation to either the intervention (n=80) or control group (n=80) using 1:1 block randomisation. During PreHomeCare, the intervention group will receive a smartphone application with a video system and an infant scale, and the control group will receive usual care (ie, hospital consultations). Additionally, both groups will have planned nurse consultations two to three times a week: the intervention group through video consultations and the control group through inhospital consultations. Data collection will occur at inclusion/baseline, at the end of PreHomeCare and 1&#x02005;month after discharge using questionnaires and hospital records. The primary outcome is the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants 1&#x02005;month after discharge/end of PreHomeCare, the secondary outcomes are parent&#x02013;infant interactions measured by the Mother and baby interaction scale and family confidence in caring for infants measured by the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale. The process evaluation will consist of two qualitative studies: a field study and an interview study. Data collection will initially involve field observations of three scheduled video consultations with six families from the intervention group. These families will also be interviewed 1&#x02005;month after PreHomeCare has ended.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The project has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT02581800.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Early in-homecare</kwd><kwd>Breast feeding</kwd><kwd>Premature infant</kwd><kwd>early discharge</kwd><kwd>parent/infant relation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Preterm birth rates have been increasing in almost all countries worldwide,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and &#x0223c;15 million infants around the world are born prematurely each year. Premature birth is defined as a delivery that occurs before a gestation age (GA) of 37&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Denmark, &#x0223c;6.4% of all live infants are born prematurely.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Premature infants are characterised by organ underdevelopment, which increases the need for treatment associated with breathing, circulatory and gastrointestinal function, temperature regulation and infections; in most cases, these needs require admission to the neonatal ward.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While health professionals care for the infant (depending on the severity of the infants' condition), parents often experience anxiety, depression, decreased parenting confidence and self-efficacy and impaired parent&#x02013;child interactions related to feelings resulting from the premature infant's condition.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Parental anxiety related to uncertainty about their infant's health has been shown to affect infant development and growth and perceptions of future infant vulnerability.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, parental anxiety seems to be a significant predictor of cognitive and behavioural outcomes in later life.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Breast feeding or bottle nutrition is initiated during hospitalisations, and as the premature infant grows and develops, the parents gradually assume responsibility for the provision of primary care. It is important for premature infants to receive breast milk because it provides pronounced health benefits.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Mothers are encouraged to express breast milk approximately every third hour to feed their infant in order to stimulate the breast and prepare for when the infant is ready to breastfeed. Despite these recommendations, at discharge, premature infants are not breast fed to the same extent as term infants. Among other factors, a low GA, mother's lack of privacy during breast feeding, mother's level of stress and the lack of use of baby-friendly initiatives in neonatal wards seem to limit breast feeding success.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A previous study showed positive effects of test weighing on establishing earlier exclusive breast feeding.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Additionally, a newly published study found that the proportion of breast feeding decreases from 68% at discharge to &#x0223c;40% around 1-month post discharge from the neonatal ward.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A Cochrane review further demonstrated that any form of extra support can increase the duration of exclusive breast feeding in term infants.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> These findings indicate that there may be a need to create an environment that supports maternal breast feeding of premature infants. In a recent study, parents of premature infants reported that they did not feel that the infant was theirs before returning home.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Towards the end of their hospital stay, most premature infants will be physiologically stable, although some will still require tube feeding.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> At this point, in most hospitals in Denmark, families are provided the opportunity to participate in early inhomecare programmes to bring their infant home as well as to receive relevant education. These programmes are designed to bridge the gap in the transition from hospital to home and provide parents and infants the ability to be alone and become familiarised with each other outside of the hospital setting.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Early inhomecare with tube feeding performed by parents<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;16</xref> is becoming the standard of care in most Danish hospitals. Qualitative studies have described how the transition to early inhomecare is a difficult experience for new parents, particularly in the first weeks and months after discharge.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Although parents in this phase have been looking forward to returning home, they often feel insecure and concerned about their infant's health and well-being.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> At the same time, they want to have control over the situation and function as normal parents regarding their infant.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In a recent study, parents received knowledge and education<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> to accommodate this difficult transition. The families expressed the importance of being assigned to the same nurse throughout the entire process<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and of receiving unidirectional and additional guidance. Early inhome programmes can address parent&#x02013;child interactions,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> which have been shown to have a significant effect on infant development,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and could also support mothers in successful breast feeding.</p><p>Early inhomecare programmes have previously been followed by support<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> from home visits and/or hospital consultations two to three times a week or by the use of telemedicine communication.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The effects of home visits and/or hospital consultation support include the prolonged provision of breast milk,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> a lower risk of infections during tube feeding<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and higher parental satisfaction;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> furthermore, early inhomecare for premature infants results in fewer readmissions, less unscheduled support and shorter lengths of hospitalisation.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A new Cochrane review and a randomised study on these programmes were not able to find significant differences in exclusive or partial breast feeding.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Moreover, no differences in parental anxiety or confidence were found; however, mothers in early inhomecare programmes felt better prepared to take care of their infants.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although home visit support shows promising results, it requires comprehensive nurse resources and can therefore be an expensive and resource-demanding approach.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> To date, no studies have offered round-the-clock home visit support. A randomised controlled effect study from Sweden that used less resource-demanding video consultations showed that families welcomed this option and that the need for home visits was reduced.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> These findings indicate that telemedicine may be a viable option to address the need for support in the early inhomecare period. Furthermore, using an application to collect daily data has great potential in telemedicine.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The use of technology provides parents the opportunity to be at home and still be in close contact with hospital staff,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;26</xref> and it gives hospital staff the opportunity to provide equal care to all parents regardless of their distance from the hospital. The concerns raised about the use of technology have been that it affects the communication between parents and nurses<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and that the occurrence of frozen screens may affect video communications.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Telemedicine is a very new and unexplored field in the neonatal setting, and there is a lack of knowledge of its effects on breast feeding, parental confidence and parent&#x02013;infant interactions as well as a lack of experience with the use of video consultations and smartphone applications. The aim of this study is to examine the effect (1) and evaluate the process (2) of early inhomecare (PreHomeCare) with video consultations and mobile applications compared with the effect of inhospital consultations. The hypothesis is that the intervention will positively influence the continuation of breast feeding by providing<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> easily accessible knowledge about breast feeding (application),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> available guidance at all hours from a nurse (video consultation) and<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> home weighing of the infant (weight). <italic>Effect study (1)</italic>: The objective is to test the effects of video consultations and the mobile application on the proportion of exclusive breastfeeding mothers, parent&#x02013;infant interactions and parental confidence with premature infants after the PreHomeCare programme. <italic>Process evaluation studies (2)</italic>: The objectives are to explore nurses' communication (regarding nursing practice, dialogue and information) during the parent&#x02013;nurse interactions in the video consultations and to explore how parents of premature infants experience PreHomeCare and the use of technology.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>PreHomeCare study</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Mixed methods study design</title><p>The effects and process of the project will be evaluated using the framework outlined by the intervention mapping approach.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The study will apply a mixed methods design comprising a randomised controlled intervention study with two parallel arms for the evaluation of effects, targeting the primary study population and two qualitative studies for the process evaluation of the intervention: a field study and an interview study, primarily targeting the secondary study population of nurses involved in the intervention.</p><p>The primary study population of early discharged parents with premature infants will be randomised into two groups: the intervention group, which will receive the smartphone application and video consultations in the PreHomeCare programme, and a control group, which will receive usual care (hospital consultations) in the PreHomeCare programme (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013024F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013024F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Project overview.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013024f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Setting</title><p>There are 19 neonatal wards in Denmark, and this study is being conducted in four of them (in different geographical parts of Denmark). Study inclusion began in November 2015. These wards all receive premature infants from GA week 27/28 and correspond to a level IIIa ward.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>PreHomeCare: The care in these neonatal wards is provided by registered nurses (RN) who are trained in caring for premature infants. All nurses can participate in the early inhomecare programme, as all are familiar with and trained in this type of care; however, 3&#x02013;4 nurses on each ward have special interests in early inhomecare. These nurses are the most experienced in this field and work in practice and in experience sharing and will thus serve as the nurses responsible for the project. The wards assign the families a contact nurse who follow the family through the admission and early inhomecare.</p><p>The criteria to participate in early inhomecare are that the infant has a GA &#x02265;34+0 at the start of inhomecare, does not have apnoea, maintains a normal body temperature, gains weight, receives tube feeding, has started breast feeding/bottle nutrition and does not need medical treatment. The goals of early inhomecare are to strengthen the parent&#x02013;child relationship, support the parents' skills, ease the transition to home and support mothers in practicing exclusive breast feeding.</p><p>When the family returns home in early inhomecare (usual care), they attend 2&#x02013;3 planned visits to the hospital to talk with a nurse, primarily the contact nurse. The content of this discussion pertains to the nutrition plan, infant's actual weight, bottle/breast feeding progression, family life, infant's general well-being, expression of breast milk, use of nipple shields and tube feeding, among other topics.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Study status</title><p>As of September, 50 infants/parents from the participating neonatal wards had been enrolled in the study.

The study has a cluster structure with care in different hospitals, and this clustering will be considered when data are analysed (use of a random effects model is a possibility). Data will initially be analysed with univariate analysis using a 2&#x000d7;2 contingency table (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and Fisher's exact test). Multivariate regression models will be used to adjust for confounders and other statistically significant explanatory variables. However, the initial randomisation should reduce the overall risk of confounding. The effect of the intervention according to the proportion of infants exclusively breast fed will be analysed using linear regression models. The MABISC and KPCS will be analysed using paired and unpaired t-tests. The number of readmissions will be evaluated using Poisson regression and will be further assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves as time to first readmission.

The field observation method was chosen to explore nursing practices and will be based on Spradley's methodology regarding &#x02018;participant observation&#x02019;.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The observations will occur in the parents' homes and will focus on the nurse's communication and interaction with the parents on screen to gain insight into how video communication affects their dialogue.</p></sec><sec id="s2a11b"><title>Interview study</title><p>A qualitative evaluation will be conducted to explore how parents of premature infants experience the PreHomeCare programme and the use of technology, that is, applications and video consultations, and the baby scale. As parents describe the transition from hospital to home as being difficult, and as they have reported feeling insecure, a qualitative interview study was chosen to gain in-depth knowledge of the parents' perspectives of PreHomeCare. The study will be planned and conducted with inspiration from Kvale and Brinkmann&#x02032;s methodology.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The interview study will explore PreHomeCare from the parents' perspective by uncovering the meaning contained in their experiences.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2a12"><title>Data collection</title><p>Six families will initially be selected from the intervention group to be the subjects of the field observations. In accordance with the qualitative tradition, the exact number of participants cannot be determined in advance. The data collection will continue until saturation has been reached, that is, until no new information is obtained.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> The selected parents will be informed about the aim of the study after randomisation. To ensure variation in the sample, the respondents will be strategically selected based on the premature infants' GA at birth (GA is related to the length of hospitalisation). The observations will occur in the parents' home during the three scheduled video consultations. The observer will stand to the side during the video consultations in the parents' home and will conduct an informal follow-up with the parents. Through &#x02018;passive participant observation&#x02019; of the situation (video consultations), the people (parents, infants and nurse(s)) and the physical setting can be openly observed. Field notes will be recorded according to an observation guide inspired by the theory of &#x02018;active listening&#x02019;.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Thus, concrete descriptions of what is said and done, the tone of voice, the researcher's impressions and the assumptions of the communication between nurse(s) and parents will be documented.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> After the observations, the field notes will be written in prose.</p><p>Parents in the field observation study will be interviewed<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> &#x0223c;1&#x02005;month after the end of the PreHomeCare programme, as the parents are expected to have reflected on the programme by this time point. As fathers and mothers may experience PreHomeCare differently, clarifying questions will be addressed to each parent using a semistructured interview guide. The interview will occur in the parents' home or in a place of the parent's preference. The primary aim of the interview will be to explore the main question: &#x02018;how did you experience PreHomeCare?&#x02019; with a particular focus on what was especially meaningful for the parents. The interviewer will listen with an open mind and ask clarifying questions to gain as close an understanding as possible of the parents' everyday life experiences with PreHomeCare and the technology. Immediately after the interviews, the mood and other impressions will be noted, and the taped interviews<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> will be transcribed verbatim.</p></sec><sec id="s2a13"><title>Data analysis of the qualitative substudies</title><p>The transcripts of the interview data will be analysed using qualitative content analysis.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> This process includes open coding in which notes and headings are written in the text and are subsequently grouped into meaning units. Codes are compared with identify differences and similarities and are then transformed into categories and subcategories. Finally, the underlying meanings will be interpreted and formed into themes, either at the manifest or the latent level. Considering the first author's background in the neonatal ward, objectivity during data analysis will be gained through an awareness of the author's preunderstanding and through critical reflections to maintain an open mind throughout the analysis process.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The supervisors, AN and HK, will be involved in the analysis and interpretation of the data.

Furthermore, it will provide insight into the factors needed to define clear goals regarding the quality of the treatment and care of premature infants in the end stages of their hospital admission/during PreHomeCare. The knowledge gained from this project is expected to be used to further develop care for premature infants. The increased effectiveness of infant care can address challenges in healthcare and help redistribute economic and professional health service resources.
