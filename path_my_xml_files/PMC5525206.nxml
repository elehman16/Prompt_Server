These complications may appear during pregnancy, birth or postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Seizures are one of the findings observed in patients with pre-eclampsia and may present in the postpartum period in approximately 2-3% of patients when magnesium sulfate (Mg) is not used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is well known that the treatment for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is the interruption of pregnancy and even more categorically so when faced with severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. If the cure for pre-eclampsia/eclampsia is the birth of the fetus and elimination of the placenta, then complications should diminish or disappear after birth; but the truth is that postpartum eclampsia occurs in varied percentages ranging from 11 to 44% of all cases of eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To avoid eclampsia during the postpartum period, Mg is used. However, there are doubts about the utility of using Mg in the postpartum period in women with severe preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. One arm of The Magpie trial (MAGnesium sulphate for Prevention of Eclampsia) did not show superiority for Mg when first used postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, the data from a randomized study showed no benefit to continuing Mg postpartum when patients with severe pre-eclampsia received more than 8&#x000a0;h (h) of Mg before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, many patients receive less than 8&#x000a0;h of Mg before birth, and the remedy is to use Mg for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This practice does not have sufficient evidence and is therefore questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. It is important to consider the secondary effects related to post-partum magnesium use as delay in patient ambulation and breast feeding; other known complications include maternal somnolence, muscular weakness and magnesium toxicity.</p><p id="Par11">The main objective of this research is to compare the benefits of Mg for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum versus 6&#x000a0;h postpartum in patients who received the drug for less than 8&#x000a0;h before birth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and study design</title><p id="Par12">A randomized, multicenter, open study was conducted between November 2013 and October 2016 in three teaching maternity hospitals in Panama.

The findings from this randomized clinical study show that maintaining Mg for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum yields similar result to receiving Mg for only 6&#x000a0;h postpartum in patients with severe pre-eclampsia who received treatment with Mg infusion for less than 8&#x000a0;h before birth. Therefore, maintaining Mg for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum in patients with severe preeclampsia who received less than 8&#x000a0;h of Mg prior to birth is no better than just maintaining Mg for 6&#x000a0;h postpartum.</p><p id="Par34">According to the results of randomized clinical studies, receiving Mg leads to an eclampsia frequency of 0.6%, with a range from 0.3 to 0.9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. That is, in patients with severe pre-eclampsia in hospitals, receiving Mg represents a seizure risk ranging from 0.3 to 0.9%. All the studies reviewed administered Mg beginning at diagnosis in the antepartum period and maintained treatment for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum; most studies start Mg during labor. Our study shows that after starting infusion and receiving treatment with Mg (4&#x000a0;g on average) for less than 8&#x000a0;h prior to birth, continuing the Mg for 24&#x000a0;h postpartum is no better than just maintaining it for 6&#x000a0;h postpartum. Interestingly, the current study does not report any cases of eclampsia, contrary to expectations. In patients treated with Mg ante- and postpartum, we expected at least two cases of eclampsia among 280 cases of severe pre-eclampsia, according to the results of the MAGPIE study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If the treatment were not adequate in the experimental group, two to three cases of eclampsia were expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The interesting result was that there were no cases of eclampsia in either the control group or experimental group. That is, the effectiveness of either strategy was 100%. However, neither of these two regimens has been strictly investigated in previous studies because only a particular group has been investigated, i.e., those patients who received low doses of Mg for very short courses before undergoing cesarean section or childbirth.</p><p id="Par35">Approximately 80% of cases of eclampsia occur during pregnancy or intrapartum, and only an average of 20% of cases occur postpartum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This timing means that our main strategy for avoiding eclampsia should focus on the pregnant woman and the moment of birth. Therefore, delivery of the fetus is the main strategy to treat eclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The two known strategies for preventing eclampsia are pregnancy discontinuation and the use of Mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Thus it seems that if we have used the minimum effective dose of Mg and we interrupt the pregnancy, then the administration of Mg postpartum is not justified. In addition, any postpartum strategy would be focused on preventing only approximately 20% of cases of eclampsia. We do not know the effective minimum dose of Mg; however, our study shows that a 4&#x000a0;g infusion plus an average of 4&#x000a0;g before birth and 6&#x000a0;g postpartum (14&#x000a0;g total) is sufficient to avoid eclampsia; 32&#x000a0;g of Mg was used in the control group.</p><p id="Par36">On the other hand, the secondary objectives such as postpartum hemorrhage, respiratory depression, need for antihypertensive drugs to control blood pressure, severe hypertension, hypertensive encephalopathy, and syncope, among others, showed no significant differences between giving Mg for 6 or 24&#x000a0;h postpartum. Possibly, the similarity between these secondary results occurs because Mg was used in both groups (14&#x000a0;g in the experimental group and 32&#x000a0;g in the control group). For all of the above outcomes, when a patient receives Mg for less than 8&#x000a0;h antepartum, maintaining it for 6&#x000a0;h is already sufficient to avoid eclampsia; however, the side effects are not increased by maintaining it for 24&#x000a0;h.</p><p id="Par37">In many hospitals around the world, as in Panama, patients receiving postpartum Mg are kept in bed for 24&#x000a0;h. In addition, this restriction makes difficult or prevents breastfeeding during this time. As expected, in this study, the group that received postpartum Mg for only 6&#x000a0;h started to ambulate significantly earlier, and they also started breastfeeding sooner. These two findings suggest a great benefit to the mother and her child. In addition, the bladder catheter is maintained for only 6&#x000a0;h. It is also more expensive to maintain Mg longer and requires additional personnel for surveillance purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par38">This study is a randomized multicenter study in a country with a high frequency of pre-eclampsia/eclampsia.

However, there was no eclampsia in the whole study population, probably because of the effectiveness of both treatments.</p><p id="Par40">In this study, there was no eclampsia, and there were no maternal deaths. Therefore, it appears that there are more benefits for the mother and her child to using postpartum Mg for only 6&#x000a0;h instead of 24&#x000a0;h in severe pre-eclampsia, provided that patients have received less than 8&#x000a0;h of Mg prior to birth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par41">Patients diagnosed with severe pre-eclampsia and treated with Mg for less than 8&#x000a0;h before birth can benefit from receiving Mg for only for 6&#x000a0;h postpartum because this treatment yields the same protection against eclampsia and also results in earlier onset of ambulation and breastfeeding. Studies with greater sample are necessary to corroborate these findings.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>HELLP</term><def><p id="Par6">Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAGPIE</term><def><p id="Par7">Magnesium sulphate for prevention of eclampsia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAG-PP</term><def><p id="Par8">Magnesium postpartum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Mg</term><def><p id="Par9">Magnesium sulfate</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par42">No funding was received for this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par43">The final analyzed dataset of this trial will be available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The conception and design of the study were developed by PV-D.
