Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) is a herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1-based oncolytic immunotherapy designed to replicate selectively in tumors and produce human granulocyte&#x02013;macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> In the randomized phase III OPTiM trial of patients with unresectable stage IIIB&#x02013;IV melanoma, intralesional T-VEC administration yielded an improvement in the primary endpoint of durable response rate (DRR; defined as a response beginning in the first 12&#x000a0;months of treatment and lasting at least 6&#x000a0;months continuously) versus subcutaneous administration of GM-CSF (16 vs. 2&#x000a0;%; odds ratio 8.9; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> Overall response rate (ORR) was 26&#x000a0;% [11&#x000a0;% complete response (CR)] in patients treated with T-VEC, and 6&#x000a0;% (1&#x000a0;% CR) in patients treated with GM-CSF. Median overall survival (OS; a secondary endpoint) in the T-VEC arm was 23.3 versus 18.9&#x000a0;months in the GM-CSF arm (hazard ratio [HR] 0.79, 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval [CI] 0.62&#x02013;1.00;&#x000a0;<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.051).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
</p><p>T-VEC may induce tumor regression both through direct lytic effects following intratumoral injection into tumors and through secondary induction of systemic antitumoral immunity in the context of virally mediated GM-CSF production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> The direct lytic effects are expected to mediate rapid tumor responses in injected lesions. Induction of systemic immunity may require more time to prime antigen-specific T cell responses, but could lead to regression of uninjected tumors harboring shared tumor-derived antigens with injected lesions. Similar dynamics of antitumor response have been proposed for other immunotherapeutic agents, such as with PD-1 pathway inhibitors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> and anti-CTLA-4 inhibitors,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> with some patients experiencing tumor progression prior to eventual regression. Thus, the onset of immune-mediated tumor responses may be delayed compared with the immediate effects of cytotoxic agents and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p><p>Since responses to T-VEC in uninjected sites were documented in some patients with melanoma in phase I and II studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref> we sought to validate, quantify, and characterize the systemic effects of T-VEC in patients in OPTiM. We compared response patterns of injected and uninjected tumors in T-VEC-treated patients and conducted an analysis of overall responses to assess whether T-VEC, as with other immunotherapies, induces delayed antitumor responses.</p><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>OPTiM Trial Design and Treatment</title><p>In this open-label, multicenter, phase III study, 436 patients with previously treated and untreated, unresected, stage IIIB&#x02013;IV melanoma were randomized 2:1 to receive intralesional T-VEC or subcutaneous GM-CSF. The primary endpoint of OPTiM was DRR; key secondary endpoints included ORR, OS, and safety. The clinical trial design, treatment, and primary results have been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> All participating sites had approval from the Institutional Review Boards or Ethics Committees, and all participants provided written, informed consent.</p><p>A treatment cycle of T-VEC consisted of two consecutive injections (5&#x000a0;weeks for the first cycle and 4&#x000a0;weeks for subsequent cycles). At each treatment session, injecting new lesions followed by larger lesions was prioritized. Visceral lesions were not allowed to be injected. Treatment continued for at least 6&#x000a0;months, during which treatment discontinuation for disease progression was not required; an increase in lesion size or appearance of new lesions was expected to occur in some patients based on the results from a phase II study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref> After 6&#x000a0;months, treatment continued until clinically significant disease progression was documented in association with a decline in performance status, intolerability, or lack of injectable lesions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>Visible or palpable lesions were evaluated by clinical evaluation (caliper or ruler) at baseline and day 1 of each treatment cycle. Deeper subcutaneous, nodal, or visceral lesions were assessed by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography/CT, and ultrasonography, if appropriate, and performed at baseline and every 12&#x000a0;weeks. Overall tumor response was determined by WHO criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> modified to allow patients who developed new lesions or increase in lesion size to be evaluated for tumor response later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref> In the event of response, any residual cutaneous pigmented areas or other residual masses had to be documented as not containing tumor by a representative biopsy. In addition, investigators were encouraged to take biopsies of residual pigmented areas or masses suspected of no longer containing the tumor at any time point during the study. A blinded independent Endpoint Assessment Committee (EAC) evaluated patients with a best response per investigator of CR or PR, or who received treatment for &#x02265;9&#x000a0;months, by reviewing photographs of all visible lesions, other imaging assessments, and biopsy results. Investigator measurements of individual lesions and assessments of response were also collected and analyzed for this report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Lesion-Level Response Analysis</title><p>Since EAC-derived measurements were only available for responders per investigator or those who had at a &#x02265;9-month treatment period, investigator-reported assessments in 291 patients treated with T-VEC (four patients randomized to T-VEC did not receive treatment) were used to evaluate response of individual lesions during treatment. The site, frequency, and location of injections were recorded at the beginning of each treatment cycle.</p><p>For this analysis, lesions were considered evaluable for response if two or more measurements were recorded at two separate time points. Evaluations of individual lesion responses were conducted using the best percentage change from baseline with a cutoff of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;% decrease in tumor lesion size. This was defined as a product of the two largest perpendicular diameters. Lesion-level response analyses were calculated based on the type of lesion: injected (recorded as having been injected), uninjected non-visceral (non-visceral lesions never recorded as having been injected), and visceral (identified by medical review of investigator-described locations of sites of the disease; per protocol, injection of these lesions was not permitted). Locations of visible or palpable tumor lesions were also assigned to a body-site grid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Progression Prior to Response Analysis</title><p>Patients randomized to the T-VEC arm who experienced a DR were evaluated for PPR, defined as the appearance of a new lesion or &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;% increase in baseline total tumor area (the sum of the products of the two largest perpendicular diameters of all index lesions at baseline). Since all data for responders per investigators were also assessed by an independent, treatment-blinded EAC, EAC-reported measurements were used for the PPR analysis. Responders by EAC were grouped as with or without PPR. Responders with PPR were further subdivided by progression in existing lesions (with or without new lesions) or with appearance of new lesions only. Responders without PPR were further divided by durable response (DR) onset at &#x02264;6&#x000a0;months from receiving initial T-VEC treatment, or DR onset after 6&#x000a0;months from receiving initial T-VEC treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Demographics and disease characteristics of T-VEC treated patients in OPTiM are shown in electronic supplementary Appendix 1.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, T-VEC administration yielded regression of &#x02265;50&#x000a0;% in 64&#x000a0;% of injected lesions (with approximately half of the injected lesions resolving completely) and in uninjected lesions (34&#x000a0;% in non-visceral and 15&#x000a0;% in visceral). Delayed tumor responses due to PPR occurred in approximately half of the T-VEC-treated patients with DRs. PPR did not appear to significantly impact the duration and quality of DRs or OS.</p><p>Local tumor lysis achieved by direct injection of T-VEC into the lesion is believed to lead to release of tumor-derived antigens, and virally encoded GM-CSF potentiates systemic antitumor immune responses. Preclinical results indicated that incorporation of GM-CSF into the oncolytic virus was important for the systemic antitumor effect of T-VEC since this resulted in increased tumor shrinkage of uninjected tumors in mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref> In a phase II study in patients with melanoma,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> an ORR of 26&#x000a0;% was reported, with responses frequently observed in uninjected lesions, including visceral lesions. Supporting evidence of the systemic effect of T-VEC came from biopsies that were taken from injected and uninjected lesions in 11 of the 50 patients treated with T-VEC. Analysis of regressing lesions, including uninjected lesions, suggested an association between response and the presence of MART-1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells, consistent with induction of host antitumor immunity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
</p><p>To further understand the systemic effects of T-VEC, we performed an analysis of the response of individual lesions from patients in the phase III OPTiM trial. Consistent with previous observations,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref> T-VEC administration resulted in responses in both injected and uninjected lesions. These individual lesion responses occurred earlier in injected lesions, likely due to the time required for a systemic immune response to be established. The systemic effects of T-VEC were unlikely due to direct exposure of uninjected lesions to the oncolytic virus from adjacent injected lesions, as responses were seen in visceral lesions and in uninjected non-visceral lesions located in different body sites than injected lesions.</p><p>Similar to other immunotherapies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> some T-VEC-treated patients experienced PPR. Nearly half of all T-VEC durable responders experienced PPR, with the majority of these progression events being due to development of new lesions. While DR occurred nearly 3&#x000a0;months earlier in patients without PPR versus those with PPR, the percentage of patients with a DR ongoing at the time of this analysis was similar in both groups. Thus, PPR did not seem to adversely impact the duration of response.</p><p>Responses after an initial increase in tumor size or appearance of new lesions have been observed in patients with melanoma treated with immunotherapies such as ipilimumab (10&#x000a0;% of treated patients who were initially characterized with disease progression),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> nivolumab (4&#x000a0;% of all treated patients),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref> and pembrolizumab (9&#x000a0;% of evaluable treated patients).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref> In addition to melanoma, PPR (pseudoprogression) was reported for other tumor types treated with checkpoint inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> Therefore, the occurrence of subsequent responses, including complete disease resolution that occurs in some patients, may justify continued treatment with immunotherapies despite early disease progression. Distinguishing true progression from pseudoprogression is likely to be a challenge with T-VEC and other immunotherapies that display delayed tumor responses due to inflammatory tumor infiltrates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
</p><p>In this study, patients with PPR relative to those without PPR had younger median age, better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, more HSV-1 seronegativity at baseline, more female patients, and more patients who received T-VEC as &#x02265;2 line of therapy. However, due to the small numbers, as well as unknown data for potential confounding characteristics (e.g. <italic>BRAF</italic> status), formal comparisons were impractical. Research in a larger cohort of patients as well as parallel efforts to find biomarkers are needed to help identify patients who may experience true progression versus pseudoprogression.</p><p>Conventional response criteria such as RECIST<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref> and WHO<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref> that rely on tumor shrinkage subsequent to treatment as an indicator of antitumor activity may underestimate the full benefit of immunotherapies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref> Immune-related response criteria, in which new lesions are incorporated into the total tumor area and disease progression criteria, and require confirmation of &#x02265;25&#x000a0;% increase in total tumor area &#x02265;4&#x000a0;weeks later, have been proposed to address distinct response patterns observed with immunotherapies, specifically disease progression followed by response.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref> The data reported here and by others<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref> provide additional support for the use of revised response criteria in evaluating immunotherapies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>T-VEC demonstrates response in injected and uninjected lesions, and represents a new first-in-class oncolytic virus immunotherapy for patients with melanoma. These data also suggest that, similar to other novel immunotherapies, more patients may have benefited from treatment with T-VEC due to the delayed nature of tumor regression. Opportunities to enhance T-VEC activity could include direct injection of visceral lesions and/or combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Early reports from a phase Ib clinical trial of T-VEC and ipilimumab suggest a response rate of 56&#x000a0;% and a CR rate of 33&#x000a0;%; a randomized phase II study is ongoing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref> Future studies will likely focus on defining the specific mechanisms by which T-VEC mediates tumor regression and the development of rational combination therapies to improve the potential of this agent for patients with cancer, in both melanoma and other tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec15"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
