Therefore, more extensive studies are required to evaluate this factor and its effects on preterm infants.</p><p>Inspecting the various recent articles, indicates that given the positive effects of oligosaccharides on gut flora, there was an idea that prebiotic supplementation can confer protection against neonatal sepsis. However, to our knowledge, none of studies have found a significant relationship. Sepsis was defined, across the studies, as blood culture being positive, regardless of clinical conditions. Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. found that in the prebiotic-supplemented group, 6 of 55 (11%) infants had &#x0003e;2 serious infectious episodes compared with 12 of 58 (21%) in the placebo group (odds ratio: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.16-1.40; <italic>P</italic> = 0.16).[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Niele <italic>et al</italic>. in a 1-year follow-up found that the incidence of sepsis/meningitis was similar among infants in prebiotic mixture and placebo groups.[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</p><p>Srinivasjois <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in a systematic review and meta-analysis of three trials involving prebiotic versus control groups, have found that late onset sepsis happened with an relative risk (RR) of 1.05 (95% CI: 0.45-2.44) in Modi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] 0.78 (95% CI: 0.53-1.16) in Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.09-1.99) in Riskin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] respectively. Despite the lack of statistical significance, Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] observed that the incidence of sepsis was lower in the prebiotic than compared with the placebo group (9 of 55 [16%] infants vs. 17 of 58 [29%] infants [RR: 0.4, 95% CI: 0.17-1.16, <italic>P</italic> = 0.10]). Also, Modi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Riskin <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] found that neonatal sepsis was lower in the prebiotic in comparison with the placebo group ([SF: 10; <sub>SC</sub>GOS/<sub>LC</sub>FOS: 9; <italic>P</italic> = 0.180]) and (L: 2 [13%]; DP: 4 [31%]; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05), although the difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>In our study, there was a trend towards lower neonatal sepsis in the prebiotic group (<italic>P</italic> - 4 [16%]; C: 17 [34%]; 1.66 [95% CI: 0.37-3.67]; <italic>P</italic> = 0.79). Accordingly, a larger cohort study, with the large sample size, is required to evaluate the actual relationship between prebiotic and neonatal sepsis in preterm infants.</p><p>Two other interesting results observed in the present study were shorter time to establish a total milk intake and shorter hospitalization period.</p><p>Perhaps, complete removal of formula in our study, was the reason that the time of reaching full feeding volume was meaningfully different between the two groups (in prebiotic group vs. control group was 11.92 &#x000b1; 2.97 vs. 14.84 &#x000b1; 5.85 with a HR 1.24 [95% CI: 5.4&#x02013;0.44]; <italic>P</italic> - 0.02). However, in other studies, attendance of formula was serious or semi-serious.</p><p>Modi <italic>et al</italic>. and Riskin <italic>et al</italic>. defined full enteral feeding volume as 150 ml/kg/day, while Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>. defined full feeds as 120 ml/kg/day. Time to full enteral feeding volume (median [range]) in prebiotic versus control group was 6 (5-8) versus 7 (6-9) days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.10 in Modi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] while Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] observed that the time required was 10 (4-48) versus 11 (7-50) days, <italic>P</italic> = 0.47. Riskin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] stated that the average time of full enteral feeding (mean &#x000b1; SD) was 41.0 &#x000b1; 32.0 versus 54.2 &#x000b1; 31.9 days, in prebiotic versus control group respectively.</p><p>With reviewing the literatures, we found only two studies that examined the relationship between prebiotics and length of hospital stay, where no difference was found between the two study groups.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>Another feature which many studies have examined was weight gain or weight at discharge. Indrio <italic>et al</italic>. found a weight gain per day of 34.90 &#x000b1; 6.90 versus 34.60 &#x000b1; 9.46 g in prebiotic versus control group.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Kapiki <italic>et al</italic>. reported 22.8 &#x000b1; 6.0 versus 27.4 &#x000b1; 7.0 g/day in prebiotic versus control group.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Moreover, Riskin <italic>et al</italic>. shown that weight at discharge had a mean &#x000b1; SD of 2567 &#x000b1; 355 versus 2846 &#x000b1; 667 g.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] None of the above studies showed any statistically meaningful difference between the prebiotic and control groups. Also in other studies, such as Mihatsch <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Modi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and Westerbeek <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] no significant difference between the two groups was reported.</p><p>In our study, average body weights at 30 days of life in prebiotic and control group was 1702.80 &#x000b1; 325.42 g. and 1542.40 &#x000b1; 270.67 g, respectively (<italic>P</italic> - 0.06). The result is in line with the all those of all the above studies.</p><p>The strengths of the study include the RCT design in high risk neonates (i.e., VLBW infants) and the complete removal of formula. This study has some limitations. The major limitation of this study could be the rather small number of the infants included (75 premature neonates), even though the results clearly indicated a significant difference between the prebiotic and control groups. Another limitation of this study was that Supply of Prebiotics in our country was very difficult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Enteral supplementation with prebiotic significantly reduced the incidence of NEC in VLBW infants who were fed exclusively breast-milk. This finding suggests that it might have been the complete removal of formula which caused a synergistic effect between nonhuman neutral oligosaccharides (prebiotic) and human oligosaccharides, which, in turn, reduced the incidence of NEC and decreased the time to full enteral feed as well as the hospitalization time. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to investigate the issue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank the medical and nursing team of the NICU of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and the two participating hospitals.
