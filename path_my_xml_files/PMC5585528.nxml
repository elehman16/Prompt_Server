Desflurane has faster emergence with a comparable incidence of emergence agitation compared with sevoflurane and isoflurane, even in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> However, its pungency can provoke airway irritation, causing secretions, breath-holding, cough, and laryngospasm.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Therefore, desflurane is contraindicated for inhalation induction in children and infants. The use of desflurane is considered safe in terms of airway irritability only with an endotracheal tube and during anesthesia maintenance.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>The manufacturer has warned that children, particularly those aged 6 years or younger, who are under anesthetic maintenance with desflurane delivered via an laryngeal mask airway (LMA), are at an increased risk for adverse respiratory reactions based on the report of Lerman et al. This study reported the incidence and severity of adverse airway events was higher in children under anesthetic maintenance with desflurane, via an LMA or a facemask, than in those under isoflurane anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the Pediatric Advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that desflurane labeling be &#x0201c;revised to clearly state that the use of maintenance of non-intubated pediatric patients be contraindicated.&#x0201d;<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>Nevertheless, there is increasing evidence that desflurane has a similar incidence of respiratory events as sevoflurane when both are given via an LMA. A retrospective investigation revealed that desflurane did not increase the risk of respiratory events in children with LMA.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Also, a meta-analysis by Stevanovic et al<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> concluded that, in adults, there is no difference in adverse upper airway events between anesthesia achieved with desflurane via an LMA, sevoflurane, isoflurane, or propofol anesthesia. However, no randomized controlled study has compared desflurane and sevoflurane use in children aged 6 years or younger, via an LMA, in terms of airway events.</p><p>Therefore, this randomized controlled trial compared the respiratory events and emergence characteristics of desflurane versus sevoflurane during ambulatory anesthesia, via an LMA, in children. The primary outcome was the overall incidence of respiratory adverse events, and the secondary outcomes were the emergence time and incidence of emergence agitation according to inhalation agents.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This study used a double-blind, randomized controlled, parallel group design and was conducted at a tertiary care children's hospital. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Seoul National University Hospital (Ref. H-1504-116-668) and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (Ref. NCT02470442) on June 8, 2015. The first participant was enrolled on June 25, 2015. After obtaining written informed consent from the children's parents, the study enrolled 200 pediatric patients from 2 to 6 years of age who underwent general anesthesia for strabismus surgery from June 2015 to February 2016. We excluded patients who had an upper respiratory infection (URI) within the previous 2 weeks, any respiratory disease, known susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia, or a history of moderate-to-severe hepatic dysfunction following anesthesia with desflurane not otherwise explained.</p><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study protocol</title><p>We randomly allocated the pediatric patients to 1 of 2 parallel groups (1:1 allocation) using website-based randomization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.org/">www.randomization.org</ext-link>). The random permuted block method with a block size of 4 was used. A trained researcher generated the random allocation sequence, prepared sealed opaque envelope, opened an envelope immediately before the start of anesthesia, and assigned participants to the trial groups (S group, sevoflurane maintenance anesthesia; D group, desflurane maintenance anesthesia). Although the anesthesiologists assigned to the intervention group were aware of the group allocation, the patients, data analysts, and outcome assessors were blinded to the allocation. Standard monitoring with noninvasive blood pressure, electrocardiography, and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was performed. Anesthesia was induced with 5&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> thiopental sodium, atropine 0.01&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, and 6 to 8 vol% sevoflurane under 100% O<sub>2</sub> mask ventilation, followed by 0.3&#x0200a;mg&#x0200a;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> rocuronium to facilitate LMA placement. The Flexible LMA and standard insertion technique was used. Opioids were not administered in any patient. Immediately after the anesthetic induction, the inhalation agent was switched depending on the group allocation. Anesthesia was maintained with 2 to 3 vol% sevoflurane using an oxygen/air mixture in the S group and 7 to 8 vol% desflurane using an oxygen/air mixture in the D group. The minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) during the maintenance period was 0.8 to 1.2 MAC in both groups, as determined by the child's age.</p><p>All surgical procedures for strabismus in this study were performed by 1 surgeon. Before the end of surgery, the inhalation agents were slowly decreased and discontinued, 100% oxygen with 6 L/min was administered. Neostigmine and atropine were administered after confirming 4 twitches on train-of-4 stimulation to facilitate the recovery of residual muscular blockage, and the LMA was removed in the operating room after confirming that the child was fully awake (i.e., the grimacing, regular respiration, gag reflex, and purposeful movement of the extremities). Then, the child was monitored in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) until the modified Aldrete score reached 8.</p><p>A blinded investigator recorded perioperative events in the operating room. A blinded nurse recorded any adverse events and emergence agitation during recovery in the PACU until discharge.</p><p>The primary outcome was the overall number of respiratory adverse events during maintenance anesthesia and emergence. The events included breath-holding (&#x0003e; 15&#x0200a;s), bronchospasm (bilateral wheezing), coughing, laryngospasm, secretions (require suctioning), mild desaturation (90% &#x02264; SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 97% that lasted for &#x0003e; 15&#x0200a;s), and severe desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 90% that lasted for &#x0003e; 15&#x0200a;s). The secondary outcomes were the emergence time (the time interval between discontinuation of inhaled anesthetics and LMA removal after confirming the awake state of children), recovery time (the PACU stay time), and emergence agitation. Emergence agitation was evaluated at 15&#x0200a;minutes after admission to the PACU using the 4-point agitation scale for emergence delirium, on which emergence delirium is defined by a score of 3 or 4 at any time (1, calm; 2, not calm but could be easily calmed; 3, not easily calmed, moderately agitated, restless; and 4, excited or disoriented).<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> The scale is simple to use and provides a meaningful and clear end point for the dichotomous outcome of emergence agitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data on patient characteristics are presented as means&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;SD, medians (range), or absolute numbers as appropriate.

We calculated the sample size based on a study by Saros et al.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> They reported that respiratory complications occurred in 14% (5/35) and 2% (1/35) of their desflurane and sevoflurane groups, respectively. With an &#x003b1;-error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, considering an attrition rate of 10%, a total sample of 200 patients was required to detect a difference in the incidence of overall respiratory adverse events between groups. Differences between the S and D groups were evaluated using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as appropriate.

Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> provides details of the respiratory adverse events. The incidence of coughing, secretion, breath-holding, and laryngospasm was similar in both groups. No patient developed bronchospasm during emergence. However, the incidence of mild desaturation (90% &#x02264; SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c; 97%) was significantly higher in the D group. The cause of mild desaturation (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7 in the D group) was breath-holding and coughing. All patients (i.e., in both groups) who experienced laryngospasm eventually developed desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> range: 77&#x02013;89%). The duration of desaturation did not exceed 30 seconds; all patients recovered promptly with an oxygen supply, stimulation of the laryngospasm notch, and positive airway pressure. None of the cases of laryngospasm had any negative outcome. Of the 5 children who experienced laryngospasm, 4 were aged &#x0003c;3 years, and the other was a 5-year-old child in the D group. The incidence of laryngospasm was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.0217) in the patients aged under 3 years (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48), compared with the older pediatric patients (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;152) with a relative risk of 12.6 and 95% CI 1.45&#x02013;110.62.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The detailed incidence of respiratory adverse events during emergence.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7977-g002"/></table-wrap><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> shows the emergence characteristics of both groups.

The incidence of emergence delirium in the PACU was comparable in the 2 groups (52% and 51% in the S and D groups, respectively).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Emergence and recovery characteristics.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7977-g003"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, desflurane anesthesia following sevoflurane induction had a similar incidence of overall respiratory adverse events. In addition, desflurane anesthesia following sevoflurane induction showed slightly faster emergence and a comparable incidence of emergence delirium to that of sevoflurane anesthesia.</p><p>We assumed that the less airway irritability of LMA counteracts the effect of the desflurane on airway irritability when using the maintenance of anesthesia. A meta-analysis of LMA usage in pediatric anesthesia concluded that the incidence of desaturation, laryngospasm, cough, and breath-holding during recovery from anesthesia was lower than with tracheal intubation.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Even in pediatric patients with an upper respiratory infection which may increase the airway resistance, the LMA usage considered feasible alternative to the tracheal tube.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>It should be noted, however, that the degree of airway irritability due to inhalation agents differs between normal and susceptible airways.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Known risk factors for perioperative respiratory adverse events include a history of recent URI, age less than 6 years,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and airway surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> We controlled these variables by limiting the age of the children (2&#x02013;6 years old) and excluding morbid patients. Interestingly, 4 of the 5 patients who developed laryngospasm were small children aged 2 to 3 years old. Perioperative respiratory adverse events during pediatric ambulatory anesthesia are increased in children younger than 3 years regardless of the anesthetic regimen, such as LMA or desflurane anesthetics.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the interpretation of our results must specifically consider the patient age. In this prospective study, less than half of the patients were aged 2 to 3 years. Accordingly, we emphasize meticulous attention when using desflurane maintenance anesthesia with an LMA in pediatric patients aged &#x02264; 3 years.</p><p>The secondary outcomes of this study were the emergence time and incidence of emergence agitation according to the inhalation agent. Desflurane maintenance anesthesia resulted in faster emergence from anesthesia. However, faster emergence does not guarantee fast recovery and hospital discharge. Some authors concluded that faster emergence from anesthesia is associated with a higher incidence of postoperative agitation and even a delay in recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, in this study, desflurane during maintenance anesthesia shortened the emergence time but was similar to sevoflurane with respect to emergence agitation and recovery time.</p><p>We examined whether the incidence of emergence agitation changes when different anesthetics are used to control contributing or confounding factors, such as pain intensity and surgical time, by enrolling children undergoing the same surgery for strabismus performed by a single operator. We found no difference in the incidence of emergence agitation between sevoflurane and desflurane. Consistent with our results, a systematic review of risk factors for emergence agitation showed that there is no difference in emergence agitation according to the inhalation agent.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> However, the incidence of emergence agitation with both agents was very high in this study. Emergence agitation may affect the postoperative course,<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> and a multimodal approach to reducing the emergence agitation is needed.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup></p><p>We should consider many factors when we choose an inhalation agent for anesthesia, including drug effectiveness, patient safety, costs, and environmental impact.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> The operating room is a major source of perioperative costs and the anesthesiologist can affect the efficiency of the operating room by choosing anesthetic options that are cost-effective, safe, and facilitate rapid emergence.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Clinicians must consider the risks and benefits of desflurane anesthesia with an LMA in children. Careful patient selection and an optimal anesthetic technique are required.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, the sample size was calculated based on the study performed in adult population under self-respiration. However, considering of adverse respiratory events in 2 groups (39% vs 41%) in this study, our study was under-powered to draw conclusions. Second, we used a muscle relaxant in all patients during the induction and maintenance of anesthesia, so the generalizability of our findings in patients with spontaneous ventilation supported by an LMA requires confirmation. Also, the muscle relaxant could increase the perioperative respiratory adverse events, especially after short surgical procedure. Third, our study population comprised children with normal airways and 111 of the 200 patients were aged &#x0003e; 3 years. Therefore, our results should be applied to the younger high-risk group carefully. Fourth, exposure to sevoflurane in both groups during the induction of anesthesia could have influenced the results. Lastly, the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium scale is currently regarded as the standard evaluation tool for emergence agitation, but there is no consensus regarding an appropriate cut off for the presence of emergence agitation.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The scoring system also includes an evaluation of &#x0201c;eye contact,&#x0201d; which cannot not be assessed in pediatric patients undergoing strabismus surgery. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether emergence agitation is present by using Aono's 4-point scale.</p><p>In conclusion, desflurane maintenance anesthesia in children with an LMA might be a possible alternative to sevoflurane during ambulatory anesthesia with respect to the rapid emergence and similar incidence of overall respiratory adverse events. However, anesthesiologists should pay more attention to desaturation during emergence when using LMAs with desflurane especially in small children younger than 3 years.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval, LMA = laryngeal mask airway, MAC = minimum alveolar concentration, PACU = postanesthesia care unit, SpO<sub>2</sub> = peripheral oxygen saturation, URI = upper respiratory infection.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p> The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lerman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammer</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Verghese</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
