Anticoagulants are the first choice for preventing cerebral infarction associated with atrial fibrillation, transient cerebral ischaemic attack, and other such cardiogenic cerebral embolisms. Warfarin and heparin have long been known to serve this purpose, but other, novel oral anticoagulants have been used since 2011. One of these is apixaban, the use of which has been on the rise due to its low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and rapid onset of effects.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society (JGES) guidelines published in 2012,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is indicated for colon tumours based on high haemorrhagic risk of the procedure. Moreover, the guidelines deem heparin substitution followed by withdrawal,-that is, heparin bridging-to be necessary for patients taking oral anticoagulants. However, heparin bridging also faces problems: postoperative bleeding is reportedly significantly more common when it is used than when it is not,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and it results in longer hospital stays. There are several reports on the risk of heparin bridging in Western countries.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> Birnie <italic>et al</italic> reported that heparin replacement did not decrease embolic events in patients who underwent insertion surgeries of pacemaker or implantable cardioverter&#x000a0;defibrillator (ICD), while raising the incidence of device&#x000a0;pocket haematoma.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, Douketis <italic>et al</italic> reported that heparin replacement during a palliative surgery did not decrease thromboembolic events and increased the risk of major bleeding.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> However, there is no clinical trial that examined heparin bridging at EMR. Apixaban is considered to have a low risk of gastrointestinal bleeding among direct oral anticoagulants.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;9</xref> In addition, since the maximum plasma concentration reaching time is 3&#x02013;3.5&#x02009;hours and the elimination half-life is 6&#x02013;8&#x02009;hours, it is unnecessary to administer heparin at the resumption and the risk of postoperative bleeding is considered to be low. Apixaban substitution is an alternative treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation taking oral warfarin at high risk of stroke: this perioperative procedure could result in lower proportion of postoperative bleeding and shorten hospital stay length following colon EMR.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study objectives</title><p>This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of warfarin replacement with apixaban without postoperative resumption of heparin with that of conventional heparin bridging in patients taking warfarin and scheduled to undergo EMR: specifically, by checking for reduction in proportion of postoperative bleeding following EMR.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, open-label, randomised, parallel-group, controlled intervention study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Entire design of this trail.&#x000a0;EMR,&#x000a0;endoscopic mucosal resection; PT-INR, prothrombin time-international normalised ratio.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjgast-2017-000152f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Participating centres</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Osaka National Hospital</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Kure Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Tokyo Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Mie Chuo Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Disaster Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Hakodate National Hospital</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Cancer Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Kanazawa Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Tsuruga Medical Center</p></list-item><list-item><p>National Hospital Organization Higashihiroshima Medical Center</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study population</title><p>Hypothesis is superiority of apixaban regimen group to warfarin group in reducing the proportion of postoperative bleeding.

Patients are discontinued from warfarin and put on heparin on hospitalisation, 5&#x02009;days before treatment. Any oral antiplatelet drugs being taken are suspended 1&#x02009;day before treatment (3&#x02009;days before if the drug is aspirin, and 5&#x02009;days before if the drug is a thienopyridine derivative). However, patients who cannot discontinue their antiplatelet regimen are allowed to proceed in the cases of oral administration of aspirin and/or cilostazol. Regimens consisting of multiple oral antiplatelet drugs are replaced with an aspirin or cilostazol regimen. On the day of the operation, EMR is performed 6&#x02009;hours after suspension of intravenous heparin administration. Heparin administration is resumed 3&#x02009;hours after treatment. Patients resume oral warfarin at their preoperative dose the next day, once doctors confirm the absence of postoperative bleeding. Oral antiplatelet drugs discontinued prior to EMR are resumed at the same time as warfarin. PT-INR is monitored as appropriate; heparin administration is discontinued and the patient discharged once it reaches the therapeutic range (2.0&#x02013;3.0). Each heparin regimen is begun at a dose of 10&#x02009;000 units/day, and calibrated so that the patient&#x02019;s activated partial thromboplastin time reaches 2.0 times its baseline value.</p><p>Experimental treatment group (B group): Patients are discontinued from warfarin 14 days before treatment, and started on apixaban once their PT-INR drops to&#x000a0;&#x02265;2.0.

However, patients who cannot discontinue their antiplatelet regimen are allowed to proceed in the cases of oral aspirin and/or cilostazol. Regimens consisting of multiple oral antiplatelet drugs are replaced with an aspirin or cilostazol regimen. Patients are hospitalised the day before treatment, and discontinued from apixaban that evening. EMR is performed the following day. Oral apixaban is resumed and the patient discharged once doctors confirm the absence of postoperative bleeding the morning after EMR. Oral antiplatelet drugs discontinued prior to EMR are resumed at the same time as apixaban.</p><p>Patients in both groups have an outpatient consultation 28 days after treatment to check for postoperative bleeding.

Gastrointestinal bleeding is rare in such patients who undergo therapeutic endoscopy. Doctors who suspend a patient&#x02019;s anticoagulant therapy due to excess concern over gastrointestinal bleeding instead increase their risk of cerebral infarction, embolism, and other such serious events. Thus, both suspension and continuation of anticoagulant therapy can cause serious illness, leading to increases in hospitalisation and treatment costs. Heparin bridging is currently considered the standard treatment prior to therapeutic endoscopy for patients taking oral warfarin; however, higher proportion of postoperative bleeding and longer hospital stays associated with heparin bridging have also brought increases in hospitalisation costs and treatment costs. There are several reports on the risk of heparin bridging.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> However, since there is no clinical trial that examined heparin bridging at EMR, we believe that this trial is important. This study seeks to establish a procedure that presents lower risks of haemorrhage, thrombosis, and embolism, and which could lower medical costs by reducing the length of hospital stays. Assessing the effects and risks of apixaban&#x02019;s use in therapeutic endoscopy for patients receiving anticoagulant therapies could also lead to safer and more&#x000a0;effective ways of managing anticoagulant therapies. The paucity of reports with high evidence levels was considered problematic when the JGES gastroenterological endoscopy guidelines were revised in 2012. The results of this trial will have clinical significance, as its data could serve as the basis for revisions in the next edition of the guidelines.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> TY participated in the design of the study.
