However, the healthy young population also engages in drug use to enhance cognition as is illustrated by the abundant illicit use of drugs that are normally prescribed for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) including methylphenidate (Ritalin) and other amphetaminelike stimulants, which are believed to improve cognitive performance (Greely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008b</xref>; Maher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). This has raised concern regarding the ethical and safety aspects of potential cognition-enhancing drugs (Greely et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008a</xref>; Larriviere et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2009</xref>; Sahakian and Morein-Zamir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). These issues aside, it is important to know if these drugs do actually have cognition-enhancing effects in healthy subjects.</p><p>Methylphenidate inhibits the reuptake of the catecholamines dopamine and noradrenaline by blocking the transporters and thus, enhances catecholamine availability (Hannestad et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>). Methylphenidate treatment does not only reduce behavioral symptoms in children with ADHD but also improves their cognitive function (Pietrzak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>). There are also observations of methylphenidate-induced cognition enhancement in healthy adults (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>), although studies in this area are relatively sparse.</p><p>Previous studies on the effects of methylphenidate on cognitive function in healthy volunteers have mainly focused on cognitive domains which are known to be affected in ADHD or to involve dopaminergic action. These include attention, response inhibition, planning and (working) memory (Cools and Robbins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Luciana and Collins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1997</xref>; Luciana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1992</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1999</xref>; Pietrzak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>). One aspect of attention studied in healthy volunteers is divided attention. Methylphenidate has been observed to improve performance on a divided attention task, in which participants have to track a moving target with a joystick and simultaneously press a button in response to the appearance of a visual stimulus (Bishop et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1997</xref>; Roehrs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>). These effects were most prominent when participants were sleep-deprived.</p><p>Attentional control has been assessed in healthy volunteers using an intradimensional/extradimensional shift task, which requires participants to make visual discriminations while stimulus characteristics vary along different dimensions and the relevant dimension reverses between different task stages (Rogers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1999</xref>). Although Elliott et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>) found no effect of methylphenidate on this task, Rogers et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1999</xref>) observed an enhanced ability to reallocate attention towards newly relevant features of environmental stimuli after methylphenidate.</p><p>Response inhibition, as assessed in a Go&#x02013;NoGo task has been shown to improve with methylphenidate in older adults (Ben-Itzhak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>). Planning is also observed to be affected by methylphenidate in healthy adults. In two versions of the Tower of London task, enhanced performance was observed when methylphenidate was administered in the first of two sessions as opposed to impaired performance when the drug was taken in the second session (and placebo in the first, (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>)). Elliott et al. explain this result hypothesizing that methylphenidate enhances performance on novel tasks but impairs performance on familiar tasks.</p><p>There are several reports of improved performance on both nonspatial and spatial working memory tasks after methylphenidate administration in healthy adults. For example, methylphenidate enhances performance on the Sternberg memory scanning task, in which participants are asked to judge whether probe letters were in the memory set that was learned at the beginning of the task (Brumaghim and Klorman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1998</xref>; Fitzpatrick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1988</xref>). Improvement of spatial working memory has been observed within a self-ordered search task in which participants search for tokens in an array of boxes displayed on a computer screen (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>).</p><p>Besides the domains described above, few researchers have studied the influence of methylphenidate on immediate and delayed recall of word lists (Bray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>; Camp-Bruno and Herting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>; Hermens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>), none of whom found a significant effect. This is surprising as methylphenidate is known to enhance delayed recall of word lists in ADHD (Evans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1986</xref>). The pharmacologically similar compound amphetamine has shown to improve consolidation and retention of word lists while leaving acquisition unaffected (Advokat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2010</xref>). Experiments from Soetens and Zeeuws (Soetens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1993</xref>; Zeeuws and Soetens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>) have shown that amphetamine facilitates verbal memory recall if it is active in the brain during the consolidation phase (Soetens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1995</xref>). Additional experiments showed that the effect increases with longer presentation time of the words, lasts at least 3&#x000a0;days, is independent of retrieval and generalizes to recognition (Soetens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1995</xref>; Zeeuws et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>; Zeeuws and Soetens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, task procedures used by Soetens and Zeeuws were rather different from those used in the methylphenidate studies cited above. Hermens et al., Kuypers and Ramaekers and Bray et al. used word lists containing only 12 or 15 items. In combination with repeated presentations (three or four times), this may have led to a ceiling effect in performance. In line with this notion, using lists of 24 easy nouns that were presented only once, Camp-Bruno and Herting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>) did observe improved performance in both immediate and delayed recall, although this effect was not significant.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to find out whether enhanced word recall could be observed after methylphenidate with a more optimal experimental design. In order to avoid possible ceiling effects suspected to have influenced the studies mentioned above, a 30-word learning test was used in the current study. Performance on the 30 word lists of the visual verbal learning task was tested in 19 healthy volunteers after 10, 20 or 40&#x000a0;mg of methylphenidate and placebo. To get a more complete view of methylphenidate&#x02019;s cognitive effects, not only extending previous findings but also putting current effects of methylphenidate on word learning into perspective, additional cognitive tasks were administered. These additional tasks were carefully selected to represent the most relevant cognitive domains, both with respect to the most common clinical application of methylphenidate (i.e., treatment of ADHD) and dopaminergic involvement. Hence, we included tasks assessing attention, response inhibition, planning and working memory.</p><p>The design of the current study, using three different doses of methylphenidate in a placebo-controlled within-subjects experiment allows examination of the a dose&#x02013;response relationship for this drug and its effect on cognition. It addresses some methodological issues observed in other studies using only a single dose or comparing different doses in parallel groups (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>). Dose-related effects of moderate to high doses of methylphenidate on memory consolidation were expected to be reflected by better delayed recall. Performance on the other tasks was also expected to improve after moderate to high doses of methylphenidate. Based on the effect of methylphenidate on psychomotor function, it was expected that improved performance on these tasks may mainly be reflected by faster response times.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen healthy male volunteers (mean age =23.4, SD =5.4, range =19&#x02013;37) were selected and paid to participate.

The main exclusion criteria were history or presence of mental or physical disorders, consumption of more than 21 alcohol units per week or more than five caffeine-containing drinks per day. In addition, volunteers with polymorphisms of the <italic>CES1</italic> gene indicative of being a poor metabolizer of methylphenidate were excluded.

Between the testing days, a period of at least 48&#x000a0;h elapsed, but generally, testing days were scheduled approximately 1&#x000a0;week apart. Each participant received one of four single treatments including placebo (PLA) and 10, 20 and 40&#x000a0;mg methylphenidate (M10, M20 and M40) on each testing day. The order of the treatments was randomized following a Williams Latin Square design resulting in four different sequences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Visual verbal learning test</title><p>This task is an adapted version of Rey&#x02019;s Auditory Verbal Learning Test (Lezak <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1995</xref>). The VVLT was used to measure declarative memory. It included 30 words that were presented on a computer screen (stimulus presentation time and interstimulus interval were 1,000&#x000a0;ms, (Klaassen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>)). This presentation was repeated three times using the same sequence of words, each time followed by immediate free recall of all remembered words. Thirty minutes after immediate free recall of the final series, participants were subjected to a delayed recall test and a recognition test. During the latter, 30 words were presented, 15 of which were previously presented and another 15 that were new. Outcome measures of the immediate and delayed recall tests were total number of correctly recalled words during immediate recall (summed over three trials) and number of correctly recalled words during delayed recall. The dependent measures of the recognition test were median reaction time, measured in milliseconds and sensitivity (<italic>A</italic>&#x02019;). <italic>A</italic>&#x02019; is calculated as follows: <inline-formula id="IEq1"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

In this task, participants were required to relocate ten visual stimuli (small drawings of objects such as a car or a flower) that were presented on a computer screen in a 15-cm<sup>2</sup> sized square to their original location. The task consisted of two parts. In the first part, called &#x02018;object to position&#x02019; or OTP, participants had 15&#x000a0;s time to memorize the locations of the objects and were asked to drag the objects to the correct positions, which were cued with black dots. In the second part, the combined (COM) part, participants had 30&#x000a0;s to memorize the locations and this time, there were no cues to indicate the previous positions. Participants were instructed to place the objects in their original position as accurately as possible. In both parts, there was no time limit for the relocation of the stimuli. The dependent variables were percentage correct for OTP and percentage correct, absolute error and positional fit for COM. In the COM part, percentage correct was calculated such that relocation would be correct when the object was placed within 20&#x000a0;mm from the original location. Absolute error was the absolute distance in millimeters an object was relocated away from its original position. Positional fit measured the ability to remember the locations per se, independent from the ability to remember which object was in each location and computed as the best fit score yielding the smallest distance error for the stimulus as a whole.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Set shifting task</title><p>The set shifting task used in this study combined the methods of M&#x000fc;ller and Townsend (Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>; Townsend et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). The task measured cognitive flexibility and the influence of reward. Participants were presented with a stream of auditory and visual stimuli including light and dark blue squares on a computer screen and high and low tones through headphones (stimulus presentation time was 150&#x000a0;ms and interstimulus interval was 850&#x000a0;ms). Assignments so as to respond to the tones (&#x02018;Hear trials&#x02019;) or the squares (&#x02018;Look&#x02019; trials) were interspersed with the stimuli and presented for 1,000&#x000a0;ms. Participants were told to respond only to the dark blue square and the high tones, while ignoring the light blue squares and low tones. In half of the trials, a &#x02018;&#x020ac;&#x02019; sign on the computer screen indicated that if they would perform very well (correct and fast responses), they would earn an additional monetary reward (awarded to the best performer in the study). The experiment contained six blocks, of which three were &#x02018;reward blocks&#x02019; and three were &#x02018;nonreward blocks&#x02019;. Each block contained 56 stimuli and switching occurred after a variable number of trials, ranging between five and nine trials. The sequence of blocks was randomized between participants and sessions. After a block containing the reward stimuli, the participants received feedback on how well they performed. Participants were expected to respond faster in the reward than in the control conditions. Dependent measures were response times in correct trials and percentage of correct responses. These were calculated separately for the four different trial types: Look in the reward blocks; Look in the nonreward blocks; Hear in the reward blocks; and Hear in the nonreward blocks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Stop signal task</title><p>The stop signal task was used to measure motor impulsivity and adapted from that used by Fillmore and Rush (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2002</xref>). In this task, participants were required to respond to go signals and inhibit the response when a stop signal was presented. On a computer screen, the go signals were visually presented letters, A, B, C and D (stimuli were presented for 500&#x000a0;ms or until the participant responded; interstimulus interval was 1,500&#x000a0;ms). The stop signal was the visual presentation of a &#x02018;*&#x02019;at one of the corners of the screen. Participants were instructed to respond as fast as possible with left (to A and C) and right (to B and D) index fingers. Stop signals were presented at delays of 50, 150, 250, and 350&#x000a0;ms. A single test consisted of 176 trials in which each of the four-letter stimuli was presented equally often. A stop signal occurred in 48 trials during a test. Dependent variables were the proportion of commission errors on stop trials and the reaction times on go and stop-signal trials (i.e., stop reaction time). Reaction time to stop-signal trials represented the estimated mean time required to inhibit a response. The method for calculating stop reaction time was taken from the race model of inhibitory control (Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1994</xref>). Stop reaction time was calculated by subtracting the stop-signal delay from the reaction time on go trials associated with the <italic>n</italic>th percentile of the reaction time distribution. The <italic>n</italic>th percentile corresponds to the percentage of commission errors (Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1994</xref>; Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Tower of London</title><p>Planning ability was assessed by a computerized version of the Tower of London task (Sobczak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2002</xref>). On a computer screen, two arrays of differently colored balls (red, yellow and blue) on sticks were presented until the subject responded. The subject was requested to indicate the minimal number of steps necessary to rearrange the balls on the lower configuration to match the arrangement presented on the top half of the screen. The subjects had to count the number of moves and then respond by pressing the appropriate response button (two to six steps) as quickly as possible. The complexity of the task was dependent on the minimal number of steps in which the rearrangement could be achieved: two, three, four and five steps and sometimes six steps, to avoid guessing (only two to five are analyzed). Performance was indicated by the slope coefficient of the linear regression of the median response time as a function of the number of steps. In addition, percentage correct and response time calculated per number of minimally required steps were taken into account.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Procedure</title><p>The current study was integrated in a larger study on the effects of methylphenidate on the Contingent Negative Variation (Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). A training session in which the tasks were practiced took place within 2&#x000a0;weeks before the first testing day. Participants abstained from alcohol during the last 24&#x000a0;h prior to each testing day. On testing days, they were collected at their home and arrived at the lab in fasted condition at either 8.00&#x000a0;am or 8:30&#x000a0;am. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were checked. Next, participants were given a standardized meal for breakfast at 80&#x000a0;min predose (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;80). At <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;30, stop signal, set shifting and spatial working memory tests were administered to get a baseline measurement. At <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 participants ingested four capsules with water, which contained either PLA, M10, M20 or M40.

Because one subject dropped out, there was a minimal deviation from complete balancing of treatment orders (order 1 = PLA, M10, M20, M40 (five participants), order 2 = M10, M40, PLA, M20 (five participants), order 3 = M20, PLA, M40, M10 (four participants) and order 4 = M40, M20, M10, PLA (five participants)). For this reason, treatment order was entered as a between-subjects factor. Since treatment consisted of different doses of the same drug, main effects of the drug were not evaluated.

Methylphenidate improved delayed recall of word lists. In addition, set shifting and stop signal test performance improved after methylphenidate. Methylphenidate had little effect on the Tower of London task performance and no effect on performance of the spatial working memory task.</p><p>Based on earlier findings of enhanced declarative memory consolidation after amphetamine, it was expected that methylphenidate would improve performance on the 30-word learning test. Results of the current study confirmed this expectation. Participants recalled more words in the delayed recall test after 20 and 40&#x000a0;mg of methylphenidate compared to placebo. Since no improvement was observed at immediate recall, enhanced delayed recall is likely caused by better consolidation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report better consolidation of word lists after methylphenidate in healthy adults. Since previous studies used similar doses (20 or 45&#x000a0;mg), suboptimal dosing is an unlikely explanation for the lack of performance-enhancing effects in those studies. An important factor may be word list length. When testing memory in healthy volunteers, a ceiling effect is easily reached if relatively short lists are presented repeatedly. Since it was hypothesized that enhanced dopamine activity induced by methylphenidate may lead to improved word learning test performance, the use of lists of 12 to 15 words in previous studies (Bray et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>; Hermens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2007</xref>; Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>) may have left no room for improvement.</p><p>There are ample indications of dopamine involvement in (spatial) working memory (Ellis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Landau et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>; Robbins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005</xref>). Indeed, methylphenidate has been shown to improve spatial working memory performance (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>). This effect was, however, not replicated in the present study. A possibly important difference between the self-ordered search tasks used in previous studies and the spatial working memory task used here is that encoding of spatial locations occurs under time pressure in the current task. Previous research has suggested that methylphenidate may induce activity and arousal in healthy volunteers (Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1986</xref>; Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>). Hence, participants may have had difficulties to encode information due to overarousal.</p><p>Methylphenidate generally improved performance of the set shifting task, as was indicated by both faster responses and a higher percentage of correct responses. Most effects were observed on the hear trials, suggesting that methylphenidate affected auditory attention more than visual attention. It is unclear why this should be the case. Our expectation that the effect of methylphenidate would be more pronounced in the reward parts of this task was not confirmed. Participants may not have paid attention to the &#x02018;&#x020ac;&#x02019; sign, which indicated that they were in the reward condition.</p><p>Methylphenidate improved stop signal task performance as was indicated mainly by faster responses. Effects were most prominent in the go trials. Faster responses (both in the set shifting and the stop signal task) may partly reflect the response readiness-enhancing effect of methylphenidate (Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>) increasing the speed of performance (Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>). Furthermore, taking into account the relatively high number of statistical comparisons being made in this study, some of the effects reported here including those on the Tower of London task may not be genuine drug effects. Therefore, the overall pattern of results was considered when describing drug effects. Thus, generally, MPH improved measures of declarative memory, attention and response inhibition.</p><p>The effects of methylphenidate were observed within a rather wide time window, between 90 and 270&#x000a0;min after drug intake. This likely reflects a relatively long lasting enhancement of dopamine levels in the blood after methylphenidate. Blood dopamine levels cannot be measured directly, but changes in prolactin level in blood are a good surrogate marker, since the prolactin level is known to rise as the dopamine level decreases and vice versa (Ben-Jonathan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1985</xref>). Indeed, prolactin levels were decreased between 60 and 240&#x000a0;min after methylphenidate administration in this group of participants (Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>).</p><p>Most studies into effects of dopaminergic drugs on aspects of cognitive performance describe results according to an inverted U curve when performance is mapped as a function of degree of neurotransmitter activity (Levy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>; Mehta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>). The design of the present study, using three doses of methylphenidate, the highest of which corresponds to 75% blocking of dopamine reuptake sites (Volkow et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>) should allow to reveal the inverted U curve, if present. This would be reflected by improved performance at low and intermediate dosing levels and a drop in performance enhancement at the higher dose. However, the current findings suggest that methylphenidate influences memory consolidation in a monotonic positive fashion. Although dose&#x02013;response relationships may differ between cognitive domains, it has been shown that methylphenidate effects on response readiness cannot also be described in terms of the inverted U function (Linssen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2011</xref>). Methylphenidate&#x02019;s enhancing effects on response readiness were observed even after a dose as low as 10&#x000a0;mg and grew more consistent and prominent with increasing doses. Hence, our data challenge the existence of the inverted U relationship, at least with respect to declarative memory consolidation and response readiness.</p><p>In conclusion, this was the first study to find dose-related effects of methylphenidate on declarative memory consolidation. This result is in line with earlier described findings of amphetamine-induced enhancement of memory consolidation. Improved performance was also observed on stop signal and set shifting tasks.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was carried out at Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands and was sponsored by F.
