The symptoms exceed the expected clinical course of the inciting event.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>CRPS-1 is seen as a multifactorial disorder that requires a multidisciplinary approach. The variability in the activation of the three major pathophysiological pathways (aberrant inflammatory mechanisms, vasomotor dysfunction and maladaptive neuroplasticity) involved in CRPS cause the clinical heterogeneity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Different stages have been identified,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and over time, clinical features spread and may even occur in the opposite or ipsilateral limb.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>To date, there are many uncertainties regarding the most optimal way of managing this disabling disorder, which in many cases appears to be therapy resistant. Recent systematic reviews show that there is still insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of most therapies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The Cochrane systematic review from 2013 concluded that there is low-quality evidence for many treatment modalities such as the use of bisphosphonates, calcitonin or a daily course of intravenous ketamine; graded motor imagery; and physical or occupational therapy. The review authors generally identified a critical lack of high-quality evidence for the effectiveness of most therapies.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Despite the lack of high-quality evidence, the Dutch national multidisciplinary clinical guideline for the treatment of CRPS-1 was issued in 2006.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Treatment recommendations in this guideline include pharmacological interventions aimed primarily at decreasing pain combined with physical and/or occupational therapy. This therapy is focused on controlling pain and other symptoms, using mild exposure, and increasing the capacity step by step in a pain-contingent manner. Pharmacological treatment includes the use of analgesics in a step-up procedure in accordance with the WHO pain ladder, free radical scavengers including dimethyl sulfoxide 50% ointment (DMSO) and <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine, calcium channel blockers and ketanserin. Patients presenting with allodynia or hyperalgesia are given gabapentin, amitriptyline or carbamazepine. Dystonia, myoclonia and muscle spasms are treated with baclofen, diazepam or clonazepam. In the case of cold skin, the anaesthesiologist will prescribe vasodilating drugs such as verapamil, ketensin and pentoxifylline. In case of insufficient clinical effect, sympathetic blockade or spinal cord stimulation can be considered.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In contrast to the biomedical approach as advocated in the guideline, the attention of the research community has shifted over past decades towards a behavioural paradigm for the management of benign chronic pain disorders. A widely used model in treatment of patients with chronic pain is the fear-avoidance model of Vlaeyen.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> When injury leads to pain, rest and avoidance of movement may be adaptive in the acute phase, but in the longer term, this &#x02018;protective&#x02019; responding is no longer functional and may paradoxically worsen the problem.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Decreased motor activity can lead to changes in cortical representation zones,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which have been identified in patients with CRPS-1.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Movements are more effortful, and unsuccessful motor attempts lead to compensatory behaviour. Unpleasant and unsuccessful experiences, in combination with pain increase, lead to increased pain-avoidance behaviour, which causes so-called learnt non-use.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>In order to overcome the hypothesised learnt non-use, some treatment approaches apply a well-known and accepted strategy in psychology: graded exposure to fearful stimuli in order to overcome fear and avoidance behaviour. Patients with CRPS-1 are instructed to use their affected limb step by step, using positive reinforcement and under explanation that motor activities are not harmful but rather enhance recovery.</p><p>A more direct alternative is pain exposure physical therapy (PEPT, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008283TB1">table 1</xref>).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> PEPT is not similar to graded exposure, as PEPT is neither limited to patients with high levels of fear nor uses a strict hierarchy of avoided activities to which patients need to be exposed gradually, as is typical for graded exposure. In PEPT, patients are directly exposed to painful stimuli (ie, activities). They are stressed to regain their normal daily activities as soon as possible, without the use of medication, and are instructed to ignore their pain. It is explained to them that pain in itself has become a &#x02018;false warning sign&#x02019; due to long-lasting functional disturbances in the affected limb. On the basis of the history taking and observations during assessment, the intervention is adapted to the individual patient. During the first assessment, patients, along with their partners, set their personal goals for treatment. They receive detailed information about the condition, the working mechanism of pain and pain-related avoidance behaviour, and the rationale and content of PEPT. The therapists inform the patients that, although understanding the pain, they will not respond to it: they will ignore both verbal and non-verbal expressions of pain during treatment. Because of improved function, the pain will eventually diminish. All medication aimed at CRPS-1, including analgesics, is stopped and use of crutches and other walking aids, splints and bandages is discouraged. Patients learn how to decrease skin sensitivity for touch and pressure by performing self-massage and &#x02018;forced&#x02019; use of the affected extremity in daily activities. The tailored progressive-loading exercises focus on specific daily activities, using muscle strength training and joint mobility exercises, both passive and active. The patients perform the exercises at home and incorporate them in their daily life using regular daily schedules. The physical therapists act mainly as instructors and coaches, and confirm and reward progression with positive feedback. They instruct the partners to change their protective and curative role into a facilitating, motivating and coaching role, removing barriers without taking over. The partners have to ignore the pain behaviour of the patients during the treatment sessions and home exercises. The key to success of PEPT is internal motivation and adherence.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015008283TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Description of interventions according to the TIDieR checklist</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain exposure physical therapy</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Conventional treatment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Why</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain is a false warning sign<break/>Rapidly regaining functional activity, despite levels of pain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pain is a sign of dysfunction<break/>Pain contingent, improving functional activity while controlling pain</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">What</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exposure to painful movements and activities;<break/>No medication, no TENS, no walking aids, splints or bandages;<break/>Self-massage, &#x02018;forced&#x02019; use, progressive-loading exercises, muscle strength training, joint mobility exercises;<break/>Information and education about CRPS-1, PEPT and the role of chronic pain as a false warning sign;<break/>Internal locus of control</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Dependent of pain limits;<break/>Medication (analgesics, free radical scavengers, Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers, etc), TENS, walking aids, splints, bandages;<break/>Mild exposure, progressive-loading exercises, muscle strength training, joint mobility exercises;<break/>Information and education about CRPS-1 and the role of pain as a protective response and a sign of dysfunction;<break/>External locus of control</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Who provided</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Two physical therapists;<break/>Partner as a &#x02018;home coach&#x02019;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anaesthesiologist, physical therapist, rehabilitation physician</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">How</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Face-to-face, individually, explicit home exercises and functioning in activities of daily living</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Face-to-face, individually</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Where</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PT department, continuously in daily life</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anaesthesiology department, PT department</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">How much</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum five sessions of 40&#x02005;min</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No predefined limits, on average 15&#x02013;20 sessions</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tailoring</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adapted to individual competencies and daily life requirements</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adapted to levels of pain</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>CRPS-1, complex regional pain syndrome type 1; PEPT, pain exposure physical therapy; PT, physical therapy; TENS, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; TIDieR, Template for Intervention Description and Replication.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>It has already been shown that PEPT is a promising treatment for patients with CRPS-1.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

Baseline characteristics of the patients and baseline values of the outcome measures were described using measures of central tendency and dispersion. We conducted the statistical analysis following the intention-to-treat principle (ITT): patients were analysed in the groups to which they were allocated. We also performed a secondary analysis following the per protocol (PP) principle: only the patients who followed the randomisation protocol were analysed and the patients who opted out of the treatment allocation prior to treatment initiation were excluded from this analysis. We performed a responder analysis in order to compare the proportion of patients achieving the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of four points on ISS-RV. We used linear mixed models with unstructured repeated covariance to determine the between-group differences over time. Treatment, measurement in time, and treatment&#x000d7;time interaction were added to the model as factors and outcome at baseline was added as a covariate. Linear mixed models deal with missing data by predicting the best-fitting line for each patient without data imputation.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>The Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development (ZonMw; 1709901004) sponsored this study.

Seventy-four patients fulfilled the study inclusion criteria and were invited to participate in the study. Eighteen patients did not give their informed consent due to constraints like travel time or an unwillingness to undergo frequent assessments. The resulting 56 patients were randomly allocated to either PEPT (n=28) or CONV (n=28). Prior to treatment initiation, four patients (14%) in the PEPT group and 11 patients (39%) in the CONV group opted out of their assigned treatment and switched groups.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008283F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the participant flow.

Patients in both treatment groups experienced a clinically important decrease in ISS-RV, but we did not find a significant between-group difference. We did observe a significantly larger improvement of AROM for patients treated with PEPT. The ITT analysis showed no other differences between treatment groups. The PP analysis showed larger and significant between-group effects on ISS-RV, VAS-pain, AROM, PDI, SF-36, LLTQ and TUG.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Meaning of the study</title><p>Both groups improved substantially on ISS-RV (6.7 points for the PEPT group and 6.2 points for the CONV group), although there was no significant between-group difference. We also observed a relevant improvement in disability for both groups, which we also consider an important outcome measure.</p><p>This study indicates that CRPS-1 may be treated with well-tolerated PEPT, without the use of medication, thus avoiding adverse effects and high costs of medication. However, owing to certain shortcomings in the execution of this trial, as mentioned hereafter in the discussion, while the within-group differences for both treatments suggest improvement, the between-group differences do not provide evidence that PEPT offers additional benefit over CONV. This could be relevant for a cost-effectiveness analysis. Because of the maximum duration of five treatment sessions, PEPT is a low-cost intervention: the number of physical therapy sessions in CONV was much higher than that with PEPT.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The outcomes of a cost-effectiveness analysis will be published in a subsequent paper, but based on the previous statements it seems that, from an economic point of view, PEPT could be recommended to patients as well as by caregivers and health insurance companies.</p><p>The effects reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008283TB5">table 5</xref> are estimated effects. We did not include a treatment &#x000d7; time interaction to the analysis, as this did not contribute to the model. The difference in outcome between treatments was achieved after 3&#x02005;months (T1) and remained stable over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Strengths and limitations of the study</title><p>Our trial included a number of aspects to minimise bias. We prospectively registered the trial and followed the published protocol.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Patients were randomised, allocation was concealed and the assessor was blinded, although we did not systematically record whether patients unblinded the assessor. Small groups of correctly instructed therapists conducted the treatments at different locations of our university hospital. The therapists applying the experimental treatment were specifically trained to perform PEPT. The physical therapists who applied CONV were the same therapists as those applying treatments in the studies by Oerlemans <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>A homogeneous group of patients was included, with baseline characteristics comparable to those of the normal patient population. This argues for generalisability of our findings in the population. However, we only included patients with one affected extremity, so we cannot draw conclusions about the effect of PEPT for patients with more than one affected extremity. Furthermore, the median duration of symptoms was relatively short (6.0&#x02005;months, IQR 4&#x02013;9) and only 12.5% of patients reported at our outpatient clinic &#x02265;12&#x02005;months after the inciting event. Therefore, we cannot generalise the results of this study to chronic patients.</p><p>The inclusion rate was disappointing and the maximum duration of the study forced us to accept a lower number of participants than was calculated for the optimal sample size. No specific measures were undertaken to compensate for non-compliance or loss-to-follow-up and after randomisation, a substantial number of patients (15/56; 26.8%) opted out of their assigned treatment and did not follow the trial protocol. As a result, this trial was underpowered and the primary analysis was based on mixed groups; thus, the actual effect was diluted. These are important limitations of our trial.</p><p>We could not foresee so many patients changing treatment group before having finished the initial allocated treatment. Since the initial inclusion rate was low, the funding organisation allowed us to take 1&#x02005;year extra but without extra financial support. Owing to financial limitations, we could not afford to exceed the extra inclusion period.</p><p>Our hospital is known for its research on CRPS-1, and patients referred to our hospital might have had the expectation to receive a new treatment. The larger number of patients that switched to the PEPT group directly after randomisation might be due to this expectation. However, we did not evaluate possible preferences prior to randomisation. In future trials, we should explore the opinions and expectations of the patients better prior to inclusion and randomisation. Furthermore, there should be better education about the implication of randomisation in order to minimise switching after inclusion.</p><p>A disadvantage of randomised controlled trials is that some patients refrain from participation because of randomisation; they do not want to risk being allocated to the control intervention. Patients who do participate may be disappointed when they are assigned to the control group, which can result in dropouts or patients switching to the experimental group.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> One might question whether a conventional randomised controlled trial is the most appropriate form of research in such cases.</p><p>After completion of this trial, a Cochrane review was published, showing the lack of evidence of most CONV modalities,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> making it difficult to place the results of this trial in perspective. A placebo-controlled trial would reveal the actual treatment effect, without the risk of switching or potentially biasing factors. However, it seems rather undoable to conduct a placebo-controlled physical therapy trial, given the nature of the treatment, the intensity of the condition and the clear request for help in most patients.</p><p>A relatively new type of study design, called cohort multiple randomised controlled trial, tackles the aforementioned problems regarding recruitment and allocation and might be a good alternative design in populations like the one under study.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>Owing to switching of treatment groups, shifts in baseline characteristics occurred for the PP analysis. The CONV group contained more patients with an affected upper extremity and the dominant side was affected more often in this group. These differences, however, were not significant. According to adjusted analyses, introducing these variables to the model had little influence on the outcome and correction for the variables in the analysis appeared to be unnecessary.</p><p>ISS is specifically developed for measuring severity of CRPS-1. A disadvantage of this score is that continuous data are converted to a 1 to 10 scale, which leads to loss of data. However, ISS provides a balanced score, in which all domains are represented equally. Since several trials have used ISS as an outcome measure, this allows for comparison of results between trials. In ISS-RV, measurement of limb volume is excluded. This is a rather irreproducible measure with low sensitivity, and causes increased variability in the ISS scores, rendering it less useful.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We expect that excluding measurement of limb volume will not affect the reliability of the sum score.</p><p>In the study protocol of this trial, we mentioned three other secondary outcome measures (PAR, the Seven Days Physical Activity Recall questionnaire; IPAQ, the International Physical Activity questionnaire; and Personal Activity Monitor, an accelerometer). However, data sets of the outcomes were too incomplete and therefore unsuitable for analysis.</p><p>Not all patients who were treated with PEPT adhered to the treatment protocol: 10 patients received some form of medication or other CONV. Most of this treatment was prescribed by their general practitioners, who were not involved in the trial, and in some cases it was not clear whether the treatment was CRPS related.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths and limitations in relation to other studies</title><p>Ek <italic>et al</italic> studied PEPT in a cohort of 106 adult patients with long-lasting CRPS-1. Function improved in 90% of patients, and they observed full functional recovery in 46% of patients.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In 2011, we published an article on the safety of PEPT, reporting that we did not observe exacerbations of CRPS-1 symptoms during intensive stress-loading exercises. A second remarkable finding was that pain relief and complete remission of CRPS-1 symptoms could be reached without specific CRPS-1 medication and/or other invasive treatments.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>This study also showed decreased pain intensity, increased AROM and decreased disability in the PEPT group, without disease deterioration.</p><p>In another publication, we showed the results of a mediation analysis on pain-related fears (fear-avoidance beliefs, pain catastrophising and kinesiophobia) in the treatment of CRPS-1 with PEPT. We found no indication that pain-related fears mediate the reduction of disability and pain.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Unanswered questions and future research</title><p>In this study, we observed no deterioration shortly after finishing PEPT; however, future studies should explore the long-term tenability of PEPT.</p><p>Future research should also focus on the question whether PEPT is applicable to all patients with CRPS-1, both acute and chronic, and whether psychological or cognitive factors or differences in physical characteristics need to be taken into account. Detection of and insights into these factors would help us when making decisions about an appropriate individual intervention.</p><p>In future studies, perhaps especially with (chronic) pain patients, researchers should be attentive to expectations of potential participants in order to preclude a large number of participants from switching treatment groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We cannot state that PEPT is superior to CONV for patients with CRPS-1. However, patients allocated to PEPT did experience a greater improvement in AROM compared to those allocated to CONV. In the ITT analysis, all other outcomes showed improvement over time, but we were not able to detect significant between-group differences. The improvement in the PEPT group was achieved in a maximum of five treatment sessions and without the use of medication.</p><p>Interested readers can find full details of the trial protocol in the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008283/-/DC1">Supplemental Appendix</ext-link>, available with the full text of this article, and at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/13/58">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2474/13/58</ext-link>.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Tjarda Tromp, who performed all of the measurements and data management; Maria Reinders, who performed the randomisation; Rob Oostendorp, who substantially contributed to the conception and design of the study; Anouk Puts and Marijke Tolsma, who carried out the pain exposure physical therapy; and Peter Paul Mazure, Jan Oosterhof and Riet Doppen, who carried out the conventional physical therapy.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KJB wrote the paper.
