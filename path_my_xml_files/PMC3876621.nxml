Its frequency was no different from those seen over the years 1984-1998, that is, 27%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Head and neck carcinoma (HNC) includes the common squamous-cell carcinomas of the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx, and the less frequent tumors of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and the salivary glands. Radiation therapy the mainstay of treatment offered nearly 75% of all head and neck cancers with either curative or palliative intent, alone or as a part of multimodality approach.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The prognosis of patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer (LAHNC) is still poor, 5 year survival rate with conventional radiotherapy is 40-50%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>One of the important causes of failure is accelerated repopulation of tumor clonogen, which usually starts around the 4<sup>th</sup> week of radiotherapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] To combat this, 60 cGy of extra dose per day is needed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Hence to increase local control and survival, several strategy of altered fractionation is used.</p><p>Another reason to deliver radiation therapy with altered fractionation schedules was designed as a means of maximizing the therapeutic ratio. The use of small multiple daily fractions allows to increase the therapeutic differential between late-responding normal tissues and acutely responding tumors with the advantage that the overall treatment time is shortened, thereby limiting the opportunities for proliferation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>To improve the outcome of head and neck cancer concomitant chemoradiotherapy is another novel approach. The goal of using concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy is to eradicate systemic microscopic disease while simultaneously enhancing the cytotoxicity of radiation against macroscopic neoplastic disease. Several recent studies and meta-analyses have indicated superior loco-regional control and/or survival rates after concomitant chemoradiotherapy when compared with radiotherapy alone particularly when chemotherapy includes cisplatin or analogues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Based on these considerations, we began a prospective, single institutional study to compare different schedules of radiation therapy in patient LAHNC.

The initial assessment included in all patients a complete medical history and physical examination, endoscopy and biopsy, complete blood count and biochemical profile, chest X-ray, and computerized tomography (CT) of the head and neck. Bone scan and abdominal ultrasound were performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Pretreatment evaluation also included complete dental evaluation and nutritional assessment. Patients were simulated before the start of the treatment with an appropriate immobilization device. In most of the patients, lateral opposed fields were used to treat the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes. Uninvolved level II to V nodes were included in the initial treatment volume in all patients and uninvolved level I nodes were also included in oral cavity cancers to ensure microscopic coverage. A third anterior field was used to treat the uninvolved supraclavicular nodes. CT-based three-dimensional treatment planning was used in all cases. The radiation dose was prescribed to the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU) point. Radiation treatments were delivered with Co-60 photon beams. The patients were randomized into three groups.

Radiotherapy alone was the standard nonsurgical treatment for advanced disease for a long time. It was observed that radiotherapy alone resulted in local control of 50-70% and disease-free survival of 30-40%. The phenomenon of accelerated repopulation is one of reason of treatment failure in cancers of head and neck. This refers to the triggering of the surviving tumor cells [clonogens] to divide more rapidly as a tumor shrinks after irradiation or chemotherapy. It starts after about the 4<sup>th</sup> weeks of radiation in head and neck cancers. This suggests that treatment should be completed as soon as possible once it is started.</p><p>Accelerated treatment strategy aims to deliver the same total dose over a shorter time. In purely fractionated regime, total dose is delivered in half the overall time without changing the size of the fraction. But in practice it is difficult to follow it because of acute toxicities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] In this study we have followed a modest acceleration regime by giving 6 fractions of radiotherapy per week.</p><p>For concomitant chemo radiation: Meta analysis of chemotherapy on head and neck cancers [MACH-NC] studied &#x0003e; 10000 patients in 63 trials conducted prior to 1993. It demonstrated that adding chemotherapy to radiation therapy (RT) resulted in 12% reduction in the risk of death and 4% increase in 5 year survival.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. performed a phase III trial on concomitant chemoradiation versus radiotherapy in advanced cancers of oropharynx and nasopharynx with weekly Cisplatin. This showed the concomitant chemoradiotherapy regime to be safe and superior in advanced cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] In our study we found better compliance in concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm is good (median compliance arm A = 7.5 weeks, arm B = 8.5 weeks, and arm C = 10 weeks).</p><p>For radiotherapy with accelerated fractionation: Overgaard <italic>et al</italic>. conducted Danish Head and Neck Cancer Study Group (DAHANCA)-6 and DAHANCA-7 trials, which are one of the largest trials of altered fractionation. The study compared five versus six fractions per week with same fraction size.
