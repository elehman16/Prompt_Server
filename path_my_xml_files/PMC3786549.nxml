Sufficient estrogen levels leading to an intact and mature stratified, squamous, non-keratinized, vaginal epithelium are essential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0002">2</xref></sup>. The breakdown of proliferated, superficial, vaginal epitheliocytes liberates glycogen, which serves as a substrate for the lactobacilli bacteria<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0003">3</xref></sup>. Hence, a mature vaginal epithelium is a prerequisite for the establishment and maintenance of the physiological flora.</p><p>Estrogen deficiency in menopause leads to vaginal atrophy, resulting in reduced efficacy of the barrier function of the vaginal epithelial lining and facilitation of penetration by pathogens<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0004 CIT0005 CIT0006">4&#x02013;6</xref></sup>. Additionally, an intact vaginal flora cannot develop due to the lack of glycogen-containing epithelial cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref></sup>. As the vaginal epithelium becomes atrophic and the microflora change, atrophic vaginitis more commonly occurs. Up to 40% of menopausal women have symptomatic vaginal atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup>. These changes of the vagina, defined by a decreased Vaginal Maturation Index (VMI), cause clinical symptoms in many women, such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, abnormal discharge, pruritus, and soreness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0008">8</xref></sup>. The VMI is an indicator of the estrogenic stimulation of the vaginal epithelium, being 0&#x02013;49% in the case of an absent or low estrogenic effect, 50&#x02013;64% in the case of a moderate estrogenic effect, and 65&#x02013;100% in the case of a high estrogenic effect<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>Clinical studies in the treatment of vaginal atrophy have demonstrated the efficacy of vaginal estriol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0011">11</xref></sup>. Despite the effectiveness of vaginal hormone treatment, concerns about the safety of estrogen therapies in general have hindered its use by postmenopausal women<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0013">13</xref></sup>. However, estriol is a relatively short-acting estrogen due to its short nuclear retention time in endometrial cells, its low affinity for plasma proteins, and its rapid metabolic clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref></sup>. Many long-term studies using topical vaginal estriol preparations have shown no evidence of endometrial proliferation after 6&#x02013;24 months of use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, some other studies have shown an association of oral and vaginal estriol with a stimulating effect on the endometrium and endometrial atypical hyperplasia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0016">16</xref></sup>. It seems that systemic absorption and a stimulatory effect on both breast and endometrial tissue of this vaginal medication are dose- and frequency-dependent, and only continuous use of high doses may have safety concerns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0017">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>Vaginal estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli tablets containing an ultra-low dose of estriol have been introduced to promote the proliferation and maturation of the vaginal epithelium and to enhance the restoration of the vaginal ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018 CIT0019 CIT0020">18&#x02013;20</xref></sup>. A dose-finding study has demonstrated that the vaginal combination of 0.03 mg estriol with lactobacilli was equally efficient as the control preparation containing 0.5 mg estriol and lactobacilli<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, it has been shown that the efficacy of vaginal tablets containing 0.03 mg estriol in treating women diagnosed with atrophic vaginitis was equivalent to the efficacy of vaginal administration of 0.5 mg estriol alone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref></sup>. Overall, the beneficial profile of this combination has been demonstrated in several small and short-term clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref></sup>; however, the data in the treatment of vaginal atrophy still need broader confirmation. A study with more subjects and a long-term follow-up is needed to gain information on the optimal maintenance dose.</p><p>This is the first study investigating the efficacy and tolerability of ultra-low-dose (0.03 mg) estriol in combination with viable lactobacilli in short-term, initial as well as long-term, maintenance treatment of symptomatic vaginal atrophy in postmenopausal women. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of an ultra-low-dose 0.03 mg vaginal estriol in combination with viable <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> KS400 (Gynoflor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaginal tablets) in the short-term, 12-day treatment of vaginal atrophy in comparison with placebo.

Both blinded medications were to be administered daily for 12 days. Control examinations were performed 5&#x02013;7 days after start of therapy (C1) and 2&#x02013;4 days after the end of the initial, daily therapy (C2).</p><p>After the examination at C2, women were unblinded to determine the appropriate treatment for the subsequent open-label follow-up (Open phase). Those women who received the test medication during the Controlled phase entered directly into the maintenance treatment receiving Gynoflor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> vaginal tablets, one tablet on two consecutive days weekly for 12 weeks. Women from the placebo group first received an initial test medication therapy with one vaginal tablet daily for 12 days and returned for an additional visit 2&#x02013;4 days after the end of this therapy (C2A); subsequently, they entered into the maintenance treatment (one tablet on two consecutive days per week for 12 weeks). During the maintenance therapy, all women returned for follow-up visit 2 (C3) 2 weeks after the start of maintenance therapy and for follow-up visit 3 (C4) at the end of therapy (12 weeks).</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter was the change in VMI at C2. A vaginal smear from the lateral vaginal wall was obtained by using an Ayre spatula, stained according to the Papanicolaou technique, and scored under light microscopy by the cytopathologist who was blinded with regard to treatment.

Efficacy and safety variables were assessed by the investigator and patient at every visit. For the Controlled phase, two analysis sets were defined: intention-to-treat (ITT), of randomized women who attended at least one visit, and per-protocol set (PPS), of all women who attended at least one control visit and did not violate any major protocol criteria. The ITT analysis was considered the primary analysis and performed for all parameters. Additionally, the change in VMI and VMI itself at C2 were also analyzed for the PPS population. For the Open-phase analysis, the women in the two groups of the Controlled phase were combined and results were analyzed descriptively based on the ITT set. As women in the the placebo group had to be first treated with the daily therapy of the estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination before they entered the maintenance therapy, the visits of the two groups had to be combined for the Open-phase analysis as follows: Entry = estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination at E/placebo at C2; Follow-up 1 = estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination at C2/placebo at C2A; Follow-up 2 = C3; and Follow-up 3 = C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>All women who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analysis for both study phases. For the evaluation of safety (SAF population), an adverse event was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in clinical trial subject or clinically significant changes in physical and laboratory findings.</p><sec id="ss3"><title>Statistics</title><p>For the primary efficacy parameter, a two-sided Mann&#x02013; Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test (two independent samples) based on a 5% significance level was used.

VMI, symptoms, LBG and global assessment of efficacy and tolerability were assessed using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. Total symptom score, percentage of epithelial cell types, number of lactobacilli, and vaginal pH results were analyzed using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. For the Open phase, the efficacy variables were analyzed descriptively, and the results were described over time. All safety variables were described over time.</p><p>The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy variable (change of VMI), a 5% level of significance (two-sided) and a power of 90%. In order to be able to demonstrate the clinically relevant difference of 20% (standard deviation of 25%), as reported in previous studies, a sample size of 35 women per group was required. Considering a 20% drop-out rate, it was necessary to recruit 44 women per group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="ss4"><title>Results</title><p>An overview of subject disposition is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>.

These results confirm the previously available clinical data on low-dose vaginal estriol therapy of vaginal atrophy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0009 CIT0010 CIT0011">9&#x02013;11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref></sup>. The observed increase in the VMI during the study shows moderate estrogenic stimulation of the vaginal epithelium and demonstrates that ultra-low-dose estriol in combination with viable lactobacilli is sufficient for the clinical improvement in women suffering from vaginal atrophy.</p><p>After 1 week of daily therapy, the change in VMI was not yet significantly improved compared to placebo, indicating that a 6-day therapy with vaginal tablets containing 0.03 mg estriol and lactobacilli is not sufficient for a full improvement of vaginal atrophy. However, after the complete initial therapy of 12 days, the vaginal maturation was increased significantly from 14.9% to 49.5%. Similar improvement was seen with regard to secondary variables &#x02013; clinical symptomatic (especially vaginal dryness) and vaginal ecosystem parameters. The results for dyspareunia, abnormal discharge, pruritus, and soreness were also different between groups but not significantly, due to small numbers. Improvement of VMI, vaginal pH and clinical symptoms under placebo has been reported previously, and is not uncommon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref></sup>. However, after visit C1, no further improvement was observed.</p><p>This is the first study where a possible maintenance regimen for the estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination tablets was investigated. During the 12-week maintenance therapy, the maturation of the vaginal epithelium remained at similar levels. Thus, the study demonstrated that the applied regimen of two vaginal tablets per week was on average sufficient to prevent the recurrence of vaginal atrophy and its clinical symptoms. Interestingly, even though the VMI did not increase during maintenance therapy, other secondary parameters such as clinical symptoms, number of lactobacilli and LBG did improve further. As a matured vaginal epithelium is a pre-requisite for the establishment of an intact lactobacilli flora, it is not surprising that the maintenance dose of the estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination with its viable <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> further supports the establishment of a healthy vaginal ecosystem and particularly a normal vaginal lactobacilli flora.</p><p>In both phases of the study, no adverse drug reaction was reported. Together with the excellent tolerability, as judged by the investigator and patient, this result confirms the previously demonstrated beneficial safety profile of the combination containing ultra-low-dose estriol and viable <italic>L. acidophilus.</italic>
</p><p>The strengths of this study were the uniqueness of its design, the comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy parameters, and the consistent demonstration of the benefit of a daily initial and weekly maintenance therapy in the treatment of symptomatic vaginal atrophy using ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol in combination with lactobacilli. The missing evaluation of a possible effect on the endometrium could be considered as a weakness of the study. Since estriol is a short-acting estrogen and proliferation is commonly considered as a typical late estrogen effect, an influence of ultra-low-dose vaginal estriol was not expected to occur. Furthermore, previous studies and meta-analyses have sufficiently shown that vaginal estriol even at higher doses does not increase the thickness of endometrium<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref></sup>.</p><p>It has been previously demonstrated that daily application of the estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination for 12 days did not increase serum concentrations of estriol in postmenopausal women. At day 1, application of the estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination resulted in a <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> of about twice the baseline level, but still in the postmenopausal range, whereas at day 12, <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was not increased at all<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Quality of life in postmenopausal women is often severely hampered by the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. Vaginal estrogen therapy is well accepted and used to help these women. However, the goal in menopausal hormone therapy is to use the lowest effective dose in order to achieve the best possible risk&#x02013;benefit balance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0026">26</xref></sup>. In light of this, our study results provide further evidence that a daily dose of 0.03 mg vaginal estriol in combination with viable lactobacilli is sufficient to treat efficiently vaginal atrophy in postmenopause, and that the current vaginal standard dose of 0.5 mg estriol is not needed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0025">25</xref></sup>. These results also confirm the findings of previous clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0027 CIT0028 CIT0029">27&#x02013;29</xref></sup>.</p><p>Regarding the role of the viable lactobacilli used in the combination with estriol, it is expected that lactic acid bacteria could have a synergistic effect on the improvement of the vaginal ecosystem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup>. With an improved maturation of the vaginal epithelium, the risk for vaginal infections such as bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis is increasing, and thus additional supplementation with beneficial <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> supports the restoration of the healthy vaginal flora<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT0019">19</xref></sup>. The study has shown that the evaluated indicators for a healthy vaginal flora have significantly improved, even after the maturation of the epithelium did not further increase. To demonstrate and to confirm this synergy could be the aims of future clinical investigations.</p><p>In conclusion, the study demonstrated that ultra- low-dose 0.03 mg vaginal estriol in combination with viable <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> KS400 (Gynoflor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was superior to placebo with respect to the primary variable: change in vaginal maturation (VMI) after the 12-day therapy. The estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination was sufficient to achieve statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement of the objective parameters and also the quality of life of these women. Furthermore, a long-term dose of two vaginal tablets is sufficient to maintain the improved maturation of the vaginal epithelium and to prevent relapse of symptomatic vaginal atrophy. The estriol&#x02013;lactobacilli combination showed a very good tolerability and no adverse drug reactions during the complete 12-week treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Ms Rachanida Sirithorn, Ms Somtawin Pojjanasopanakun, Ms Tanimporn Ninlagarn and Mrs Rachanee Wongwathanavikrom for their study assistance and Dr Tun Myint Win for his comments on the manuscript.</p><p>
