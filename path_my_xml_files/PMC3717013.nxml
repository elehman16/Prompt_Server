[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Together with hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction they may increase pulmonary vascular resistance and cause pulmonary hypertension. ARDS may thus lead to an acute cor pulmonale
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Right ventricular dysfunction occurs in 61% of patients with ARDS submitted to mechanical ventilation using conventional tidal volumes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is estimated to be present in only 25% of patients with ARDS submitted to mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Although the right ventricle secretes less NT&#x02013;proBNP than the left ventricle
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP can be elevated in patients with an acute cor pulmonale due to ARDS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Notably, stretching of heart muscle cells could also be the result of fluid overload, frequently seen in patients with ARDS. In addition, NT&#x02013;proBNP levels can be elevated due to kidney failure
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and elevated levels are seen in patients with acute brain injury
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>It can be questioned whether the size of tidal volumes used with mechanical ventilation influences the right ventricular afterload and therefore has an effect on serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP. In the present study we measured levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP in serial samples taken from patients without ARDS who were randomized to mechanical ventilation with lower tidal volumes or conventional tidal volumes in a previous trial
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We hypothesized that conventional tidal volumes may lead to increased pulmonary vascular resistance as the incidence or ARDS is higher compared to lower tidal volumes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this way, increased pulmonary vascular resistance may lead to increased stretching of the right ventricle and therefore increased NT-proBNP levels. To investigate this possibility we studied the relation between tidal volumes and NT&#x02013;proBNP levels. The purpose of this study was (a) to investigate whether serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP are dependent on tidal volume size in patients without ARDS, and (b) serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP to increase parallel to severity of lung injury, when controlling for acute kidney injury, cumulative fluid balance and presence of brain injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The original trial was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and registered at the Netherlands Trial Register (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl">http://www.trialregister.nl</ext-link>; NTR151)

Echocardiography was performed routinely in patients with myocardial infarction and in patients with suspected cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction was suspected in case of hemodynamic instability which could not be explained by bleeding or an event causing vasodilatation such as sepsis, allergic reaction, or administration of agents causing vasodilatation.

First, we may not have included a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a difference in serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP between the randomization groups. Notably, as patients developing ARDS in the conventional tidal volume group were immediately set to lower tidal volume ventilation as soon as ARDS was recognized, we may have limited right ventricular wall stress, possibly influencing serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP. Second, we did not perform pulmonary artery pressure measurements to assess the afterload of the right ventricle. However, this procedure can result in complications as cardiac arrhythmias or lung bleeding. We therefore choose not to perform this procedure in patients who were already compromised by ARDS. Third, our study was performed using the American-European consensus conference ARDS criteria. The ARDS criteria have recently been changed
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study patients who developed ARDS all had underlying risk factors
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, it is standard practice in our clinic to perform echocardiography in case heart failure is suspected. As all patients were ventilated with at least 5&#x000a0;cm H2O of PEEP, ARDS diagnosis may not have differed significantly in case patients were reviewed based on the Berlin definition.</p><p>The incidence of acute cor pulmonale with ARDS seems to have declined with the use of lower tidal volumes. The study by Vieillard-Baron <italic>et al</italic>. showed a lower incidence of acute cor pulmonale diagnosed by echocardiography
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They suggested that lowering tidal volumes with mechanical ventilation resulted in afterload reduction of the right ventricle, thereby minimizing the incidence of acute cor pulmonale. Their results also suggested that a lower tidal volume may be associated with higher degree of hypercapnia which was significantly associated with presence of acute cor pulmonale. In our study no correlation was found between tidal volume size and serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP. We also did not find any relation between hypercapnia and the level of NT&#x02013;proBNP. This may have been caused by the two independent determinants of NT&#x02013;proBNP levels. i.e., the cumulative fluid balance and the presence of kidney injury. Although ARDS is associated with hypercapnia, patients with higher cumulative fluid balance or with AKI were not hypercapnic in most cases.</p><p>The relation between tidal volume size and acute cor pulmonale may be different in patients with and without ARDS. Although higher tidal volumes may indeed increase the afterload of the right ventricle, this may be less or even not important in patients without lung disease. However, the effect of conventional tidal volume on the right ventricle and therefore on serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP may have been tempered in our study. In patients who developed ARDS, the tidal volume was immediately set at 6&#x000a0;ml/kg in patients of the conventional tidal volume group. As mentioned above, this may have resulted in less stress on the right ventricle and accordingly lower serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP.</p><p>In line with previous studies, serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP correlated with cumulative fluid balance
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the presence of AKI
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our finding that serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP were associated with both cumulative fluid balance, and AKI and ARDS may disqualify this protein as a suitable biological marker to distinguish between ARDS and acute pulmonary cardiogenic edema or acute pulmonary edema due to circulatory overload. Recent studies have investigated this issue. Rana <italic>et al</italic>. studied patients with acute pulmonary edema and measured serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP within 24&#x000a0;hours after the onset of the edema
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. They found a low serum level of NT&#x02013;proBNP to be supportive of ARDS. However levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP were not discriminative in patients with a level above 250&#x000a0;pg/ml. In a study of patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, low serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP (&#x0003c; 200&#x000a0;pg/ml) were found to be supportive of ARDS while high serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP (&#x0003e; 1200&#x000a0;mg/ml) were supportive of cardiogenic pulmonary edema
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, in a study of patients with respiratory distress and bilateral pulmonary edema, Levitt <italic>et al</italic>. could not find a useful cut&#x02013;off point for NT&#x02013;proBNP in diagnosing ARDS
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Finally, in a study of patients with respiratory distress after blood transfusions, Li <italic>et al</italic>. observed higher serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP in patients with circulatory overload compared to patients with transfusion&#x02013;associated lung injury, but NT&#x02013;proBNP had no diagnostic value due to a large range of overlapping values
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. All studies bear more of less the same message: in patients with acute respiratory distress, serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP tend to be lower in patients with ARDS as compared to patients with circulatory overload or congestive heart failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP are independent of tidal volume size in patients without ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation. Presence of ARDS, a more positive cumulative fluid balance and AKI are all independently associated with increased serum levels of NT&#x02013;proBNP. NT&#x02013;proBNP cannot to be used as biological marker of ventilator&#x02013;induced lung injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RD participated in the design and coordination of the study, performed the statistical analyses, and drafted the manuscript.
