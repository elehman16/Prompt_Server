And 25 patients received dexamethasone after induction and before commencement of the surgery, about 0.5 mg/kg through I V (intra operative), while another set of 25 patients received equal volume of saline as control group. Sharp dissection snare technique was used for tonsillectomy. Bleeders were ligated using ties. Hemostasis was achieved using packs or sutures. Electrocautery was not used.</p><p>Patients were monitored in the postoperative care for first 6 h and in the ward for next 6-24 h. Out of them, 25 patients received single intra venous dexamethasone dosage of 0.5 mg/kg in the postoperative care unit, just after shifting the patient to post operative recovery unit (post operative group). The same surgeon using dissection and snare technique performed tonsillectomy in all patients with same standard anesthetic technique.</p><p>Pain was assessed using visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 &#x02013; 6, every half hourly for first 2 h and second hourly for next 4 h and then at 6, 12, and 24 h. Recordings were made at 30 min, 6, 12 and 24 h. If VAS was more than 6 tramadol 1 mg/ kg was administered.</p><p>Nausea (a subjective unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit) and vomiting (forceful expulsion of liquid gastric content), if occurred, were recorded. Number of episodes of vomiting was also noted. Inj. Ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg was administered, if more than two episodes of vomiting in an hour or nausea lasting for more than half an hour occurred. Temperature was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h. Temperature &#x0003e; 37.6&#x000b0;C was considered as fever. Hemorrhage, if thereany, was noted.</p><p>At 4 h after the surgery, patients were asked to take oral liquids. The quality of oral intake was graded as follows:</p><p>

</p><p>The time of first acceptance of oral liquid diet was recorded.</p><p>If the oral intake was delayed, the time duration between the end of surgery and first acceptance of oral liquid was recorded. Till that time 3 ml/kg-1h-1 of lactated ringer's solution with dextrose was infused. At 24 h, patients were discharged. Patients or parents were asked to note, the time of first acceptance of solid food, fever, bleeding or other side effects if occurred.</p><p>This information was collected, when they returned on seventh day for follow up.</p><p>For analysis, patients of each group were divided into three pain groups for first 30 min, 6, 12, 24 h.</p><p>

It has a 36 to 72 h of biological half-life. About 10 mg of cortisol is secreted by an adult daily, which is equivalent to 0.4 mg of dexamethasone, thus the dose chosen for this study (0.5 mg/ kg, max 20 mg) is very supraphysiological. Dogma states that 1.00 to 1.5 mg/kg can be used intravenously, about 70 to 105 mg in an adult. This is probably excessive and it invites adverse drug reactions. In 1970 Papangelou[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] treated 323 patients with four days course of 0.5 mg betamethasone tablets given every 6 h in the first day, every 8 h in the second day, every 12 h in the third day and once in the fourth day. The steroid treated group had better oral intake than the control group. In our study, mean days of starting solid food were not much different in dexamethasone group compared to control group, perhaps because of the single IV dose used in our study. Administration of oral dexamethasone next day onwards might have resulted in earlier solid intake. However, randomized controlled studies are needed to find out the safety and efficacy of repeated doses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Henzi I, Walder B, Tramer MR did meta-analysis of 17 trials involving use of dexamethasone for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in surgical patients. The number needed to treat to prevent early and late vomiting compared with placebo in adults and children was 7.1 (95%CL 4.5 to 18) and 3.8 (2.9 to 5) respectively, They concluded that when there is a high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a single prophylactic dose of dexamethasone is anti-emetic compared with placebo, without evidence of any clinically prevalent toxicity in otherwise healthy patients. Late efficacy seems to be most pronounced.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Steward DL, Welge JA, Myer CM did a meta-analysis of randomized double blind placebo controlled trials of a single dose of intravenous intraoperatively steroid for pediatric patients who underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy. Eight trials met their inclusion criteria. They concluded that routine use of steroids would result in earlier soft or solid diet intake. But, because of the missing data and varied outcome measures, pain could not be meaningfully analyzed as a distinct end point.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Vosdogonis and Baines described 41 children who received 0.4 mg/kg of intravenous dexamethasone or placebo, concentrating their observations on the first 24 h postoperatively. Time taken for first liquid and solid food intake, vomiting, and pain were assessed. Postoperative vomiting was significantly decreased in the dexamethasone group (45 vs 63%; <italic>P</italic> =. 02), as was the need for administration for rescue anti emetic and intravenous fluid supplementation. Time taken to first liquid intake was similar between the groups, but first solid intake was earlier in the study group (6 vs 10 h; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.1). There was no difference in postoperative pain assessment or analgesic requirement.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Splinter and Roberts observed 133 children who received 0.15 mg/kg of dexamethasone or placebo intravenously before outpatient tonsillectomy. Postoperative vomiting both in the hospital and at home for 24 h was recorded. The dexamethasone group had less vomiting in the immediate postoperative period as well as during the first 24 h at home (overall, 40 vs 71%, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.5).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Pappas ALS, Sukhani R, Hotaling AJ examined postoperative vomiting in 130 children who received 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone or placebo during outpatient tonsillectomy. Vomiting was recorded in the hospital and for the first 24 h at home. Duration of recovery-room stay was longer in the placebo group. The incidence of vomiting, need for rescue anti emetic treatment, and analgesic requirements were not different before hospital discharge, but during the 24-h period after that, fewer patients in the steroid group experienced vomiting (48 vs 88%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.5).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>April MM, Callan ND, Nowak DM, Hausdorff MA, studied 80 children who received 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone or placebo prior to adenotonsillectomy and measured postoperative oral intake, pain, vomiting, fever, and complications during the first 24 h. The dexamethasone group had significantly less trismus, fever, and vomiting in the first 6 h postoperatively, and took more oral food (including early acceptance of solid food) than the control group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Tom LWC, Templeton JJ, Thompson ME, Marsh RR, observed 58 children who received 1 mg/kg of dexamethasone or placebo preoperatively. Parents recorded diet, medication, activity level, pain, nausea, and vomiting everyday for 10 days. Patients who received steroids had less vomiting and less severe throat pain on the first postoperative day, and returned to soft and solid diet more quickly than the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01). No difference was found in analgesic use, delayed pain and/or return to normal activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In our study there was a significant decrease in the pain in dexamethasone group than the control group <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001. However, in dexamethasone group, pre and intraoperative group showed better response than the postoperative group (1.72 &#x000b1; 0.84 and 2.20 &#x000b1; 1.19) than 2.6 4&#x000b1; 0.99 in group D respectively at 6 h of postoperative period, whereas at 24 h, all the dexamethasone groups (B, C and D) were found to be around 1.5&#x000b1;095. Pre and intra operative dexamethasone was found to be better than the postoperative group in reducing pain in the early post operative period. Overall incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting in our study was less compared to previous studies, perhaps due to avoidance of potent opioids and use of electrocautery. More severe pain and hence PONV (Post Operative Nausea and Vomiting) are known to occur with electrocautery. Previous studies using 8-10 mg of dexamethasone for other surgeries have shown decrease in incidence of PONV by 50%. Pappas <italic>et al</italic>. showed decrease in incidence of PONV from 62 to 40% Using 1 mg/kg dexamethasone for adenotonsillectomy. With 0.15-mg/kg dexamethasone, reduction in incidence of PONV from 72 to 40% was noted by Splinter <italic>et al</italic>. In our study dose of 0.5 mg/kg showed such benefit in low incidence of PONV. We found significantly better quality of oral intake with dexamethasone. Perhaps, by decreasing pain and inflammation, it improved the oral intake. In a meta-analysis Steward <italic>et al</italic>. showed that children receiving dexamethasone were more likely to advance to a soft or solid diet on post-tonsillectomy day 1 (RR= 1.69; 95% CI, 1.02-2.79; <italic>P</italic> =0.04). Catlin and Grimes studied the effect of single post induction dose of 8 mg/kg on recovery from tonsillectomy in children. On day 3, half of the steroid treated group had good appetite in contrast to 12% of the control group patients and 60% of dexamethasone treated group who could take full diet compared to 13% of the control group.</p><p>Administration of a single dose of steroid medication, even a large one, is regarded as very safe and is virtually without harmful effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] No adverse effects of steroid administration were observed in any of the studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that a single intravenous dose of 0.5 mg/kg dexamethasone at a maximum of 20 mg, given following induction of anesthesia or at the time of surgery, provided good and prolonged analgesia, reduced nausea and vomiting and resulted in earlier and better quality of oral intake without side effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Papangelou</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Steroid therapy in tonsillectomy</article-title><source>Laryngoscope</source><year>1972</year><volume>82</volume><fpage>297</fpage><lpage>302</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5014392</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shott</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tonsillectomy and post operative vomiting: Do steroids really work?</article-title><source>Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg</source><year>2001</year><volume>127</volume><fpage>1009</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11493217</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Henzi</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Walder</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Tramer</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dexamethasone for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting: A quantitative systematic review</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2000</year><volume>90</volume><fpage>186</fpage><lpage>94</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10625002</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Steward</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Welge</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Myer</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Do steroids reduce morbidity of tonsillectomy?
