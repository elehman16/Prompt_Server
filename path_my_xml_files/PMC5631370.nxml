MET is first-line therapy in diabetic HIV patients. <italic>In vitro</italic>, BIC inhibits renal transporters OCT2 and MATE1, which affect MET disposition. This study evaluated the effect of BIC on the PK and PD of MET following coadministration with the B/F/TAF.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a Phase 1, blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 32 healthy subjects randomized 1:1 to either B/F/TAF or placebo QD for 9 days followed by a 3-day washout. Following 4 days of B/F/TAF or placebo, subjects received 850 mg MET at 12 hours postdose of B/F/TAF or placebo, and 500 mg BID for 4 additional days. Plasma and urine PK of MET were assessed on the last treatment day (Days 9 and 21 for B/F/TAF or placebo). Oral glucose tolerance test was performed before (Days 5 and 17) and after MET (Days 9 and 21). MET PD endpoints including plasma glucose, active Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 (GLP-1) and lactate were assessed after glucose intake. Geometric mean ratios (GMR) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for MET PK were calculated for B/F/TAF vs. placebo. Comparisons of PD responses within treatments (before vs. after MET) and comparisons between treatments (B/F/TAF vs. placebo) were done via nonparametric Wilcoxon signed-rank test (<italic>P &#x0003e;</italic> 0.05 denotes non-significance).</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>MET plasma AUC<sub>tau</sub> was increased 39% (%GMR [90% CI]: 139 [131, 148]) with B/F/TAF vs. placebo, with no change in median plasma t<sub>1/2</sub> (B/F/TAF: 6.4 hours; placebo: 7.1 hours). MET renal clearance decreased 31% with B/F/TAF vs. placebo. Following MET administration, statistically significant reduction of plasma glucose, and increase of plasma active GLP-1 and lactate levels relative to baseline were observed (P &#x0003c; 0.001) confirming their utility as PD endpoints. Importantly, PD responses were not statistically different when MET was administered with B/F/TAF vs. placebo (p &#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Inhibition of renal transporters OCT2/MATE1 by BIC led to a modest increase of MET plasma exposure upon coadministration with B/F/TAF; however, the PD characteristics of MET were not significantly affected by B/F/TAF relative to placebo. Based on these findings, prospective dose adjustment/restriction of MET is not required upon coadministration with B/F/TAF.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
