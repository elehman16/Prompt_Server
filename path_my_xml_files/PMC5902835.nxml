The impact of PPI on guidelines, however, has not been rigorously assessed. Better understanding of the impact of PPI must start with guideline question formation, which drives all subsequent development steps. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PPI on guideline question formation and validate a conceptual model of patient and public contributions to guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">For development of a clinical practice guideline on the topic of using amyloid positron emission tomography in the diagnosis of dementia, we convened two parallel guideline development groups, one with and one without patient representatives. Participating physicians were randomized to group assignment. Each group developed Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, Time (PICOT) questions and identified key benefits and harms to incorporate in guideline development. Analysis included a descriptive comparison of proposed PICOT questions, benefits, and harms between groups and a qualitative analysis of discussion themes from audio recordings of the question development retreats.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Proposed guideline questions, benefits, and harms were largely similar between groups, but only the experimental group proposed outcomes relating to development of cognitive impairment at specific time points and rate of progression. The qualitative analysis of the discussions occurring during guideline question development demonstrated key differences in group conduct and validated the proposed conceptual model of patient and public contributions to guidelines. PPI influenced the conduct of guideline development, scope, inclusion of patient-relevant topics, outcome selection, and planned approaches to recommendation development, implementation, and dissemination with implications for both guideline developers and the guideline development process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Evidence of how PPI impacts guideline development underscores the importance of engaging patient stakeholders in guideline development and highlights developer- and guideline-specific outcomes of PPI, both of which have implications for guideline implementation. It also raises the question of whether guidelines developed without such input are acceptable for use. PPI should be considered an essential element of trustworthy guideline development for purposes of development and funding.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13012-018-0745-6) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Guidelines as Topic [MeSH term]</kwd><kwd>Clinical practice guideline</kwd><kwd>Evidence-based guideline</kwd><kwd>Patient Participation [MeSH term]</kwd><kwd>Patient-Centered Care [MeSH term]</kwd><kwd>Patient involvement</kwd><kwd>Guideline Adherence [MeSH term]</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000133</institution-id><institution>Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08HS24159</award-id><award-id>R24HS022135</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>C.

Guidelines are foundational to health care improvement efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], but compliance with guidelines is variable and often poor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. When guidelines are implemented, they can improve outcomes and reduce resource utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but important gaps remain in understanding optimal implementation strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are many identified barriers to guideline implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These include guideline-related factors such as lack of confidence in development (credibility) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], stakeholder involvement (i.e., use of experts alone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], utility/applicability of the guideline in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], applicability to individual patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and physician judgment about the balance of benefits and risks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Research suggests that guidelines are more implementable when they address patient needs and preferences and include information to support patient involvement in decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and that stakeholder involvement is a key domain impacting implementability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Improving guideline implementation must thus start with involving key stakeholders&#x02014;including patients&#x02014;and developing guideline questions that result in relevant and applicable recommendations addressing patient preferences and needs.</p><p id="Par16">In part for these reasons, patient and public involvement (PPI) is internationally recognized as an important component of guideline development. Numerous organizations recommend or require that guideline development panels include patients, patient representatives, or health consumers, including the Guidelines International Network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the United States&#x02019; Institute of Medicine (IOM, now renamed the National Academy of Medicine) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and the United Kingdom&#x02019;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument requires that guideline developers seek the views of the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. PPI in guidelines is advocated because it recognizes that patients are experts, respects the rights of citizens in health policy development, empowers and informs consumers in health care decisions, and leads to the development of more patient-centered and trustworthy guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">It is largely unknown, however, how PPI influences guidelines. Frameworks describe <italic>mechanisms</italic> for engaging patients and the public in guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], but no identified framework describes <italic>contributions</italic> PPI makes to guidelines or anticipated outcomes.

Facilitators with prior experience in leading guideline development groups were invited to chair the two groups. As per usual AAN practice, an open invitation was offered at a guideline subcommittee meeting to engage subcommittee member participants. All guideline subcommittee members provided guideline development expertise; a subset also had content expertise. Additional content experts were recruited by their reputation in the field and recommendations from colleagues and/or prior AAN interactions. Patient, caregiver, and advocacy participants (&#x0201c;patient representatives&#x0201d;) were recruited through the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association&#x02019;s Minnesota-North Dakota chapter. The US-based AAN takes a patient/stakeholder approach to PPI rather than seeking public/consumer representatives. All participants reviewed the IRB-approved consent document and verbally agreed to participate and have sessions audio-recorded.

Investigators were not blind to group results. A qualitative descriptive approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] was used to identify, define, and organize themes from retreat discussions using NVivo 11 Pro and Microsoft Word tables. One investigator (MJA) with an interest in guideline methodology and patient engagement independently analyzed retreat discussions to create a log of codes reflecting emerging themes and sample quotes illustrating theme coding (open coding using an inductive approach).

Patient representatives accounted for the same proportion of the transcripts as non-experts in the control group, but the &#x0201c;ideal&#x0201d; contribution from patient representatives in guideline development is unknown. Data were acquired solely during question development. This limits conclusions for the impact of PPI at other guideline steps, though retreat discussions touched on these subjects in a manner consistent with the conceptual model. The model outcome of meaningful and effective partnerships could not be fully assessed within the study, though patient representatives were recruited through the local Alzheimer&#x02019;s Association chapter and this is hoped to promote additional collaborations. It is possible that other researchers would identify additional transcript themes or that researchers&#x02019; backgrounds in patient engagement influenced interpretation of results, attributing differences to PPI where others would point to group differences alone. Differences in proposed questions were supported by identified themes, however, and results fit within the referenced model. Finally, research was conducted in partnership with a guideline developer already largely compliant with the IOM standards and with participants aware of the study aims; it is possible that the impact of PPI would be different in other organizations and circumstances.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par80">This study shows that engaging patient representatives on guideline development groups at the step of question development influences the conduct of guideline development, scope, inclusion of patient-relevant topics, outcome selection, and planned approaches to recommendation development, implementation, and dissemination. The conceptual model showing the impact of PPI on organizations/developers and the guideline development process underscores the importance of engaging patient stakeholders and raises the question of whether guidelines developed without such input are relevant to patients&#x02019; needs and implementable. PPI should be considered an essential element of trustworthy guideline development for purposes of development and funding. Further research is needed to identify optimal strategies for PPI involvement in guideline development to address recruitment, panel composition, and mechanisms of engagement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
