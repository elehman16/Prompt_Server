The solution requires a new approach that considers both biophysical and pharmacological aspects of treatments used in acute asthma. The result of testing several formulations was S-1226: carbon dioxide-enriched air delivered in nebulized perflubron, a synthetic surfactant. These agents act synergistically to rapidly reopen closed airways within seconds. The bronchodilator effect is independent of &#x003b2;-adrenergic and cholinergic mediated-signaling pathways, offering a unique mechanism of action. S-1226 has a low toxicity profile and was effective in treating bronchoconstriction in animal models of asthma. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226 in healthy human subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The phase I study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, single-ascending-dose study conducted in Canada. Thirty-six subjects were distributed into three cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects were randomized to receive a single dose of S-1226 or a matching placebo administered over a 2-minute nebulization period. S-1226 was formulated with perflubron and 4&#x000a0;%, 8&#x000a0;%, or 12&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>. The dose of CO<sub>2</sub> was sequentially escalated by cohort. The safety and tolerability of S-1226 were evaluated through assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiograms, clinical laboratory parameters, and physical examinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>S-1226 was safe and well tolerated at all three CO<sub>2</sub> levels (4&#x000a0;%, 8&#x000a0;%, and 12&#x000a0;%). A total of 28 adverse events were reported, and all were judged mild in severity. Twenty-four adverse events occurred in the S-1226 cohort, of which five were considered remotely related and six possibly related to S-1226.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>S-1226 is a novel drug being developed for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. It consists of CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched air and perflubron and has potential to offer rapid and potent bronchodilation. The results of the study indicate that S-1226 is safe and well tolerated. All adverse events were mild, reversible, and likely due to known side effects of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02616770">NCT02616770</ext-link>.

Furthermore, an estimated 250,000 people die prematurely as a result of asthma each year. In most cases, these deaths are avoidable and could be prevented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In 2011, 8.6&#x000a0;% of Canadians aged 12&#x000a0;years or older were reported to be diagnosed with asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Healthcare costs of asthma are considered to be among the highest associated with chronic disease. In Canada, it is estimated that 65&#x000a0;% of patients with asthma treated in general practice have poorly controlled disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, asthma is the leading cause of hospitalization, with the cost of urgent care (including hospitalizations, unscheduled physician and emergency department visits, medications, and ambulance services) associated with the disease being assessed at $46 million to $141 million per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Inhaled short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (with or without accompanying anticholinergic agents and systemic corticosteroids) represent the most common frontline emergency department treatment for acute exacerbations because of their well-known rapid bronchodilatory effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, many patients do not respond to these treatments, resulting in disproportionate consumption of healthcare resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In an acute asthma exacerbation, bronchoconstriction upon a background of mucous plugs, vascular congestion, inflammation, and airway remodeling characteristic of severe asthma can result in fatal hypoxemia. Autopsy examination reveals lungs characterized by areas of hyperinflation and collapse, as well as airways blocked by large, tenacious mucous plugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Poor response to initial therapy requires more aggressive strategies, with approximately one-third of patients with asthma admitted to intensive care units requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The latter treatment requires high pressure, resulting in barotrauma and associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The major challenge in treating acute asthma exacerbations is the need to open constricted airways rapidly enough to reestablish ventilation and allow delivery of oxygen and conventional medication to the diseased airways and to reduce the risk for barotrauma. It requires a new approach, one that takes into account both the biophysical and pharmacological aspects of acute asthma.</p><p>Our investigations resulted in the development of S-1226, an aerosol-vapor-gas mixture of CO<sub>2</sub> and perflubron. CO<sub>2</sub> and perflubron work together synergistically via both pharmacological and biophysical principles, offering a unique mechanism of action to rapidly dilate airways.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Carbon dioxide</title><p>CO<sub>2</sub> is an odorless, colorless, relatively inactive, nonflammable gas found in trace amounts in the atmosphere (0.038&#x000a0;%). It plays multiple roles in homeostasis in all living organisms and is essential for normal cellular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. When CO<sub>2</sub> is inhaled, or after it is produced by cellular respiration, it is dissolved into the blood, where it reacts with water. The carbonic enzyme that is formed when CO<sub>2</sub> undergoes hydration in the bloodstream is used in renal function and in maintaining a proper internal pH balance. CO<sub>2</sub> acts through the stimulation of chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and respiratory control centers in the brain and brainstem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] to increase breathing frequency and tidal volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. CO<sub>2</sub> also has a direct, dose-dependent, relaxant effect on vascular and bronchial smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], resulting in increased gas exchange and compliance within the lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> is a known bronchodilator for many mammalian species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In vitro studies have shown that hypercapnia relaxes airway smooth muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], whereas hypocapnia constricts it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Similar effects are seen in vivo: Hypocapnia causes bronchoconstriction in healthy individuals and patients with asthma, whereas hypercapnia reduces airway resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A study of young patients with atopic asthma demonstrated that inhalation of 6&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> over 4&#x02013;5 minutes relieved exercise-induced airflow obstruction, both at rest and during exercise, with no significant side effects reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Perflubron</title><p>Perflubron is chemically an extremely stable, inert compound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is one of the most widely used perfluorocarbons and has been used extensively in clinical applications, including bronchial lavage, liquid ventilation, and gastrointestinal contrast-enhanced imaging, with no significant toxicity, as it is not metabolized and is minimally absorbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It is hydrophobic and slightly less lipophobic than most perfluorocarbons of the same molecular weight, and it has among the greatest O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> solubilities relative to its molecular weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Perflubron also possesses high density and low surface tension, making it compatible with endogenous airway surfactant. It has mucolytic properties in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In pulmonary applications, perflubron is associated with improved lung compliance and gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In preclinical evaluations, aerosolized perflubron reduced pulmonary inflammation in addition to improving lung compliance and gas exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Thus, perflubron acts as the biophysical component of S-1226, and its effect is believed to be due to compatibility of perflubron with airway surfactant, its mucolytic properties, and its ability to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>. It may reduce inflammation and irritation by suppressing airway irritant receptors that cause bronchoconstriction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>S-1226</title><p>S-1226, the combination of CO<sub>2</sub>-enriched ambient air delivered in nebulized perflubron, was shown to rapidly open obstructed airways in a sheep model of chronic allergic asthma with an effect that was greater and more prolonged than that of either CO<sub>2</sub> or perflubron alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Moreover, studies using methacholine showed that S-1226 dilated constricted ovine airways within seconds, indicating a neural mechanism, potentially by activating noncholinergic, nonadrenergic nerves located between the epithelial cells in the bronchial mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The clinical indication for S-1226 is for the treatment of acute asthma exacerbations. It would complement existing rescue treatments for asthma, as it acts via a different mechanism to &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists such as salbutamol or cholinergic antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, the biophysical properties of S-1226 indicate that it will have mucolytic properties, thus providing relief when conventional therapies fail. If S-1226 is proven to be effective in humans, it may be possible to develop a portable rescue device similar to an EpiPen&#x000ae; (Mylan, Canonsburg, PA, USA) for patients with asthma at risk for an acute exacerbation. S-1226 also has potential for treating other obstructive airway diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis, and as a platform technology to enhance delivery of other drugs to the lung.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objective</title><p>In the present study, we sought to evaluate the safety and tolerability of S-1226, composed of 3&#x000a0;ml of perflubron with ascending doses of carbon dioxide (4&#x000a0;%, 8&#x000a0;%, and 12&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>) administered over a 2-minute nebulization period to healthy subjects. This phase I study is reported following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) 2010 checklist (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted a single-center, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential, single-ascending-dose study in Canada.

Each formulation is inhaled directly from a nebulizer over a 2-minute administration period. Subjects received, under fasting conditions, a single dose of S-1226 or matching placebo administered over 2&#x000a0;minutes with a Circulaire&#x000ae; II hybrid nebulizer system (Westmed, Tucson, AZ, USA) at a flow rate of 8.9&#x000a0;L/minute. The nebulizer was filled with either 3&#x000a0;ml of perflubron driven by a compressed medical gas mixture containing CO<sub>2</sub> (S-1226) or 3&#x000a0;ml of normal saline driven with compressed medical air (placebo). The design of the Circulaire&#x000ae; nebulizer system incorporates an inflatable reservoir bag, which collects nebulized gas during the exhalation phase so that during the inhalation phase, and the subject receives both freshly generated nebulized drug and stored nebulized drug at a sufficient rate. Thus, no ambient air is entrained into the system, ensuring that nebulized gas concentrations are maintained throughout the breathing cycle.</p><p>Three S-1226 formulations were tested:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>S-1226 (4&#x000a0;%): composed of perflubron and 4&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>S-1226 (8&#x000a0;%): composed of perflubron and 8&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub></p></list-item><list-item><p>S-1226 (12&#x000a0;%): composed of perflubron and 12&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub></p></list-item></list></p><p>Each S-1226 formulation was administered by inhalation for a period of 2&#x000a0;minutes, with 0&#x000a0;h defined as the end of nebulization. Subjects were allowed to stop treatment at any time at the appearance of adverse events (AEs), including intolerable anxiety or panic.</p><p>Subjects were confined in the clinical site for 24&#x000a0;h following administration of S-1226 for procedural and safety measures. Normally, CO<sub>2</sub> is eliminated from the body via exhalation at the same rate at which it is produced. In addition, perflubron is an extremely stable and inert compound that is excreted as a vapor during exhalation. Therefore, a 24-h confinement was long enough to collect and monitor any AEs that might occur.</p><p>No food was allowed from at least 10&#x000a0;h before dosing until at least 2&#x000a0;h after dosing. Controlled meals were served at appropriate times during the remainder of the confinement period. Meals were similar in composition for all cohorts. The evening before dosing, subjects were asked to drink at least two glasses of water (approximately 240&#x000a0;ml each). On the morning of dosing, subjects were asked to drink at least one glass of water (approximately 240&#x000a0;ml) at least 1&#x000a0;h predose. Starting at 1&#x000a0;h predose, no fluids were allowed until 1&#x000a0;h postdose. At 1&#x000a0;h after study treatment, subjects were asked to drink at least one glass (approximately 240&#x000a0;ml) of water every 4&#x000a0;h over the 12-h period following study treatment. Thereafter, water was provided ad libitum.</p><p>Safety parameters, including laboratory results and ECG, were assessed by the qualified investigator or delegate. In making the medical assessment, the clinical site criteria for laboratory and ECG acceptance ranges were used as suggested guidelines. Scheduled safety measurements were repeated according to the clinical site standard operating procedures or upon request from a physician. Any abnormal measurement was evaluated by a physician and repeated if judged necessary. No pharmacokinetic assessments of perflubron were performed, as the dose of perflubron in S-1226 is below the detection limit of headspace gas chromatography with electron capture detection, the most sensitive analytical technique to measure perflubron in the blood and urine.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>Safety and tolerability to S-1226 were evaluated through the assessment of AEs, vital signs (respiratory rate, blood pressure, and heart rate), 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory parameters (spirometry), and physical examination, as detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Safety and tolerability data were reported using descriptive statistics.</p><p>The data captured for this study allowed for adequate evaluation of the safety of the subjects after product administration. These data (AEs, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory parameters, and physical examination) were reviewed by the qualified investigator throughout the study and by the safety monitoring committee after the completion of cohorts 1 and 2. On the basis of the results of the documented measurements, the safety monitoring committee determined that all subsequent dosing could proceed according to the protocol. The collected measurements provided the qualified investigator and safety monitoring committee adequate data to assess the subjects objectively and provide a study conclusion. The efficacy of the tested products was not evaluated for this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size of 12 subjects per cohort is a number commonly used in first-in-human studies, and it was judged appropriate to achieve the study&#x02019;s objectives. A total of 36 subjects were recruited into the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>The randomization scheme was generated by PMRI. Participants were randomly assigned using the randomization procedures to either the S-1226 or the placebo group within each cohort. Randomization was carried out by using a computer-generated random list of numbers prepared and checked by designated personnel with no direct involvement with the clinical aspects of the trial. The numbered list was generated separately for each cohort before administration of the drug, and labels were placed on the unit dose package.</p><p>Both study subjects and the clinical personnel involved in the collection, monitoring, revision, or evaluation of AEs, as well as personnel who could have an impact on the outcome of the study, were blinded with respect to subject treatment assignment until the clinical phase of the study was completed (i.e., when investigation and reporting of all AEs were completed). The study personnel responsible for subject dosing were not involved in the collection, monitoring, revision, or evaluation of AEs. Designated personnel at the clinical site not directly involved with the clinical aspects of the trial prepared (including loading the nebulizer) and dispensed the study medication and were aware of the randomization code. Before administration of the drug to the participant, the appropriate individual subject randomization envelope was opened, which revealed which treatment was to be administered. Research pharmacists dispensed either the drug or placebo according to the randomization list.</p><p>In the event of an emergency, an envelope for each subject containing the subject&#x02019;s treatment assignment was available from the clinical site personnel involved with the preparation of the study medication. The qualified investigator or other attending study physician (subinvestigator) was required to make every effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a subject&#x02019;s treatment assignment and to record the date and reason for the unblinding in the study source documents.</p><p>To avoid compromising blinding of the study, S-1226 and placebo had the same visual appearance, and the same model of hospital nebulizer was used for administration of both compounds. The compressed gas mixtures were similarly blinded. The perflubron and placebo (saline) used in the study were delivered to the clinical trial facility in different forms. The perflubron was contained in 3-ml sterile bottles, while the saline was delivered in ampoules. Apart from the packaging, both were in liquid form and had the same visual appearance. Before administration to the participants, both S-1226 and placebo were repackaged into 51.75 ml snap-cap amber vials and consecutively numbered for each participant according to the randomization schedule. Each participant was assigned an order number and received the drugs in the corresponding prepacked bottle. The same model of hospital nebulizer was used for administration of both compounds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethical conduct of the study</title><p>Trained personnel obtained written informed consent from each participant prior to enrolling the participant in the study.

Alterations in mental state (e.g., restlessness, confusion) and feeling faint occurred more commonly at doses &#x02265;10&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>. Loss of consciousness occurred with longer administration times (&#x0003e;8&#x000a0;minutes where reported) and at CO<sub>2</sub> doses &#x0003e;10&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These effects are dose-dependent and reversible, returning to normal soon after treatment cessation. CO<sub>2</sub> levels are highly regulated, leading to a relatively rapid resolution of effects observed after inhalation of concentrations greater than normally occur in arterial blood and alveoli. In this study, CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 4&#x000a0;%, 8&#x000a0;%, and 12&#x000a0;% were delivered for 2&#x000a0;minutes to reduce the risk of symptoms associated with higher concentrations and extended delivery of CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Furthermore, inhaled 6&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to relieve airway obstruction with no reported AEs in patients with asthma who experience exercise-induced bronchospasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On the basis of this finding and prior clinical research with inhaled CO<sub>2</sub> and perflubron, including the presence at least 5&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in perflubron within the lungs of patients treated with perflubron as bronchial lavage or a partial liquid ventilation agent, S-1226 (4&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub>) administered for 2&#x000a0;minutes was selected as a safe starting dose. Following a safety evaluation of this concentration, 8&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> and 12&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> were subsequently delivered to subjects, with previous preclinical animal studies supporting that they would be safe and effective to administer for 2&#x000a0;minutes. This range of doses of CO<sub>2</sub> was chosen on the basis of safety studies in humans indicating that 12&#x000a0;% is the upper limit and efficacy studies in animal models of asthma.</p><p>On the basis of previous clinical research, the AEs in this study are likely accounted for as known side effects of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and not related to perflubron. The toxicology profile of perflubron is well researched, and it is considered safe to use. Perflubron is biologically inert and is not metabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It is a synthetic surfactant that has been administered to humans in high doses orally, intravenously, and by liquid instillation directly into the lungs. The majority of perflubron instilled into the lungs is eliminated from the body through respiration, as perflubron readily evaporates from surface tissues and is exhaled. In addition, very small proportions of the perflubron instilled in the respiratory tract partitions into blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It has been shown to improve lung compliance and gas exchange in pulmonary applications, and it has been marketed as a gastrointestinal imaging agent in the United States (Imagent&#x000ae; GI; Alliance Pharmaceutical Corp., San Diego, CA, USA) using a dose of 9&#x000a0;ml of perflubron per kilogram of body weight and as a bronchial lavage solution in Canada (Liquivent&#x000ae;, previously called Perflubronc&#x000ae;-B; OriGen Biomedical, Austin, TX, USA), showing it is safe to use and well tolerated by humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Both components of S-1226, perflubron and CO<sub>2</sub>, have undergone extensive clinical testing as separate agents, and their safety profiles are well known. CO<sub>2</sub> and perflubron do not chemically interact. Due to the natural elimination of CO<sub>2</sub> by respiration, clinical liquid ventilation studies with large volumes of perflubron, as well as clinical use of perflubron as a licensed bronchial lavage solution (Liquivent&#x000ae;), have involved levels of approximately 5&#x000a0;% or greater CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved in perflubron within the lungs.</p><p>S-1226 is intended for clinical use as a single-dose treatment for acute asthma exacerbations. If multiple treatments are indicated in future studies, additional safety studies will be required. S-1226 is to be used within hospital emergency rooms, where rapid treatment administration and immediate relief of acute airway obstruction are vital. S-1226 has a unique mechanism of action independent of the &#x003b2;-adrenergic and cholinergic mechanism of conventional therapies and offers a novel treatment in cases where these other therapies have proven ineffective. Moreover, S-1226 dilates airways within seconds and can be combined with traditional medications and oxygen therapy to provide more effective and sustained relief following an exacerbation. In the future, if S-1226 is shown to be effective in humans, it may be possible to develop a rescue device similar to an EpiPen&#x000ae; (Mylan) for patients with asthma to be used following an acute asthma exacerbation to rapidly dilate the airways. S-1226 may also serve as a platform technology to enhance delivery of other drugs to the lung.</p><p>On the basis of this phase I trial demonstrating the safety and tolerability of S-1226 in humans, as well as preclinical studies that have shown the efficacy of S-1226 in rapidly dilating the airways in sheep and rat models of asthma, a phase II trial designed to determine the efficacy of S-1226 in patients with mild atopic asthma has been developed and is currently ongoing. In this single-dose, placebo-controlled crossover trial, a 8&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> dose will be used. This dose was chosen because it produced the fewest AEs in the phase I trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This phase I study shows that S-1226 is safe and well tolerated when administered to healthy humans at 4&#x000a0;%, 8&#x000a0;%, and 12&#x000a0;% CO<sub>2</sub> nebulized in 3&#x000a0;ml of perflubron. All AEs associated with S-1226 were mild and reversible and were likely due to the known side effects of CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. S-1226 has the potential to be a rescue therapy for acute asthma exacerbations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE, adverse event; BMI, body mass index; ECG, electrocardiogram; FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;second; PFOB, perflubron; PK, pharmacokinetic; PMRI, Pharma Medica Research Inc.; WBC, white blood cell</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1489_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>CONSORT 2010 checklist.
