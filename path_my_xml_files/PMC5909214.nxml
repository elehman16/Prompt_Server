In this analysis of PREFER, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were assessed during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">PREFER was a two-period, 8-week crossover, double-blind, phase IV study (NCT02138747) of treatment-na&#x000ef;ve adults with OAB &#x02265;3&#x000a0;months randomized to 1 of 4 treatment sequences (M/T; T/M; M/M; T/T), separated by a 2-week washout. Tolterodine ER was dosed at 4&#x000a0;mg for 8&#x000a0;weeks and mirabegron was dosed at 25&#x000a0;mg for 4&#x000a0;weeks then increased to 50&#x000a0;mg for the next 4&#x000a0;weeks. At each visit, PROs related to treatment satisfaction, quality of life and symptom bother were assessed using the OAB Satisfaction (OAB-S; 3 independent scales/5 single-item overall assessments), OAB-q (total health-related QoL [HRQoL] and subscales [Sleep, Social, Coping, Concern] and Symptom Bother scale) and Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC) questionnaires. Responder rates were reported for OAB-q subscales based on a minimal important difference (MID; &#x02265; 10-point improvement) and OAB-S Medication Tolerability score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;90.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">In total, 358 randomized patients received &#x02265;1 dose of double-blind study medication and completed &#x02265;1 post-baseline value (OAB-S scale, OAB-q, PPBC): M/T (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;154), T/M (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;144), M/M (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;30) or T/T (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;30). At end of treatment (EoT), mirabegron and tolterodine ER were associated with similar mean improvements in 7 of the 8 OAB-S scores investigated, OAB-q scales and PPBC.

The prevalence of OAB increases with age and is expected to affect 1 in 10 people by 2018 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The chronic nature of OAB and severity of symptoms makes it problematic for many patients, often resulting in significant deterioration in quality of life (QoL), depression and social isolation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Significant economic consequences are associated with OAB as a result of health resource costs and decreased work productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Patients with OAB tend to seek treatment once their QoL is affected, and are more likely to persist with their medication if they perceive meaningful improvements in QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This underlies the importance of evaluating the benefits of a treatment not only according to objective changes in bladder parameters (e.g. micturition frequency, incontinence episodes) but also via subjective outcomes related to QoL, perception of symptoms, and general well-being. Validated bladder health questionnaires include the OAB-questionnaire (OAB-q), Patient Perception of Bladder Condition (PPBC), and OAB-Treatment Satisfaction (OAB-S) questionnaire. The OAB-q is useful for assessing treatment effects on various aspects of QoL such as social interaction, coping, sleep, and the extent of bother associated with symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and the single-item PPBC evaluates patients&#x02019; perception of their current bladder problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, neither the OAB-q or PPBC explores additional factors related to patient satisfaction with their medication. The OAB-S was developed to measure the &#x02018;multidimensional concept&#x02019; of treatment satisfaction over a number of domains, including 5 independent scales (OAB Control Expectations, Impact on Daily Living with OAB, OAB Control, OAB Medication Tolerability, and Satisfaction with OAB Control) and 5 single-item overall assessments (Patient&#x02019;s Fulfillment of OAB Medication Expectations, Interruption of Day-to-Day Life Due to OAB, Overall Satisfaction with OAB Medication, Willingness to Continue OAB Medication, and Improvement in Day-to-Day Life Due to OAB Medication) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Communicating the clinically meaningful benefits of treatment to the patient can be simplified through the use of responder analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These clinically meaningful changes are often expressed as specific differences or thresholds, known as a minimally important difference (MID). The MID is assessed at the individual level of analysis such that changes consistent in magnitude with the MID in individual PROs over time are interpreted as a treatment benefit in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The MID is defined as &#x0201c;the smallest difference in score in the domain of interest that patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate, in the absence of troublesome side effects and excessive costs, a change in patient management&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This approach is used to categorize patients into two distinct groups based on those who attain a treatment benefit in the PRO (&#x02018;responder&#x02019;) vs those who do not attain a treatment benefit (&#x02018;non-responder&#x02019;). For PROs in which no MID has been established, responders to OAB treatment have been variably defined and have included positive response categories to specific questionnaire items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Mirabegron (&#x003b2;3-adrenoceptor agonist) and tolterodine (antimuscarinic) belong to the two classes of oral pharmacotherapies used to treat OAB. Both drugs have similar efficacy in decreasing OAB symptoms of urinary urgency, frequency and incontinence. The different mechanism of action of mirabegron, however, is associated with a lower frequency of specific antimuscarinic side effects, such as blurred vision and dry mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Dry mouth is the most frequent and bothersome side effect reported with antimuscarinics, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and one of the main reasons patients discontinue antimuscarinic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Potential differences in tolerability between antimuscarinics and mirabegron may confer clinically meaningful improvements in health-related QoL (HRQoL), treatment satisfaction, and persistence. Medication tolerability can be an issue in both treatment-experienced and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients; however, the treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients have lower rates of persistence at 12&#x000a0;months, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] which may be a consequence of higher treatment expectations or a lower tolerability threshold compared with treatment-experienced patients.</p><p id="Par24">In clinical practice, the successful management of OAB demands greater focus on demonstrable benefits in PROs rather than relying solely on reductions in bladder symptoms. Each patient is different in terms of how he or she experiences symptoms and responds to treatment, according to his or her own priorities, expectations, and attitudes. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to evaluating efficacy and tolerability that considers the impact of symptoms on the individual&#x02019;s experience and lifestyle may be predictive of long-term persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">A crossover study design is a methodology for comparing two or more therapies in the same patient and obviates the need to account for inter-patient variability. PREFER was a phase IV, crossover trial in patients with OAB in which a statistically significantly higher OAB-S Medication Tolerability score (the primary endpoint), implying better tolerability, was demonstrated with mirabegron vs tolterodine extended release (ER) 4&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Mirabegron was also associated with significantly fewer anticholinergic side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, improved tolerability did not translate into preference for mirabegron (the secondary endpoint). Herein PROs and corresponding responder rates from the PREFER study are reported to further explore potential treatment differences and identify outcomes that may be predictive of treatment success.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par26">PREFER (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> NCT02138747) was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, double-blind, higher order (i.e. more periods/sequences than number of treatments being compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]), two-period crossover, phase IV study, conducted in 36 sites (28 sites in the United States and 8 sites in Canada) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">The study design has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Some of the OAB-S modules, such as Medication Tolerability, are not completed at baseline but only at follow-up. In both 8-week treatment periods, the OAB-S premedication questionnaire (OAB Control Expectations and Impact of Daily Living with OAB) was completed at baseline only, the OAB-S medication questionnaire (Impact of Daily Living with OAB, OAB Control, OAB Medication Tolerability, Satisfaction with OAB Control, Fulfillment of OAB Medication Expectations, Overall Satisfaction with OAB Medication, Willingness to Continue OAB Medication, and Improvement in Day-to-Day Life with OAB Medication) was completed at each follow-up visit, and the OAB-S medication questionnaire module, Interruption of Day to-Day Life due to OAB, was assessed at baseline and at each follow-up visit. The OAB-S Medication Tolerability scale results were reported previously in the primary analysis of PREFER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

For the OAB Control, Satisfaction with OAB Control and Impact on Daily Living with OAB scales, at least five out of the ten items (50%) in each scale had to be completed to compute a scale score. The OAB-S does not have a published MID score; instead various &#x0201c;responder&#x0201d; definitions have been used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">The impact of OAB symptoms on HRQoL and the severity of symptom bother experienced by the patient was assessed by the OAB-q. The OAB-q is a self-reported questionnaire with 33 items, each rated on a 6-point Likert scale, and comprises an 8-item Symptom Bother scale (scores ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate greater symptom bother) and 25 HRQoL items (from the HRQoL subscales Coping, Concern, Sleep and Social Interaction [scores ranged from 0 to 100; higher scores indicate better QoL]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The HRQoL total score is calculated by summating the individual HRQoL subscale scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The OAB-q has a well-established MID of 10 points that detects clinically meaningful changes in score. Coyne et al. developed the MID for the OAB-q via distribution and anchor-based analyses. They showed that a greater change score was related to greater patient perceived treatment benefit and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par32">The PPBC uses a 6-point Likert scale to rate patient&#x02019;s impression of their current bladder condition (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;causes no problems, 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;causes many severe problems) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

It is therefore imperative to measure treatment outcomes that reflect how the patient perceives changes in their symptoms and subsequent changes to their daily life. This approach is also more likely to help differentiate OAB treatments, as objective measures of bladder symptoms are usually of a similar magnitude between antimuscarinic agents and mirabegron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">In PREFER, which consisted of a treatment-na&#x000ef;ve population characterized by moderate levels of symptom bother and disruption to daily activities, the average improvement over time in PROs, as measured by the OAB-S, OAB-q and PPBC questionnaires, were comparable during treatment with mirabegron vs tolterodine ER with the exception of the OAB-S Medication Tolerability score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although most PROs improved over time, both treatments were similarly associated with a decrease in the OAB-S assessment of Willingness to Continue OAB Medication.

Treatment expectations may have been higher, and the tolerability threshold lower, in this treatment-na&#x000ef;ve population compared with previously treated patients, which may have contributed to the decrease over time in Willingness to Continue OAB Medication that was observed with both study drugs. In the majority of OAB-S scales, the 4-week results with mirabegron were lower than tolterodine ER, but at 8&#x000a0;weeks mirabegron was associated with higher scores than tolterodine ER. This may have been due to a suboptimal duration of treatment for mirabegron at 4&#x000a0;weeks, or that some patients do not respond to the 25&#x000a0;mg dose.</p><p id="Par51">Similar improvements over time with mirabegron and tolterodine ER were evident for each scale of the OAB-q and PPBC.

A real-world evaluation of the OAB-S in older adults starting mirabegron or an antimuscarinic showed similar trends in PRO improvement over time, but without differences between mirabegron and antimuscarinics, despite mirabegron patients being older and having a higher burden of comorbidities and prior treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, failure of the PREFER study to detect these differences over time may have been due to inadequate adjustment for confounders such as comorbidities and age, which may affect PRO outcomes. The randomized crossover higher order design should have accounted for these potential issues and we do believe that any influence of sequence or period on PROs is unlikely given the lack of a period-by-treatment interaction effect on tolerability scores in the previous analysis of PREFER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite a 2-week washout period, the slight improvement in PRO scores in period 2 is possibly indicative of some carryover effect, despite far greater than 5 half-lives of drug washout. Moreover, the higher order design, whereby sequences in which patients received the same drug twice were included, allowed within-patient estimates of treatment effect irrespective of carryover effect. Also evident from the previous analysis of PREFER was that tolerability was not the main reason patients gave for their preference of medication at the end of the study, with only 24.7% and 18.7% of patients choosing &#x0201c;tolerated better&#x0201d; during treatment as the reason for their preference with mirabegron and tolterodine ER, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore if patients value improvement in their symptoms over fewer side effects, differences in tolerability are only one piece of the puzzle. The relatively shorter treatment period in this study (8&#x000a0;weeks) compared with most OAB trials (12&#x000a0;weeks) may also have contributed to the lack of treatment differences; for example, patients experiencing side effects such as dry mouth for 8&#x000a0;weeks may not be as bothered as they might after 12&#x000a0;weeks. It is also worth noting that while mirabegron 25&#x000a0;mg demonstrates good efficacy at 4&#x000a0;weeks, maximal efficacy is not reached until 8&#x000a0;weeks and hence the maximal efficacy was reached as the patients were approaching the washout/switch period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A handheld electronic device was used to record PROs. Although this approach has been shown to improve the accuracy and reliability of recording bladder diary parameters versus a paper diary, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] we have not found validation of the PROs used in this study for the electronic device. The electronic recording of the PROs used in this study may be a potential limitation; however, we would have no reason to believe that the instruments would behave differently in the two time periods in a crossover study.</p><p id="Par55">PREFER is the first late-phase OAB clinical trial to utilize a crossover design and explore PROs related to QoL and satisfaction, including responder analyses to assess clinically relevant improvements. By measuring PROs using three validated questionnaires, PREFER presents a comprehensive analysis of the patient&#x02019;s experience of mirabegron and tolterodine ER treatment during the 20-week study. Combining the multidimensional concept of treatment satisfaction (OAB-S), aspects of QoL, symptom bother and perceptions of bladder condition ensures that the most important components of the patient&#x02019;s lifestyle and wellbeing is measured following treatment. Despite previously demonstrating a difference in tolerability in favor of mirabegron, which was accompanied by a reduced rate of anticholinergic side effects, there were no differences in average scores over time between mirabegron and tolterodine ER for other scales of the OAB-S, OAB-q and PPBC. However, the proportion of patients achieving clinically relevant improvements in the overall scores for these questionnaires as measured by the MID or patients who were not bothered by the drug side effect was consistently higher with mirabegron than tolterodine ER.</p><p id="Par56">Sample size calculations for PREFER were based on the primary endpoint (OAB-S Medication Tolerability Score), but not for other outcomes. Specifically because the other PROs were exploratory in nature, hypothesis testing of the other PROs was not done. Although multivariate analysis corrected for sex and baseline values was carried out, it is possible that important covariates such as age and comorbidities that may have had an impact were missed. However, other randomized controlled trials that have used other PROs have not controlled for comorbidities, and have found differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Phase IV studies of both treatment-na&#x000ef;ve and -experienced patients, have demonstrated higher persistence with mirabegron vs antimuscarinics, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] which may be a consequence of greater tolerability and preference for mirabegron. The relationship between treatment preference, patient behavior and persistence requires further investigation to determine who derives the most benefit from the different treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par58">Patients with OAB reported improvements in treatment satisfaction, QoL and symptom bother that were of a similar magnitude during treatment with mirabegron and tolterodine ER. A higher percentage of patients achieved clinically relevant improvements in the OAB-S Medication Tolerability score and OAB-q during mirabegron treatment than tolterodine ER. Further studies are recommended to identify factors related to OAB (i.e. symptom severity) and the patient (i.e. age, lifestyle factors) that are predictive of treatment success and longer term persistence and compliance.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p id="Par6">Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EoT</term><def><p id="Par8">End of treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FAS</term><def><p id="Par9">Full analysis set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRQoL</term><def><p id="Par10">Health-related quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAB</term><def><p id="Par11">Overactive bladder</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAB-q</term><def><p id="Par12">OAB-questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OAB-S</term><def><p id="Par13">OAB-satisfaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPBC</term><def><p id="Par14">Patient Perception of Bladder Condition</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PREFER</term><def><p id="Par15">A Prospective, double-blind, Randomized, two-period, crossover, multicenter study to Evaluate the tolerability and patient preference between Myrbetriq&#x000ae; and Detrol&#x000ae; LA in subjects with overactive bladder (OAB)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRO</term><def><p id="Par16">Patient-reported outcomes</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QoL</term><def><p id="Par17">Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE</term><def><p id="Par18">Standard error</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors received editorial assistance from Stuart Murray, MSc (Envision Scientific Solutions), for the preparation of the initial and final drafts of the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par59">The PREFER study was funded by Astellas Pharma Inc. and designed and analyzed by Astellas in collaboration with the authors.
