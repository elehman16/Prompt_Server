Exposure to petrochemical contaminants such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes and diesel exhaust particulate leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals, which in turn would result in increased oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Increase in oxidative stress is widely thought as a mechanism involved in developing cancer, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cardiac disease, neurological and psychiatric disorders.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Moreover, increased risk of some cancers such as melanoma, bladder and prostate carcinoma and pulmonary mesothelioma has been reported in petrochemical workers.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>There are several strategies to reduce oxidative stress including use of antioxidants especially vitamins A, C, and E,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] carotenoids,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] polyphenols[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] as well as diets rich in vegetables and fruits.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recently, the use of probiotics to reduce the oxidative stress has been proposed. Probiotics are microorganisms that are believed to provide health benefits for humans and animals when consumed.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] To the best of knowledge of the authors, no studies are available indicating the effects of probiotics on biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors among petrochemical workers.

We hypothesized that probiotic supplementation might positively affect biomarkers oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in petrochemical workers. As to our knowledge no previous study has evaluated effects of probiotics on biomarkers oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in petrochemical workers, the aim of our study was to determine effects of probiotic yoghurt and multispecies probiotic supplements on biomarkers oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in petrochemical workers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was performed in Tehran, Iran, during February 2014 to March 2014. The current study was approved by the ethical committee of research deputy of Tehran University of Medical Sciences. All procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national) and with the Helsinki's Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008. In addition, we obtained written informed consent from all subjects. The trial was registered in the Iranian website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.irct.ir">www.irct.ir</ext-link>) for registration of clinical trials (IRCT code: IRCT201406222394N11). Petrochemical workers and aged 20&#x02013;60 years old were included in this study. Individuals were excluded if they were using insulin or vitamin supplements, or had chronic kidney disease, lung and chronic or acute inflammatory disease, hepatic or thyroid diseases, severe intestinal disease, peptic ulcer, pregnant, allergies or the use of antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs. Based on the suggested formula for parallel clinical trials, considering the type one error of 5% and the study power of 80%, we reached the sample size of 10 for each group. However, we recruited 13 persons in each group (totally, 39 persons) to compensate for the probable loss to follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>To obtain detailed information about the dietary intakes of study participants, all workers entered into a 2-week run-in period; during which all persons had to refrain from taking any other probiotic or synbiotic food. During the run-in period after stratification for body mass index (BMI) (&#x0003c;30 and &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and age (&#x0003c;40 and &#x02265;40 year), participants were requested to record their dietary intakes for three nonconsecutive days. At the end of run-in period, subjects were randomly divided into three groups to receive 100 g/day probiotic yogurt + one placebo capsule (<italic>n</italic> = 12) or one probiotic capsule daily +100 g/day conventional yogurt (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or 100 g/day conventional yogurt + one placebo capsule (<italic>n</italic> = 10) for 6 weeks. Randomization and allocation were concealed from the researcher and participants until after the main analyses had been completed. A trained nutritionist at petrochemical technology company did the randomized allocation sequence, enrolled participants and assigned participants to interventions. In during intervention, subjects were asked not to change their routine physical activity or usual diets and not to consume any probiotic products other than the one provided to them by the investigators. In addition, they were asked to avoid consuming any fermented and synbiotic products. Probiotic and conventional yogurts or multispecies probiotic supplements were provided for participants every day. All participants provided three dietary records (1 weekend day and 2 weekdays) throughout the intervention and three physical activity records to make sure that they maintained their usual diet and physical activity during the study. Both dietary and physical activity records were taken at week 1, 3 and 5 of the intervention. The dietary records were based on estimated values in household measurements. To obtain nutrient intakes of participants based on these 3-day food diaries, we used Nutritionist IV Software (First Databank, San Bruno, CA, USA) modified for Iranian foods.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Assessment of variables</title><p>Weight was measured at the beginning study and 6 weeks after the intervention at petrochemical technology company, Tehran, Iran by trained nutritionist. Body weight was measured in an overnight fasting status without shoes in a minimal clothing state by the use of a digital scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height was measured using a nonstretched tape measure (Seca, Hamburg, Germany) to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated using the height and weight measurements (weight in kg/[height in meters]<sup>2</sup>). Fasting blood samples (10 mL) were obtained at the beginning study and end-of-trial at Kavosh medical laboratory in an early morning after an overnight fast. Blood was collected in 2 separate tubes: (1) One without EDTA to separate the serum, in order to quantify serum 8-oxo-7, 8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-G), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and interferon gamma (INF-&#x003b3;) levels and (2) another one containing EDTA to examine protein carbonyl (PC) and prostaglandin F2-alpha (8-iso-PGF2a). Blood samples were immediately centrifuged (Universal, Germany) at 3500 rpm for 10 min to separate serum. Then, the samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until analysis at the Kavosh medical laboratory.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>In the present study, the primary outcomes were biomarkers of oxidative stress including PC, 8-iso-PGF2a and 8-oxo-G.

The major finding was that probiotic yoghurt and multispecies probiotic capsule supplementation had favorable effects on the biomarkers of oxidative stress in petrochemical workers. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first that reports the effect of probiotic yoghurt and multispecies probiotic capsule supplementation on biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammatory factors in petrochemical workers. Petrochemical workers are susceptible to increase in oxidative stress.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The current study demonstrated that consumption of probiotic capsule has resulted in significant decreases in plasma PC and iso prostaglandin levels as well as taking probiotic yogurt led to a significant reduction in plasma PC levels among petrochemical workers for 6 weeks, but did not affect serum 8-dihydroguanine levels. In consistent with our study, Lamprecht <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that probiotic supplementation for 14 weeks decreased PC levels among athletes, but it was not statistically significant. In addition, <italic>B. breve</italic> attenuated oxidative stress in skin via preventing ROS generation and suppressing oxidation of protein and lipids and xanthine oxidase activity.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The same as findings was also observed following the administration of <italic>B. longum</italic> during industrial process[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and taking multispecies probiotic capsule among diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] In another study, Asemi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] demonstrated a significant reduction in dihydroguanine levels after intake of probiotic yogurt containing <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and <italic>B. lactis</italic> among pregnant women after 9 weeks. However, some researchers could not observe such beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on the biomarkers of oxidative. For instance, taking a probiotic preparation (VSL#3) for 7 days could not affect biomarkers of oxidative stress among critically ill patients.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In addition, received multi-species probiotics supplements (10<sup>10</sup> CFU/day) for 14 weeks did not affect malondialdehyde levels among men.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The beneficial effects of intake of probiotics on biomarkers of oxidative stress might be attributed to its impact on decreased lipid peroxidation such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein, 8-isoprostanes and GSH redox ratio[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and increased GSH levels in skin and serum through augmentation of glutamate-cysteine-ligase activity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Our study revealed that intake of probiotic yogurt and probiotic capsule did not influence inflammatory factors among petrochemical workers for 6 weeks. Previous studies, the beneficial effects of probiotics on inflammatory factors have reported among immune-compromised patients[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and patients with rheumatoid arthritis.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In line with our study, administration of two Lactobacillus strains, one Bifidobacterium strain, one Propionibacterium strain plus galacto-oligosaccharides did not affect serum CRP levels among men with a low serum enterolactone concentration after 6 weeks.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In addition, taking 1500 mg probiotic capsules containing <italic>L. acidophilus</italic>, <italic>L. bulgaricus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus bifidum</italic> and <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> twice daily was shown no significant changes in inflammatory factors among diabetic patients after 6 weeks.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, the consumption of probiotic yoghurt containing <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> among pregnant women after 9 weeks[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and administration of Bifidobacterium supplements among patients undergoing resection for colorectal cancer[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] has resulted in decreased inflammatory markers. The absent effect of probiotic consumption on inflammatory factors levels in the present study may be result from different study designs, the dosage of used probiotic, the patients under investigation, sample size as well as duration of supplementation.</p><p>Some limitations must be taken into account in the interpretation of our findings. Small sample size and short period of supplementation were two main limitations of our study. Long-term interventions might result in greater changes in circulating levels of makers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, using other oxidative stress biomarkers including malondialdehyde, GSH reductase, GSH peroxidase and superoxide dismutase could be helpful in the interpretation of results. However, we believed that the assessment of fecal short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) is an appropriate method for compliance, due to budget limitation; we did not assess effects of probiotic on fecal SCFA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Taken together, consumption of probiotic yogurt or multispecies probiotic capsule had beneficial effects on biomarkers of oxidative stress in petrochemical workers but did not affect 8-dihydroguanine and inflammatory factors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to the Research and Development Division of Iran Dairy Industry Corporation (IDIC-Pegah) and Zist Takhmir knowledge-based company, Tehran, Iran that provided the dairy products for the present study.
