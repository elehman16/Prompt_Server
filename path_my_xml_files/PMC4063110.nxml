This is a randomized prospective double blind clinical trial conducted on 40 patients (d = 0.2). The study was performed in 2012 in martyr Chamran heart hospital. The inclusion criteria were: (1) Patients candidate for aorta and/or mitral valve with/without tricuspid valve replacement surgery, (2) ejection fraction &#x0003e;40%, (3) patients without history of previous heart surgery, esophageal surgery, dysphasia and odynophagia.</p><p>The applied exclusion criterion was: Intra-aortic balloon pump requirement while weaning from CPB.</p><p>Patients satisfying inclusion criteria were informed about the whole procedure and signed consent was obtained. Patients were randomly assigned to control and CPAP group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) through the table of random numbers. Anesthesiologist, the echo cardiographer and statistical analyst were blinded to both groups. Both groups were visited by anesthesiologist and received identical premedication one night prior the surgery. Patients were monitored in the operation room for pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, invasive blood pressure measuring, temperature, urine output, central venous pressure and capnography. Patients were anesthetized through standard manner in both CPAP and control group. The anesthesia machine was Drager (Fabius). Initial setting for respiratory ventilation was: (1) Tidal volume: 8-10 ml/kg (2) ventilation frequency: 10-12 breath/min (3) maximum ventilation pressure: 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (4) inspiratory/expiratory ratio: 1:2 (5) positive end expiratory pressure: 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (6) relative inspiratory pause: 10% (7) fresh gas flow: 100% oxygen. This setting was adjusted to achieve end tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide about 35-40 mmHg in capnography. The TEE probe was placed in oesophagus and primary echocardiography (midesophageal four chamber view) was performed 10 min after the induction of anesthesia and before administration of heparin. The probe remained in esophagus throughout the whole surgery. After administration of heparin and reaching activated clotting time of over 460 s, cannulation of the ascending aorta and superior and inferior vena cava was performed in all patients. Surgery was performed using pulseless Roller pump. During CPB, the mean arterial pressure was kept between 60 and 90 mmHg, mild hypothermia was used, the hemoglobin concentration was kept over 7 g/dl and PH was controlled using &#x003b1;-stat.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Control group</title><p>During the surgery and CPB, the ventilator (Drager, Fabius) was turned off and the flow of fresh air was totally ceased and adjustable pressure limit (APL) valve was placed in SPONT position.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>CPAP group</title><p>During CPB, after turning the ventilator off, the flow of oxygen flow was maintained at the rate of 0.5 L/min and the APL valve was placed in MAN position on 20 mbar (20 hectopascal, 15 mmHg).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>During the surgery</title><p>The vent catheter was placed in right upper pulmonary vein in order to keep the surgical site free of blood.</p><p>After completion of the surgery, de-airing procedure and weaning from CPB was started under TEE monitoring if the serum potassium level was less than 6 mmol/dl, normothermic state was established, the arterial blood gas was normal and no cardiac arrhythmia was detected. The lungs were ventilated. The Vent catheter was placed in LV apex and aortic root and primary de-airing of these areas was performed. The aortic clamp was released afterwards. The patient was placed in the head down position, venous return of CPB was gradually reduced by the surgeon, the cardiac chambers were gradually filled and cardiac ejection was begun. The patient was continually observed for air emboli in left atrium using TEE and de-airing was continued if needed. De-airing procedure was continued until the left atrium was free from air emboli.</p><p>For the 1<sup>st</sup> time for evaluation of severity of air bubbles occupation in the left atrium we purpose new classification into 3 grades on TEE:</p><p>Mild: If air bubbles occupied less than 25% of the left atrium area.</p><p>Moderate: If air bubbles occupied 25-50% of the left atrium area.</p><p>Severe: If air bubbles occupied more than 50% of the left atrium area.</p><p>During the survey, the patient demographic data was recorded in a check list as well as duration of de-airing after starting mechanical ventilation of lungs, duration of de-airing after cardiac ejection and duration of the left atrium air bubble occupation graded as mild, moderate, severe in the left atrium.</p><p>After weaning from CPB and hemodynamic stability, the heparin was reversed with protamine at 1:1.5 ratio of the initial heparin dose.

Their study showed that de-airing quality was better in the control group.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In contrast to their study, our survey demonstrated that during open heart surgery, CPAP significantly increased the de-airing quality compared to when the ventilator was turned off.</p><p>This is the first study on the effects of CPAP on de-airing during CPB in open heart surgery. CPAP increases intra-thoracic pressure, which prevents the air entering from the surgical field into lung bloodstream. During CPB weaning especially after ventricular ejection beginning, air bubbles enter the heart chambers mainly through the pulmonary veins, therefore increased intra-thoracic pressure by CPAP during CPB stops the air bubble from entering into the pulmonary veins.</p><p>As mentioned above, the duration of the de-airing was shorter in the CPAP group than in the control group in the severe, moderate and mild grades.</p><p>It was observed that duration of the de-airing process from ventilation and ventricular ejection beginning until complete de-airing were significantly lower in CPAP group.</p><p>One of the important findings in this study was that in a number of patients in the CPAP group undergoing CPAP during CPB the amount of air bubbles in left atrium never reached the severe grade.</p><p>We demonstrated that this is an easy, simple and cost-effective way for facilitating de-airing and reducing the risk of air emboli.</p><p>We hope that this study hold a way in open heart surgery for reducing of air trapping and reduce air emboli and other complication that related to air embolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>By CPAP at
