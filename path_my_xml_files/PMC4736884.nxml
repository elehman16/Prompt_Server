Subjects were randomized into misoprostol or placebo group with the sample size ratio set to 7:2. Intravaginal 25-&#x003bc;g misoprostol or placebo was applied at an interval of 4 h (repeated up to 3 times) for labor induction. Primary outcome measures were the incidence of cumulative Bishop score increases &#x02265;3 within 12 h or vaginal delivery within 24 h.

Data from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Survey on Maternal and Perinatal Health between 2004 and 2008 showed that 9.6% of all the deliveries involved labor induction. Among the countries surveyed, the incidence of labor induction of America was 11.4%, while that of China was only 6.4%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In the United States, the incidence of labor induction increased significantly from 9.0% in 1989 to 18.4% in 1997, to over 23% in 2009.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In China, however, changes of nationwide data of the incidence of labor induction are still lacking.</p><p>On the other hand, increasing the incidence of the cesarean section has become a public health problem in China since the past 20 years.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Apart from the nonclinical factors that drive women and obstetricians to choose cesareans, failure of induce labor and lack of an effective medicine to induce labor in China, are two of the main clinical reasons for the increased rate.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Some women choose elective cesarean sections just because they are worried about an unsuccessful labor induction.</p><p>Prostaglandins (PGs) are widely used for cervical ripening and labor induction; according to the Chinese guideline for cervical ripening and labor induction in late pregnancy, dinoprostone and misoprostol are both recommended.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Vaginal prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (dinoprostone) has been shown to increase the chance of vaginal delivery in 24 h compared with a placebo.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, dinoprostone is costly and must be refrigerated or frozen during transportation and storage because of its thermal instability, which restricts its use in undeveloped regions in China.</p><p>Misoprostol is a synthetic PGE1 analog. Vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be associated with less use of epidural analgesia, more vaginal deliveries within 24 h, and more uterine hyperstimulation compared with vaginal PGE2.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Compared with dinoprostone, misoprostol is stable at the room temperature, which is more convenient for storage and administer;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] moreover, its relatively inexpensive price makes it more acceptable. Although 25-&#x003bc;g misoprostol is recommended in the Chinese guidelines for labor induction, no tablets with an accurate 25-&#x003bc;g dose of misoprostol are currently available in China.</p><p>In this study, we conducted the first double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravaginal misoprostol in cervical ripening and labor induction in term pregnancy in nulliparous women, by using a misoprostol tablet with 25-&#x003bc;g dosage. We hope our data from Chinese women can contribute to the world's database of using misoprostol as a labor inductor, and help to reduce the high incidence of cesarean section in this country.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled clinical study of misoprostol was conducted in 6 university hospitals across China from May 2012 to February 2013.

All women provided informed consent prior to participation in the study. All subjects were aged 20 years or older; had a gestational age between 37 and 42 weeks, with head fetal presentation and intact amniotic membrane. All subjects were induced labor for the indications according to the Chinese guideline of cervical ripening and labor induction during the third trimester pregnancy (draft)[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] but demonstrated an unfavorable cervix (cervical Bishop score &#x02264;6). Women were excluded if any of the following criteria was met: Placenta previa, placenta abruption, breech or transverse presentation, significant cephalopelvic disproportion, preeclampsia or eclampsia, suspected macrosomia, emergent fetal distress, fetal congenital malformation, and prior uterine surgical procedure history. Women with severe chronic diseases of the cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematopoietic, endocrine, or immune system; acute infection; cervical carcinoma; and contra-indications for the use of PG analogues (glaucoma, asthma, epilepsy, and allergy to PG) were also excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size</title><p>The incidences of vaginal deliveries achieved within 24 h ranged from 61.3% to 75% for the misoprostol group and 0&#x02013;10% for the placebo group; the Bishop scoring increases &#x02265;3 in 12 h were about 50% for the misoprostol group and 25% for the placebo group.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] We estimated the sample size according to the incidences of Bishop scoring changes, which needed more sample size than those of vaginal deliveries within 24 h did, at a two-sided alpha = 0.05 with 80% power. To determine as many adverse events of misoprostol as possible, the sample size ratio of the misoprostol: Placebo group was set to 3:1. Using PASS software, we determined the sample size of 41 for placebo, and 123 for misoprostol group. For consideration of the sample loss rate, we increased the sample size by 20% for the placebo group and 40% for the misoprostol group. Finally, a final total sample size of 225, with 175 patients receiving misoprostol and 50 receiving placebo (at a ratio of 7:2), was decided.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned to the misoprostol or placebo group. Both participants and investigators were masked to group assignment, and data remained blinded to researchers until study enrollment was complete. Block randomization was used to provide balanced enrollment among the hospitals. Randomized via a computerized randomization sequence, misoprostol: Placebo ratio was set to 7:2 in each block. A total of 25 blocks were distributed among the hospitals. In case of emergent unblinding, an envelope with a blinding code and the participant's group was distributed with the tablets to the investigators.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Treatment</title><p>Tablets of 25-&#x003bc;g misoprostol or placebo were applied into the posterior fornix of the vagina at an interval of 4 h (repeated up to 3 times) for labor induction.

Eight hours after the third tablet of misoprostol was provided, this woman underwent a cesarean section, because her baby showed a frequent late deceleration in the latent period. During the section, this woman experienced a blood loss of over 5000 ml due to uterine atony, and her vital signs were unstable until she underwent the hysterectomy.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>This study is the first double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of intravaginal misoprostol in cervical ripening and labor induction in term pregnancy in China. We found that, compared with the placebo, 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal misoprostol significantly increased the incidence of cumulative Bishop score increases &#x02265;3 within 12 h or vaginal delivery within 24 h from the start of labor induction, without significantly increasing the maternal and fetal complications and adverse events, which is consistent with other previous studies on the topic.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Our data also showed that 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal misoprostol significantly increased the incidence of onset of labor within 24 h and reduced the induction-onset of labor interval when compared with a placebo, which is in agreement with previous reports.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Our findings suggested intravaginal misoprostol 25 &#x003bc;g is efficacious and safe in labor induction and cervical ripening in term pregnancy.</p><p>On the other hand, 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal did not significantly reduce the median duration of vaginal labor. Further, when we compared the duration of each of the three periods of vaginal labor between the two groups, we similarly did not find any significant difference between the misoprostol and placebo groups (data not shown). This result differs from that of two other randomized controlled trials,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which reported a shorter duration of the latency period or active period in the misoprostol group. However, both of these previous studies lacked placebo controls, and may hence have an inherent performance and/or detection bias. Our double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled study suggested that 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal misoprostol could only shorten the induction-onset of labor interval, but it does not have prolonged effects on the process of vaginal labor, as long as the labor starts.</p><p>Herein, although we found that the incidence of caesarean section deliveries in the misoprostol group tended to be lower than in the placebo group, no significant difference was found. Similarly, when analyzing the indication of cesarean section, although we found that there was a trend of more operations for fetal distress and fewer for prolonged labor progress in the misoprostol group, it did not reach statistical significance. In the previous studies about misoprostol use in labor induction, the rates of caesarean section in the misoprostol groups were inconsistent, although they tended to be reduced.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] A recent network meta-analysis of labor induction with PGs found that intravaginal misoprostol (both tablets &#x0003c;50 &#x003bc;g and &#x02265;50 &#x003bc;g) significantly reduced the cesarean section risk compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The insignificance of the difference of the cesarean section rate between the misoprostol and placebo groups in our study might be attributable to the limited numbers of patients recruited, and the effect of misoprostol on reducing the cesarean section rate should be further studied in the future.</p><p>In terms of the safety assessments, although there were no significant differences in the incidences of the adverse events/serious adverse events between the two groups, there were still some severe adverse events, including one case of hysterectomy due to overwhelming postpartum hemorrhage caused by uterine atony in the misoprostol group. In the previous studies of misoprostol in labor induction, neonatal and maternal mortality, and serious morbidity outcomes are often too rare or poorly reported. Our study suggests that, although the incidence of serious adverse events of intravaginal misoprostol insert for labor induction was low, clinicians should still be careful and be aware of the possible complications when using misoprostol for labor induction.</p><p>In our study, intravaginal 25-&#x003bc;g misoprostol applied every 4 h was found to be effective and safe. Our protocol was decided according to the FIGO Misoprostol Recommended Dosages, which changed to intravaginal 25-&#x003bc;g misoprostol every 6 h in 2012, after we had fixed our protocol. Until now, no study has been performed on the differences between 4-hourly and 6-hourly intravaginal misoprostol in labor induction, although both interval hours have been used in the clinical studies. Thus, more studies are needed to determine the optimal interval time for intravaginal misoprostol as a labor inducer.</p><p>Although this was a randomized, double-blinded, controlled study, several limitations exist. First, the inclusion and exclusion criteria may limit the generalizability of the data, particularly the stringent criterion of exclusion of any maternal or fetal compromise. Moreover, the solubility of the misoprostol tablets in the vagina, which might affect the onset time of the effectiveness of the tablets, was not recorded in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, our study suggested that 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal misoprostol every 4 h is efficacious in labor induction and cervical ripening without significantly increasing the rates of maternal and fetal complications and adverse events. Further, 25-&#x003bc;g intravaginal misoprostol could reduce the induction-onset of labor interval, but did not show any effects on the process of vaginal labor. Clinicians should always be vigilant of the maternal and fetal complications when using misoprostol as a labor inducer. Herein, we provided data from the first double-blinded, prospective randomized controlled study on misoprostol for cervical ripening and labor induction in China. Our data from Chinese women can contribute to the world's database of using misoprostol as a labor inductor, and help to reduce the high incidence of cesarean section in this country.</p><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Guangzhou Regenex Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Guangzhou, China.
