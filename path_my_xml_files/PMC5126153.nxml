Subclavian vein puncture has faster learning curve, and the success rate is generally high.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, due to its anatomic characteristics, complications are relatively common, including pneumothorax, hemopneumothorax, inadvertent subclavian artery puncture, brachial nerve plexus injury, subclavian crush syndrome, and electrode lead fracture.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The cephalic vein was proposed to be an alternate access.

The number of implantations of ICDs and CRT-Ps/CRT-Ds has increased in the past few years,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and cephalic vein puncture may not be an optimal procedure. Anatomically, the axillary vein terminates at the lateral margin of the first rib and becomes the subclavian vein. Its passage is outside the clavicle and far from the cupula pleurae, and the diameter is larger compared with the cephalic vein with little variation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, the axillary vein puncture avoids nerve or pleura injury and subclavian crush syndrome, which ensures a high success rate.</p><p>Axillary vein puncture was first reported by Nickalls in 1987.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Afterward, some physicians improved and expanded the technique. Higano <italic>et al</italic>. reported an approach of guiding the puncture pathway using vein angiography and fluoroscopy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, these maneuvers are complicated and have steep learning curves, which limit the clinical application.</p><p>Belott reported an approach based on anatomic landmark on body surface and radiograph, where the axillary vein terminates and becomes the subclavian vein with little variation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A few other clinical studies also proposed a maneuver based on this landmark.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Overall, axillary vein punctures guided by fluoroscopic landmark, contrast venography, or ultrasound have shown high success rate and low complication rate.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In this trial, the axillary vein puncture can be achieved in most patients, confirming its feasibility. Furthermore, we used the 21-G needle instead of the routine 18-G needle, which reduced tissue injury as well as the risk of artery injury and pneumothorax. In this study, the overall success rate and one-time success rate of axillary and subclavian vein puncture were similar. No pneumothorax or difficulty on lead operating occurred in the operation and no subclavian crush syndrome occurred in the follow-ups, which confirmed the efficacy and safety of this technique. No pocket hematoma or other severe complications occurred in either group, probably due to the operator's experience and the use of electrotome. The duration of procedure in the axillary vein group is longer than the subclavian group, probably because the axillary vein puncture requires more fluoroscopy guidance and searching in local area. In addition, the axillary vein puncture included an extra procedure: exchange of guidewire and sheath, which was time consuming. Moreover, the development of equipment is likely to simplify this additional procedure. The relatively steep learning curve of axillary vein puncture is an issue, and innovations in the axillary vein puncture have been proposed recently, such as using the cephalic vein as anatomic landmark,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] introducing guidewire retrogradely from the femoral vein up to the left axillary vein as roadmap,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and utilizing the caudal fluoroscopic view.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] These innovations may help optimize the axillary vein puncture technique.</p><p>The study has several limitations. First, the relatively short follow-up period is not sufficient to evaluate long-term efficacy. Second, it was a single-centered trial and all the procedures were performed by one operator, thus interpretation and extrapolation of the results should be cautious. A multi-centered trial with larger scale and longer follow-ups is necessary to present more evidence of the advantage of the axillary vein puncture technique.</p><p>In conclusion, optimized axillary venous approach may be superior to conventional subclavian vein approach for CIED lead placement.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This work was supported by
