<bold>Background:</bold> Malaria is thought to kill between 1 and 2 million people each year in sub-Saharan Africa; most of these are young children under the age of five, who are particularly prone to developing clinical malaria because their immunity is not yet developed. Many groups of researchers around the world are developing candidate vaccines of different types that it is hoped would protect against malaria. One of these types is a &#x0201c;blood-stage&#x0201d; vaccine, which would prevent parasite multiplication in red blood cells. A candidate blood-stage vaccine is FMP1/AS02A, which is designed to raise an immune response against a particular protein (merozoite surface protein-1) on the surface of the blood-stage infectious form of the malaria parasite. In early-stage clinical trials performed in people not exposed to malaria (healthy volunteers in the United States) and in African adults who were exposed to malaria, this candidate vaccine has already been shown to be safe and to bring about an immune response. As part of the next stage in developing this vaccine, a group of researchers next wanted to see whether the vaccine was also safe and brought about an immune response in the population most in need of a vaccine: young children living in an African region with very intense malaria transmission. Therefore, as reported here, this group performed a small trial in western Kenya, recruiting 135 children under 5 y of age to receive either the FMP1/AS02A vaccine (at three different doses) or rabies vaccine for comparison (thus ensuring that children in the control arm got some benefit from being in the trial). The outcomes that the researchers were interested in were primarily adverse events, which they categorized using a standard questionnaire at up to 7 d after vaccination; unsolicited events reported up to 30 d after vaccination; and, finally, any serious events occurring up to 8 mo later. The researchers also examined antibody responses to the FMP1/AS02A vaccine.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> Participants who received the FMP1/AS02A vaccine (as compared to the rabies vaccine) experienced more immediate symptoms, such as pain and swelling at the injection site. Most participants reported unsolicited events during follow-up, but the proportion of participants with adverse events did not seem to be different between the FMP1/AS02A vaccine groups and the rabies vaccine group. Unsolicited outcomes that were reported included, for example, clinical malaria, upper respiratory tract infections, and a few events that were thought to be related to the vaccines, such as fever and eczema. A few serious adverse events occurred up to 8 mo after vaccination, but the numbers did not seem to be different between the FMP1/AS02A and rabies vaccine groups, and the events were not judged to be related to vaccination. Finally, participants who received the FMP1/AS02A vaccine raised an antibody response to the vaccine, which was highest in those who received the highest vaccine dose. The researchers concluded that this vaccine was safe and brought about an immune response in the group of malaria-exposed children studied.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The trial was conducted in a population that is likely to benefit from the vaccine, if it is shown to be effective in further studies. Therefore, the data obtained from this study will be informative in helping to design future trials on FMP1/AS02A. The randomization procedures used in this study were appropriate, and in particular participants of different ages were equally distributed to the different intervention groups, helping to minimize bias. Procedures were also set up to prevent participants and staff giving the vaccines and collecting data from knowing which interventions participants had received. However, the number of participants recruited into the trial was small, and it therefore was not powered to detect anything other than large differences in rates of adverse events between the study groups.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This study extends evidence from prior trials on the safety and immunogenicity of the FMP1/AS02A vaccine to a population that is representative of those most in need of an effective vaccine&#x02014;young African children. The results suggest that the vaccine candidate should undergo further evaluation in trials examining vaccine efficacy in a similar population.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Withers MR, McKinney D, Ogutu BR, Waitumbi JN, Milman JB, et al.

Although no inhabited continent is unaffected, Africa is particularly hard hit. Annually, over half a billion <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content> infections occur worldwide, leading to between 1 and 2 million deaths in sub-Saharan Africans&#x02014;most of them children [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The proportion of total mortality attributable to malaria in this pediatric population has increased in recent years because of a general breakdown of public health services in many areas, antimalarial drug resistance, interactions with the human immunodeficiency virus, and (perhaps) global climate change [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nearly 100 candidate malaria vaccines are currently in various stages of evaluation [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and a pre-erythrocytic (pre-blood stage, liver-stage) vaccine candidate, known as RTS,S, has recently demonstrated efficacy against clinical and severe disease in children in Mozambique [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An alternative to such pre-erythrocytic vaccines is the targeting of antigens that are expressed during the erythrocytic (blood) stage of the parasite life cycle. The rationale for such an erythrocytic stage vaccine is based on the observation that natural protection against clinical disease in adults and in young children depends upon maintenance of high antibody levels to antigens present on the form of the parasite (the merozoite) that circulates in the bloodstream [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP-1) is a 195-kDa protein that is proteolytically cleaved to yield four fragments, which are associated with each other through noncovalent interactions on the merozoite surface. Among them is the carboxy-terminal 42-kDa fragment known as MSP-1<sub>42</sub> [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Secondary processing of the 42-kDa fragment into 19-kDa and 33-kDa fragments is thought important for merozoite invasion [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Individuals living under high malaria transmission develop anti-MSP-1<sub>42</sub> and anti-MSP-1<sub>19</sub> antibodies that inhibit parasite growth in vitro [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, inoculation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Aotus</named-content> monkeys with a recombinant MSP-1<sub>42</sub> and potent adjuvant can confer protection against blood-stage challenge with <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In human subjects, the candidacy of MSP-1<sub>42</sub> as a potentially efficacious malaria vaccine is further supported by epidemiologic studies demonstrating that antibodies to the relatively conserved domains are associated with a diminution of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> disease severity [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and by the finding that the majority of antibodies active in growth inhibition in sera from endemic areas are p19 specific [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The MSP-1<sub>42</sub> of the 3D7 clone of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> has been formulated into a final test product, termed the falciparum malaria protein 1 (FMP1) [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and combined with GlaxoSmithKline's proprietary adjuvant AS02A [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The safety and immunogenicity of the FMP1/AS02A formulation has been confirmed in two phase I trials conducted in the United States [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and in phase I trials in malaria-experienced populations in western Kenya [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Mali (C. Plowe, personal communication). The present study, a phase Ib trial in young children subject to intense malaria transmission, follows up the previous adult trial in the same area of western Kenya. It is part of our long-term malaria vaccine development plan that aims to develop products to prevent malaria morbidity and mortality in infants and young children in malaria endemic areas.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The trial was conducted in Kombewa Division in the Kisumu District of Nyanza Province of western Kenya. The study subjects were drawn almost exclusively from the Luo ethnic group living in low-land country near Lake Victoria. The Luo are settled agriculturalists of Nilo-Saharan origin, most of whom engage in low-income subsistence farming or fishing. In this region of holoendemic malaria transmission, most infections (90%) are transmitted by mosquitoes of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anopheles gambiae</named-content> complex and the infecting parasite species is usually (95%) <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

All parents known to have children in the relevant age groups and living within a 1-mile (1.6-km) radius of each of 12 field stations were invited to participate in a briefing.</p><p>Prior to enrollment in this study, a medical history, physical examination, and screening laboratory tests were performed on every subject to detect any underlying medical condition that might confound clinical evaluation or data analysis. Males and females were considered eligible for enrollment if they were 12&#x02013;47 mo old at the time of screening and in good health and if a parent agreed to sign a written and witnessed informed consent form and to remain in the study area for 12 mo. Exclusion criteria included any evidence of acute or chronic medical conditions that might increase the risk to the participating subject. Specific exclusion criteria included prior receipt of an investigational malaria vaccine or of a rabies vaccine; recent or planned use of any investigational new drug (IND), vaccine, immunoglobulin, or any blood product; use of immunosuppressant drugs within the previous 6 mo; confirmed or suspected immunodeficiency; history of splenectomy; administration, or anticipated administration, of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol within 30 d of the first dose of vaccine (with the exception of tetanus toxoid); and concurrent participation in another clinical trial.

Initial approval of the study protocol and of subsequent protocol amendments was granted to the investigators by the Ethical Review Committee of the Kenya Medical Research Institute, Nairobi; by the Human Subjects Protection Committee of PATH, Seattle, Washington, United States; and by the United States Army HSRRB. The study was done under a Food and Drug Administration IND and was compliant with all relevant International Conference on Harmonization guidelines.</p><p>Vaccinations of the second and third cohorts were staggered from each other by 2 wk (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0010032-t002">Table 2</xref>). A safety report was produced prior to each dose escalation. The LMM and the DSMB reviewed all adverse events (AEs) occurring in the 7 d immediately following any vaccination that preceded a dose escalation. Written approval from the LMM and concurrence by the DSMB were required prior to any subsequent dose escalation.</p><table-wrap id="pctr-0010032-t002" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Timing of First, Second, and Third Vaccinations for Each Cohort (Dosage Group) over 12 wk</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0010032.t002"/></table-wrap><p>Stopping rules were to be invoked when either of the following observations was made: (1) &#x0003e; 20% of subjects with &#x0201c;severe&#x0201d; (grade 3) general AEs (not local AEs) related to the vaccine; or (2) any SAE, including death, judged to be vaccine related.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to assess the safety and reactogenicity of the FMP1/AS02A malaria vaccine in malaria-exposed 12- to 47-mo-old children living in western Kenya.

Immunizations were carried out simultaneously in four separate consultation rooms that were connected to a central pharmacy (the vaccine preparation room) by small, closable service hatches. On vaccination days, the prepared syringe was handed through a service hatch to a vaccinator for vaccine administration. For each subject, an identification number, a randomization code from a chart, and a randomization code on the syringe were recorded on a vaccination form. Following vaccine administration, subjects were assessed and follow-up visits conducted by a group of clinicians who had not been involved in the vaccinations.

The incidence of solicited, unsolicited, and serious AEs were compared using two-sided Fisher's exact tests without correction for multiplicity. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) were calculated to assess immunogenicity at each timepoint when titers were collected. The titer data were transformed to a log<sub>10</sub> scale and were modeled by longitudinal mixed models to assess the effect of dose and age on the mean level of the antibody responses over time. The models used a spatial covariance structure, which takes into account the number of study days between two measurements when determining the correlation between them.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant Flow</title><p>A total of 590 parents of children were briefed; of these, 436 parents consented to screening. Of the 320 children who were returned for screening, 135 (77 girls and 58 boys) were enrolled and randomized to one of the three dosage cohorts. Among these were 25 children who were initially disqualified owing to clinical malaria; however, they were subsequently enrolled after successful treatment and confirmed cure. Of the 135 subjects who received the first vaccination, five did not receive the second vaccination and another eight did not receive the third. Thus, 122 subjects received all three vaccinations; 83 of the 90 subjects were randomized to receive FMP1/AS02A and 39 of the 45 randomized to receive the rabies vaccine. The 13 incompletely vaccinated subjects were evenly distributed among the three dose cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0010032-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Because all of the 135 enrolled subjects received at least one vaccination, all were to be followed per protocol for the study duration and included in the safety analyses. Twenty-five subjects withdrew prematurely from the study, approximately 20% from each study arm; these withdrawals were also evenly distributed across cohorts. Twelve subjects had consent withdrawn by a parent or grandparent because of family discord regarding participation in the study; 11 subjects migrated out of the study area; one subject attended the final study visit during which the mother refused the blood draw; and one subject died.

There were no differences by group or by cohort in the proportions of subjects experiencing an unsolicited symptom. All but one of the enrolled children experienced at least one unsolicited symptom during a follow-up period, and most experienced an unsolicited symptom during each of the three follow-up periods (77%&#x02013;97% for FMP1/AS02A and 80%&#x02013;100% for the comparator). The most common unsolicited symptoms were upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) and malaria.</p><p>Approximately 80% of subjects in each study arm experienced at least one URTI during the three 30-d postimmunization follow-up periods. There was no indication that vaccinated groups had any increased risk of developing clinical malaria.</p><p>For unsolicited symptoms, vaccine relatedness was determined by temporal relationship to a vaccination with absence of any reasonably explanatory comorbidity. Very few vaccine-related unsolicited symptoms occurred during the postimmunization follow-up period (five and one among FMP1/AS02A and comparator recipients, respectively). These symptoms were mostly limited to injection-site reactions that differed from those elicited during the immediate follow-up period. They included a case of hyperpigmentation in the comparator group and three cases of fever by history, one of induration, and one of eczema in the FMP1/AS02A group. The last mentioned was a nonpruritic skin rash developing in the right flank area about 50 min after a second vaccination of the 10-&#x003bc;g dose of FMP1/AS02A. Initially presenting with a plaque-like appearance, these lesions developed a follicular eczematous pattern that then resolved over a few days. This child had been noted to have similar (albeit smaller) dermatitic or eczematous lesions prior to the first vaccination. A third vaccination was withheld from this subject. One grade 3 unsolicited symptom occurred during the postimmunization follow-up period, a 25-&#x003bc;g FMP1/AS02A subject experiencing grade 3 malaria beginning 2 d after receiving the first vaccination.

No SAE was judged causally related to a vaccination. Seven documented SAEs occurred during this period: four in the FMP1/AS02A group and three in the comparator group. In the former group, two children in the 10-&#x003bc;g dosage cohort experienced convulsions 17 and 189 d after second and third vaccinations, respectively; one child in the 50-&#x003bc;g dosage group experienced convulsions 12 d after the third vaccination. (All convulsions were febrile, malaria-associated seizures.)</p><p>A 37-mo-old female acquired malaria 26 d after receiving a third dose of 10 &#x003bc;g of FMP1/AS02A, was treated, and recovered. She developed hepatitis and severe anemia 7 d later. She died 62 d after her third vaccination, following several hospitalizations and blood transfusions. In this subject, an extravascular hemolysis caused severe organomegaly with secondary thrombocytopenia and hypersplenism, along with a possible partial obstruction of biliary outflow. The death of this subject led to a thorough review of the case by the principal investigator, the DSMB, and a pediatric hematology consultant not previously associated with the study. After considering all potential etiologies (including Epstein&#x02013;Barr virus, parvovirus B19, and others) that could have precipitated such a clinical course and the clinical context (e.g., the long interval between vaccination and onset), it was concluded that there was not a likely causal biological connection between the immunization and the preterminal course and death. In accordance with the study protocol, the principal investigator's judgment was that &#x0201c;there are other, more likely causes and administration of the study vaccine is not suspected to have contributed to the adverse event.&#x0201d; Her death was judged not related to the study vaccine, but rather to autoimmune hemolytic anemia, most likely secondary to a viral infection, causing first hepatitis and then an unusual warm reactive immunoglobulin G. The clinical course and the temporal association are here reported so that in the event of similar instances, this information will be readily available.</p><p>In the comparator group, one subject experienced febrile, malaria-associated convulsions; one, an episode of severe bronchospasm; and one, an intestinal obstruction due to ascariasis. One unexpected AE occurred during the study: a subject from the comparator group experienced a markedly elevated ALT level and was diagnosed with hepatitis A. The subject was excluded from the third vaccination to eliminate the possibility of confounding the assessment of safety following subsequent vaccinations. In addition, two subjects from the FMP1/AS02A group developed phimosis, leading to elective hospitalizations and circumcisions.</p></sec><sec id="s3e4"><title>Laboratory parameters.</title><p>Blood (venous samples from arms) for laboratory measurements (white blood cell count, hemoglobin, platelet count, ALC, creatinine, and ALT) was collected at baseline (study day 0) and on study days 14, 30, 44, 60, 74, and 90. Group mean safety laboratory values were generally unchanged in the 30-d postimmunization follow-up periods. The majority of subjects had all values within normal range. However, both vaccine and comparator groups had a number of subjects outside of the normal range of ALCs, including timepoints prior to first vaccination; none was judged to be clinically significant.</p><p>The protocol specified that each child was to receive 10 hemoglobin determinations occurring at the seven timepoints cited above and on study days 180, 270, and 364.

The overall baseline GMT in thousands (across all study groups) was 2.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] of 1.7, 3.2).

Laboratory parameters were comparable throughout the study. No local or systemic allergic event occurred. The seven SAEs occurring during the 8-mo observation period were evenly divided between test article and comparator arms, with none adjudged causally related to receipt of a vaccine.

This immunogenicity of the vaccine in adults may have been masked by the high levels of preexisting antibody in that semi-immune population; this was supported by the observation that the greatest rise in antibody was seen in subjects with the lowest baseline levels. The present study confirms our anticipation that this vaccine candidate would induce an even greater increase in anti-FMP1 titers when administered to children with less malaria exposure and lower baseline titers.</p><p>The waning of antibody levels in the 25- and 50-&#x003bc;g dosage groups after study day 74 is congruent with previous experience with FMP1. Significantly, by study day 364, the 25- and 50-&#x003bc;g dosage groups maintained higher antibody levels than subjects in the 10-&#x003bc;g dosage and comparator groups. It is not clear what effect boosting from natural exposure had on the magnitude and persistence of the antibody response, but the anti-FMP1 response in the rabies comparator group did not significantly increase over the year-long observation period. The results from the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed linear modeling for all randomized subjects showed statistically convincing evidence of a dose-response relationship to antibody response.</p><p>Consistent with our ultimate goal of allowing administration of a malaria vaccine as part of the World Health Organization's Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) to infants at greatest risk of malaria, we have here followed up the previous year's trial of FMP1/AS02A in adults in Kombewa [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with another EPI-compatible 0-, 1-, and 2-mo schedule. This brisk schedule has now been shown to be well tolerated in both trials and was not associated with any new or higher incidence of postvaccination symptoms compared to trials of FMP1/AS02A given on a 0-, 1-, and 3-mo schedule in healthy malaria-na&#x000ef;ve adults in the United States [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Reports of experimentally induced, malaria-associated anemia in <italic>Aotus</italic> monkeys subjected to prolonged <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> parasitemia have raised concern that malaria vaccines eliciting immunity that controls, but does not eliminate, parasitemia might themselves increase the risk of anemia in endemic human populations [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the previous year's adult study, hemoglobin levels were stable in both test article and comparator groups for 365 d. Results of the present study are similarly reassuring in indicating that hemoglobin levels do not deteriorate in children, even when they are exposed to high levels of malaria transmission after vaccination. Indeed, slight continuous increases in hemoglobin levels occurred in all groups, perhaps because of the enhanced medical care provided to these study subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The study population selected for this trial was chosen as representative of the target population for a malaria vaccine: at-risk, malaria-experienced children living in an area of endemic, holoendemic, or epidemic malaria. As the primary objective of the trial centered upon evaluation of safety and reactogenicity, results should be broadly generalizable to children of the representative age groups. Results pertaining to the secondary objective (evaluation of immunogenicity) should be generalizable to children of these age groups exposed to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infections at levels obtaining in the study area, but may not be generalizable to children under other transmission intensities.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Along with the previous year's adult trial, this trial accomplishes the first two of the three immediate goals of the clinical development plan [<xref rid="pctr-0010032-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] for FMP1/AS02A, namely, expansion of the safety and immunogenicity profile in endemic populations and dose exploration of the test article in children. The third goal&#x02014;determination of the preliminary efficacy of this vaccine for reduction of clinical malaria in children at risk of disease&#x02014;awaits the outcome of a phase IIb efficacy trial. On the basis of preliminary presentations of the results included here, this proposed efficacy trial received the endorsement of the DSMB and the relevant institutional review boards in mid-2004 and is currently underway in Kombewa. Results should be available by the end of 2006.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010032-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010032.sd001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(255 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0010032-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0010032.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(1.0 MB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Members of the MSP-1 Malaria Vaccine Working Group not in the author list are the following: K.
