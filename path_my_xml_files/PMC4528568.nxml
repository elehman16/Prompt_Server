Five hundred and forty-one children aged 8&#x02013;12 completed a battery of self-reports, of which responses for measures of depression symptoms, perfectionism, and coping strategies were examined for the purposes of this study. Structural equation modeling tested whether coping mediated the effects of perfectionism on depression. Results indicated that SPP had both a direct and an indirect relationship with depression symptoms through a moderate association with maladaptive coping. Implications for prevention of depression were discussed and recommendations for future research were proposed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>middle childhood</kwd><kwd>perfectionism</kwd><kwd>coping</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">Healthway and Curtin University&#x02019;s Division of Health Sciences</funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="5"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="56"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7280"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Perfectionism or striving for flawlessness is considered an adaptive trait in high achievers and elite athletes as it drives the individual to succeed and as a result contributes positively to mental well-being by improving life satisfaction and self-esteem (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, as a growing body of research has established, perfectionism may be maladaptive when motivated through a fear of failure, compelling individuals to engage in perfectionistic behavior to avoid failure (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Individuals with maladaptive perfectionism traits tend to engage in critical self-evaluation against a rigid set of unrealistically high expectations, leading to dichotomous thinking, rumination over mistakes, procrastination, increased stress, dysphoria, and performance dissatisfaction (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>If follows that maladaptive perfectionism may contribute to the development and maintenance of depression, a clinical disorder that may manifest during adolescence (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). As perfectionism traits may emerge at an early age in childhood, research into the interactions with pre-clinical symptoms of depression in children could potentially inform preventive strategies (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In examining the relationship between maladaptive perfectionism and depression in children, researchers commonly utilize the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale (CAPS) developed by Flett colleagues, an adaptation of the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (MPS) devised to assess intra and interpersonal dimensions of perfectionism in adult populations (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The measure like its adult counterpart differentiates between self-oriented perfectionism (SOP), the striving for, and critical self-evaluation against self-imposed excessively high standards; and socially prescribed perfectionism (SPP), the striving for, and critical self-evaluation against, the perceived expectation of others (Flett et al., Unpublished)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref>. However, the CAPS omits the &#x0201c;other oriented&#x0201d; perfectionism dimension, which refers to perfectionism being imposed onto others as Flett et al. (Unpublished)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> found no developmental evidence to support this factor. Studies with adolescents demonstrated robust associations between symptoms of depression and both SOP and SPP in the context [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)], generally replicating findings in adults [see Ref. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)], while research in younger samples has been limited and with mixed results. Nobel et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) observed that only SOP was significantly correlated with depression in 8- to 11-year-old children identified at-risk for depression or anxiety. This was inconsistent with earlier findings by Huggins et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) who observed that only SPP was associated with a clinical diagnosis of depression in a group of indicated preadolescents (10&#x02013;11&#x02009;years). This discrepancy may be due to a potential floor effect in the Nobel et al. study with mean SPP scores almost 2 SDs lower than those reported by Huggins et al. Furthermore, Nobel et al. applied a reduced version of the CAPS, potentially limiting detection of a significant interaction between SPP and depression, as well as its comparability with other studies. Additional research with a larger sample of preadolescents is therefore needed to clarify the nature of association between depression and perfectionism in children.</p><p>In examining relationships between perfectionism and depression in adults, researchers have observed that individuals with high levels of perfectionism tend to apply ineffective coping strategies to manage stressful events (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Coping strategies are considered effective and adaptive when behavioral and cognitive processes include active emotion regulation, constructive thinking, and problem solving techniques to reduce stress (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>); and they are considered ineffective or maladaptive when comprising avoidant cognitive and behavioral strategies, which tend to be associated with poorer psychological outcomes (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Researchers have found that coping is often context driven and depends on the initial appraisal of the situation by the child and their coping repertoire, which becomes more diversified and sophisticated with development (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p>Research has established that adults with high levels of maladaptive perfectionism, specifically SPP, are more likely to apply maladaptive coping (MCOP) and less likely to apply adaptive coping (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Research on a sample of maltreated adolescents has indicated similar patterns of associations with Flett et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) observing that SOP was correlated with problem solving (an adaptive coping strategy), while SPP was negatively correlated to problem solving and positively related to avoidant (maladaptive) coping.</p><p>Studies utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) have demonstrated that MCOP either fully or partially mediate the relationship between perfectionism and depression in adults [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>)]. However, no known published research has examined the mediating role of coping on the depression&#x02013;perfectionism relationships in children.</p><p>Exposing the interactions of MCOP, perfectionism, and depression may have implications for the development of effective treatment and prevention of depressive disorders, particularly given Blatt and colleagues&#x02019; findings in a landmark study [see Ref. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)] that perfectionism can limit the effectiveness of otherwise efficacious treatment for depression in adults. Interventions addressing depressive symptoms in adults with high levels of perfectionism have only been efficacious when directly targeting perfectionistic behaviors and cognitions [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)].</p><p>Although there are no known evidenced-based treatments for children that specifically target perfectionism, preliminary research indicates that CBT-based interventions aimed at preventing and reducing depression symptoms may also influence perfectionism. Essau et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) reported significant improvements in both SOP and SPP as well as coping and depression symptoms as a result of a randomized controlled trial of the manualized FRIENDS program administered to a large community sample of 9- to 12-year-old children. A randomized controlled study by Nobel et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) in children with subclinical levels of anxiety and depression also observed reductions in depression and SOP. As there were no significant differences between treatment and control groups at post-test, conclusions regarding treatment efficacy were limited. A study by Dry (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) found positive changes over time in depression levels of 8- to 11-year-old children with high levels of perfectionism in an open trial of the CBT-based Aussie Optimism Positive Thinking Skills program. However, the absence of a control group limited inferences that could be made about treatment efficacy.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to address specific limitations of the aforementioned research and examine the interrelationships between coping strategies, perfectionism, and prodromal depression symptoms in the context of a preventative treatment for pre adolescents. It was specifically hypothesized that:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>H1: Pre-test perfectionism (SOP and SPP) would moderate the intervention effect on depression scores, such that children with high-perfectionism scores would benefit less from the intervention;</p></list-item><list-item><p>H2: At pre-test, MCOP would partially mediate the relationship between perfectionism (SOP and SPP) and depression symptoms, such that individuals with high levels of perfectionism would score more highly on MCOP and depression symptoms. It was expected that this mediation relationship would be stronger for SPP. As researchers reported gender differences in rates of SOP and SPP (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), in coping strategies [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)] and rates of depression symptoms (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), it was expected that gender would be a covariate; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>H3: Adaptive coping would partially mediate the therapeutic effect of the intervention on depressive symptoms.</p></list-item></list>

Item No. 19 (evaluating suicide ideation) was removed from the questionnaire due to concerns raised by school principals (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).

Once school principals had agreed to participate, written informed consent was sought from parents and children. Trained experimenters, who were blind to the treatment mode, administered the battery of measures in accordance with the AO-PTS protocol manual to participating children in classroom groups during class time, reading aloud all questions to minimize differences in reading ability. Where possible a teacher was present at testing to ensure duty of care was maintained. Children were rewarded with a sticker and pencil or eraser for participating. After data entry, the AO-PTS research team identified children who scored highly on the CDI [above 17, Ref. (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>)]. Parents were notified accordingly offered referrals for appropriate psychological support for their children.</p><p>Testing was conducted before and after the 10-week intervention, or in the case of the control group after an equivalent lapse of time. Data collection occurred between 17 September 2010 and 14 December 2010 for the intervention schools and between 3 August 2011 and 6 December 2012 for the control schools.

Considering that a previous trial of the AO-PTS intervention found significant effects in a larger sample of children where mean CDI scores were approximately 1 SD higher (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12.21, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;467) than those of the current sample, a key factor limiting the observation of an intervention effect in this sample was an apparent floor effect of scores for depression symptoms, potentially exacerbated by wave attrition of a disproportionate number of children with elevated scores for depression in the control group. Additionally, as children with elevated scores for depression were offered referrals for psychological assistance, any external support received may have contributed to the observed reduction in depression scores. It is possible that this contributed to the observed pre&#x02013;post-test reductions in the control group, which comprised a higher number of at-risk children who may have received psychological help, thereby mitigating any treatment effect. Additional factors limiting observation of an intervention effect included potential temporal effects due to differences in timing of testing for control and intervention groups and potential inconsistencies in treatment compliance by teachers (this could not be determined due to incomplete records of treatment fidelity and child attendance rates for some schools).</p><p>It was predicted that at pre-test, MCOP would partially mediate the relationship between perfectionism and depression symptoms and that this mediation relationship would be stronger between depression and SPP. Results confirmed that gender was a covariate, influencing several of the outcome measures. The SEM found that SPP had a direct and indirect association with depression but that coping was not a mediator. This finding suggests that while children with high levels of SPP tend to employ more dysfunctional coping strategies to manage stress, thereby contributing to depression symptoms, other perfectionistic tendencies, such as self-criticism and rumination, over failure to meet others&#x02019; perceived expectations have an independent and stronger relationship with depression. These findings are contrary to SEM research in adults, which demonstrated more clearly that avoidant coping mediated the relationship between perfectionism and depression [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>)]. Wei et al.&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) more sophisticated longitudinal design demonstrated that maladaptive perfectionism and coping not only contributed to depression but also influenced each other at different points in time. Dunkley and Blankstein&#x02019;s (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) mediation model was demonstrated in the context of daily hassles and distress. It is feasible that the more complex models of coping and perfectionism tapped into the latent variables more effectively. Zhang and Cai (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) claimed partial mediation in a simpler cross-sectional model; however, the patterns of association observed in their sample of young adults were similar to those observed in this sample with direct pathways relatively stronger compared to indirect pathways, casting doubt over their claim of partial mediation.</p><p>The SEM demonstrated a small but significant negative association between depression and SOP, indicating that there may be protective factors associated with this dimension of perfectionism. SOP also correlated positively with cognitive behavioral problem solving, indicating that children who are more self-motivated to achieve may be less likely to suffer from depression. However, this conclusion would be inconsistent with findings in adult and child literature by Nobel et al. who found a positive association between SOP and depression. This contradiction may be due to differences in levels of distress in the sample, with Nobel et al.&#x02019;s sample showing higher levels of depression symptoms. Hewitt et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and O&#x02019;Connor et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) observed that stress moderated the association between perfectionism (including SOP) and depression in adolescent youth. This would suggest that maladaptive cognitions associated with SOP, such as rumination over mistakes, procrastination, and self-criticism, may only be triggered in the presence of acute stress. Lewis and Frydenberg (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) observed that adolescents who implemented adaptive coping strategies also used MCOP strategies, concluding that adolescents may adopt MCOP strategies when other strategies have failed. Others have suggested that avoidance strategies may be the default choice in times of distress (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with research by Flett et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), SPP scores showed a moderate and positive association with MCOP, while SPP was negatively associated with adaptive coping, suggesting that children of this younger age group with tendencies to critically evaluate themselves against perceived high expectations tend to use more behavioral and cognitive avoidance strategies to deal with stressors.</p><sec id="S4-14"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of this study included a sound methodological approach comprising a randomized control design, standardized testing procedures, a large sample size ensuring a sufficiently powered statistical analysis, and sophisticated statistical methods to assess the interaction of outcome variables, which were able to account for measurement error, group inequivalence, and intra-class dependence.</p><p>Because the mediation hypothesis was tested cross-sectionally, inferences regarding causal relationships implied in the model are limited as the temporal sequencing of perfectionism, coping, and depression was not demonstrated (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). Ideally, mediation is tested longitudinally over three points in time without potential interference of an intervention. As data were unavailable for three separate time points, it was decided to examine meditational interactions concurrently at pre-test, combining intervention and control subjects to maximize sample size and thereby increasing statistical power. Other limitations included reliance on self-reports of children and poor reliability rates on two of the subscales of the CSCY, which may have limited observed relationships (although error rates were accounted for in the SEM). Finally, the generalizability of results is limited as participating children were from predominantly Catholic middle income families.</p></sec><sec id="S4-15"><title>Practical and theoretical implications</title><p>This study extended on a very limited body of research demonstrating links between MCOP and perfectionism and presenting novel research results of SEM of the interrelationships between socially prescribed and SOP, coping, and depression. The pathway model identified provides an insight into the interactions of these variables in asymptomatic children, and also provides a more accurate analysis (by accounting for measurement error) of relationships between perfectionism and depression, which has previously been examined primarily through means of correlational studies.</p><p>It is recommended that future research examine these interrelationships in a longitudinal study to demonstrate temporal sequence in a causal model. It is also advised that a coping measure is used, which has demonstrated strong internal consistency across all subscales to improve construct validity. Further research validating the CSYC for use in a younger sample should be considered. Future examination of the relationship between SOP coping and depression in a diathesis-stress model may highlight maladaptive traits of SOP in healthy samples, which could further inform the formulation of preventive strategies. As suggested by Pincus and Friedman (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), such preventative interventions may need to include not only an increase in adaptive coping skills but also an increased awareness of the effects of using less productive coping strategies in times of stress. Future research testing for moderation of perfectionism on efficacious treatments in children is warranted as is an investigation into whether improving coping skills would buffer against the effects of perfectionism on depression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The study through sophisticated SEM supported that children with a tendency to evaluate themselves critically against the perceived unrealistically high expectations of others tend to report higher levels of depression. This influence is predominantly due to the maladaptive cognitions associated with perfectionism, and to a lesser extent, as a result of an increased tendency of these children toward to use of ineffective behavioral and cognitive avoidance strategies to cope with stressors.</p><p>Furthermore, the findings that associations between perfectionism, MCOP, and depression are present even in children who do not necessarily present clinical levels of depression symptoms could be useful in informing universal programs to prevent adverse mental health outcomes in children.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Melissa C.
