Probenecid is a well-established hypouricemic agent for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The goal of this study was to examine the impact of coadministration of probenecid on the pharmacokinetic parameters and tolerability of olmesartan in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study, 12 volunteers received 2 oral treatments (olmesartan alone or olmesartan plus probenecid) separated by 4 days.

No serious adverse event (AE) was reported during the study. The proportion of volunteers with AEs in the olmesartan plus probenecid period (5 of 12 [42%]) was higher than that in the olmesartan-alone period (1 of 12 [8%]). All of the AEs during the olmesartan plus probenecid period were abnormal routine urine test results. The AE in olmesartan-alone period was dizziness.

There is significant overlap of the 2 conditions.

There is no relationship between the dose and the occurrence of side effects of olmesartan medoxomil. The mean oral bioavailability of olmesartan medoxomil in healthy adult volunteers has been found to be 29%. C<sub>max</sub> occurs at 2 hours (range, 1&#x02013;4 hours). Distribution of olmesartan occurs over the first 8 hours after oral administration with an estimated volume of distribution of 29 L. Olmesartan is primarily excreted unchanged in the feces (up to 89%), with a small proportion (10%&#x02013;16%) excreted unchanged in the urine. Because the rate of renal clearance (mean, 0.55 L/h) is substantially lower than the glomerular filtration rate, it was hypothesized that there is extensive tubular reabsorption of olmesartan. The mean elimination half-life was ~5 to 7 hours in Chinese patients and 12 to 18 hours in Western patients, with a duration of action of up to 24 hours.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> In vitro studies show that OAT polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 are involved in hepatobiliary and renal transport of olmesartan.<xref rid="bib6 bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6,8</sup></xref> We know that probenecid interferes with the kidneys&#x02019; OAT.<xref rid="bib2 bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref> Will probenecid have an effect on the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan, thereby resulting in changes in the antihypertensive effect and side effects of olmesartan? Until now, many clinical studies have shown that olmesartan has no pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs; moreover, there is no research on the interactions between olmesartan and probenecid. In this study, we assess the involvement of probenecid in the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of olmesartan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0010"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Study design</title><p>This study had an open-label, randomized-sequence, multiple-dose, 2-treatment, 2-period design.

The first dose of probenecid was administered with olmesartan medoxomil in the morning of the last day in period II. The second dose of probenecid was administered alone 6 hours after the first administration. The treatment periods were separated by a washout period of 4 days. Subjects arrived at the hospital the day before the study. A table of random numbers was used to assign the sequence for subjects to receive multiple doses (administered with 200 mL of water) of olmesartan medoxomil tablets (Lot: 070901; expiration: September 2009, TianQuan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, Fujian, China), with or without a probenecid tablet together (Lot: 081201; expiration: December 2010, Shanghai Sine Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.).

Written informed consent was obtained from all of the subjects after an explanation of the aim and the risks of the study before study initiation. The main information in the informed consent included the details of the tested drugs, the purpose and the length of the study, the number of visits required, and the medical procedures and medications included. It also provided expected outcomes, potential benefits, and possible risks. Subjects were compensated for study participation. Subjects were eligible based on the following criteria: age 18 to 40 years and a body mass index between 19 and 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Additional inclusion criteria were nonsmoking status and an unremarkable clinical history. No volunteers could have a history or evidence of a renal, gastrointestinal, hepatic, or hematologic abnormality; any acute or chronic disease; or an allergy to any drugs. These subjects were excluded to ensure that the degrees of variation were not due to the influence of illness or other medications. Chest radiography, electrocardiography, biochemistry, hematology, and routine urine test results were used to confirm subject history. Subjects were required to have negative HIV and hepatitis &#x00412; and C test results.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Blood sampling and assaying</title><p>A 20-gauge catheter was placed in a forearm vein.

As we know, olmesartan medoxomil is converted to olmesartan by intestinal wall esterases. Olmesartan undergoes virtually no further metabolism.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Thus, the pharmacokinetics of olmesartan were considered less likely to be affected by the drugs metabolized or to have effects on the CYP450 isoenzyme system,<xref rid="bib15 bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15&#x02013;17</sup></xref> for example, probenecid. At the same time, the tubular excretion with which probenecid interferes plays a small role in the excretion of olmesartan.</p><p>The changes in AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02192;&#x0221e;</sub>, and C<sub>ss-av</sub> in the study have statistical significance when olmesartan is combined with probenecid in healthy subjects. C<sub>ss-av</sub> for the olmesartan plus probenecid period was 40% higher than that for the olmesartan-alone period. The AUC<sub>0&#x02192;&#x0221e;</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48</sub> for the olmesartan plus probenecid period increased by nearly 50% of that of the olmesartan-alone period. The increase in olmesartan exposure may or may not increase the antihypertensive efficacy; this is not yet clear. More basic and clinical studies are needed to answer these questions.</p><p>There is another interesting result in that olmesartan exposure (AUC) is increased 40%, but the increase in exposure has no effect on either absorption (T<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>max</sub>) or elimination (t<sub>1/2</sub>). In the study, we only studied the concentration of olmesartan in blood. In fact, the drug does not only distribute blood but in tissue as well. Sometimes the AUC may change without absorption or elimination may change if the distribution balance between blood and tissue is changed. Unfortunately, we did not obtain body tissue to study the drug concentrations. So our study is underpowered in some sense.</p><p>In this study, 42% of the volunteers in the olmesartan plus probenecid period had abnormal routine urine test. The urine tests are performed at baseline, 24 hours after olmesartan administration alone in period I, and 24 hours after olmesartan plus probenecid administration in period II. The AEs are considered to be at least possibly related to treatment. The genitourinary side effects including urinary tract infection with olmesartan were reported in only 0.5% to 1% of patients. Hematuria was reported in &#x0003e;1% of patients, but at the same or greater incidence than with placebo.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The genitourinary side effects of probenecid including bloody urine, difficult or painful urination, cloudy urine, sudden decrease in the amount of urine, and frequent urge to urinate are &#x0003c;1%.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> The occurrence of AEs may not be increased by the increase in olmesartan exposure because there is no relationship between the dose and the occurrence of side effects with olmesartan medoxomil.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> We suspect the combined treatment of olmesartan medoxomil with probenecid may be not safe.
