Criteria for inclusion in the intervention study were: being symptomatic, experiencing daily hot flushes, age between 40 and 63&#x02005;years, not using HRT now or in the past 3&#x02005;months, having a sedentary lifestyle (with aerobic training under twice a week) and having last menstruated 3&#x02013;36&#x02005;months earlier. Women who were physically active (exercising two or more times a week, at least 30&#x02005;min at a time); whose body mass index (BMI) was above 35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; or who had coronary heart disease, orthopaedic or other diseases preventing them from exercising, were excluded from the study. Further, women who were using medication influencing heart rate, or using &#x003b2;-blockers, were excluded, since they would have biased the results pertaining to heart rate. Menopausal status was verified via assay of plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH exceeding 30&#x02005;IU/L). Before the trial began, daytime and night-time hot flushes were recorded in a 2-week diary, with the women instructed to record a sensation of warmth, with or without concomitant sweating, as a hot flush, and the daily frequency of hot flushes before the intervention was estimated. During the intervention, the number of hot flushes, both daytime and night-time, was calculated. In total, 159 women participated in the study, and the duration of the intervention was 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The women in the intervention group engaged in aerobic training four times a week, with 50&#x02005;min of exercise each time. They were instructed to exercise at a level of about 64&#x02013;80% of maximal heart rate, whereas the women in the control group were instructed to keep their PA habits unchanged. In the intervention group, at least two PA sessions had to consist of walking or Nordic walking, while the other sessions could include walking, Nordic walking, skiing, jogging, cycling, swimming, aerobics and/or gymnastics. The intervention primarily included walking because earlier trials showed it to have favourable effects on health among menopausal and postmenopausal women.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Information on hot flushes and aerobic training was collected via mobile phone questionnaires twice a day. Responses were automatically transferred to digital format via 3G technology.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The SF-36 Health Survey questionnaire was used to measure health-related QoL. This questionnaire has been validated in Finland<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and is known to be a reliable measure of QoL. It is composed of 36 items, addressing eight dimensions of QoL: physical functioning, physical role limitations, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, emotional role limitations and mental health.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The scores for each of the eight dimensions were transformed linearly to a scale ranging from 0 (maximal impairment) to 100 (best QoL).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The first follow-up questionnaire was posted to the participants 2&#x000bd; years after the intervention began, and 102 of the 159 women responded.

After this request, 95 of the women responded to the questionnaire and participated in the measurements. All the participants gave written consent. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured with lightweight clothing by staff of the UKK Institute, and the UKK 2&#x02005;km Walk Test was performed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The participants completed the SF-36 Health Survey questionnaire on health-related QoL, at home.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, they carried a Hookie accelerometer for a week, in order to measure their daily PA. Also, the women were asked to take notes, in a 1&#x02005;week diary, about the type and intensity of their PA, and to note the exercise time. Specific questions related to accelerometer use and the UKK 2-km Walk Test will be reported on in a separate article. In addition, the participants were asked to use a 1&#x02005;week diary to note the number of daytime and night-time hot flushes experienced, the time they fell asleep and woke up, and their judgement of their sleep quality.

The odds model was used for analysis of the association between the outcomes both on the physical dimensions (physical functioning; role functioning, physical; freedom from pain; and physical health) and on the psychological dimensions (role functioning; emotional; vitality; emotional well-being; social functioning; general health; and mental health) over time and between the intervention versus the control group. Multilevel linear regression models could not be used, because the distributions of SF-36 variables were skewed or discrete. Since the conditions necessary for the use of multilevel ordinal logistic regression models were not met, these models could not be used either.</p><p>The multilevel model for dichotomous outcome y<sub>ij</sub> at time i for person j can be expressed as<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015008232ueq1.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>where x<sub>2j</sub> represents group, x<sub>3ij</sub> represents time, <bold>x</bold><sub>ij</sub>=(x<sub>2j</sub>, x<sub>3ij</sub>)&#x02032; is a vector containing both covariates, and &#x003b6;<sub>j</sub> is a person-specific random intercept. This model allows for a difference between groups at baseline &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and linear changes in the log odds of outcome over time with slope &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> in the control group and slope &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>+&#x003b2;<sub>4</sub> in the intervention group. Therefore, &#x003b2;<sub>4</sub>, the difference in the rate of improvement (on the log odds scale) between groups, can be viewed as changing over time between groups.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Also second-order and third-order functions of time were included in the model, for testing of whether a model with a non-linear effect improved the fit. A likelihood-ratio test was used for models&#x02019; comparison, to identify the model fitting best. The parameter estimates were presented as ORs with 95% CIs.</p><p>The proportions for the physical and mental dimensions of QoL by time are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008232F1">figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008232F2">2</xref>.

were regular smokers more often (27.3%, in contrast to 12.0%) than the women who participated in the follow-up study.</p><p>As sensitivity analyses, we performed multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models also for women who responded to all four time points (N=75). When these women with non-missing responses were taken in the analyses, intervention women had significantly higher probability of improved mental health functioning (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.13 to 3.40) as compared with control women (not shown in the figures or tables). Results from the models including only 4-year follow-up responses without 2.5&#x02005;year responses were similar to the results in the current tables and figures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s5"><title>Discussion</title><p>The physical exercise intervention may have long-term positive effects on health-related QoL among the group of menopausal women experiencing daily symptoms of menopause. Women in the intervention group had a higher probability of improvement in physical functioning dimension of QoL from baseline to the end of 4-year follow-up. Among a subsample of women who responded to both follow-up studies, significant results between the groups were found between mental health dimensions. Overall, the results show that women in the intervention group sustained their improved QoL on both physical-health and mental-health dimensions more often than did women in the control group.</p><p>Findings from previous studies have shown that getting physical exercise is correlated with lower estimates of the perceived severity of symptoms and that exercise moderates the psychological symptoms associated with menopause.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study is in line with these findings both in physical and mental dimensions. A report on an 8-year population-based follow-up study from Finland<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> states that motivation to increase one's PA during menopausal transition might be an explanatory factor connected with improved QoL. According to that follow-up study, women whose PA increased or remained stable, had a higher probability of improved QoL than women whose PA decreased.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Elavsky<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> found, in a longitudinal study of middle-aged women, that PA was associated with self-worth and by this mechanism improved QoL. Furthermore, Stojanovska <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> recently published a review of the role of PA in reducing symptoms of menopause. They considered both somatic and psychological dimensions. On the basis of their review, physical exercise has been proposed as an alternative to HRT, for improving the QoL of menopausal women.</p><p>Our study has its limitations, in the response rate (59.7%) and the fact that women with an adverse lifestyle were more likely to be found among non-responders. All initial participants were included in the analyses, even if they did not participate to the end of the intervention or the 2.5-year follow-up study. The results of the study showed a tendency towards increased QoL, although there were no statistically significant differences for any cores on the physical and mental dimensions of QoL between the groups. Our findings are similar to those from a large multiethnic volunteer cohort of postmenopausal women, in which self-reported PA was, for the most part, stable over 8&#x02005;years of follow-up. There was approximately 0.3 metabolic equivalent (MET) of actual growth in recreational PA per year&#x000d7;8&#x02005;years=2.4 MET&#x02005;h/week, which represented 30&#x02005;min of brisk walking in this case.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Loss-to-follow-up analysis showed differences between participants and those lost to follow-up. Non-responding women differed from responding women in their weight, age and smoking status. Respondents were lighter, older and were less often regular smokers than non-responding women. These differences might have had an effect on the findings in the follow-up study. If all of the original participants had been studied, the differences between the groups might have been larger. When limiting the analyses to women responding to both follow-up measurements, the results differed. Explanation for this may be due to the fact that conscientious women responding to questionnaires may have benefited even more from available support to be physically active. A follow-up study in itself can be considered an intervention, producing a non-differential support to the original groups in the RCT.</p><p>The core strengths of the study reported here are its prospective study design and repeated assessments of PA behaviour, which made it possible to examine the differences between groups in the follow-up.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Many studies have described PA patterns through the lens of cross-sectional data, while fewer studies have examined changes between several time points after an intervention. PA has been reported to decrease with age,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> but contrary findings have also been reported. Earlier, our research group published the finding<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> that women in menopausal transition shifted their behaviour in the other direction. Therefore, increased PA could be explained by higher motivation for lifestyle changes during the menopausal transition. In a longitudinal study by Smith-DiJulio <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> the researchers found that a woman's sense of control, of her life and satisfaction with it, and her ability to make use of the available social support, predicted greater well-being during menopause. This is consistent with our findings, as we observed improvement in vitality, emotional well-being and mental health during the follow-up, even though the results did not reach a level of statistical significance.</p><p>Our results may be generalised to menopausal women having daily vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flushes or sleep problems, according to the inclusion criteria in the original RCT.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Overall, our study underlines the importance of PA during menopausal transition. In addition, it supports the assumption that menopause can be seen as a window of opportunity, since it may motivate women to modify their lifestyle. Menopausal women should be encouraged to participate in regular exercise and supported in this endeavour through development of easily implemented home-based exercise programmes or incorporation of PA programmes into public-health initiatives.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="Conclusion" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Women in the intervention group showed positive long-term effects on physical and mental dimensions of QoL after 4&#x02005;years. Menopause is a window of opportunity for increasing PA and thereby future QoL.
