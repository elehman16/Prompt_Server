This aberrant wound healing process in combination with progressive contraction of the ECM eventually leads to fibrosis at the site of inflammation in the majority of patients [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Obstructive symptoms caused by strictures is the clinical end stage of fibrosis and is observed in more than 40% of patients with Crohn&#x02019;s disease [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The vast majority of these patients will need at least one surgical resection [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Monoclonal antibodies against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) have significantly improved the therapeutic options for Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients. Infliximab (IFX) is an anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody that blocks soluble and membrane bound TNF, induces lamina propria T-cell apoptosis and M2 type wound-healing macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Due to these properties, IFX suppresses the inflammatory response and contributes to rapid healing of the damaged intestinal tissue. Currently, IFX is the most effective therapy to induce and maintain mucosal healing in CD, with sustained complete mucosal healing rates of approximately 30% when used in monotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Due to the anti-inflammatory actions of anti-TNF therapy, purely inflammatory strictures may improve with it. However, almost all strictures in Crohn&#x02019;s disease also contain a fibrotic component, often complemented with prestenotic dilatation [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore fibrotic, stricturing disease is often considered as a relative contraindication for anti-TNF therapy [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], although data from a recent study suggest that Adalimumab may be effective in stricturing disease [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In fact, a small study where Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients with stenotic disease were treated with IFX to evaluate the effect of anti-TNF on strictures, had to be terminated prematurely because of high need for surgery [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In line with a negative correlation between response to anti-TNF therapy and stenotic disease, the requirement for surgical interventions for patients with intestinal strictures has not changed in the past 25 years [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Due to the poor outcome of anti-TNF therapy in fulminant stricturing disease, we hypothesized that even subclinical fibrosis (i.e. that has not yet led to stenotic obstructive disease) may contribute to incomplete response to IFX. We aimed to investigate this hypothesis in Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients who had failed or were naive to IFX therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Between 2007 and 2014, patients with active recurrent Crohn&#x02019;s disease of the terminal ileum failing thiopurine treatment were randomized to additional medical therapy with IFX or ileocecal resection in the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (LIRIC trial, NTR1150, [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Patients who had prestenotic dilatation with fibrostenosing disease on screening magnetic resonance enterography were excluded from the trial. Patients who were randomized to IFX treatment, but did not respond to this treatment based on reappearance or continuation of symptoms as demonstrated by endoscopy or radiology, underwent subsequent ileocecal resection as routine care treatment. For each patient, age at operation, gender, disease duration, Montreal classification, smoking status, time of previous thiopurines treatment, duration of IFX treatment (if applicable), and serum CRP and albumin levels were collected pre-operatively.</p><p>For this study, resection specimens were retrieved form the pathology tissue bank and processed as described below. The most inflamed area was identified by an expert IBD-pathologist who was blinded for treatment allocation (SM). This most inflamed area was located in the terminal ileum in all specimens. Moreover we collected ileal biopsies from a second cohort of 5 Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients before IFX treatment and from the same patient after 4 weeks of treatment. Those patients responded to IFX based on absence of ulcerations on endoscopy.</p><p>The medical ethical committee granted a waiver for this study based on Dutch legislation.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immediately following surgery, ileocaecal resection specimens were routinely processed by the department of pathology for histology. This included a protocolized approach following national guidelines with extensive sampling of the affected and non-affected tissue perpendicular to the bowel wall and embedded in paraffin [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. 4 &#x003bc;m thick sections were prepared and stained routinely for haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E). Consecutive slides were used for immunohistochemistry. For immunohistochemistry, sections were deparaffinized, dehydrated and immersed in 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in methanol. After antigen retrieval and blocking, slides were incubated with the primary antibody dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum. To detect the ECM component fibronectin an anti-fibronectin antibody (ab 23750; Abcam, Cambridge, UK; dilution 1:200) was used; and to detect specific collagen deposition an anti-collagen I and anti-collagen III antibody (respectively 1310&#x02013;01 and 1330&#x02013;01, both from Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA; dilution both 1:200) were used. After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody (Immunologic, Duiven, the Netherlands), slides were counterstained with Haematoxylin, dehydrated, cleared in xylene and mounted. All stainings were performed manually, with all individual samples processed in a single batch per staining.</p><p>Immunostained slides were all assessed and scored by a pathologist who was blinded to treatment allocation under identical light microscope conditions, including magnification (100x), gain, camera position, and background illumination.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Histological evaluation</title><p>Inflammation was scored by a single blinded expert IBD-pathologist (SM) using the previously described Geboes-D&#x02019;Haens histological inflammatory activity score [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this score epithelial damage, architectural changes, infiltration of mononuclear cells and/or polymorphonuclear cells, crypt deformation, erosions, ulcers and granulomas are assessed. The score ranges from 0 (no inflammation) to 13 (maximum inflammation) points and was determined on the selected slides in the most involved region.

Mucosa and muscularis mucosa (hereafter: mucosa) were separated from the submucosa and muscularis externa (hereafter: submucosa) meticulously as demonstrated by the significantly higher relative expression of the epithelial marker Keratin 18 as assessed by qPCR in the mucosa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0190999.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Fibrosis is characterized by increased expression of ECM molecules such as fibronectin and collagen. Collagen chains are synthesized by fibroblasts in precursor form as procollagens, translocated to the extracellular compartment and processed by procollagen peptidase to allow aggregation and deposition of collagen fibrils [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

Transforming growth factor beta (TGF&#x003b2;) is a dominant cytokine involved in fibrosis [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It induces expression of the Extra Domain A (ED-A) form of fibronectin, a variant that occurs through alternative splicing of the fibronectin transcript. Conversely, ED-A activates myofibroblasts which are characterized by expression of alpha smooth muscle actin (&#x003b1;SMA) and contribute to ECM deposition [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Transforming growth factor beta (<italic>TGFB1</italic>) mRNA expression was not significantly different in the mucosa and submucosa between the two patient groups. In the mucosa of IFX failure patients more alpha smooth muscle actin (<italic>ACTA2</italic>) mRNA expression was seen compared to the IFX na&#x000ef;ve patients although this difference just did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.056). In the submucosa there was no difference in <italic>ACTA2</italic> expression seen between the two groups.

One possible explanation for this may be that patients who did not respond sufficiently to IFX had already formed subclinical, microscopic fibrosis in the intestine due to chronic inflammation, and therefore did not respond to IFX therapy. Alternatively, the exposure to IFX itself may have altered the ECM. However, when we evaluated biopsies from 5 Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients who did respond to IFX, expression of <italic>ED-A</italic> or <italic>PCOLN3</italic> was similar before and after exposure to IFX. Indeed in ileal biopsies from a cohort of Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients in Leuven who were complete endoscopic responders or non-responders to IFX the same trend was observed [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this cohort expression levels of <italic>COL1A1</italic>, <italic>COL1A2</italic>, <italic>PCOLCE</italic> (Procollagen C-Endopeptidase Enhancer) and <italic>FN1</italic> were higher in the non-responders compared to the responders before IFX treatment. Furthermore, expression of ECM associated genes decreased with response. Although it should be noted that the duration of anti-TNF exposure in this study was shorter than in our IFX failure group, exposure was sufficient to induce complete mucosal healing. Therefore, it appears unlikely that IFX itself leads to ECM formation.</p><p>Fibronectin plays an important physiological role during wound healing [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and is responsible for the autocrine induction of myofibroblast migration [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. On protein level, fibronectin was indeed increased in IFX failure patients. Additionally, fibronectin can occur in up to 20 different isoforms as a consequence of alternative splicing of the primary transcript, with different functions of the various forms [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Splicing variant ED-A is important for regulation of cell proliferation and differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. One of the factors regulating the alternative splicing of fibronectin is tissue stiffness [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It can be hypothesized that due to increased levels of collagen and fibronectin, the tissue of IFX failure patients has increased tissue stiffness. Indeed increased levels of the ED-A splice variant were observed in IFX failure patients. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the muscularis mucosa of those patients was significantly thicker than the mucosa of the patient group na&#x000ef;ve to IFX.</p><p>Type I collagen is composed of several subunits, which are products of two genes, <italic>COL1A1</italic> and <italic>COL1A2</italic> and are secreted by fibroblasts into the extracellular space as procollagens. Procollagen peptidases cleave off the terminal peptides, enabling aggregation of collagen fibrils and deposition [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0190999.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We found increased protein expression of both collagen I and III in the ECM of IFX failure patients, and on mRNA level procollagen peptidase was significantly more expressed in IFX failure patients. This argues for post-translational modifications of procollagen, leading to enhanced formation of collagen fibrils and accumulation of the collagen protein in the ECM.</p><p>The main limitation of this descriptive study is the fact that this is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. Although the sections were processed via a protocolized approach where the sections were cut perpendicularly to the bowel wall, there was still some variation in the orientation and original localization of the section. However, this expected variation in the orientation was similar in the two groups and therefore it is unlikely that this has influenced the results. Moreover, due to the paucity of existing data regarding fibrotic markers under these circumstances, no power calculations were performed, resulting in a potential underpowering of the study. Nonetheless, these data provide a good indication for the differences found between the two groups, as well as the information required for power calculations in future studies. In addition, IFX exposure in this study was limited to non-responders. Ideally, one would compare responders to non-responders directly, but as responders obviously do not require surgery, resection specimens are not available for this group and a direct comparison is not feasible. Instead, we included patients randomized to surgery immediately and therefore were IFX naive. As allocation was performed randomly, the expected failure rate for this group is similar to that seen in the patients who were randomized to receive IFX (30% [<xref rid="pone.0190999.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). It should thus be noted that the IFX naive group cannot be considered as fully equal to an &#x02018;IFX responder&#x02019; group. However, inclusion of potential non-responders among the IFX na&#x000ef;ve group would only result in an underestimation of the differences between responders and non-responders and therefore does not invalidate our results.</p><p>Although this study did not allow determination of a causative relationship, our findings suggest that intestinal fibrosis is associated with insufficient response to IFX therapy in Crohn&#x02019;s disease. Unfortunately, no biomarkers with predictive value for the development of intestinal fibrosis have been described to date. As our study evaluated surgical specimens, the direct translation of this data for prognostic use is limited. However, further evaluation of the use of (microscopic) fibrosis in biopsy material as a prognostic marker for response to anti-TNF seems warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0190999.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Increased Keratin 18 expression in the mucosa compared to the submucosa of all patients together.</title><p>KRT18: Keratin 18; 36B4: Acidic Ribosomal Protein 36B4.
