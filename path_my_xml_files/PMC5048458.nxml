Current topical agents have limited efficacy and undesirable side effects associated with long-term use. Tofacitinib is a small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor investigated for the topical treatment of psoriasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled Phase 2b study of tofacitinib ointment (2&#x000a0;% and 1&#x000a0;%) applied once (QD) or twice (BID) daily in adults with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis. Primary endpoint: proportion of patients with Calculated Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA-C) clear or almost clear and &#x02265;2 grade improvement from baseline at Weeks 8 and 12. Secondary endpoints: proportion of patients with PGA-C clear or almost clear; proportion achieving Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) response; percent change from baseline in PASI and body surface area; change from baseline in Itch Severity Item (ISI). Adverse events (AEs) were monitored and clinical laboratory parameters measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 435 patients were randomized and 430 patients received treatment. The proportion of patients with PGA-C clear or almost clear and &#x02265;2 grade improvement from baseline at Week 8 was 18.6&#x000a0;% for 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD (80&#x000a0;% confidence interval [CI] for difference from vehicle: 3.8, 18.2&#x000a0;%) and 22.5&#x000a0;% for 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID (80&#x000a0;% CI: 3.1, 18.5&#x000a0;%); this was significantly higher vs vehicle for both dosage regimens. No significant difference vs vehicle was seen at Week 12. Significantly more patients achieved PGA-C clear or almost clear with 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD and BID and 1&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD (not BID) at Week 8, and with 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID at Week 12. Pruritus was significantly reduced vs vehicle with 2&#x000a0;% and 1&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID (starting Day 2), and 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD (starting Day 3). Overall, 44.2&#x000a0;% of patients experienced AEs, 8.1&#x000a0;% experienced application site AEs, and 2.3&#x000a0;% experienced serious AEs. The highest incidence of AEs (including application site AEs) was in the vehicle QD group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In adults with mild to moderate plaque psoriasis, 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib ointment QD and BID showed greater efficacy than vehicle at Week 8, but not Week 12, with an acceptable safety and local tolerability profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01831466">NCT01831466</ext-link> registered March 28, 2013.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12895-016-0051-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Psoriasis</kwd><kwd>Topical</kwd><kwd>Tofacitinib</kwd><kwd>CP-690,550</kwd><kwd>Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment</kwd><kwd>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index</kwd><kwd>PASI</kwd><kwd>Dermatology Life Quality Index</kwd><kwd>Pruritus</kwd><kwd>Itch</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004319</institution-id><institution>Pfizer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The World Health Organization has described psoriasis as a &#x02018;chronic, non-communicable, painful, disfiguring and disabling disease for which there is no cure&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The majority of people with plaque psoriasis (75&#x02013;90&#x000a0;%) are considered to have relatively limited mild to moderate disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Many treatments are available for mild to moderate psoriasis, including topical treatment with corticosteroids, often in combination with vitamin D analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The use of mid to high potency corticosteroids can be limited by local and systemic adverse effects, particularly on the face and intertriginous areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Irritation or burning can also occur with vitamin D analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

The limited efficacy of non-steroidal topical monotherapy or low potency corticosteroids and the safety issues associated with long-term use of mid to high potency topical corticosteroids suggest an unmet need exists for additional topical therapeutic options.</p><p>Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a small molecule Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor; inhibition of JAK1 and JAK3 by tofacitinib blocks signaling of multiple cytokines implicated in immune response and inflammation.

An ointment formulation of tofacitinib investigated for the topical treatment of psoriasis in a Phase 2a study showed the ointment (2&#x000a0;% twice daily [BID]) was effective with acceptable tolerability for mild to moderate psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective of this Phase 2b study was to further characterize the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib ointment (2&#x000a0;% and 1&#x000a0;%) applied once daily (QD) or BID over 12&#x000a0;weeks in adult patients with mild or moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, compared with the corresponding vehicle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study (NCT01831466), conducted at 52 centers in the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Poland, was initiated in May 2013 and completed in September 2014. Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive 1&#x000a0;% (10&#x000a0;mg/g) tofacitinib ointment, 2&#x000a0;% (20&#x000a0;mg/g) tofacitinib ointment or corresponding vehicle. Randomization was stratified by baseline severity of psoriasis as defined by the Calculated Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment (PGA-C). Investigators, study staff and sponsor remained blinded to treatment and randomization information until after the conclusion of the study. Investigator sites were assigned to either QD or BID regimen, but not both; neither investigators nor patients were blinded to regimen.</p><p>Tofacitinib ointment was provided in 60&#x000a0;g tubes at a strength of 2&#x000a0;% (maximum feasible concentration) and 1&#x000a0;%; the matching vehicle contained the same inactive ingredients as tofacitinib ointment. Treatments were administered topically at a target application coverage of 3&#x000a0;mg/cm<sup>2</sup> to a treatment area corresponding to 2 to 20&#x000a0;% of the patient&#x02019;s body surface area (BSA). Patients were instructed to treat all treatment-eligible psoriatic areas identified at baseline for 12&#x000a0;weeks, regardless of clearing or improvement in psoriasis. On study visit days, showering or bathing, but not moisturizing, was permitted prior to attending, and study drug was applied in the clinic after study assessments were completed. After the final study treatment, the treatment areas were left untreated during the 4-week follow-up period.</p><p>Use of shampoo containing tar, salicylic acid or low or least potent corticosteroid products (eg hydrocortisone and hydrocortisone acetate &#x02264;1&#x000a0;%) was permitted on hair-bearing scalp only throughout the study.

These PGA subscores were then summed, averaged, and rounded to the nearest whole number to determine the PGA-C score and category [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Evaluation of the PGA-C excluded the scalp (even if the hairless scalp was being treated with study drug), palms, soles, and nails.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects achieving a PGA-C response of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with &#x02265;2 grade improvement from baseline at Week 8 and Week 12, independently. Secondary endpoints included Week 8 and Week 12 assessments of the proportion of patients achieving a PGA-C response of clear (0) or almost clear (1); the proportion of patients achieving a &#x02265;75&#x000a0;% improvement from baseline in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI75); the percent change from baseline in PASI; and the percent change from baseline in affected BSA.</p><p>Evaluation of patient-reported outcomes included change from baseline in itch severity and in the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). The severity of itch was assessed via the Itch Severity Item (ISI), a single item instrument in which the patient records itching over the previous 24&#x000a0;h on a numerical rating scale of 0 (no itching) to 10 (worst possible itching) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. ISI was recorded in the clinic during Visit 1 (baseline/Day 1) and at Visits 3&#x02013;7 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16), as well as once per day between Visit 1 and the day before Visit 3 by the patient in a diary prior to application of study treatment. Patients in the BID treatment group recorded the ISI before applying either the morning or evening treatment, but at the same time throughout this period.</p><p>Safety endpoints included the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), and application site AEs, plus the proportion of patients who discontinued due to application site AEs. Physical examination, monitoring of vital signs, and clinical laboratory assessments (including hematology, fasting serum chemistry, fasting lipid panels, and urinalysis) were performed.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints included tofacitinib PK concentrations for pre-dose and post-dose samples. Pre-dose blood samples were collected at baseline and at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (0&#x000a0;h). At selected sites, three PK samples were also collected at Week 4 post-dose between 30&#x000a0;min and 1&#x000a0;h, between 2 and 3&#x000a0;h, and between 4 and 10&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This was an estimation study. A sample size of 70 subjects per treatment group was selected, such that the 80&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) width of the difference between tofacitinib and vehicle was approximately 19&#x000a0;%, assuming a 21&#x000a0;% vehicle response and a 36&#x000a0;% response in tofacitinib. Additionally, this sample size would yield approximately 76&#x000a0;% power to establish the superiority of each strength and regimen of tofacitinib to its respective vehicle for the primary endpoint at the 0.10 (one-sided) significance level. No adjustment for multiple comparisons was made.</p><p>Patients with mild or moderate psoriasis at baseline (as defined by PGA-C) who were randomized and received at least one dose of study medication (tofacitinib or vehicle) were included in the analyses. Data at Week 8 and Week 12 were evaluated separately.</p><p>For the primary endpoint, standard error (SE) and two-sided 80&#x000a0;% CI were calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial proportions. A stratified analysis was conducted by summarizing the difference in proportions adjusted for the baseline PGA-C disease severity using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Patients with missing values were considered non-responders.</p><p>PASI75 and PGA-C response of clear or almost clear were analyzed using a marginal logistic regression model fit by pseudo-likelihood (generalized linear mixed model for repeated measures). Response proportions were estimated from the model and odds ratios for treatment contrasts along with 80&#x000a0;% CI were determined. Continuous variables (eg percent change from baseline in PASI and BSA, and change from baseline in ISI) were analyzed using a linear mixed model for repeated measures. Least squares mean (LSM), difference in LSM, SE, and two-sided 80&#x000a0;% CI were calculated. All analyses used observed data without imputation. Separate models were fit for the QD and BID data.</p><p>For comparisons in response proportions between the active treatment and corresponding vehicle, statistical significance was declared if the lower limit of the two-sided 80&#x000a0;% CI for the response difference was &#x0003e;0 for the primary efficacy endpoint, and if the lower limit of the two-sided 80&#x000a0;% CI for the odds ratio was &#x0003e;1 for the secondary PGA-C and PASI75 endpoints. For comparisons in LSMs between active treatment and corresponding vehicle, statistical significance was declared if the upper limit of the two-sided 80&#x000a0;% CI was &#x0003c;0 for percent change from baseline in PASI and BSA and change from baseline in ISI.

Greater efficacy response was generally observed with 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib than 1&#x000a0;% tofacitinib, and overall no clear distinction in efficacy was seen between BID and QD dosing.</p><p>Greater efficacy of tofacitinib compared with vehicle was seen for more primary and secondary efficacy endpoints at Week 8 than Week 12. While it appeared that the PGA-C response of clear or almost clear and &#x02265;2 grade improvement from baseline plateaued after Week 8, the vehicle treatment group PGA-C responses continued to improve after Week 8, thereby decreasing the difference between tofacitinib and vehicle at Week 12. Explanation for the increase in vehicle responses between Week 8 and Week 12 was not evident after thorough review of the study data for potential contributing factors, although it is possible this could be related to the small sample size of the study.</p><p>Patients were required to achieve a &#x02265;2 grade improvement from baseline in PGA-C in addition to having a PGA-C score of clear or almost clear to be considered a responder for the primary efficacy endpoint. This is a much more challenging threshold than the achievement of a PGA-C score of clear or almost clear alone, when a patient need only change from mild (2) to almost clear (1) to be considered a responder. This more stringent criterion is used, as a change from the low end of the mild range to the high end of the almost clear range may not represent a clinically meaningful change.</p><p>The clinical significance of objective changes in disease severity were confirmed by the improvement in patient-reported measures. Improvements in health-related quality of life, as indicated by DLQI, reflected the changes seen in PGA-C and PASI. Greater improvements in pruritus were seen compared with vehicle in both tofacitinib BID dosing groups from Day 2 of dosing and for 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD from Day 3. The improvements in pruritus from baseline were likely clinically meaningful (defined as a LSM decrease from baseline in ISI of 2 points based on analyses conducted with oral tofacitinib therapy for psoriasis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and were seen with 1&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID from Day 4 through Day 14, with 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID from Day 5 through Day 14, and with 2&#x000a0;% tofacitinib QD from Day 8 through Day 14 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have shown oral tofacitinib improved patient-reported pruritus in moderate to severe psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is a direct effect, independent from improvements in clinician-reported signs of psoriasis severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], with a statistically significant improvement occurring as early as the second day of dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Topical tofacitinib also improves pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>A very rapid reduction in ISI was seen on initiation of treatment, with a significant reduction in pruritus with both 2&#x000a0;% and 1&#x000a0;% tofacitinib BID compared with vehicle BID as early as the day following the initial dose. Although pruritus is a common feature of psoriasis, the underlying pathogenesis is not understood. Impaired innervation and neuropeptide imbalance in psoriatic skin may be involved; other potential mechanisms include increased expression of IL-2, the opioid system, prostanoids, IL-31, serotonin, proteases and/or vascular abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Tofacitinib inhibition of JAK may suppress pruritus by blocking signaling via IL-31 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and reducing expression of IL-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. As neuropeptides have a role in the pathogenesis of both psoriasis and pruritus, increased expression of substance P receptor, high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor or calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor may be involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Overall, topically administered tofacitinib had an acceptable safety profile, with no clinically meaningful differences in the incidence of AEs or SAEs between tofacitinib and vehicle treatment groups. The incidence of AEs coding to the MedDRA Infections and Infestations system organ class was higher in patients receiving vehicle than patients receiving tofacitinib. None of the side effects associated with topical application of potent corticosteroids were observed.</p><p>The range of observed plasma concentrations of tofacitinib from the PK analysis showed significant overlap between the dose strengths and regimens. Both AUC<sub>tau</sub> and maximum observed plasma concentration were higher in patients with QD administration than with BID administration, which was not expected. In addition to dose strength and regimen, PK exposure is likely related to the treatment BSA and/or ointment application rate and this may be contributing to the lack of clear differentiation between the regimens.</p><p>In Phase 3 studies of oral tofacitinib in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis, serious infections and herpes zoster infections were associated with tofacitinib treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Based on an exposure-response analysis of oral tofacitinib psoriasis data, an average tofacitinib exposure of 12.4&#x000a0;ng/mL was not associated with increased incidence rates of serious infections and herpes zoster infections when compared to patients treated with placebo (unpublished observations). In the current study, more than 83&#x000a0;% of tofacitinib levels measured in plasma from patients in all active treatment groups were &#x0003c;1.0&#x000a0;ng/mL, which represents a &#x0003e;12-fold margin to the exposure levels for oral tofacitinib with no increased incidence rates for serious and herpes zoster infections relative to placebo observed in the oral tofacitinib Phase 3 psoriasis program.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study limitations</title><p>To form the basis for further clinical development, this Phase 2b estimation study used the 2-sided 80&#x000a0;% confidence interval as the pre-specified confidence level per study protocol, whereas in a Phase 3 trial the more rigorous 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval or 0.05 significance level would be used. The stringent eligibility criteria of a Phase 2b clinical study generally exclude some patients who may have been considered for topical treatment outside of the clinical trial environment. The numbers of patients included in the study (~70 per treatment group) is a relatively small sample size. Caution is therefore needed in extrapolating findings to real-world clinical practice. No active comparator to tofacitinib was included so efficacy was not assessed relative to another agent with a known therapeutic effect in psoriasis. No formal statistical comparison was made between QD and BID application, as study sites were assigned to either QD or BID regimens, not both. As such, the dosing regimens essentially represent two separate sub-studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This small Phase 2b study demonstrated that topical treatment with the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib in an ointment formulation provided improvement in the clinical signs of psoriasis for patients with mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis.
