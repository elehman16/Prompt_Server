We have previously shown that DNA vaccine priming increases the magnitude and quality of antibody responses to H5N1 monovalent inactivated boost. We now report the safety and immunogenicity of a H7 DNA-H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine prime-boost regimen. In this Phase 1, open label, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated three H7N9 vaccination regimens in healthy adults, with a prime-boost interval of 16 weeks. Group 1 received H7 DNA vaccine prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine boost. Group 2 received H7 DNA and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a prime and H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine as a boost. Group 3 received H7N9 monovalent inactivated vaccine in a homologous prime-boost regimen. Overall, 30 individuals between 20 to 60 years old enrolled and 28 completed both vaccinations. All injections were well tolerated with no serious adverse events. 2 weeks post-boost, 50% of Group 1 and 33% of Group 2 achieved a HAI titer&#x02009;&#x02265;1:40 compared with 11% of Group 3. Also, at least a fourfold increase in neutralizing antibody responses was seen in 90% of Group 1, 100% of Group 2, and 78% of Group 3 subjects.

Julie Ledgerwood and her team from the United States&#x02019; National Institutes of Health in collaboration with colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tested their two-stage vaccine protocol in humans, showing it to be effective and safe. The vaccine consists of an initial injection of viral DNA, which &#x02018;primes&#x02019; the immune system to the pathogen, followed by a follow-up injection of an inactivated purified viral protein, which further boosts the host&#x02019;s production of protective antibodies.

While this trial contained a limited number of subjects, these results are consistent with prior studies evaluating a similar regimen for H5N1, which showed that H5 DNA priming for an H5N1 MIV vaccine improved the antibody response when the boost interval was greater than 12 weeks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par15">An HAI titer of &#x02265;1:40 is the traditional benchmark used as a correlate for protection against seasonal influenza and as one criterion for licensing seasonal influenza vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> However, it remains unclear what level of HAI titer is associated with protection against novel influenza strains including H7N9. Serologic evaluation of laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 in China suggest that robust antibody responses are associated with increased survival. In one cohort of 45 patients infected with H7N9, 64.9% of survivors had H7N9 HAI titers&#x02009;&#x02265;80 while among fatal cases, only 28.6% had HAI titers&#x02009;&#x02265;80 (ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>). In contrast, an additional serological evaluation of 18 patients with confirmed H7N9 infection revealed that early and rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies, rather than HAI, correlated with improved clinical outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> In our study, 50% of those receiving the heterologous vaccine regimen of H7 DNA prime-H7N9 MIV boost achieved HAI titers &#x02265;1:40 following the boost compared with only 1 of 9 receiving H7N9 MIV prime alone and boost. The HAI titers of the subjects were compared against both the Anhui and Shanghai strains. In subjects that received the H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV prime concurrently, there was a significant increase compared to the H7N9 MIV prime alone group for the Shanghui strain (14.7 vs. 5.8, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) and marginal significance for the Anhui strain (21.6 vs. 8.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.063). Nevertheless, the trends are very similar over the two strains. This difference in significance may have occurred due to the small number of subjects involved in the study.</p><p id="Par16">Previous studies have indicated that older individuals may suffer from immunosenescence following vaccination.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> While our study did contain a small number of older subjects, upon enrollment they were block randomized stratified by age to prevent any bias. Upon analysis, the HAI titers for these older subjects were found to be comparable to those of the younger subjects; suggesting that there was no age effect on the vaccine response in this study.</p><p id="Par17">In addition, the magnitude of vaccine induced neutralizing antibody responses was 4 to 5-fold greater in the subjects who received the DNA prime. The immunogenicity of the H7 DNA prime was not negatively impacted by co-administration of the H7N9 MIV prime. Subjects who received both the H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV prime concurrently achieved higher neutralizing antibody titers prior to the boost compared with those receiving only the H7 DNA prime, suggesting that the combination priming regimen may provide earlier protection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par18">Since the emergence of H7N9 in China in 2013, several candidate vaccines have been evaluated in humans including a MF59-adjuvanted, cell-culture-derived H7N9 monovalent subunit vaccine that induced HAI titers &#x02265;1:40 in 52% of recipients following a 2-dose strategy,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> an ISCOMATRIX-adjuvanted, recombinant virus-like particle Influenza A/H7N9 vaccine that achieved HAI titers &#x02265;1:40 in up to 80.6% of those receiving two doses,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and an AS03-adjuvanted monovalent inactivated H7N9 vaccine that elicited HAI titers &#x02265;1:40 in up to 84% of recipients following a two-dose regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup> These vaccines, however, required multiple doses as well as an adjuvant to achieve immunogenicity. While the vaccine strategy described here still requires more than one dose, this study did not require adjuvants and included a DNA vaccine platform. The advantages of DNA vaccine platforms include: lack of anti-vector immunity, plasmid DNA stability, speed and ease of manufacturing and enhanced antibody and T-cell responses when administered via needle-free delivery system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> Previous experience with DNA vaccines shows them to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic as a priming vaccine, and they may be optimally suited for pre-pandemic scenarios where pre-existing immunity is lacking in the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>
</p><p id="Par19">In conclusion, the administration of H7 DNA and H7N9 MIV vaccines in prime-boost regimens was safe and well tolerated. Subjects that received H7 DNA as a priming vaccine developed higher HAI and neutralizing antibody titers 2 weeks following the H7N9 MIV boost. While the small trial size is a limitation to this study, the results do agree with previous studies involving DNA priming vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> Although demonstrated in multiple clinical trials, the mechanisms underlying this DNA priming effect remain poorly understood and continue to warrant evaluation. Since the population is generally naive to H7, this provided the unique opportunity to evaluate immune responses to novel influenza vaccine platforms in the absence of baseline immunity. Further evaluation of the DNA prime-inactivated protein boost regimen on the diversity of the B cell repertoire, and the ability to elicit stem-specific antibodies capable of neutralizing heterologous influenza virus strains will provide additional insight into the complex immunological response to influenza vaccination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par20">VRC 315 was a single-site, phase 1, open label, randomized clinical trial performed at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Vaccine Research Center (VRC), NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA.
