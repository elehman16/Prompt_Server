NAS is characterized by gastrointestinal, central nervous system, autonomic and respiratory signs and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Although the syndrome mostly occurs in the context of antepartum opioid use, with the growing prevalence of illicit drug use, other drugs have also been described to cause NAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Based on a recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) in the United States 5.9&#x000a0;% of pregnant women reported using illicit drugs during gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Among the neonates who were exposed to illicit drugs in utero, withdrawal signs and symptoms requiring medical intervention develop in 27&#x02013;91&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The treatment rate is usually higher among poly substance and opioid exposed neonates (60&#x02013;70&#x000a0;%) and lower in stimulants only exposed neonates (less than 10&#x000a0;%) whose the majority do not require pharmacologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the last decade with the increase in the incidence of NAS, the total hospital charges have dramatically increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Prompt diagnosis and treatment of NAS is important because of its serious and potentially life threatening complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although non-pharmacologic treatments have been proposed for the management of NAS, especially for the neonates born to cocaine or methamphetamines only dependent mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], most neonates with NAS require pharmacologic treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Many agents have been proposed for the treatment of NAS including opioids, anticonvulsants, &#x003b1;2-adrenergic antagonists, benzodiazepines, chloral hydrate and chlorpromazine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However the optimal pharmacologic treatment of NAS has not been established and is still debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition despite all the proposed treatments the duration of hospital stay for NAS remained relatively unchanged during the past decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Morphine is the most commonly used drug as an initial therapy for the treatment of NAS, however the evidence suggesting the effect of prolonged opioid exposure on the developing neonatal brain made the researchers search for an alternative drug for initial NAS treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Phenobarbital is another drug widely used for the treatment of non-opioid NAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. some studies tried to compare Phenobarbital versus Morphine in the treatment of NAS; In the studies of Jackson et al. and Ebner et al. shorter treatment duration was noted in the Morphine treated group compared to the Phenobarbital treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the study of Jackson et al. all the mothers had received Methadone during pregnancy. Also in the study of Ebner et al. the mothers were only opioid dependent. Considering the increasing prevalence of polysubstance use during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and that Phenobarbital is preferred in the NAS due to intrauterine polysubstance exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], studies are needed to compare Phenobarbital versus Morphine treatment in the neonates born to mothers who used other addictive drugs in addition to opioids during gestation. Additionally it is documented that the use of loading dose of Phenobarbital significantly reduces the time for symptom control in neonates with NAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the available studies no loading dose was used, therefore it is still unknown if there is any differences in the duration of treatment and hospital stay in the Morphine versus Phenobarbital treated groups when loading dose of Phenobarbital is used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>We conducted this study to compare the efficacy of initial Phenobarbital treatment with loading and maintenance dose versus Morphine treatment in the neonates born to drug (opioids, stimulants and polysubstance) dependent mothers who exhibit NAS requiring pharmacologic treatment. The primary goal of the study was to evaluate the duration of treatment required for NAS resolution. The total hospital stay and the requirement for additional second line treatment were secondary aims of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and study design</title><p>This multicentric prospective, randomized, open label, trial was conducted on 60 neonates who were born to illicit drugs dependent mothers and exhibited NAS requiring medical therapy who were admitted at Vali-Asr and Akbar-Abadi teaching hospitals of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, from August 2009 through February 2014.

The need for adjunctive therapy failed to show statistically significant difference between the two groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial we evaluated 60 neonates with NAS who were born to illicit drugs dependent mothers, there were no significant differences in the duration of treatment required for the resolution of NAS, duration of total hospital stay, and the requirement for adjunctive treatment, between the neonates randomized to receive oral morphine sulfate and the neonates randomized to receive Phenobarbital. Currently the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends treating opioid withdrawal with an opioid, while Phenobarbital is only used as the adjunctive treatment for opioid withdrawal in the United States. The results of this paper show that using loading with titration doses of Phenobarbital can be also a good and reasonable first line option especially for the neonates with NAS who were exposed to polysubstance in utero, however more studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results.</p><p>Morphine Sulfate is the most commonly used drug as the first line treatment of both opioid and polydrug withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Many protocols for NAS treatment prefer morphine because of its effectiveness, predictable half-life and ease of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However the risks of prolonged and increased total cumulative exposure to opioids require attention; the evidence suggest that the opioids might negatively affect the growing brain through a dose dependent way, these effects include the reduction of brain size, weight, proteins, RNA, DNA, and neurotransmitters. These concerns made the researchers search for alternatives to the opioids in the management of NAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Phenobarbital is the second most commonly used drug for the management of both opioid and polysubstance withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is mostly used to treat NAS due to polydrug withdrawal and also neonatal seizures due to drug withdrawal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Phenobarbital has been shown to be superior to other sedatives in the management of NAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. and also it seems to have a particular utility in neonates with polydrug exposure in utero [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, concerns about Phenobarbital use in the literature include impairment of suckling, and adverse effects on the developing brain in long-term therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Phenobarbital have been used in different protocols for the treatment of NAS; titration dose alone, loading dose with titration, short course and long course of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. in the study of Finnegan et al. the time required to control NAS symptoms was significantly lower when a loading dose of Phenobarbital was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another study Kahn et al. compared the short and long courses of Phenobarbital treatment, they reported that there were no significant differences in treatment failure and the requirement for adjunctive therapy in short versus long courses of Phenobarbital treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the current study no significant differences were observed in the efficacy of Morphine Sulfate versus Phenobarbital in the treatment of NAS. This is in contrast to the previous studies; Jackson et al. and Ebner et al. both reported that Morphine sulfate was superior to Phenobarbital in the management of NAS due to shorter duration of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. several factors could explain the differences observed in the results compared to the previous studies: 1. In the study of Jackson et al. and Ebner et al. due to blinding no loading dose of Phenobarbital was used, this could have introduced bias in the favor of Morphine Sulfate. 2. The types of drugs used by mothers; all the mothers in the study of Jackson et al. and Ebner et al. had received opioids in their pregnancy, while in our study not all the neonates were exposed to opioids in utero, and also in Jackson&#x02019;s study 22&#x000a0;% in the Morphine group and 44&#x000a0;% in the Phenobarbital group had used Benzodiazepines while mothers who had used Benzodiazepines were excluded from our study. 3. The scoring system and inclusion criteria: in Jackson&#x02019;s study Lipsitz scoring system was used to evaluate NAS severity and treatment, in Ebner&#x02019;s study Finnegan scoring system was used and the neonates with Finnegan score of 10 or more were included in the study, while we used Finnegan scoring system in this study and the neonates with Finnegan score of eight or more were included in the study. In addition in our study breastfed neonates were excluded due to the possible effect of breastfeeding on NAS symptoms while in the previous studies these neonates were not excluded.</p><p>The main strength of our study was using the loading and maintenance dose of Phenobarbital and comparing it to the effect of Morphine Sulfate on NAS treatment. Using short course of Phenobarbital treatment, involving mothers with substance abuse other than opioids and polysubstance users in the study were other strengths of the study. There are several limitations in our study that should be mentioned for future research: 1. we didn&#x02019;t measure the serum level of Phenobarbital in our study, this could help in better and more practical interpretation of the results. 2. measuring the adverse events of the treatments was not among the purposes of the study, comparing the adverse effects could help in better understanding and decision making. 3. In this study women who used nicotine were not excluded of the study, since nicotine has been shown to affect the severity of NAS symptoms, this point should be considered when interpreting the results. 4. Due to the nature of the study, it was un-blinded; this could potentially affect as the results of the study. 5. To minimize the factors that could potentially bias the results of the study, many exclusion criteria were used, therefore the generalizabilty of the findings should be considered when interpreting the results of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Phenobarbital and Morphine treatments are equally effective in the management of NAS. Phenobarbital treatment when used in a loading followed by maintenance doses can be used as an effective and appropriate initial treatment in the neonates with NAS who were exposed to illicit drugs in utero (opioids, stimulants and polysubstance) and exhibit severe withdrawal signs and symptoms requiring pharmacologic intervention. There were no significant differences in the duration of treatment, duration of hospital stay, and the requirement for adjunctive treatment, between the neonates with NAS who received Morphine Sulfate and those who received Phenobarbital.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FN designed and carried out the study, participated in the interpretation of data and writing the paper.
