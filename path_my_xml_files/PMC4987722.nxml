The term dates back to medieval times and is based on the concept that fear or horror would &#x0201c;run the blood cold&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;curdle&#x0201d; (congeal) blood.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The validity of this theory has, however, never been studied.

We hypothesised that acute fear activates the coagulation system and that this poses an important evolutionary benefit, by preparing the body for blood loss during life threatening situations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We recruited 24 healthy volunteers aged &#x02264;30 years from among students, alumni, and employees of the Leiden University Medical Centre. We excluded those who were taking prescribed drugs, pregnant, using hormonal contraceptives, had a history of thrombosis, and had had surgery or been immobilised with a cast in the past two months.</p><p>One group (n=14) were assigned to watch the horror movie <italic>Insidious</italic> (2010)<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1929288729?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_2">www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi1929288729?ref_=tt_pv_vi_aiv_2</ext-link>) followed by the documentary <italic>A Year in Champagne</italic> (2014).<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The other group (n=10) watched the movies in reverse order (see supplementary file for authors&#x02019; descriptions of these movies). As movie nights were set on specific dates, group allocation was based on availability of the participants. Each movie lasted approximately 90 minutes and they were shown one week apart at the same time of day (fig 1<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1"/>). Participants were seated in comfortable chairs and were not aware in advance of either the movie genre or the study hypothesis; we provided them with a leaflet explaining that the study aimed to determine the effects on coagulation of sitting still and watching movies.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><caption><p><bold>Fig 1</bold> Flow of participants through study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nemb029359.f1_default"/></fig><p>The movies were shown at the Department of Clinical Epidemiology&#x02019;s main meeting room, which for the purposes of this study was transformed into a home-style cinema. The room has a non-threatening, welcoming atmosphere. Participants were asked to avoid alcohol and tobacco on movie days. To reduce the risk of confounding by superstition, no movies were shown during a full moon or on Friday the 13th. The participants provided written informed consent.</p><sec><title>Laboratory measurements</title><p>Within 15 minutes before each movie, we took blood samples from each participant&#x02019;s antecubital vein and used the contralateral arm for the second blood sample taken within 15 minutes after each movie.</p><p>Markers of coagulation activity (or potential &#x0201c;fear factors&#x0201d;) were blood coagulant factor VIII (IU/dL), D-dimer (ng/mL), thrombin-antithrombin complexes (&#x003bc;g/L), and prothrombin fragments 1+2 (pmol/L). Blood samples were drawn in vacuum tubes containing 0.105M sodium citrate and centrifuged at 2500 g for 10 minutes at 18&#x000b0;C within one hour of venepuncture. After aliquoting, the samples were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. All markers were determined within one batch. We measured prothrombin fragments 1+2 and thrombin-antithrombin complexes in duplicate and the samples were measured using a sandwich-type enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (Siemens, Marburg, Germany). Coagulant factor VIII and D-dimer levels were measured using the TOP analyser (Werfen Instrumentation Laboratory, Barcelona, Spain). The laboratory technicians were not aware of which movie corresponded to which blood sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Fear scale and questionnaire</title><p>After each movie the participants completed a visual analogue fear scale, designed specifically for this study. This scale estimates the degree of fear experienced while watching a movie, ranging from 0 (no fear at all) to 10 (worst fear imaginable). Additionally, participants reported whether they had already seen the movie and rated it on a scale from 0 (worst ever) to 10 (best ever). Finally, the participants completed a general questionnaire on lifestyle and favourite movie genre.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>We calculated the sample size required for evaluation of coagulant factor VIII activity (two sided test, &#x003b1;=0.05, &#x003b2;=0.90) and determined that 23 participants would be required to observe an increase of 15 IU/dL (150 IU/L) or more (assuming a correlation between the difference in measurements at the two time points of 0.7). Taking into account possible dropouts, we determined that overall 24 participants would be required.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We summarised personal and baseline data as means with standard deviations, or proportions. Using a paired <italic>t</italic> test we compared the difference between the mean change in levels of coagulation markers (before and after watching the horror movie compared with before and after watching the educational movie). For the visual analogue fear scale we reported the mean change and 95% confidence intervals. At baseline (before both movies) the groups had similar levels of coagulation factors. Therefore we considered a carry-over effect to be absent and pooled the results of both groups by movie genre.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>The table shows the baseline characteristics of the study sample.

In two, a sample was visibly haemolytic. Therefore these results were considered unreliable because in the case of haemolysis, various measurements (coagulation factors among them) are known to be inaccurate owing to degradation of red blood cells. The third participant was tense before the first blood sample was taken (before watching the educational movie); in an attempt to relax before the second blood sample was taken he ingested a family pack of chocolates. He subsequently fainted while blood was being taken after the educational movie. Fainting was not observed in association with the second, horror, movie. Since the assumption for a crossover trial (that is, similar circumstances except for the intervention) was clearly not met, we regarded the results as unusable (coagulant factor VIII levels before and after the educational movie were 132 IU/dL and 346 IU/dL, respectively, and before and after the horror movie were 109 IU/dL and 123 IU/dL, respectively).</p><p>The mean baseline levels of coagulant factor VIII of the remaining 21 participants were similar before both the horror movie and the educational movie (mean difference &#x02212;2.9 IU/dL, 95% confidence interval &#x02212;10.1 to 4.2). However, the mean change in levels (difference between levels before and after the movie) was higher after the horror movie than after the educational movie (mean difference 11.1 IU/dL, 1.2 to 21.0, fig 2<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2"/>). Coagulant factor VIII levels increased in 12 (57%) participants during the horror movie, but only in 3 (14%) during the educational movie.

The mean increase in factor VIII levels of 11.1 IU/dL associated with acute fear could be clinically relevant, as every 10 IU/dL increase in coagulant factor VIII levels is associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval 7% to 28%) increase in the risk of venous thrombosis.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Levels of D-dimer, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, and prothrombin factors 1+2 did not prove to be fear factors. This indicates that although the coagulation cascade was influenced by acute fear, this did not lead to the formation of thrombin (thrombin-antithrombin complexes and prothrombin factors 1+2) and subsequent fibrin formation (D-dimer).</p><sec><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>A limitation of the study could be the magnitude of fear induced by the movie genre. Although some participants scored 7 or 8 on the visual analogue fear scale, there is definite room for the enhancement of fear. However, such designs might elicit ethical controversy and would likely be confounded by physical exertion. Secondly, we did not completely reach the intended sample size. Nevertheless, we still found a clear 11.1 IU/dL (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 21.0) increase in coagulant factor VIII levels after exposure to the horror movie. Thirdly, participants were not randomised by the order in which the movies were watched. Finally, the visual analogue fear scale was not validated.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications of this study</title><p>The underlying biological mechanism of acute fear associated with an increase in coagulation activity is still to be unravelled.
