Typically, diabetes care and glycemic control deteriorate throughout adolescence as parents increasingly disengage from care. Poorer adolescent management, once established, often persists into young adulthood (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Efforts to sustain effective diabetes care from late childhood through adolescence and to prevent deterioration in care could yield lasting and significant individual and public health benefits.</p><p>Parental monitoring of adolescent disease care contributes to better youth adherence and to better glycemic control (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) but can be associated with counterproductive family conflict (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The dual dilemma of diabetes care deterioration and increased conflict during adolescence is well recognized and has precipitated intervention efforts by Anderson et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), Laffel et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and Wysocki et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) that focus on more effective communication to offset increased conflict and decreased adherence (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Treatment studies generally adopt either a &#x0201c;prevention&#x0201d; orientation that seeks to avoid deterioration in care and increased conflict or an &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; focus to rectify problems once present. Prevention programs usually deliver a relatively smaller dose of uniform treatment to inoculate all pediatric patients within a given age range. Treatment sessions are relatively few, four or five, and usually brief (20&#x02013;25 min) adjunctive meetings to quarterly medical appointments (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These low-intensity features of clinic-integrated prevention programs are more translatable into routine care, since specialized psychological expertise is not required to identify, target, and treat individual &#x0201c;cases.&#x0201d; More complete descriptions of these programs have previously been published (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). In contrast, intervention programs typically are more intensive and selectively directed toward youth and families with identified problems&#x02014;usually, poorer adherence or glycemic control. Sessions are more frequent, such as weekly or bimonthly; lengthier (often an hour); and focus more intensively on individual and family processes deemed counterproductive to optimal disease care and family functioning (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Intervention treatment also has been used preventatively, for example, by Grey and colleagues (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to facilitate the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. However, intensive elements of intervention programs limit their ready adoption into routine clinical care. More comprehensive descriptions of these programs have previously been published (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>The current randomized clinical trial (RCT) sought to combine the optimal components of a prevention treatment approach (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) with the benefits of a brief intervention program of coping skills (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) to help early adolescents avoid deterioration in disease care and glycemic control. Prevention features included brief quarterly treatment sessions with adolescent/parent dyads as an adjunct to medical appointments and enrollment of all young adolescents, regardless of most preexisting problems. For an increased dose of treatment compared with a standardized education treatment, a more intensive coping skills program was provided via individualized dyadic instruction designed to sustain parental monitoring without an increase in conflict.</p><p>The efficacy of a family teamwork coping program versus a psychologically supportive education program to maintain parental involvement and disease care throughout early adolescence was evaluated in this RCT. Specifically, more sustained parental monitoring and disease care was hypothesized from baseline through follow-up for a coping versus an education comparison group without an accompanying increase in family conflict. Further, sustained or increased self-efficacy for diabetes management was expected with individualized coping treatment administered to parent/youth dyads. Based on the universal coping skills taught, the Coping group was hypothesized to have more sustained long-term follow-up. Finally, efficacy of the two treatments to mitigate adolescent deterioration in glycemic control was evaluated. Glycemic status of study participants was compared with that of a post hoc Usual Care (UC) group of adolescents. Participants in both treatment groups were projected to show less glycemic deterioration over time than a group of adolescents in UC.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligibility requirements were youth age 11&#x02013;14 years, disease duration &#x0003e;1 year, absence of severe medical/psychiatric complications, and English fluency. Youths were recruited without regard to glycemic control. Participants were 226 family dyads composed of one parent (92% mothers) and youth with type 1 diabetes. The same parent who started the study was requested to complete each treatment session and all assessments. Other parent caregivers were invited to participate, but few did.

Eligible families were contacted by letter and a follow-up telephone call. Written consent and assent were obtained. All study components were conducted at scheduled quarterly endocrinology appointments. Baseline and follow-up data consisted of self-report questionnaires completed separately by parents and adolescents. Medical data were corroborated via chart review. Assessments required 45&#x02013;60 min; families received gift cards in the amount of 25 USD at baseline.</p><p>The treatment program included four brief quarterly coping skills or diabetes educational sessions with one parent and youth, conducted before/after a medical appointment. Sessions began ~3.5 months after baseline assessment. Immediately after the fourth treatment session, quarterly follow-up assessments occurred for a maximum of 1.5 years after treatment completion or for a total of six possible assessments over the 3-year course of the study. Remuneration was 65 USD/follow-up assessment.</p><p>Power analysis indicated an <italic>N</italic> of 170 was necessary to detect a medium effect size between the Coping and Education groups with latent growth curve analysis (GCA) (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). To account for anticipated attrition of 5&#x02013;10% over the course of treatment, an <italic>N</italic> of at least 190 was sought. Of 395 eligible families successfully contacted, 281 consented to participate. Complete baseline data were provided by 257 dyads (90%). Baseline run-in failures that were not randomized cited a lack of interest or time to continue the study. Randomized participants (88%) were assigned in approximately a 1.5:1 ratio to coping or education treatment. Randomization, block stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels above and below 8.2% (66 mmol/mol), ensured that groups had equivalent proportions of participants with higher and lower HbA<sub>1c</sub> values. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref> for participant flow through the study. Most families completed the immediate posttest (95%), but only those enrolled earlier in the study could attain the 6th assessment (60%) for long-term 3-year follow-up.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) diagram with the participant flow through recruitment, randomization, and progress through the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1535fig1"/></fig><sec id="s5"><title>UC</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels from a group of UC adolescents (<italic>N </italic>= 205) were obtained post hoc from medical charts to provide a comparison of the natural course of glycemic status during adolescence.

The Coping group focused on developmental challenges surrounding the diabetes regimen with formal discussion and practice of coping skills (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) such as attitude and behavior change. Coping skills were discussed and practiced at four quarterly 30- to 45-min modules over a year. The first session included information about puberty, authoritative parenting, and the need for effective adolescent/parent communication. Treatment was individualized by eliciting areas of potential family concern surrounding a diabetes task or a coping skill, e.g., blood glucose monitoring or communication, with brief family practice plans designed to incorporate family input and to facilitate more effective coping with problems between visits. Other sessions included problem solving regarding blood glucose monitoring, conflict resolution surrounding dietary issues, and parental support and cognitive reframing to promote exercise (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>).</p><p>Graduate-level interventionists led the coping sessions with parent/youth dyads and were unknown to study participants prior to study start. A 2-day training workshop for interventionists occurred at study initiation followed by a 1-day refresher a year later. Coping sessions consisted of a brief introduction of family teamwork or a review of the previous session&#x02019;s content, information relevant to new content area, or an activity related to a new area and development of a behavioral practice plan. Sessions stressed continued parental involvement (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Active listening and open communication were modeled throughout, as were problem solving, conflict resolution, and cognitive reframing. After each session, families received a brochure of major session points along with an individualized practice plan developed during the session for home use. A follow-up telephone call 1 month later reviewed plan implementation and made modifications as needed.</p><p>The diabetes education sessions were led by BA-level facilitators who met with parent/youth dyads at four quarterly consecutive appointments for a year. Education facilitators were unknown to study participants prior to the study start. Facilitators had knowledge of pediatric diabetes and experience with families; facilitators received supervised training and monitoring throughout the course of the study. Sessions were 15&#x02013;20 min and consisted of ice-breaking social questions and the following diabetes content: communication about diabetes, diabetes and extracurricular activities, travel, and school issues that included 504 education plans and diabetes rights. After each completed session, education families received a brochure of the major session points. No discussion of parental involvement, authoritative parenting, or practice plans occurred. Education content was uniform&#x02014;not individualized&#x02014;and no patient contact occurred between sessions.</p><sec id="s7"><title>Treatment Fidelity</title><p>Both coping and education sessions were audio recorded for treatment fidelity.

A third (UC) comparison group was included only for the analysis of glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub>). GCA time intervals were recorded in years. Four steps compared group main effects and rate of outcome change, with the latter depicted as an interaction term to reflect outcome change over time. First, linearity of each outcome trajectory was examined with time and time squared as independent variables. A nonsignificant squared term indicates a linear trajectory. Second, an unconditional model with only time as an independent variable evaluated changes in trajectory over time. Third, a conditional model evaluated Group and Year as independent variables. A significant group coefficient indicates group differences in level of outcome from baseline to the last follow-up. The final step added a Group &#x000d7; Year interaction term as an independent variable to test group differences in rate of change for each outcome. Since SES is a significant factor related to most major outcomes in this clinical trial, SES was used as a covariate in all conditional models to minimize slight group differences (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s17"><title>Results</title><sec id="s18"><title>Demographic Features</title><p>Descriptive statistics are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Participants in this RCT were assigned to either a family teamwork Coping group or a diabetes Education comparison group. Each treatment consisted of four sessions with adolescent/parent dyads over the course of a year as an adjunct to quarterly medical appointments. Both groups successfully prevented deterioration in diabetes management behaviors and showed improvements over time in quality of life. Further, parents in both groups maintained their initial positive beliefs about the importance of parental monitoring, although monitoring decreased throughout the study, perhaps reflecting improved quality of life that occurred during the study or the natural tapering of parental monitoring that occurs with older adolescent age. Equally importantly, both parents and youth sustained feelings of self-efficacy for diabetes management during treatment despite behavioral and hormonal changes in early adolescence, ages 11&#x02013;14 years, which can disrupt diabetes care and glycemic control (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to expectation, the diabetes education comparison group performed as well or better than the teamwork Coping group on study outcomes. Importantly, disease adherence was maintained during this high-risk developmental transition as hypothesized for the Coping group, but disease adherence improved in the Education group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Both groups started the study with similar adherence scores at the lower end of the normative range (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Unexpectedly, the Education group alone improved disease care scores over time and more closely approximated the test standardization sample by study end. As hypothesized, disease care did not deteriorate in the Coping group, but neither did it improve like in the Education group. Consistent with adherence findings, the Education group alone improved in glycemic control from study start to finish (HbA<sub>1c</sub> 8.89&#x02013;8.61% [74 to 71 mmol/mol]) (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The Coping group generally sustained HbA<sub>1c</sub> values over the study as hypothesized but did not do better than the UC group, who had a similar but slightly higher elevation in HbA<sub>1c</sub> slope. Importantly, sustained adherence (Coping group) or improved adherence (Education group) occurred without increased diabetes-related or family conflict. The Education group performed as well or better than the Coping group in quality of life and other study outcomes, contrary to expectation. The common session format of parent/youth dyadic instruction appeared to facilitate family interaction, communication, and diabetes teamwork without an increase in conflict, regardless of treatment. However, study groups differed appreciably in the focus and participant demands of sessions. The coping sessions had a problem and process focus on identification of disease management concerns to facilitate individualization of coping skill instruction and development of diabetes practice plans. In contrast, the Education group received uniform information that was practical, if sometimes rudimentary, in a straightforward manner that was more efficient and focused on the information itself and not on the process of coping skill acquisition, which may have better aligned with the disease-specific study outcomes. Further, the individualization and problem focus of the Coping group sometimes elicited negative emotions, and its process orientation resulted in longer sessions than the briefer, neutral, and more focused exchanges of education information. Higher attrition in the Coping (9%) versus Education (0%) group at immediate follow-up may reflect these focus and process differences, although on average youth and parents in the Coping group felt that they learned more (4.0 on a 5-point scale) than the Education group (3.5 on a 5-point scale).</p><p>In keeping with the broad-based prevention goal of the study, adolescents and parents were recruited regardless of level of disease care or glycemic control. All participants were told they would learn methods to promote disease management and to prevent problems as youth transitioned into adolescence. The straightforward presentation of education information may have better matched participant expectations and needs, since many subjects did not report problems. Beyond participant expectations, the general lack of participant demands in the Education group may have better aligned with the low-intensity delivery of information at quarterly appointments. Additionally, with average diabetes duration of 5 years, most youth in the current study were 7 years old when diagnosed. Education may be particularly germane for youth 5 years after diagnosis. Although reeducation of youth after diagnosis is routinely recommended (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), it does not appear to be routinely implemented. Education may be particularly salient with transition into formal cognitive operations; abstraction skills can aid better understanding of diabetes information.</p><p>Beyond this prevention study, intervention studies that target youth in poorer glycemic control also find that diabetes education yields favorable outcomes. One small RCT used motivational interviewing (MI) or education to enhance diabetes care and improve poorer glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;9% [73 mmol/mol]) in adolescents hypothesized to lack motivation for more effective care. However, glycemic control of the MI adolescents actually deteriorated during the study versus that of an Education group that improved (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Wysocki et al. (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) treated small groups of families who received 12 bimonthly sessions of American Diabetes Association&#x02013;recommended education curricula versus more intensive individualized Behavioral Family Systems Therapy&#x02013;Diabetes. Education improved communication, family interactions, adherence, and glycemic control, even though the Education group was not taught communication or conflict resolution skills. Interestingly, Grey et al. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) have successfully adapted both coping and education sessions to an online delivery format.</p><p>In the current study, four quarterly coping sessions sustained disease adherence over 3 years, consistent with other problem-solving family teamwork programs with similar low-intensity delivery schedules (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). However, consistent with others, the current study also did not yield clear-cut improvements in glycemic control with coping skills treatment. Despite the greater formal education and skills of the coping interventionists and the lengthier coping treatment sessions, the Coping group nevertheless was less efficacious and less cost-effective than the Education group in effecting desirable diabetes outcomes. Also noteworthy, universally applicable coping skills were hypothesized to enhance more consistent generalization of treatment gains over time. However, 3-year follow-up favored the Education group. Accumulating evidence in this and other studies suggests that participants in prevention studies may have less need for individualized coping skill sessions and concomitantly have less &#x0201c;room&#x0201d; to improve glycemic control; i.e., regression to the mean is less striking with less distance from the mean in better functioning youth. Ideally, careful alignment of treatment goals, participant characteristics, session demands, and delivery schedule should optimize treatment efficacy.</p><p>In sum, adolescent/parent dyadic education sessions in the current study appeared to better align with the low-intensity broad-based prevention goal of this study than the coping skills sessions. Further, dyadic family (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) education sessions were briefer, standardized, and administered by less specialized facilitators; hence, they likely would be more cost-effective as well as more efficacious than coping instruction in a clinical setting. In essence, the coping sessions may have constituted &#x0201c;overtreatment&#x0201d; or treatment mismatched to the recruitment audience and session delivery schedule. Many middle-class families simply may not require the extra content and skill building that the coping sessions incorporated in order to sustain disease adherence and prevent conflict. Alternatively, coping skill training may prove more efficacious at earlier ages, perhaps 9&#x02013;11 years, to facilitate an unfettered focus on skill acquisition itself before the onset of adolescence. Finally, although the present sample was ethnically diverse, these findings should be weighed in light of the primarily middle-class sample that participated in this prevention study. Use of a randomized UC group also should be considered to enhance future research in this area.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
