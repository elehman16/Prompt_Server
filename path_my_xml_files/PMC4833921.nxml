UTIs are increasingly difficult and expensive to treat as the organisms that cause them become more antibiotic resistant. Among the SCI population, there is a high rate of multi-resistant organism [MRO] colonisation. Non-antibiotic prevention strategies are needed to prevent UTI without increasing resistance. Probiotics have been reported to be beneficial in preventing UTIs in post-menopausal women in several <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> studies. The main aim of this study is to determine whether probiotic therapy with combinations of Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14&#x02009;+&#x02009;Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 [RC14-GR1] and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bifidobacterium BB-12 [LGG-BB12] are effective in preventing UTI in people with SCI compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p>This is a multi-site randomised double-blind double-dummy placebo-controlled factorial design study conducted in New South Wales, Australia. All participants have a neurogenic bladder as a result of spinal injury. Recruitment started in April 2011.</p><p>Participants are randomised to one of four arms, designed for factorial analysis of LGG-BB12 and/or RC14-GR1 v Placebo. This involves 24&#x000a0;weeks of daily oral treatment with RC14-GR1&#x02009;+&#x02009;LGG-BB12, RC14-GR1&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo, LGG-BB12&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo or two placebo capsules. Randomisation is stratified by bladder management type and inpatient status. Participants are assessed at baseline, three months and six months for Short Form Health Survey [SF-36], microbiological swabs of rectum, nose and groin; urine culture and urinary catheters for subjects with indwelling catheters. A bowel questionnaire is administered at baseline and three months to assess effect of probiotics on bowel function.</p><p>The primary outcome is time from randomisation to occurrence of symptomatic UTI. The secondary outcomes are change of MRO status and bowel function, quality of life and cost-effectiveness of probiotics in persons with SCI. The primary outcome will be analysed using survival analysis of factorial groups, with Cox regression modelling to test the effect of each treatment while allowing for the other, assuming no interaction effect. Hazard ratios and Kaplan-Meier survival curves will be used to summarise results.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>If these probiotics are shown to be effective in preventing UTI and MRO colonisation, they would be a very attractive alternative for UTI prophylaxis and for combating the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance after SCI.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=335595&#x00026;isReview=true">ACTRN 12610000512022</ext-link>].

People with a spinal cord injury [SCI] and people with the spinal demyelinating form of Multiple Sclerosis [MS] are highly susceptible to the development of neurogenic bladder dysfunction.</p><p>UTIs have a high societal cost and current prevention strategies do not work. People with neurogenic bladder are at significant risk from UTI with approximately two [2] UTI episodes per year on average for persons with SCI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. One of the major clinical challenges for SCI patients and clinicians is that when patients get a UTI, simple oral antibiotics frequently are ineffective due to the high numbers of multi-resistant-organism [s] [MROs] within SCI populations [about 40&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% of SCI people] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This greatly amplifies the health, societal and economic consequences of disease and can even lead to life threatening clinical problems that can spread if not controlled through hospitals and the community. Health care costs associated with cross infection are estimated at US$18&#x02013;30 billion yearly in the USA and UK combined. Australian costs are expected to be proportionate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, based on the existing SCI UTI prevention literature, we have demonstrated that current commonly used methods of non-antibiotic UTI prevention in SCI do not work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The prevention of UTI, particularly the more difficult to treat MRO UTI, is therefore a clinical imperative for those people with SCI and neurogenic bladder. Non-antibiotic prevention is needed to prevent UTI without increasing the antimicrobial resistance burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Probiotics are defined as a preparation containing viable, defined micro-organisms in sufficient numbers, which alter the microflora [by implantation or colonization] in a compartment of the host and thus exert beneficial health effects in this host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Reid postulated that probiotics could reduce antibiotic related superinfections, disrupt bacterial biofilms, and enhance generalised mucosal immunity in the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In a systematic review conducted by Falagas et al., it was concluded that several probiotics tested, e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14, delivered either intravaginally or orally, were efficacious in restoring vaginal flora and in preventing recurrent UTIs in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In another trial, Manley et al. demonstrated clearance of vancomycin-related enterococci in stool after treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>There are currently no known trials of oral probiotics and its efficacy in prevention of UTIs in people with neurogenic bladders. Darouiche and others have conducted more invasive trials involving inoculating neurogenic bladders with benign strains of Escherichia coli and showed this approach was effective at lowering the rate of UTIs per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary aim</title><p>To test the effectiveness of combination oral probiotic therapy Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14&#x02009;+&#x02009;Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 [RC14-GR1 capsules] and/or Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG&#x02009;+&#x02009;Bifidobacterium BB-12 [LGG-BB12 capsules] in preventing UTI in people with SCI compared to placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary aims</title><p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>To examine whether probiotics may change or prevent colonisation or infection with MROs in persons with SCI.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To examine the effects of probiotics on bowel function in persons with SCI</p></list-item><list-item><p>Examination of indwelling and suprapubic catheters to determine:</p></list-item><list-item><p>How probiotic intervention affects microbial community composition in the urine and urinary catheter.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Differences between microbial communities in individuals who are symptomatic versus asymptomatic for UTI.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To estimate the cost-effectiveness of probiotics in persons with SCI</p></list-item></list></p><p>A randomised controlled trial [RCT] was selected as the design most likely to provide a definitive conclusion to the primary aim.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a prospective multi-site randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled factorial design trial conducted in the state of New South Wales [NSW] Australia, in order to test the effectiveness of two probiotic therapies in preventing UTI in people with SCI.

These units are located at the Prince of Wales Hospital [POWH], Royal Rehabilitation Centre Sydney [RRCS] and Royal North Shore Hospital [RNSH].</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>A multi-site ethics approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee [HREC] at each of the three SCI units in NSW, Australia.

JS is responsible for generating the allocation sequence. Randomisation is stratified by bladder management types [indwelling/suprapubic vs intermittent catheters vs condom drainage/reflex voiding] as well as inpatient/outpatient status.
