The co-primary outcomes were the number of hospitalizations and ED visits for COPD or breathing-related problems over 12 months. The Minneapolis VA Health Care System Institutional Review Board approved the study as Protocol 4140-B for all three sites and waived written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Entrance criteria</title><p>Potential subjects were identified through the upper Midwest Veterans Integrated Service Network COPD Chronic Disease Management registry.

Exclusion criteria included a COPD exacerbation requiring an ED visit or hospitalization at a VA within the last 12 months, or subject refusal to participate in the study. All patients in the registry who met the study criteria were included in the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to education or usual care according to an electronically-generated random number table, stratified by site. A locally-developed educational brochure was mailed to patients in the education group. The content of the brochure included topics which were included in the face-to-face education we provided to high-risk COPD patients in our previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-copd-7-719">6</xref> The brochure we mailed to low-risk patients included recommendations for smoking cessation, influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations, regular exercise, information about medications for COPD, and information about recognizing and treating COPD exacerbations (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary materials</xref>). In contrast to our previous study, we did not provide face-to-face education or follow-up telephone calls. We also did not provide written COPD exacerbation action plans or prescriptions for action plan steroids or antibiotics; rather, the brochure included a recommendation that patients contact their medical providers to discuss these treatments if they experienced symptoms of COPD exacerbation. In addition, the first mailing included a disease-specific, personal goal-setting questionnaire (smoking cessation, increasing daily activity, eating a healthy diet, losing weight, or receiving an influenza vaccination) (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary materials</xref>), and an option for the patient to decline participation in the study. After 3 months, patients in the education group were mailed a second brochure containing a brief review of the information in the first brochure, as well as local patient testimonials about the benefits of adherence to evidence-based COPD treatment (see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">supplementary materials</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The co-primary outcomes of the trial were the number of hospital admissions and ED visits for COPD within the VA, and the number of self-reported breathing-related hospital admissions and ED visits in non-VA facilities during the 12-month follow up period.

After 12 months we also mailed a survey to all patients inquiring about any hospitalizations or ED visits for breathing-related problems that had occurred in non-VA facilities within the past 12 months. Self-reported data from the latter were analyzed separately from the VA data. A six-question, locally-developed COPD knowledge test, based on the information that was provided in the initial educational brochure, was mailed to both groups at the end of the study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous variables are summarized as means and standard deviations and categorical variables as percentages.

We based our educational intervention on our previously successful study in high-risk patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-copd-7-719">8</xref> but in the current study we emphasized elements we thought would be most pertinent to low-risk patients: lifestyle choices, preventive measures, information about medications, and descriptions of symptoms for which patients should seek further medical attention. Because self-efficacy is considered to be an integral component of self-management of chronic diseases including COPD,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-7-719">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-7-719">15</xref> we also included patient goal-setting options.</p><p>Most studies examining the effect of COPD patient education on health care utilization have generally incorporated education as a component of resource-intense, comprehensive programs for high-risk patients, usually in conjunction with a chronic disease management or in the setting of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-copd-7-719">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-719">7</xref> The educational intervention in this study differed from that of our previous study in high-risk COPD patients, which had included face-to-face education, COPD exacerbation action plans, prescriptions, and follow-up phone calls. Compared to other studies of intensive disease management, our patient population also differed in terms of the severity of their airflow obstruction: the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> of low-risk COPD patients in our registry was 1.9 L, compared to 1.0&#x02013;1.2 L in the studies conducted by Bourbeau et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-copd-7-719">4</xref> and Fan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-719">7</xref></p><p>Intensive chronic disease management was associated with unexpected excess mortality in the recent study by Fan et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-719">7</xref> The authors could not discern the reason for the excess mortality, although they noted that their intervention failed to have an impact on patient behavior with regard to respiratory medication usage, including prednisone and antibiotics for COPD exacerbations. In a recent meta-analysis by Hurley et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-copd-7-719">28</xref> of ten COPD disease management trials, the excess mortality in the study by Fan et al was an outlier.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-719">7</xref> Nonetheless, we believe that it is important to carefully monitor the effects of educational interventions in COPD, including mortality and other unanticipated adverse events.</p><p>Disease management programs in high-risk COPD patients have, of necessity, included relatively small numbers of patients because of their resource-intense nature; yet high-risk patients represent only a small fraction of the total population of patients. Over 90% of the COPD patients in the upper Midwest VAHCS Chronic Disease COPD registry are classified as low-risk, (ie, lacking a COPD-related ED visit or hospitalization within the VAHCS in the past 12 months). We did not perform a formal cost-benefit analysis, but our results suggest that a proactive, practical, low-cost educational intervention in a large number of low-risk patients might be cost-effective by reducing respiratory-related hospitalizations.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; basic knowledge of COPD at the end of the 12-month study period was not better in the education group, and thus does not explain the observed reduction in patient-reported hospitalizations in non-VA facilities.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Our study has certain limitations. Consistent with the current demographics of patients receiving care in the VA, our patients were almost exclusively male. We did not ascertain how many patients actually received or read the brochure. The registry we used to identify low-risk COPD patients does not include hospitalizations and ED visits that occurred outside of the VA, so some high-risk patients may have been included in the sample, although the randomization of a large number of patients is expected to balance the risk profiles, and the potential existence of such unidentified patients may provide further justification for this intervention. Fewer than half of the patients in each group responded to the final survey, and we have no information about events that may have occurred outside the VA rates in non-responders. The incidence of breathing-related ED visits and hospitalizations outside the VA was considerably higher than that within the VA, but the relatively modest response rate to the survey limits the strength of this observation, which may be biased. Patients who received the education may have been more discriminating when attributing hospital admissions to breathing problems; however, the recall of major medical events among the respondents may have been better than among the usual care group. Finally, although our intervention had no apparent effect on patients&#x02019; knowledge of COPD, the questionnaire was brief and was not validated, and this may not have accurately reflected patients&#x02019; understanding of their disease.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A practical educational intervention incorporating principles of chronic disease management may reduce the rate of breathing-related hospitalizations in the large proportion of patients with COPD who are at relatively low-risk for such events. This effect appeared to be due to a reduction in hospitalizations outside of the VA, where most of the hospitalizations occurred. Further research that more closely tracks hospitalizations in non-VA facilities is needed to confirm this finding. This proactive approach may be justified, especially if it can be shown to be cost-effective.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Dr Siddique contributed to the conception and design of the study, interpreted the data, and drafted and revised the article critically for important intellectual content.
