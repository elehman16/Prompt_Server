The chronic complications of diabetes seriously affect quality of life and result in a significant decrease in life expectancy; they also impose a heavy economic burden. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of chronic diabetes complications have become a considerable medical problem attracting worldwide attention.</p><p>The macrovascular complications of diabetes, which can lead to cardiovascular diseases, are the major cause of death in patients with type 2 diabetes. A reduction in all-cause mortality among individuals with diabetes has occurred over time; however, the mortality rate from cardiovascular causes among individuals with diabetes remains approximately twofold higher than the rate in those without diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In recent years, the results of several large-scale clinical trials have illustrated that interventions for the various atherosclerosis (AS) risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes can reduce the risk of cardiovascular death by different degrees, although it remains controversial whether intensive glucose control can help prevent cardiovascular events. The Steno-2 study, which was conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria of any duration, demonstrated that target-driven, long-term, intensified interventions aimed at multiple risk factors can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by ~50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Thickening of the common carotid intima-media (CC-IMT) is considered a surrogate marker of early AS and vascular remodeling because it is correlated with all of the traditional vascular risk factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Monitoring a combination of CC-IMT thickening and plaque formation could significantly improve the prediction of cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Moreover, these factors can be assessed quickly, noninvasively, and inexpensively with high-resolution ultrasound.</p><p>Thus, we designed a prospective study in which patients with short-duration type 2 diabetes without AS were assigned to receive a combined intervention targeting multiple risk factors of AS, and their CC-IMTs were measured to explore whether intensified, multifactorial intervention could prevent the occurrence of macrovascular disease over a 7-year period.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>In brief, 150 patients with type 2 diabetes, diagnosed according to the World Health Organization criteria published in 1999, were recruited at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University. The enrollment took place from 1 April 2002 to 31 December 2002. The design of our parallel controlled study has previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>The protocol for this study was in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Dalian Medical University.

Trials of intensified interventions for single risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes, including the UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), Microalbuminuria Cardiovascular Renal Outcomes&#x02013;Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (MICRO-HOPE) study, and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), have demonstrated efficacy in reducing the development and progression of both micro- and macrovascular complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), although studies on intensive glucose control alone in patients with type 2 diabetes have reached conflicting conclusions regarding the incidence of major cardiovascular events or death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, only a delayed effect in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events was observed in UKPDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), suggesting that long-term observation might be necessary for the study of macroangiopathy in recent-onset type 2 diabetes and that cardiovascular events or death cannot be taken as indicators if the investigators want to draw conclusions about diabetes in the short term. In our study, we implemented a multifactorial intervention aimed at primary prevention for patients with type 2 diabetes without any manifestation of AS that used macrovascular end points, including subclinical AS lesions, as the evaluation index. We measured the preventive efficacy after 4&#x02013;7 years of intervention, expanding upon the results of UKPDS and the STENO-2 trial and strengthening their conclusions. Our approach achieved the primary prevention of diabetic macrovascular complications, implying that intensive, multifactorial intervention should be administered to type 2 diabetic patients as soon as possible to provide the most benefits.</p><p>Recent results from UKPDS suggested that the effects of blood pressure&#x02013; and glucose-lowering interventions might be additive; there was a trend toward a greater benefit with a combination of intensive blood pressure&#x02013; and glucose-lowering interventions. Because only a small subset of hypertensive subjects received both interventions, UKPDS had insufficient power to determine conclusively whether the effects of the treatments were additive in this group or in the broader population with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The new results of the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease (ADVANCE) trial demonstrated that a combined approach of routine blood pressure&#x02013;lowering interventions and intensive glucose control resulted in substantial reductions in major renal events and all-cause deaths, supporting and strengthening the results of the UKPDS trial and providing further evidence for thebenefits of a multifactorial treatment approach in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, ADVANCE emphasized the control of only two risk factors for diabetic macroangiopathy. As demonstrated by the STENO-2 study, a target-driven, long-term, intensified intervention aimed at multiple risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria can reduce the risk of cardiovascular and microvascular events by ~50%; furthermore, the benefits were maintained over the long term even after the randomized treatment period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, the STENO-2 subjects were different from ours in that the statuses of their arterial intima were uncertain at baseline.</p><p>Ultrasonography to measure CC-IMT is a noninvasive test that can be used to determine the presence of coronary AS. IMT is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events, and it is often used in research trials as a surrogate for the presence of cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The 150 patients with a diabetes duration of &#x0003c;1 year included in our study had initial IMTs of &#x0003c;1.0 mm in the three conducting arteries (common carotid artery, femoral artery, and iliac artery) and no atherosclerotic plaques detected by ultrasonography in addition to an absence of clinical manifestations or history of macrovascular diseases; these patients were considered not to have AS. They then underwent intensified or conventional treatment. The reduced incidence of subclinical outcomes in the intensive group indicates that these interventions reduced the incidence of macroangiopathy, which suggests that this intensified, multifactorial intervention can produce a marked effect on the primary prevention of macrovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes. No significant differences between the two groups were observed if only the secondary outcome was considered, irrespective of the primary outcome. Benefits emerged only after a relatively short period when IMTs and/or the occurrence of AS plaques were regarded as end points, implying that evidence of early-stage AS might be more important. These data also suggest that as a chronic progressive disease, subclinical AS might be considered an important index in the study of diabetic macroangiopathy.</p><p>In contrast to the uncertain follow-up frequency of those in the conventional group, the subjects in the intensive group were followed up every month. These monthly visits may themselves represent an intervention and may have partially contributed to the final outcomes.</p><p>In addition, incidence of macroangiopathy in our study decreased significantly when the HbA<sub>1c</sub> target of 7.0% was reached. However, during the 7-year follow-up, the mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the intensive group was actually ~6.5%; furthermore, no severe hypoglycemic events occurred, indicating that an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 6.5%, rather than 7%, might be desirable in patients with short-duration type 2 diabetes without macroangiopathy who are younger than 60 years old. The HbA<sub>1c</sub> target in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial was &#x0003c;6.0%, and the all-cause mortality and cardiovascular fatality rates in the intensive blood glucose therapy group were both significantly higher than those in the control group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Therefore, it might be reasonable to consider an HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 7.0% as the target for intensive blood glucose control in patients with relatively long durations of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Because this study was performed in a small group of type 2 diabetic patients, there was insufficient information for a stratified analysis of the correlation between each hypoglycemic regimen and macrovascular end points. Additionally, the period of observation was only 7 years, and total clinical macrovascular events occurred in only 14 cases. We expect to observe the correlation between subclinical AS and clinical atherosclerotic disease, followed by increased clinical macrovascular events, as time progresses.</p><p>In conclusion, the primary prevention of macrovascular disease could be achieved through intensified, multifactorial intervention in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with short-duration type 2 diabetes should receive an intensive multifactorial intervention approach with individual targets for the prevention of macrovascular diseases.</p></sec>
