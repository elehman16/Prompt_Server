Its pathophysiology and psychosocial impact are largely independent of its biological aetiology and therefore, comprehensive approaches to identifying, designing and targeting relevant interventions have been advocated, whereby chronic pain is dealt with as a whole clinical entity, regardless of its underlying cause.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Chronic pain is characterised by pain which persists despite adequate time for healing. Although there is no clear definition, it is often defined as pain that has been present for more than 3&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Approximately 20% of the European adult population have chronic pain<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and the economic burden is considerable with national healthcare and socioeconomic costs running into billions annually, representing between 3% and 10% of European gross domestic product (GDP)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and from $560 to $635 billion annually in the USA.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the UK, an estimated 11%<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> of adults suffer from severe chronic pain, representing around 4.5 million people. The average annual incidence risk estimated from health surveys of developing chronic pain is 8.3% and for those already with chronic pain (ie, prevalent cases), the average annual recovery rate is 5.4%.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The total cost of back pain alone has been estimated to be &#x000a3;12.3 billion annually in the UK or 1.5% of GDP.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The majority of patients with chronic pain are managed outside the specialist setting, mainly in primary care; however<bold>,</bold> patients will make a variety of choices for self-management of their pain.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pharmacological and non-pharmacological management options exist with provision of the former involving mostly primary care or purchase of over-the-counter medicines from the community pharmacy or supermarket; the latter options include cognitive behavioural therapy, physiotherapy or alternative therapies and are often provided privately. The recent Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guideline on chronic pain<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> reviewed the evidence for assessment and management of chronic non-malignant pain in the adult population in the non-specialist setting and reported on the current lack of good quality evidence to guide management. The guideline indicated a range of recommendations relating to pharmacological therapies including, for example, the provision of at least an annual assessment of patients on pharmacotherapy for chronic pain.</p><p>We recently reported findings from the &#x02018;Pharmacist-led management of chronic pain in primary care&#x02019; (PIPPC) pilot trial in which pharmacist medication review with face-to-face pharmacist prescribing was compared with pharmacist medication review with feedback to the general practitioner (GP) or usual GP-led care.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> This was the first pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare key clinical outcomes (rather than process end points) between pharmacist-led interventions for adults with chronic pain with the usual GP care. Although it was a pilot trial to inform the design for a subsequent definitive trial, the findings suggested that compared to usual care, participants&#x02019; pain levels, as measured by the chronic pain grade (CPG), improved in both pharmacist-led intervention groups, particularly in the group managed by pharmacist prescribing. The pilot trial also collected data on resource use and health-related quality of life. This provided an opportunity to assess the impact of pharmacist-led interventions on health economic outcomes and to offer some insight into the potential value for money of the study interventions. The objective of this paper, therefore, is to calculate the differences in mean costs and effects of the interventions, and the precision of those estimates so as to inform sample size and other design considerations for a future definitive trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview of the PIPPC trial</title><p>The PIPPC study<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> was a UK-based 6-month open exploratory pilot RCT primarily designed to investigate the effectiveness of either pharmacist medication review and face-to-face pharmacist prescribing, or pharmacist medication review and feedback to GP, relative to treatment as usual (usual GP-led care). The study was performed in six general practices with an attached independent pharmacist prescriber (3 in Grampian and 3 in East Anglia). Full details have been reported previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Briefly, a total of 196 patients were recruited into the trial between March and June 2010. Included patients were: over 18&#x02005;years of age; living in their own home; and receiving regular prescribed medication for pain (defined as receiving within the previous 120&#x02005;days either two or more acute prescriptions, and/or one repeat prescription for an analgesic and /or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)). Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either pharmacist medication review with pharmacist prescribing (n=70) or pharmacist review only (n=63) or TAU (n=63). Patients and their healthcare providers were unblinded due to the nature of the intervention. Trial outcomes assessed by self-report in postal questionnaires at baseline, and at 3 and 6&#x02005;months&#x02019; follow-up included: the short form mental (SF-12 MCS) and physical (SF-12 PCS) component summary scores, the generic preference-based health state utilities measure short form-six-dimension questionnaire (SF-6D), the CPG, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Preference weights (utilities) for the SF-6D health status measure were derived using the recommended tariffs derived from a UK general population survey.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Data on health service resource use were also collected at three time points: baseline (to measure service use 3&#x02005;months prerandomisation), 3&#x02005;months (to measure resource use 3&#x02005;months postrandomisation) and 6&#x02005;months (to measure resource use 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months postrandomisation), as described below.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Resource use and unit costs</title><p>The economic analysis included the direct costs associated with the intervention (pharmacist training, pharmacist and GP time involved in delivering the intervention along with related follow-up), pain-related hospitalisation (number of hospital inpatient days, day cases and outpatient visits), primary care visits for chronic pain (GP, nurse, healthcare assistant appointments), primary care telephone contacts for chronic pain, prescribed and non-prescribed OTC pain-related medications.</p><p>Frequency of the above primary and secondary care visits, and names and quantity of medicine prescribed were measured and valued using information from patients&#x02019; medical records and by patient self-reported questionnaire.

While resource use information was available for 178 patients, only 125 patients had complete SF-6D data for all three study assessment time-points. These 125 patients formed the sample for the main analysis. Using the data described above, estimates of the total mean costs and total mean QALYs per group were calculated. Regression analyses calculated the differences (and associated 95% CIs) in mean total costs and differences in mean total QALYs per patient, while controlling for differences in total costs at baseline, baseline SF-6D<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and other baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, marital status, work status, education, income, baseline CPG&#x02014;intensity).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sensitivity analyses</title><p>We performed a number of sensitivity analyses to explore areas of uncertainty in the main analysis. First, as noted above approximately one-third of patients were excluded due to missing some SF-6D data at follow-up (no missing cost data was apparent and so imputation was not necessary). To assess whether this introduced bias, we performed a sensitivity analysis with imputed values for missing SF-6D data and re-ran the regression analysis using data from all 178 patients. The missing SF-6D data were imputed by multiple imputation via chained equations with the STATA 13 &#x02018;mi impute&#x02019; command programme to account for patients with missing data at either 3 or 6&#x02005;months assuming that data were missing at random (and creating five imputed data sets).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Second, to investigate the impact on differential costs from patients who experienced very high costs from the analysis, we conducted an analysis excluding hospital inpatient costs, on the basis that some of these costs may not be directly related to chronic pain. Finally, we explored whether the main results were affected by controlling only for baseline differences between groups in total costs and SF-6D (ie, excluding sociodemographic and economic factors, and other health status measures, ie, the CPG).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>EVSI analysis</title><p>The expected value of sample information (EVSI)<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> was calculated to assess whether conducting a larger RCT of pharmacist prescribing versus TAU, or pharmacist review versus TAU would be worthwhile. This approach determines the optimal sample size that maximises the difference between the expected total cost (Total Cost) of a future trial and the monetary value of the information that it provides (EVSI). The EVSI is the anticipated value of the health gain (or the expected net benefit of sample information (&#x02018;Expected Net Gain&#x02019;, ENG)) over the period of t years, the chosen time horizon used for the analysis. This time horizon represents how long we expect the &#x02018;new intervention(s)&#x02019; to become established as the &#x02018;standard of care in the UK&#x02019; should it be shown to be cost effective. Total Cost is categorised into three main elements: a fixed component to represent the human (ie, labour/staff resource use) and other resources associated with the setting up and running of the trial; a variable component to reflect per patient accrual (ie, per additional patient recruited or increases in each participant taking part and who might potentially benefit from the intervention), follow-up and data collection costs; and an opportunity cost&#x02014;health loss to participants randomised to the control group (assuming the intervention is effective). To generate EVSI estimates, the difference in effectiveness, costs and associated variances and covariances observed within the PIPPC trial were used. In addition, assumptions were made regarding trial fixed costs, variable costs and the number of future patients with chronic pain expected to benefit from the proposed pharmacist prescribing and review intervention. For our analysis, we made the following assumptions: time horizon=30 years; annual incidence=540 000 (this value was calculated based on the average annual incidence of chronic pain is 8.3% in adults aged 25 years and older,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and the number of adult population is around 42 million (last UK census) that gives 3.5 million. This implies that approximately 1.2 million (1/3&#x000d7;3.5 million) people develop chronic pain that is ongoing/long-standing (ie lasting &#x0003e;3months). On the basis of the PIPPC trial,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> only a proportion of these people were receiving medication&#x02014;we calculate this to be 1492 people from a total of 3281 or 45%. So, the assumed incidence used 540 000); a fixed trial cost=&#x000a3;1.4 million; and a variable trial cost=&#x000a3;220. We generated EVSI estimates using a willingness to pay per QALY gained of &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 and &#x000a3;30&#x02005;000, respectively.</p><p>Additional sensitivity analyses checked whether the EVSI results were robust to variations in the main analysis assumptions, including the underlying incidence rate, the number of patients who would benefit and the recruitment cost per patient to a trial. Specifically, we halved and doubled the values used in the main analysis in each alternative case, with the exception of time horizon (10/20&#x02005;years).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Resource use and costs</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006874TB2">Table&#x000a0;2</xref> presents the number of patients using each type of resource (and percentages), and per patient mean quantities used, mean unadjusted cost per type of resource, unadjusted total mean costs and the adjusted cost differences by trial arm, from baseline to 6-month follow-up. As the table shows, there was some variation in the resources used and associated costs between patients in each study arm.

At both baseline and follow-up, medications accounted for the largest percentage of the total cost in all study arms (prescribing 37%, review 31%, TAU 55%), outpatient hospitalisations for TAU (19%), intervention-related costs for pharmacist prescribing (18%) and primary care costs, excluding pharmacist visit costs, for pharmacist review only (20%). Both pharmacist-led intervention arms were less costly than TAU based on the raw unadjusted mean total costs. The TAU group, however, was also the most costly treatment group observed prerandomisation and this was largely driven by medication costs; this suggests potential imbalances between study arms at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006874F1">figure 1</xref>). Following adjustment for differences in baseline costs and controlling for other baseline patient characteristics (age, sex, marital status, work status, education, income, baseline CPG&#x02014;intensity and baseline SF-6D) yielded positive incremental mean costs differences for both pharmacist-led interventions relative to TAU: prescribing &#x000a3;77.5 (95% CI &#x02212;&#x000a3;81.7 to &#x000a3;236.7) and review &#x000a3;54.4 (95% CI &#x02212;&#x000a3;103.3 to &#x000a3;212.1). In other words, the review and prescribing groups relative to TAU were now more expensive rather than cheaper, relative to usual care.

A small feasibility study<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> examining the impact of introduction of a combined nurse/pharmacist-led clinic for managing chronic pain in primary care was reported to lead to improvements in management of pain, as well as a reduction in use of secondary care resources and high rates of satisfaction. Stewart <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have argued for more research into the clinical, economic and humanistic effects of different forms of &#x02018;non-medical prescribing&#x02019; (NMP). NMP involves the prescribing of medicines by healthcare professionals (who are not doctors, eg, nurses, pharmacists) but who have undergone appropriate training (including pharmacovigilance) and are, therefore, qualified to prescribe either in a supplementary or independent role within their areas of competence.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Our study results provide new information about the costs and QALY effects of pharmacist medication review with or without prescribing for chronic pain.</p><p>One important aspect of the design of the cost effectiveness component of RCTs&#x02014;including those evaluating pharmacist interventions for pain&#x02014;relates to the selection of the most appropriate health utility measures. The SF-6D was used in the current trial. An alternative is the EQ-5D and this has become the instrument of choice for many agencies including the National Institute for Health and Care (formerly &#x02018;Clinical&#x02019;) Excellence (NICE).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The SF-6D cannot easily be compared with the EQ-5D because of differences in their descriptive systems, values applied to health states and contextual basis (ie, recall period). Moreover, a number of studies have reported that these two measures cannot be used interchangeably in patients with chronic pain.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;27</xref> In a study of 389 patients with chronic knee pain, Barton <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> reported that, in contrast to the EQ-5D, the SF-6D was unable to discriminate between patients who improved postintervention and those who did not; but in another study of patients with chronic low back pain and degenerative disc disease,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> the SF-6D had the best ability to detect changes and correctly identify patients as improved or non-improved. In a UK general population study,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> both measures were shown to discriminate between those self-reporting chronic pain or no chronic pain with and without neuropathic characteristics. However, both measures generated widely different health utility scores for the same patient groups, for example, the mean utilities for severe pain (EQ-5D 0.33 vs SF-6D 0.58). In another study,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> the EQ-5D was found to be more responsive to deterioration in health, whereas the SF-6D was more responsive to improvement in health in patients with knee pain due to inflammatory arthritis. The choice of instrument might have a considerable impact on the conclusions reached about the cost-effectiveness of the interventions being evaluated. For instance, a Norwegian cost-effectiveness study of total disc replacement versus multidisciplinary rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain found that total disc replacement was cost-effective when EQ-5D was used, but not when SF-6D was used.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Additionally, the practical issue of instrument completion is important in future trial design. In our analysis, we found around one-third of SF-6D measurements were incomplete. Similar results have been found in other studies in patients with pain, where rates of completion were significantly better for the EQ-5D over the course of an RCT in patients with non-specific neck pain<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and in patients with low back pain and degenerative disease.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Finally, it should be noted that a new 5-level version of the EQ-5D has recently been launched<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and its application in patients with various chronic conditions (eg, osteoarthritis) suggests it might have improved discriminative capacity and sensitivity to change than the EQ-5D 3-level version.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The use of both the EQ-5D and the SF-6D might be the best approach in future trials in patients with chronic pain.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study suggests that pharmacist-led medication review with or without prescribing in patients with chronic pain in primary care had similar effects in terms of QALYs compared with treatment as usual but was more expensive. These results, however, are highly uncertain due to the small sample size of the pilot trial and do not reflect the previously reported significantly improved chronic pain grade. The EVSI analysis indicated that this current evidence is insufficient for decision-making and that a future larger trial is worthwhile. Such a trial would require between 460 and 690 patients and between 540 and 780 patients per arm using a threshold of &#x000a3;30&#x02005;000 and &#x000a3;20&#x02005;000 per QALY gained, respectively, in order to obtain more precise estimates of differences in mean effects (QALYs) and mean costs between treatment groups.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the participating patients, practices and pharmacists.
