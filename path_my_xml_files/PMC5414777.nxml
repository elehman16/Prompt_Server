Actinic keratoses are usually found on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, bald scalp, forearms, and backs of hands. Individual AKs are identified as scaly, rough, skin color to red, pinpoint to larger patch lesions that may disappear and reappear over months or years. Actinic keratoses are considered to be precancerous lesions with the potential to progress to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Results of a previous study suggest that AKs may give rise to nonmelanoma skin cancers (NMSCs) at a greater rate than previously acknowledged.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Criscione and colleagues<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">l</xref></sup> found that the risk of progression of AK to primary SCC was 0.6% at 1 year and 2.57% at 4 years; in addition, approximately 65% of all primary SCCs diagnosed during the trial arose in lesions that had earlier been clinically diagnosed as AKs. The cellular damage and atypia seen at the histologic level of AKs are similar to those of surrounding nonlesional skin,<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> suggesting that skin surrounding AKs may also be at increased risk of skin cancer.</p><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) using a 20% topical solution of aminolevulinic acid HCl (ALA, Levulan Kerastick; DUSA Pharmaceuticals Inc, Wilmington, MA) and activation by 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light (Blue Light Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator, BLU-U; DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc, Wilmington, MA) exposure is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for the spot treatment of minimally to moderately thick AKs of the face or scalp after a 14- to 18-hour incubation period, in the United States and Canada.</p><p>When ALA is applied to dysplastic lesions, it is absorbed by cells and preferentially metabolized to Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) relative to normally dividing keratinocytes. When PpIX is activated by light of an appropriate wavelength and energy in the presence of oxygen, it results in a cytotoxic process. There is minimal damage to surrounding unaffected skin, and cutaneous photosensitivity is transient (usually clearing within 24&#x02013;48 hours) because of metabolic conversion of the remaining PpIX to heme.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Aminolevulinic acid&#x02013;PDT, when used on-label for 14- to 18-hour incubation, has been shown to be safe and highly effective in the treatment of minimally to moderately thick AKs of the face and scalp.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> However, anecdotal clinical findings from the dermatologic community and also from small investigator&#x02013;initiated studies indicate that physicians frequently administer ALA over a broad area (BA) rather than as a spot treatment and/or use shorter incubation times.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Fluorescence measurements of PpIX suggest that PpIX builds up gradually over the first hours, reaching peak fluorescence in the range of 6 to 18 hours after application (data on file). A previous study of the kinetics of PpIX accumulation in AK over the first 2 hours after ALA application has shown that PpIX concentration was statistically higher than baseline in 92% of lesions by 1 hour and 100% of lesions by 2 hours and that PpIX levels were also elevated in areas of normal-appearing nonlesional skin.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although the study was not designed to assess efficacy, 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup> blue light was applied to lesions 2 hours after ALA application, and 1 month after treatment, the vast majority of AKs resolved.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Data from other studies with short-incubation times also seemed efficacious for AK treatment.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Reducing incubation time might also, by decreasing the amount of PpIX produced in skin, decrease the discomfort of BA PDT while maintaining a high AK clearance rate (AKCR) and potentially treating subclinical lesions that may exist in the presence of clinically typical, visible, or palpable AKs.</p><p>This study is designed to evaluate the effect of incubation time and application method on the safety and efficacy of blue light ALA-PDT in the treatment of AKs on the face or scalp.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s1-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Eligible participants were male and nonpregnant females, 18 years or above, with 6 to 20 Grade 1 or 2 AKs (Grade 1: slightly palpable, better felt than seen; Grade 2: moderately thick, easily seen and felt) on the face or scalp, with a history of AK therapy within the treatment area at least twice in the 2 years before study entry. Key exclusion criteria included Grade 3 AKs (very thick and/or hyperkeratotic) within the treatment area, lesions suspicious or proven for skin cancer within the treatment area; a history of cutaneous photosensitization; any condition with associated immunosuppression; keratolytics including &#x0003e;5% urea, alpha hydroxyl acids (e.g., glycolic acid, &#x0003e;5% lactic acid), &#x0003e;2% salicylic acid within 2 days of initiation of treatment; cryotherapy within the previous 2 weeks; topical retinoids within the previous 4 weeks; microdermabrasion, ablative laser, ALA-PDT, chemical peels, 5-fluorouracil, diclofenac, imiquimod within the previous 8 weeks; 2 or more ALA-PDT treatments or systemic retinoids within the previous 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>Subjects were randomized to one of 5 treatment groups: BA application of ALA 1, 2, or 3 hours before blue light, spot application of ALA 2 hours before blue light, or vehicle (VEH) before blue light (placebo control), balanced for the 4 active groups (Levulan Kerastick or VEH Kerastick). For spot treatment, 2 applications of ALA or VEH were applied to individual AKs; for BA treatment, the first application was applied to individual AKs, followed by 2 BA applications. Blue light was administered to the treatment area (BLU-U Photodynamic Therapy Illuminator), for 16 minutes, 40 seconds for a total dose of 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Follow-up was performed at 24 to 48 hours and 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after initial treatment. A second treatment was given at Week 8 if treatment areas showed any AKs. Subjects were instructed to prevent exposure of the treated skin to direct sunlight or bright indoor light for 36 hours after each treatment and to apply physical sunblock containing TiO<sub>2</sub> and/or ZnO sun protection factor 15+.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki and in compliance with Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. The protocol was approved by an institutional review board for each study center. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects.

Tolerability assessments, including erythema, edema, scaling and dryness, oozing/vesiculation/crusting, and changes in pigmentation, were assessed at each visit using a 5-point scale (0 = none&#x02013;4 = severe); stinging/burning was assessed using a 4-point scale (0 = none&#x02013;3 = severe). The evaluating investigator for efficacy was blinded to the treatment assignment. To maintain blinding, personnel who were not involved in efficacy assessments administered the blue light PDT and assessed for tolerability to treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s1-4"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All data tabulations were performed using the SAS System for Windows version 9.3. The primary subject set for analysis of the efficacy data is the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. A last-observation-carried-forward analysis was used to address the effect of dropouts or missing data for the efficacy variables. Subjects receiving VEH were considered a single treatment group. The treatment groups were compared with respect to the AKCR by analysis of variance where the model included treatment effect. The Tukey&#x02013;Kramer method was used for pairwise comparisons of treatment groups. Treatment groups were also compared with respect to complete and partial clearance rates using a Pearson &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test; Fisher exact test was used at Week 8 because of sparse tables. The Cochran&#x02013;Armitage trend test was used to examine whether complete clearance rate increases as incubation time increases for the BA applications. No adjustment was made for multiple endpoints.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics</title><p>Two hundred thirty-five subjects were enrolled in the study at 13 sites; 234 subjects (211 male and 23 female, mean age 68 years [range, 40&#x02013;88 years], and Fitzpatrick skin Type I [6%], II [44%], III [43%], IV [6%], and V [0.4%]) are included in the efficacy analysis (ITT population).

Although a single short-incubation ALA-PDT treatment in this study produced lesion clearance from 36% to 57%, a second treatment performed at Week 8 increased the AKCR to 68% to 79% (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The short-incubation AKCRs seen after two treatments also compare favorably with AKCR described after 2 treatments (83.4%) using the FDA-approved 14- to 18-hour incubation time.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Furthermore, AKCRs appear similar after 2 short-incubation treatments using spot application for 2 hours or BA application for 1 or 2 hours (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>The complete (100%) subject clearance rates at Week 12 were similar for the 1-hour and 3-hour BA ALA-PDT groups (29.8% and 27.7%, respectively). Both of the 2 hour groups (spot area and BA) had similar 100% clearance rates at Week 12 (17.4% and 14.6%, respectively), which were notably lower than the 1-hour and 3-hour BA rates, for unknown reasons (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). Partial AKCRs (subjects with &#x02265;75% lesions removed) ranged from 44% to 53% and appeared to trend slightly upward with increasing incubation time.</p><p>Although subjects in this study showed a high degree of tolerability for the treatment and satisfaction with its outcome, it is clear that increasing incubation time for more than 1 hour, although not increasing efficacy, may increase the incidence and severity of some of the well-known side effects of ALA-PDT (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). Notably, the incidence of post-PDT edema and crusting nearly doubled in the 2- and 3-hour BA incubation groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Erythema, although universally observed after PDT and of a similar incidence in all groups, was noted to be of generally greater severity in subjects receiving BA application and incubated for longer than 1 hour. Stinging and burning of a moderate/severe intensity was reported in 21% of subjects after PDT in the BA1 group and increased to 54% and 57% in the BA2 and BA3 groups, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies of ALA-PDT for AK treatment in which subjects were followed for periods &#x0003e;6 months, NMSCs arose during follow-up, as may be expected in a subject population with heavily sun-damaged skin.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The incidence of NMSCs seen over the course of this study was also determined for each group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The incidence of NMSCs within the areas where BA treatment was given ranged from 0/48 (0%) for the BA1 group to 1/48 and 1/47 (2.1% each) for the BA2 and BA3 groups, respectively. This contrasts with the 2/47 (4.4%) incidence in the spot treatment group (SP2) and the highest incidence, 3/46 (6.7%), in the control (VEH) treatment group. The trending toward an indication of some degree of NMSC prevention in areas given BA treatment versus spot or control (sham PDT) treatment is of interest. Studies of long-term ALA-PDT effects in populations at high risk of NMSCs, specifically long-term immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> and subjects with a previous history of NMSCs in the treatment area,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> have clearly shown that BA application ALA-PDT can significantly reduce the occurrence of NMSCs in these subjects. Future studies will seek to corroborate these results in populations at high risk of NMSC occurrence.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>TABLE 5</label><caption><p>Incidence of NMSC Lesions Developing Over Application Site During Follow-Up</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ds-42-296-g006"/></table-wrap></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The PDT-AK Investigational Group consists of Diane O.
