ME/CFS according to Canadian diagnostic criteria [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] comprises approximately 0.1&#x02013;0.2% of the population [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and must be distinguished from general fatigue probably affecting ten times as many. A genetic predisposition for ME/CFS has been demonstrated [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>ME/CFS has profound impact on quality of life for patients and caretakers [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The symptom burden is heavy [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the disease carries high socioeconomic costs. Patients with severe ME/CFS suffer major functional impairments and often a range of debilitating symptoms. No standard drug treatment has been established, mostly due to lack of knowledge of the underlying disease mechanisms.</p><p>We have performed a pilot case series of three patients suggesting clinical activity for B-cell depletion using the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The case series was followed by a small, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled phase II study of 30 patients given either rituximab (two infusions two weeks apart), or placebo, with follow-up for 12 months [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The primary endpoint was negative, i.e. there was no difference between the rituximab and placebo groups at 3 months follow-up. There was, however, a significant difference in favor of the rituximab group in the course of <italic>Fatigue score</italic> during follow-up, most evident between 6&#x02013;10 months follow-up, and with clinical responses in 2/3 of the patients receiving rituximab. The symptom improvements were delayed, starting 2&#x02013;8 months after initial and rapid B-cell depletion [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], suggesting that ME/CFS in a subgroup of patients could be a variant of an autoimmune disease involving B-lymphocytes and elimination of long-lived antibodies.</p><p>According to protocol for the previous randomized KTS-1-2008 study, patients assigned to the placebo group should be given the opportunity to participate in a new open-label study with rituximab. The protocol for the present study was designed to learn about the therapeutic efficacy of rituximab maintenance treatment, for response rates and response durations. Also, the experiences could form the basis for design of a future randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. Therefore, we have now performed this open-label phase II study (KTS-2-2010) using rituximab induction (two infusions two weeks apart) followed by rituximab maintenance infusions after 3, 6, 10 and 15 months, and with follow-up for three years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study, including one amendment, was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee in Norway, no 2010/1318-4, and by the National Medicines Agency.

The main aim was to evaluate the effect of rituximab induction and maintenance treatment on response rates and response durations, and any adverse effects of the treatment, within 36 months follow-up, and to gain experience for the purpose of designing a new multicentre, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial. The Protocol for this study, including one amendment, is available as supporting information (<xref rid="pone.0129898.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>).</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: a diagnosis of ME/CFS according to the Fukuda 1994 criteria [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and age 18&#x02013;66 years. Exclusion criteria were: fatigue not meeting the diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS, pregnancy or lactation, previous malignant disease (except basal cell carcinoma in skin or cervical dysplasia), previous severe immune system disease (except autoimmune diseases such as e.g. thyroiditis or diabetes type I), previous long-term systemic immunosuppressive treatment (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, except steroid courses for e.g. obstructive lung disease), endogenous depression, lack of ability to adhere to protocol, known multi-allergy with clinical risk from rituximab infusions, reduced kidney function (serum creatinine &#x0003e; 1.5x upper normal value), reduced liver function (serum bilirubin or liver transaminases &#x0003e; 1.5x upper normal), known HIV infection, or evidence of ongoing active and relevant infection.</p><p>The pre-treatment evaluation included standard laboratory tests (hematology, liver function, renal function), HCG to exclude pregnancy in fertile women, endocrine assessment (thyroid, adrenal, prolactin), serology for virus (EBV, CMV, HSV, VZV, Enterovirus, Parvovirus B19, adenovirus), immunophenotyping of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets, common autoantibodies, and serum immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM, IgA) with IgG subclasses. MRI of the brain was previously performed in all patients. Further diagnostic tests were performed if the pre-treatment evaluation including clinical examination revealed any relevant abnormality that could explain the severe fatigue experienced by the patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Self-reported ME/CFS symptom scoring</title><p>Before intervention, the patients assessed their ME/CFS disease status the last three months and recorded their symptoms according to a scale (1&#x02013;10; 1: no symptom; 5: moderate symptom; 10: very severe symptom) (<xref rid="pone.0129898.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p><p>During follow-up, every second week the patients recorded the overall change in each symptom during the preceding two weeks, always compared to baseline (<xref rid="pone.0129898.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The scale (0&#x02013;6) for the follow-up form was: 0: Major worsening; 1: Moderate worsening; 2: Slight worsening; 3: No change from baseline; 4: Slight improvement; 5: Moderate improvement; 6: Major improvement. These forms for self-reported symptoms were similar to those used in the previous randomized phase II study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>The self-reported symptom changes recorded every second week and always compared to baseline are relative, i.e. an improvement interpreted as moderate or major will be different in a patient with severe ME/CFS who is mostly bedridden, and a patient with mild ME/CFS who is able to perform some level of activity. Therefore, the patients also registered their &#x0201c;Function level&#x0201d; on a scale 0&#x02013;100%, according to a form with examples in which 100% denoted a completely healthy state as before acquiring ME/CFS (<xref rid="pone.0129898.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). According to this form, patients with very severe ME/CFS will report a Function level &#x0003c; 5%, patients with severe ME/CFS will report Function level 5&#x02013;10% (mostly bedridden), patients with moderate ME/CFS 10&#x02013;15% (mainly housebound), and patients with milder degree of ME/CFS a Function level in the range of 20&#x02013;50%. The patients estimated self-reported Function level at baseline, at 15, 24 and 36 months. This recording of Function level was not predefined in the protocol.</p><p>At baseline, and at 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 24, 30 and 36 months, the patients recorded the SF-36 Norwegian version 1.2 short form scheme, which is a general health-related quality of life questionnaire assessing Physical health summary score, Mental health summary score, and eight subdimensions (Physical function, Role-physical, Bodily pain, Vitality, General health, Social function, Role-emotional, and Mental health) [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both norm-based scores based on population mean values of approximately 50, according to population norm US 1998, and raw scores (scale 0&#x02013;100) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was effect on self-reported ME/CFS symptoms during follow-up. A clinical response period was defined as <italic>Fatigue score</italic> &#x02265; 4.5 for at least six consecutive weeks (i.e. for at least three consecutive two-week recordings), which must also include at least one recording of <italic>Fatigue score</italic> &#x0003e; 5.0 during the response period, but not predefined to any specific time interval during three years follow-up. Single response periods, and the sum of such periods were recorded as response durations during follow-up.</p><p>Secondary endpoints were effects on the ME/CFS symptoms, at 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 24, 30 and 36 months assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire, the longest consecutive response period (continuous mean <italic>Fatigue score</italic> &#x02265; 4.5), the fraction of included patients still in response at end of study (36 months), and toxicity during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Treatment schedule and follow-up</title><p>The patients were given rituximab infusions in the outpatient clinic at Department of Oncology, Haukeland University Hospital. The induction treatment, rituximab 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum 1000 mg), diluted in saline to a concentration of 2 mg/ml, was administered twice with two weeks interval, with nurse surveillance and according to local guidelines. The patients then received rituximab maintenance infusions, 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (maximum 1000 mg) at 3, 6, 10 and 15 months follow-up. All patients were given oral cetirizine 10 mg, paracetamol 1 g, and dexamethasone 8 mg prior to infusion. The two pilot patients received only one rituximab induction infusion, with the sixth (last) infusion at 18 and 19 months (instead of 15 months) respectively.</p><p>According to protocol, the planned 10 and 15 months infusions could be omitted if there were no signs of clinical response at the 10-months visit.</p><p>The present open-label phase II study also had exploratory elements, aiming to gain knowledge on dose-response relationships for proper design of a later randomized phase III study. Therefore, by December 2011 an amendment was submitted to and approved by The Regional Ethical Committee; for patients with slow and gradual improvement after 12 months follow-up including five rituximab infusions, up to six additional rituximab infusions could be given with at least two months intervals. No other intervention should be given during follow-up. After infusions, the patients attended the outpatient clinic at 20, 24, 30 and 36 months, for assessment of the clinical course of their disease, including delivery of self-reported symptom forms. Most of the patients including those still in ongoing remission at the end of follow-up, have been assessed at regular intervals even after the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Response definitions and statistical analyses</title><p>Similar to the previous randomized phase II study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the self-reported symptom changes recorded every second week and always compared to baseline (<xref rid="pone.0129898.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> scale 0&#x02013;6), were used to calculate symptom scores during follow-up. The <italic>Fatigue score</italic> was calculated every second week as the mean of the four symptoms: Fatigue, Post-exertional malaise, Need for rest, Daily functioning. The <italic>Pain score</italic> was calculated as the mean of the two dominating pain symptoms (if pre-treatment level &#x02265; 4, among Muscle pain, Joint pain, Headache, Cutaneous pain). The <italic>Cognitive score</italic> was the mean of the three symptoms: Concentration ability, Memory disturbance, Mental tiredness. The <italic>Fatigue score</italic>, <italic>Pain score</italic>, and <italic>Cognitive score</italic> were plotted every second week, for each patient in separate diagrams.</p><p>The main response was defined from the <italic>Fatigue score</italic>. For overall response rate (ORR) a clinical response was defined as a <italic>Fatigue score</italic> &#x02265; 4.5 for at least six consecutive weeks, which must include at least one recording of <italic>Fatigue score</italic> &#x0003e; 5.0 during the response period. For each patient, the mean of <italic>Fatigue score</italic>s for the time intervals 0&#x02013;6, 6&#x02013;12, 12&#x02013;18, 18&#x02013;24, 24&#x02013;30 and 30&#x02013;36 months were calculated. For the 28 patients receiving rituximab induction and maintenance treatment, the <italic>Fatigue scores</italic> for the time intervals (mean with 95% confidence intervals) were then plotted.</p><p>For the nine patients in this study who had been randomized to the placebo group in the previous phase II study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], mean <italic>Fatigue scores</italic> for the time intervals 0&#x02013;3, 3&#x02013;6, 6&#x02013;9 and 9&#x02013;12 months in the present study with rituximab maintenance treatment were plotted together with mean <italic>Fatigue scores</italic> for the same time intervals from their 12 months follow-up in the placebo group in the previous study (in other words, these nine patients were their own &#x0201c;historic controls&#x0201d;). General linear model (GLM) for repeated measures was used to compare the differences in distribution of <italic>Fatigue scores</italic> for the consecutive 3-months time intervals during 12 months follow-up, between the same nine patients when participating in the present rituximab maintenance (KTS-2-2010) study and when participating in the placebo group in KTS-1-2008 study. Mean <italic>Fatigue scores</italic> for four time intervals were included in the analyses, and Greenhouse-Geisser adjustments were made due to significant Mauchly&#x02019;s tests for sphericity. The main effect for the interaction between time and group (i.e. rituximab maintenance versus &#x0201c;historical&#x0201d; placebo) was assessed.</p><p>SF-36 data from baseline, and from 3, 6, 10, 15, 20, 24, 30, and 36 months follow-up were analyzed using a SPSS syntax file, with both raw scores (scale 0&#x02013;100) and norm-based scores in which the population mean score is approximately 50 (according to US 1998). For analysis of correlation between &#x0201c;SF-36mean5&#x0201d; and self-reported Function level, SF-36 raw scores were used. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Macintosh, ver. 22, and Graphpad Prism ver. 6. Punching of data was performed by &#x000d8;F and by the staff at the office for cancer research at the Dept. of Oncology. Analyses were performed by &#x000d8;F and OM.

One pilot patient did not fill in SF-36 forms. Including baseline until 24 months follow-up, 15 out of 189 forms were missing (7.9%). Out of 17 patients with clinically significant responses, one withdrew from study after 24 months due to a diagnosis of T2N0 breast cancer, and two patients withdrew from follow-up after 25 and 32 months, respectively. Out of 10 patients with no clinically significant response, one patient withdrew from study after 12 months, and four patients after 24&#x02013;26 months follow-up.

However, increases in SF-36 scores were thereafter seen for the subdimensions Physical function, Bodily pain, Vitality, Social function and General health, which all reached maximum scores at approximately 20&#x02013;30 months follow-up. For the group of major responders, which comprised half of all included patients, the SF-36 norm-based values were at the population mean during this time interval, supporting the patients&#x02019; subjective interpretation of substantial improvement in ME/CFS symptoms. The absolute increases in raw scores of SF-36 subdimensions also clearly demonstrate the differences in symptom improvements during follow-up, between the 2/3 of patients with clinically significant responses, versus the 1/3 with no benefit from the intervention. While there were no differences in SF-36 raw scores through follow-up in the non-responders, the group with major responses showed substantial absolute increases in SF-36 raw scores, with absolute differences between 20 months and baseline of 43 (Physical function), 50 (Bodily pain), 53 (Vitality) and 60 (Social function).</p><p>Also, the self-reported &#x0201c;Function level&#x0201d; registered by the patients at baseline and at 15, 24 and 36 months, indicated that self-reported clinical responses correlated with an increase in functioning with impact on daily life. The calculated &#x0201c;mean of five SF-36 subdimensions&#x0201d; (raw scores) for Physical function, Bodily pain, Vitality, Social function and General health (denoted &#x0201c;SF-36mean5&#x0201d;) showed the best correlation with self-reported &#x0201c;Function levels&#x0201d; in pooled data from baseline and from 15, 24 and 36 months follow-up. Because the Physical Health Summary score and Mental Health Summary score are influenced also by the SF-36 subdimensions Role-physical and Role-emotional, which have previously been reported as inaccurate in patients with severe functional impairment syndromes [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], it is not surprising that an expression taking into account these five subdimensions better described the patients&#x02019; own experience of daily level of functioning.</p><p>The response rate in this study may be influenced by inclusion of patients who participated in the previous randomized and placebo-controlled study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, among nine patients in the placebo group in the previous KTS-1-2008 study, all of which had shown no signs of clinical response during 12 months follow-up when given placebo, six of these achieved a clinically significant response during the first 12 months when given rituximab maintenance treatment in the present study. In addition, one patient reached a clinically significant response at later than 12 months follow-up. These data support an influence of B-cell depletion on the mechanism for ME/CFS symptom maintenance.</p><p>Ten patients previously given rituximab, including three with no clinically significant responses in KTS-1-2008, participated in the present study to investigate whether prolonged B-cell depletion could benefit these. Out of three non-responders in KTS-1-2008, one reached a clear clinical response after rituximab maintenance in the present study.</p><p>Among seven patients given prolonged B-cell depletion due to slow and gradual improvement of symptoms after 12 months (according to an approved amendment) most remained as moderate responders throughout the study, suggesting that prolonged rituximab maintenance phase may not give major additional benefit to this group.</p><p>Within the three years follow-up period, the mean duration of responses was 97 weeks in the group of major and moderate responders. In addition, out of 18 patients with clinically significant responses, 11 were still in sustained stable responses at the end of follow-up. Three had experienced partial relapse and four almost full relapse of ME/CFS symptoms. Thus, maintenance rituximab treatment with a prolonged period of B-cell depletion seems to be associated with significantly prolonged response durations compared to two infusions rituximab two weeks apart. In the previous study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the mean response duration was 25 weeks within 12 months follow-up, and with response duration beyond the 12 months study period in only four out of ten responders.</p><p>In the present study, B-lymphocyte counts in peripheral blood were recovered in all patients after end of follow-up, and possible mechanisms for sustained clinical responses are not obvious. Pilot immunophenotyping analyses of B-cell subsets (na&#x000ef;ve versus memory versus transitional versus plasmablasts) after B-cell regeneration (i.e. at 36-40-44 months follow-up) are in progress, aiming to investigate possible differences between sustained responders, patients with partial or complete relapse, and non-responders.</p><p>The relationships between rituximab treatment, B-cell depletion, B-cell subsets and clinical responses have been studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. An increased fraction of memory cells was detected in those with early relapses [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In B-cell depletion na&#x000ef;ve RA-patients, low levels of CD27+ memory B-cells may predict later response to rituximab treatment [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Rituximab targets short-lived autoreactive plasma cells more consistently than the more long-lived protective plasma cells [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In systemic lupus (SLE), B-cell clones producing autoantibodies had a more rapid turnover than B-cells producing protective antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], making autoreactive B-cells more vulnerable to rituximab treatment.</p><p>For major responders, a mean time lag of 23 weeks (median 19 weeks, range 8&#x02013;66) between initial and rapid B-cell depletion in peripheral blood and start of clinical responses is an argument in favor of a possible autoimmune pathogenesis in a subgroup of ME/CFS patients. The patterns of responses and relapses seen in this study are in accordance with response patterns reported for some established autoimmune diseases, such as Wegener&#x02019;s granulomatosis [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The lag time before clinical improvement may be compatible with a mechanism involving reduction of long-lived autoantibodies, or some other slow alteration in immune function governed by B-cells.</p><p>An observation that may support a variant of an autoimmune mechanism underlying the entity is a moderate but highly significant increase in risk of B-cell lymphomas in elderly CFS patients, indicating a chronically activated B-cell system [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In this population-based case-control study among almost 1.2 million cancer cases aged more than 65 years, and 100.000 elderly controls without cancer, with a prevalence of CFS 0.5% in both groups, a modest but highly significant association between CFS and non-Hodgkin lymphoma was reported. There were no significant associations to other cancer types when adjusting for multiple comparisons. Of lymphoma subtypes, a significant association to the most common aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) was reported. Interestingly, there was a highly significant association between CFS and marginal-zone lymphomas [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This low-grade B-cell lymphoma type often arise in extra-nodal tissues, in which chronic stimulation by an antigen is thought to play an essential role in lymphomagenesis either from chronic infections or from autoimmunity [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Among patients included in the present study, 41% had one or more first-degree relatives with an autoimmune disease (AD). The prevalence of known AD in the general population was estimated to 3.2% in a study from US [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and to at least 5% in a study from Denmark [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Taking into account that each individual may have on average 4&#x02013;6 first-degree relatives, and also that several AD to some extent tend to cluster in families, the reported 41% in this study is probably higher than expected and therefore may indicate a genetic predisposition for AD.</p><p>Interestingly, recent studies have indicated a possible autoimmune basis for Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) with autoantibodies to autonomic receptors [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Studies have also suggested that in subsets of Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) patients, associations to partly agonistic autoantibodies to &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptors and to muscarinic-2 receptors were reported [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. CRPS has been shown to improve after intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and has been proposed as a prototype of a novel kind of autoimmunity with a possible two-hit process involving pre-existing autoantibodies that may become pathogenic after a triggering event such as trauma or infection [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is worth noting that POTS is detected in approximately 15% of ME/CFS patients [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and both POTS and CRPS are seen primarily in young women and have features that partly overlap with ME/CFS such as fatigue, brain fog, and central sensitization.</p><p>Several studies have provided data suggesting autoimmunity as a possible mechanism in a subgroup of ME/CFS. Altered B-cell subtypes compared to healthy controls have been detected [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], also reduced NK-cell activity and elevated T-regulatory cells [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Infection-induced autoimmunity was suggested as a possible disease mechanism in a recent study reporting IgM to human and microbial heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) in a high frequency of ME/CFS patients as compared to healthy [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Increased IgM-mediated autoimmune responses to oxidative specific epitopes were recently proposed to be involved in the pathophysiology of ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A recent study investigated cytokine patterns in peripheral blood from ME/CFS patients [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], showing distinct abnormalities of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines early in the course of ME/CFS, which were not present after the first three years. The same research group also showed a disturbed cytokine pattern in cerebrospinal fluid of ME/CFS patients, compared to healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients. The findings were consistent with an immune activation and a shift towards a Th-2 pattern, which may be associated with autoimmunity [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>However, other underlying mechanisms than autoimmunity may explain the observed clinical effects of B-cell depletion on ME/CFS symptom maintenance. Rituximab influences other aspects of immune function than the pronounced effect on CD20 positive B-cells. These include rituximab-induced T-cell inactivation, T-cell polarization to a suppressive phenotype, elimination of B-lymphocytes as antigen-presenting cells, and depletion of a CD20dim T-cell subset [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. B-cell depletion impairs adaptive and autoreactive CD4-positive cells in mice, as one mechanism for observed clinical benefit of rituximab in presumed T-cell mediated autoimmune diseases [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Whatever the mechanism behind the rituximab effect, the patient described in our study with a response but allergic reaction to rituximab, and later treated with the humanized anti-CD20 antibody ofatumumab again achieving a clinical response, indicate B-cell depletion as the factor responsible for response and not some other, unknown effect of the antibody.</p><p>There were no severe or unexpected side effects from rituximab maintenance treatment in this study. Two episodes of uncomplicated late-onset neutropenia (LON) were observed, both lasting for five days before recovery of neutrophil counts. The incidence of LON varies with the clinical setting, but seems to be comparable in rheumatologic and hematologic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. LON occurred in 9% of B-cell lymphoma patients treated with rituximab at a median 121 days (range 49&#x02013;474 days) from end of rituximab treatment [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>We observed few infections, and no cases of septicemia or life-threatening infections. Two patients had several upper airways infections demanding antibiotics, both seemed to benefit from two infusions of intravenous normal human immunoglobulins. In the present study, serum immunoglobulins were measured at all visits. Generally, there were slight but significant decreases in levels of IgG, IgA or IgM during follow-up (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>Two patients experienced an allergic reaction to rituximab-infusions. In the majority of patients no infusion-related symptoms or subsequent ME/CFS worsening could be noted. In eight patients, symptom flares were observed after one or more rituximab infusions. This is infrequent in lymphoma patients receiving rituximab. Such transient worsening also occurred when a patient was B-cell depleted and had a sustained major response, and usually lasted for days to a few weeks. However, we have observed one patient included in another study (KTS-3-2010, for patients with severe or very severe ME/CFS) who experienced such transient symptom worsening lasting for almost three months. Based on pilot observations, a slow infusion rate of rituximab seems to reduce this problem, and in the presently ongoing randomized phase III study (&#x0201c;RituxME&#x0201d;) all intravenous infusions are given over approximately four to five hours infusion time. The symptom worsening seems similar to that described after infusion of normal human immunoglobulins as a therapeutic option in adolescent ME/CFS [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and may indicate an unspecific immunoglobulin effect in these patients.</p><p>Rituximab maintenance treatment is generally considered safe. However, even if severe adverse effects are rare, they may occur and include defects in immune reconstitution, and reactivation of chronic viral infections such as hepatitis [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. B-cell depletion using rituximab is effective and safe in Sj&#x000f8;gren&#x02019;s syndrome [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and also in RA patients although repeated infusions over time was associated with hypogammaglobulinemia [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In a review article, rituximab treatment for two years was considered safe in multiple sclerosis (MS) with no severe toxicity. Substantial benefit was reported on relapsing-remitting MS, but with marginal effect on primary progressive MS [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In a study of patients treated with rituximab for rheumatoid arthritis in several centers in the US, Europe and Australia, describing development of the often lethal progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML) caused by JC-virus reactivation in the brain, four cases were detected among an estimated population at risk of 129.000, suggesting an increased risk of about one case per 25.000 individuals [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, the majority of these patients had also received additional immunosuppressive drugs.</p><p>A major limitation of the present study is the open-label design and lack of a placebo group for comparison. The inclusion of patients from both the placebo and rituximab-groups from the previous KTS-1-2008 randomized phase-II study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] (in total 18 out of 29 patients) may preclude the estimate of the response rate to rituximab maintenance treatment. The previously published KTS-1-2008 study [<xref rid="pone.0129898.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] had several limitations, being the first to investigate the treatment principle of B-cell depletion in ME/CFS, with inadequate predefinition of all endpoints and also a negative primary endpoint (i.e. no difference between groups at 3-months follow-up). Also, any selection bias in our two studies is unknown. The (probably) high frequency of autoimmune diseases among first- and second-degree relatives of ME/CFS patients in our studies could be a sign of unintended selection bias. Alternatively, it might prove to be a characteristic also in a broader population of ME/CFS patients, as detailed family histories are not always taken in studies.</p><p>Therefore, to verify or refute the results from the previous randomized phase II and the present open-label phase II study, a new randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled phase III study in five centers in Norway, including four university hospitals, has been launched (&#x0201c;RituxME&#x0201d;, NCT02229942). In this study, 152 patients will be randomized 1:1 between rituximab or placebo, two infusions two weeks apart, with maintenance infusions after 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, and with follow-up for 24 months. In addition to self-reported symptom scores recorded every second week and SF-36 questionnaires with 3-month intervals, physical activity will be measured using an armband-computer for seven consecutive days, at baseline and repeated in the interval 17&#x02013;21 months. Three substudies are conducted aiming to evaluate vascular endothelial function, gastrointestinal function, and performance in cardiopulmonary exercise tests for two consecutive days (only in mild-moderate, not in severe ME/CFS), all assessments performed at baseline and repeated in the interval 17&#x02013;21 months after start of intervention (i.e. during double-blind design).</p><p>We are also conducting an open-label phase II study (KTS-3-2010) aiming to include only patients with either very severe or severe ME/CFS, using the same treatment regimen with rituximab induction and maintenance as described in the study presented here (KTS-2-2010). Patients with very severe ME/CFS have special needs, and both transporting and accommodating them in a busy oncology ward have proved very difficult. Eight patients have been included, and only four with very severe ME/CFS have been given rituximab maintenance treatment in KTS-3-2010. Although the treatment had a slight beneficial effect on two out of four patients with very severe ME/CFS, none of the four will be characterized as responders. B-cell depletion using rituximab for ME/CFS is at present an experimental treatment, and more evidence is needed. We do not encourage the use of rituximab for ME/CFS outside of approved clinical trials, and this is especially important for the group with very severe disease.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the findings presented herein strengthen our previous observations, demonstrating that use of the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab may give clinical benefit in a subgroup of patients with ME/CFS. The results indicate that prolonged B-cell depletion with maintenance rituximab infusions is associated with longer response durations than induction treatment alone, with no major or unexpected toxicity. However, one-third of the study patients still show no significant clinical response to rituximab treatment. The observed patterns of response and relapse with a time lag before clinical improvement, along with a female preponderance, a higher than expected occurrence of autoimmune diseases in near family (in our studies), and published data showing a moderate, but highly significant increased risk of B-cell lymphomas in elderly ME/CFS patients, suggest to us that ME/CFS in a subgroup of patients may be a variant of an autoimmune disease. It may involve antibodies, is often triggered by infections, and probably involves a genetic predisposition. An important scientific issue will be to elucidate the target for the putative pathologic immune response, i.e. to understand the effector system for symptom maintenance and how the immune process disturbs this system, and thus explains the various aspects of clinical presentation in this devastating disease. An understanding of the disease mechanisms may also pave the way for further rational treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129898.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol for the KTS-2-2010 study (April 2010), including one amendment (December 2011).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129898.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129898.s002"><label>S1 TREND Checklist</label><caption><title>Trend checklist for the KTS-2-2010 study.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129898.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129898.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Form for patient&#x02019;s self-reported ME/CFS symptoms at baseline.</title><p>Before intervention, the patients assessed their ME/CFS disease and recorded their symptoms during the preceding three months period, using the scale 1&#x02013;10 (1: no symptom; 5: moderate symptom; 10: very severe symptom).</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0129898.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0129898.s004"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Form for patient&#x02019;s self-reported ME/CFS symptom changes every second week during follow-up.</title><p>During 36 months follow-up, the patients recorded symptom changes every two weeks, always as compared to baseline.
