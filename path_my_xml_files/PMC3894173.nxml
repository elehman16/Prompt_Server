Currently the safest drug in use is AmBisome&#x000ae;, which cures 90% of patients in India at 5 mg/kg, and is even more effective at higher doses (10 mg/kg) or in combination with miltefosine or paromomycin. These regimens have been shown to be equally cost-effective in India. However, the drug requires a cold chain for storage and reconstitution prior to injection. Although it is licensed for use in eastern Africa, in practice it is mainly used as a second-line treatment. A small study carried out in Kenya indicated that a higher dose is necessary in eastern Africa in contrast to Asia. This study aimed to determine the minimum single dose that is safe and effective for treatment of eastern African VL patients so as to be used in simplified treatment regimens. However, the tested regimens were found to be ineffective, and an optimal single dose that could potentially be used in simplified treatment regimens was not identified.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>DNDi, the sponsor of the study, was involved in the final stages of study protocol development and data analysis; and also supported the preparation of the draft manuscript by a medical writer.

Exclusion criteria were signs/symptoms of severe VL (patients who were very weak, unable to walk, bleeding, jaundiced, suffering from sepsis and other concomitant infections/illnesses); anti-leishmanial or unlicensed investigational treatments within six months; underlying chronic disease such as severe cardiac, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic impairment; serum creatinine outside the normal range; liver function tests more than 3 times the normal range; platelet count less than 40,000/mm3; known alcohol abuse; pregnancy or lactation; concomitant acute drug usage for malaria and bacterial infection; pneumonia within last 7 days; known hypersensitivity to AmBisome&#x000ae; or amphotericin B; any other condition which may invalidate the trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>On pre-specified treatment days, AmBisome&#x000ae; dosage was calculated according to body weight. Preparation included reconstitution with sterile water for injection and filtration according to the manufacturer's instructions. Administration was by slow intravenous infusion in 5% dextrose solution. During infusion, patients were closely observed with regular monitoring of vital signs (blood pressure and pulse). A test dose was administered in the first 10 minutes of infusion, and the patients carefully observed for 30 minutes. The time of treatment and dosage was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Patients were randomized to receive either treatment using a computer-generated randomisation list, stratified by site. Individual treatment allocations were placed in sealed, opaque envelopes which were opened after a patient had been entered into the trial. It was not possible to blind patients or treating physicians due to the nature of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Endpoints</title><p>Primary (definitive/final cure) and secondary (initial cure) efficacy endpoints were determined by parasitological assessment, as the most objective and consistent method across treatment centres at six months follow-up and at Day 30, respectively. Day 30 was considered as the end of treatment time point for initial cure assessment. Definitive cure was defined as absence of parasites in tissue aspirates (bone marrow, lymph node or spleen) with no relapse of signs and symptoms of VL during six months follow-up. Initial cure was defined on day 30 by absence of parasites in tissue aspirates. For patients with detectable parasites at initial cure assessment, clinical and biological assessments were used, in addition to parasitological results, to ascertain the need for rescue treatment at the end of study treatment at the discretion of the treating clinician, according to the protocol. Patients with a presence of parasites at initial assessment of cure but who were clinically well were invited to return after one month to further assess their status and need for rescue treatment. Patients who did not clear parasites at end of treatment but did by six months follow-up, in the absence of a requirement for additional rescue treatment, were classified as treatment successes at six months as patients who were slow responders, in line with previous trials in the region <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Hailu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Assessment of safety involved monitoring vital signs, documentation of patients' complaints about the treatments, and haematological and biochemical measurements evaluated on days 2 to 5, 7, 14, 21 and 30, and at 3 and 6 months. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) were classified according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Treatment emergent events were those with onset between day 1 of treatment and day 60 inclusive.</p><p>Peripheral Blood Parasitaemia: In Kassab, per protocol amendment, peripheral blood samples were analysed for parasite load in a subset of 5 consenting patients in each of the 10 mg/kg single dose and multiple dose arms. For this, a validated quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) method targeting <italic>Leishmania</italic> 18S ribosomal RNA was used <xref rid="pntd.0002613-vanderMeide1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

In interim analyses, 20 patients per arm would provide 90% power to detect a difference of at least 35% in parasite clearance rate at day 30, assuming 95% cure in the reference arm and a two-sided alpha of 0.05.

Decision-making at each interim analysis was based on a test of difference between the parasite clearance rates in the single dose arm and multiple dose arms. If the single dose arm showed significantly poorer efficacy (P&#x0003c;0.05), the single-dose was increased prior to re-starting recruitment. Patients allocated to the multiple-dose arm for discontinued single-dose comparisons were not included in comparisons of higher single doses.</p><p>Key assumptions for the planned final analysis were not met due to low efficacy in the multi-dose arm and the trial was terminated prematurely (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>). Cumulative data for each treatment regimen were used to calculate the percentage of patients cured, with exact binomial 95% confidence intervals (CI), at day 30 and 6 months follow-up in ITT and per-protocol (PP) analysis populations. Patients with missing outcome data were excluded from analyses. For safety, the number and percentage of patients per arm experiencing adverse events (AEs) were summarised, for AEs with cumulative incidence higher than 10%. For parasite clearance from peripheral blood, a linear mixed effects regression model using the natural log-transformed parasite loads was applied to estimate the time to clear 50% and 90% of parasites for each individual. Model performance and significance were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>The most commonly presenting VL symptoms were fever and weight loss, followed by loss of appetite, abdominal swelling, and cough; less commonly observed were epistaxis, diarrhoea, and skin lesions. Other characteristics of patients at entry to the trial are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pntd-0002613-t001">Table 1</xref>. Overall, 82% of patients were male and about half were children. About two thirds of patients were underweight or severely underweight. Mean haemoglobin concentrations were &#x0003c;8&#x000b7;0 g/dl, and anaemia was common, but neither baseline laboratory parameters nor vital signs suggested any major difference among dose groups. Baseline characteristics were generally comparable in the multiple and the 10 mg/kg single dose group, whereas the smaller 7&#x000b7;5 mg/kg dose group showed some imbalances: on average, patients in this group were older and accordingly had higher body weight and larger spleen size, but also had the highest baseline parasitaemia. Patients were younger in Kassab (10&#x000b7;5&#x000b1;5&#x000b7;0 years) than in Gondar (20&#x000b7;9&#x000b1;6&#x000b7;3) or Arba Minch (17&#x000b7;4&#x000b1;10&#x000b7;2 in) and more often female in Kassab (33&#x000b7;3%) than in Gondar (10&#x000b7;5%) or Arba Minch (12%). In Arba Minch, they were more often normal weight (42&#x000b7;0%) than in Gondar (21&#x000b7;1%) or Kassab (28&#x000b7;6%).</p><table-wrap id="pntd-0002613-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pntd.0002613.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline data on patient demographics, clinical characteristics and laboratory values.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pntd-0002613-t001-1" xlink:href="pntd.0002613.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Multiple dose 21 mg/kg N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;63</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single dose 7.5 mg/kg N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;21</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Single dose 10 mg/kg N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age in years</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (9.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (9.2)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (7.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Children (4&#x02013;17 y), n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37 (59)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (19)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25 (63)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adults (&#x02265;18 y), n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (41)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (81)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (37)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (11)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (25)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male, n (%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53 (84)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (91)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (75)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spleen size in cm</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean (SD)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.5 (5.3)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.0 (6.0)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.1 (5.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nutritional status<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">&#x02020;</xref>

IC rates with single doses of 7&#x000b7;5 and 10 mg/kg were 50% and 73%, respectively; and DC rates were lower, at 40% and 58%, respectively. However, there were variations in treatment response between treatment centres, with poor efficacy in Kassab and Gondar, particularly with single doses. By contrast, at Arba Minch, the multiple doses as well as the single dose of 10 mg/kg resulted in complete cure, and treatment failures were observed with the 7&#x000b7;5 mg/kg dose only.

The aim was to determine the minimum efficacious dose and safety of treatments in HIV-uninfected patients. However, the study had to be prematurely terminated due to unacceptably low efficacy in both the single and multiple dose treatment arms, with a cure rate of only 85% in the multiple-dose arm. Adverse effects of treatment in this study were in line with the current drug label.</p><p>The overall low efficacy was unexpected, as total doses of 10 mg/kg and above resulted in DC rates of at least 90% in a trial in Kenya <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Berman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The trial was not powered for data analysis by geographical location (centre) and the results may have been due to chance, but both the 10 mg/kg single dose and 21 mg/kg multiple dose regimens appeared to work very well in the small number of patients treated in Arba Minch Hospital (southern Ethiopia). We have little explanation for the overall poor response seen in this study or for the observed geographical variations. Previously, similar geographical variation in treatment response in these three sites was seen for daily doses of 11 mg/kg body weight paromomycin base over 21 days <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Hailu2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, a regimen which had also proven efficacious in India <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Sundar2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Methodological bias is unlikely in this randomized trial, but differences in base line patient characteristics between the three trial sites could have possibly introduced bias, leading to variation in treatment response. In Arba Minch, about 16% of patients were severely underweight, as compared to more than twice as many in the two sites with poorer responses. However, in all sites, between 58% and 79% of patients were underweight or severely underweight. As poor treatment response was not restricted to the severely underweight patients only, mechanisms are likely to be more complex. Furthermore, the single dose trial in India did not have stricter inclusion/exclusion criteria (it included patients with severe malnutrition) and had a population of patients comparable with ours in terms of mean age and body weight <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Sundar2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. It is possible that other factors, such as haemoglobin and immunity, may play a role; however, it is unlikely that they can account for the large differences seen between India and eastern Africa or within Africa. The poor response may relate to characteristics of either the host or the parasite or a combination of both. Of note, the disease ecology in Kenya and southern Ethiopia is similar in terms of transmission cycle, as is also the case between the north Ethiopia and eastern Sudan VL <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Elnaiem1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Regarding the parasite; susceptibility to treatments (e.g. SSG) is known to be different in Africa and India, although development of resistance is unlikely to account for the poor response in this study. In Africa, resistance has generally not been an issue and amphotericin B has not been widely used. Of the two closely related Leishmania species of the L. donovani complex that cause VL (L. donovani and L. infantum/chagasi), only the former exists in eastern Africa. However, recent studies employing microsatellite markers have revealed the existence of genetically varied populations of <italic>L. donovani</italic> in south and north Ethiopia <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Gelanew1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Whether such genetic variation accounts for the difference in treatment outcomes remains to be determined. Currently ongoing drug susceptibility testing may give some clues. Due to early termination of the study, results were not conclusive regarding the primary objective, <italic>i.e.</italic> the efficacy comparison of single and multiple doses. However, pharmacodynamic data suggests a benefit of multiple doses on peripheral parasite clearance. On day 3 of treatment, differences in peripheral parasite clearance were significant, even though total administered doses up to this time point were comparable in both arms (10 versus 9 mg/kg, respectively). This suggests a possible role for the frequency of administration. This would need to be confirmed by further studies, but is supported by the relatively high cure rate achieved in single dose patients rescued by additional standard multiple dose regimen. Even in India, where efficacy of single doses was shown to be good, it was lower than multiple dose regimens <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Sundar3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Sundar4" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In eastern Africa, there might be no optimal montherapy dosing regimen of AmBisome&#x000ae; for VL but combination therapies including AmBisome&#x000ae; are still of interest and under investigation <xref rid="pntd.0002613-Omollo1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In this respect, qRT-PCR results are interesting, although its use in Africa might be hampered by relatively low blood parasitaemia at baseline and the prohibitive cost of the test. More sensitive prognostic pharmacodynamic biomarkers, applicable in all patients, are needed to monitor treatment response.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><p>AmBisome&#x000ae; in single doses of up to 10 mg/kg is suboptimal for eastern African VL patients. A higher dose of 21 mg/kg administered in multiple doses was also far less effective than anticipated. In a small number of patients, no treatment failures occurred in patients from south Ethiopia treated in Arba Minch Hospital either with 10 mg/kg single dose or 21 mg/kg divided doses. The tested AmBisome&#x000ae; regimens would not be suitable for VL treatment across eastern Africa, and an optimal single dose that could be included in shorter and simplified treatment regimens of anti-leishmanial drugs across all VL endemic regions of eastern Africa was not identified. Efficacy of AmBisome&#x000ae;for the treatment of VL in eastern Africa was variable and overall lower than in India.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002613.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002613.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0002613.s002"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>Study protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0002613.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Our thanks go to: 1) the Food, Medicines, and Health Care Administration &#x00026; Control Authority (FMHACA) of Ethiopia, 2) the Federal Ministry of Health &#x02013; Government of Ethiopia, 3) the Ministry of Gedaref state, Sudan, 4) The Regional Health Bureaus in SNNP-RG (South Ethiopia) and Amhara Regional State (north Ethiopia), 5) The College of Health Sciences &#x02013; Addis Ababa University, and 6) Institute of Endemic Diseases - Sudan.
