These can be done through the perineum or transabdominally. Delorme&#x02019;s procedure is the most frequently used perineal, resection rectopexy the most commonly used abdominal procedure. Recurrences seem more common after perineal compared to abdominal techniques, but the latter may carry a higher risk of peri- and postoperative morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>DeloRes is a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded multicenter trial with two parallel groups. Patients with a full-thickness rectal prolapse (third degree prolapse), considered eligible for both operative methods are included. The primary outcome is time to recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse during the 24&#x02009;months following primary surgery. Secondary endpoints are time to and incidence of recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse during the 5-year follow-up, duration of surgery, morbidity, hospital stay, quality of life, constipation, and fecal incontinence. A meta-analysis was done on the basis of the available data on recurrence rates from 17 publications comprising 1,140 patients. Based on the results of a meta-analysis it is assumed that the recurrence rate after 2&#x02009;years is 20% for Delorme&#x02019;s procedure and 5% for resection rectopexy. Considering a rate of lost to follow-up without recurrence of 30% a total of 130 patients (2 x 65 patients) was calculated as an adequate sample size to assure a power of 80% for the confirmatory analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The DeloRes Trial will clarify which procedure results in a smaller recurrence rate but also give information on how morbidity and functional results compare.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>German Clinical Trial Number DRKS00000482</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rectal prolapse</kwd><kwd>Surgery</kwd><kwd>Delorme&#x02019;s procedure</kwd><kwd>Resection rectopexy</kwd><kwd>Recurrence</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Full-thickness prolapse of the rectum is defined as protrusion of the full thickness of the rectal wall through the anus. There is a peak in the incidence of this disease in the seventh decade of life. A total of 80% to 95% of the patients are women
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The etiology of rectal prolapse is still unknown. Fifty percent to seventy percent of patients complain of longstanding constipation, the rate of fecal incontinence ranges between 40% and 80%
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Other predisposing conditions include chronic straining defecation, pregnancy, previous surgery, and neurological disease. There is probably a genetic disposition to this condition.</p><p>Treatment of rectal prolapse is usually surgical. More than 100 surgical approaches have been described in the literature. The aims of the operation are to correct the rectal prolapse, to restore normal bowel function, and to avoid a recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse. For many patients, constipation and fecal incontinence improve after surgery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Basically, two different surgical approaches can be distinguished: perineal and transabdominal procedures. In general, perineal surgical repairs supposedly cause less morbidity and mortality compared with abdominal operations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. They are considered especially indicated in the elderly and/or high-risk patients as they can also be done in spinal or epidural anesthesia
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, recurrences seem more frequent after perineal techniques than after abdominal operations
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Abdominal repairs involve fixing the rectum to the sacrum by using either mesh or sutures. In addition to rectopexy a sigmoid resection is commonly performed. Laparoscopic repair of rectal prolapse has similar morbidity and recurrence rates as open surgery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There are data suggesting that the laparoscopic compared to the conventional approach has short-term benefits as described for other laparoscopic abdominal procedures (reduced length of hospital stay, less postoperative pain, faster return to normal bowel function, and less wound complications)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. But when using a modern fast-track regime (involving multimodal balanced anesthesia and analgesia including peridural catheter, early normal nutrition and mobilization as well as avoidance of tubes and catheters) the advantages of a laparoscopic approach have become somewhat less clear
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In general the fast-track regime allows enhanced recovery and discharge of patients compared to conventional postoperative management. Application of such a fast-track regime allows compensation of assumed disadvantages like more pain or slower mobilization of patients after open abdominal surgery compared to laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>In conclusion, perineal as well as abdominal (mostly laparoscopic) procedures remain the established options in the surgical treatment of rectal prolapse without evidence from adequately designed randomized studies which of these procedures are superior. There are only insufficient data available on the long-term benefits and risks, quality of life, and total treatment costs. Our trial aims to contribute to the very scarce high-level-evidence basis of randomized trials comparing a perineal <italic>vs</italic>. an abdominal approach. The urgent need for a randomized trial such as DeloRes was also pointed out in the Cochrane Review by Tou in 2009
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>DeloRes is a randomized, controlled, observer-blinded multicenter trial with two parallel groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient population</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022; Full-thickness rectal prolapse, externally visible on straining</p><p>&#x02022; ASA-Score I-III</p><p>&#x02022; Patient is suited for both standardized surgical approaches</p><p>&#x02022; Patient is able to cooperate</p><p> &#x000b7; Patient has given written informed consent</p><p>&#x02022; Aged 18&#x02009;years or older</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>&#x02022; Recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse</p><p>&#x02022; Patient with stoma</p><p>&#x02022; Patient with inflammatory bowel disease</p><p>&#x02022; Pregnancy or breastfeeding</p><p>&#x02022; Patient currently under chemotherapy</p><p>&#x02022; Active malignant disease and life expectancy less than 24&#x02009;months</p><p>&#x02022; Body mass index greater than 40</p><p>&#x02022; Participation in another intervention trial with interference of intervention and outcome of this study</p><p>The aim was to exclude as few patients as possible, but nevertheless minimize attrition bias in long-term follow-up and enable a high recruitment rate given the fact that patients presenting with full rectal prolapse are a small population of a reasonably higher population of patients not willing to present at their physicians because of misinformation or shame.</p><p>Thus patients with recurrent rectal prolapse would often not be acceptable for surgeons to be randomized to perineal vs. abdominal approach especially if the prior surgery had been a perineal approach. Patients not surviving at least 24&#x02009;months would not be available for the primary endpoint visit at 24&#x02009;months postoperatively. And patients with BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40 had been excluded as they are very few and do not represent the common patient habitus of rectal prolapse.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Scheme of intervention</title><p>DeloRes will be performed in 13 trial centers. All participating centers are cooperating units with a special focus on colorectal surgery and all centers perform between eight and sixty surgical interventions for rectal prolapse per year. In order to minimize performance bias, only surgeons with an adequate experience in performing the approaches investigated operate on patients in this study (minimum number of procedures performed (&#x02018;life-time experience&#x02019;): Delorme&#x02019;s procedure=20, (laparoscopic) resection rectopexy=20). Each study center provides at least one surgeon with the required experience for Delorme&#x02019;s procedure and one surgeon with the required experience for (laparoscopic) resection rectopexy (expertise based, best team approach). To ensure standardization for all participating centers an operative manual with standardized video sequences will be prepared. Moreover, consented crucial steps of each procedure will be captured in the clinical record file. In addition, in order to allow confirmation of a certain procedure quality, selected digital photos will be taken.</p><p>To reflect current practice and to increase external validity of the trial, perioperative standards (for example, bowel preparation, parenteral nutrition, fast-track, postoperative application of laxatives) will not be strictly standardized. Each trial center, however, will document its own standards in a short questionnaire and agrees not to change this standard during trial recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and trial timeline</title><p>Recruitment of participants started in September 2010. The duration of the trial for each patient is expected to be 60&#x02009;months with follow-up at 6, 12, 24, and 60&#x02009;months after the primary surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment assignment and randomization</title><p>Consecutively screened and eligible patients will be included in the trial. In order to achieve comparable intervention groups, patients will be allocated by preoperative randomization 24 to 48&#x02009;h prior to surgery after given written informed consent using a centralized web based tool (
<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.at">http://www.randomizer.at</ext-link>). Block randomization stratified by center will be applied to achieve equal group sizes per center.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions and trial flow</title><p>The laparoscopic approach is considered the standard approach for the transabdominal operation of full-thickness rectal prolapse. Laparoscopic resection rectopexy is suggested to yield better results in the early postoperative phase in comparison to the open approaches with equal recurrence rates in comparison to the open approach. However, the advantages of a laparoscopic approach become somewhat less evident under a fast-track regime, therefore open resection rectopexy is also acceptable via a Pfannenstiel incision. The latter approach has proven to be only moderately invasive in numerous procedures of the lower abdomen. The most frequently used perineal procedure is Delorme&#x02019;s procedure, which shows low postoperative morbidity. The trial flow is illustrated in Figure

Therefore this parameter is defined as primary outcome measure, evaluated during the 24&#x02009;months following primary surgery. Recurrence is defined as the circular protrusion of rectal mucosa through the anal canal and will be examined by standardized history, clinical examination, and photo documentation. To assess the primary outcome, patients are asked to perform a straining maneuver in a sitting position (patients not able to sit will be assessed in a lateral decubitus position). Then a photograph is taken during straining. The primary outcome is finally determined by the independent review board on the basis of the photograph.</p><p>Secondary endpoints are time to and incidence of recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse during 5-year follow-up, duration of surgical intervention, morbidity, SAE, all causes of mortality within 3&#x02009;months after primary surgery (this period was chosen to get any mortality possible related to surgery. Patients with rectal prolapse are usually rather old and frail. There are multiple reasons for further morbidity or mortality which are expected to be unrelated to the surgical procedure in case they occur beyond the first 3&#x02009;months), length of initial hospital stay, reoperation rate for recurrent prolapse, cumulative hospital stay and change in quality of life, constipation, and fecal incontinence as measured by appropriate questionnaires.</p><p>The time to and the incidence of recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse during a 5-year follow-up after primary surgery will be assessed as explained above. Morbidity occurring during the primary hospital stay is further differentiated into surgical and non-surgical complications, which are specifically defined as following: severity grading is done with the Clavien classification

<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). Based on these data, we assume a recurrence rate 2&#x02009;years after randomization of 20% for the Delorme&#x02019;s procedure and 5% for resection rectopexy, respectively. If the unstratified two-sided log rank test at level of significance &#x003b1;=5% was applied 2 x 50=100 patients would be required to achieve a power of 1 - beta=80% (nQueryAdvisorR 7.0,
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). It is expected that the rate of loss to follow-up without recurrence of full-thickness rectal prolapse will add up to 30%. Even though the lack of information on the primary endpoint at 2&#x02009;years for these patients is partly addressed by the applied time-to-event method, another 30% of patients will be randomized to compensate for this partial loss of information. It can be expected that application of the center-stratified version of the log rank test will further increase the power. Based on these considerations, a total of 130 patients (2 x 65 patients) will be allocated to the trial which should be sufficient to assure a power of 80% for the confirmatory analysis.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Currently, there is no valid evidence as no conclusive data are yet available from larger randomized or even adequately case-controlled studies. Perineal approaches, such as the Delorme&#x02019;s procedure, are deemed less invasive compared to abdominal procedures. Further advantages are shorter intervention time and the possibility to perform the operation under spinal or epidural anesthesia. On the other hand, the recurrence rates after such an approach are thought to be significantly higher than after an abdominal approach.</p><p>A prospectively randomized, adequately powered trial comparing these two established operation techniques with prolapse recurrence as primary outcome has never been successfully completed. In addition, trial registers of ongoing prospective studies do not indicate that there currently is a recruiting trial investigating this question (last search October 7, 2011).</p><p>An updated Cochrane review of Tou <italic>et al</italic>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. An urgent need for high quality randomized clinical trials with adequate statistical power, long-term follow-up, and quality of life assessment is concluded by the authors and reference is made to the PROSPER Trial still ongoing at the time of the Cochrane review update.</p><p>The so-called PROSPER Trial in the United Kingdom
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] compared abdominal to perineal surgical approaches for rectal prolapse in a pragmatic two-stage randomization trial design depending on the surgeons degree of uncertainty which of four approaches to choose. The study was able to recruit 293 patients from 33 centers over a 7-year period from February 2001 up to the cessation of the trial in August 2008, but only 26 patients were actually randomized to one of the two approaches (last available newsletter from December 2005, see trial website). All other patients were allocated to one of the two procedures by surgeon&#x02019;s preference. In view of the very small number of patients actually randomized to a perineal versus an abdominal approach, the conclusions of this study are going to be very limited and the risk of selection bias is high. In addition, the majority of recruiting centers recruited less than 10 patients to the study, further reducing the validity of the results.</p><p>Considering the lessons learned from the PROSPER Trial, an urgent need currently exists for an adequately powered, simple parallel-group randomized trial comparing the abdominal to the perineal approach in rectal prolapse. Contrarily to the PROSPER Trial, clinical equipoise regarding the two surgical approaches has been concluded after extensive discussion of the available data as the confidence intervals of the published studies on the two approaches overlap considerably. Even if the study shows that the abdominal procedure results in significantly less recurrences this may be outweighed by a considerably higher morbidity and possibly less improved quality of life. This trial therefore only allows randomization to a perineal or abdominal approach. A loss of eligible patients to an observational non-randomized arm, as was the case for the majority of patients in the PROSPER Trial, will not be possible.</p><p>This trial is designed as an expertise-based trial aiming at strong internal validity by high performance and standardization. Generalizability may be reduced by the expertise-based trial design. However, this type of surgery in larger numbers is predominantly performed by specialized surgeons. For these surgeons but also for general surgeons operating only on a few cases per year the results of this trial should have an important impact on clinical practice by determining the most effective treatment for rectal prolapse.</p><p>In summary, considering the scarce high-level evidence available up to date we hope that our trial will add the necessary and confirmatory data to analyze which surgical approach is indeed superior.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment is running since September 2010.
