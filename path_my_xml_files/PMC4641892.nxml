Among <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> are the most common ESBL-producing bacteria and are of major concern because of treatment difficulties and dissemination in the healthcare system (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The number of healthy carriers of ESBL-producing bacteria is increasing dramatically (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The prevalence of ESBL faecal carriage in different parts of the world is based on regional data. In Europe, for instance, faecal carriage may be approximately 10% (predominantly with CTX-M-15) (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In Sweden, resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in 2012 was 4.4% for <italic>E. coli</italic> and 2.6% for <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se">www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se</ext-link>, EARS-Net). International travelling contributes to a high risk for acquired ESBL genes to the gut flora (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and consequently, the spreading of plasmid-borne resistance worldwide.</p><p>In the spring of 2005, a major outbreak of CTX-M-15-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> occurred at the Uppsala University Hospital (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Two hundred forty-seven patients (median age 78 years) were reported to be infected or colonised with this difficult-to-treat bacterium (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Considerable effort to combat this outbreak was undertaken and the outbreak was declared over in 2008. Various issues during the outbreak were studied, including hospital management, microbiology, infection control measures, and educational antibiotic interventions (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Risk factors for blood stream infections with ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic> are recent antibiotic therapy (i.e. beta lactam antibiotics), presence of comorbidities, previous invasive procedures and devices, and admission to long-term healthcare facilities (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A study on faecal carriage of ESBL enzymes revealed that 1) nearly 50% of the initial carriers were still positive 12 months later, 2) some of the carriers were transiently negative before 12 months, and 3) the ESBL genes were sometimes found in new species or strains during the observation period (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). An indefinite carrier state is suggested and therefore viable alternatives to antibiotics that can eradicate resistant bacteria are urgently needed.</p><p>Thus, eradicating the colonisation of ESBL <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> from the gastrointestinal tract in carriers is an important target to accomplish to decrease the burden of antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Oral immunotherapy with avian immunoglobulins (IgY) lacks the risk of resistance, and toxicity is low. The only precaution to consider is egg allergy. Human studies have shown that the number of lung infections with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in patients with cystic fibrosis can be reduced with IgY treatment by gargling (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In a randomised, placebo-controlled study using IgY chicken antibodies for the treatment of gastroenteritis in children caused by rotavirus, stool output and oral rehydration solution were lower in the treatment group, along with a faster clearance of the virus infection, compared with the controls (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In the same study, no differences were found in duration of illness between the groups. IgY is an effective immunologic tool to influence unwanted microbes from colonising the alimentary tract of humans by adding its activity to the regular human immune system (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine whether IgY chicken antibodies could be effective in eradicating faecal carriage of ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>This study was a randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, phase II, orphan drug study of anti-ESBL IgY for the eradication of ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> in faecal carriers.

To increase the inclusion rate, patients found to be colonised or infected with ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> at Uppsala University Hospital between 2008 and 2013, and Falun Hospital between 2012 and 2013 were also added. The screening procedure and typing of ESBL-producing strains were carried out as previously described (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumonia and E. coli</italic> isolates were reported to the research team. Written information and contact data were sent by mail to patients of age &#x02265;18 years. Individuals who did not reply spontaneously were contacted by phone at least two times on separate occasions. After informed consent, patients were screened for colonisation with ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumonia</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic>, and, if positive, randomised to the study drug or placebo at a 1:1 ratio.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Preparation of study drug</title><p>Briefly, IgY antibodies against ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> were developed as follows: recombinant variants of the two fimbrial <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> subunits mrkD and fimH were developed by detailed instructions in the investigator's brochure. A combination of recombinant proteins was used for immunisation of one group of hens and a combination of ESBL <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> bacteria was used for the immunisation of another group of hens. The immunogens were prepared together with Freund's adjuvant. Egg yolk antibodies are actively transferred from the hen to the egg yolk where they are found in high concentration (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The preparation was carefully mixed and used for intramuscular immunisation. Equal amounts of eggs from the two immunisation groups were used for production of the active drug. Eggs from immunised hens were visually inspected and defective eggs were excluded from further processing. The remaining eggs were then washed in 70% ethanol and dried before the egg yolk was separated and weighed: the egg yolk was diluted with purified water (<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>); the lipoproteins were sedimented; and the supernatant decanted, filtered, and finally dispensed in high-density polyethylene bottles with a polypropylene screw cap (70 mL in each) and labelled.</p><p>The specificity of the anti-ESBL IgY antibodies against the two antigen pairs, that is, the fimbrial proteins (mrkD and fimH) and ESBL-producing <italic>E. coli/K. pneumoniae</italic> was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a high specific binding of anti-ESBL IgY in IgY batches, whereas the placebo batches showed very low activity. The minimal amount of antibodies required for clinical effect was not established. Thus, an exact lower limit for the acceptance criterion has not been established, but samples tested with ELISA from the IgY batches showed 11.6&#x02013;15.1 BNU/mL (Limit, &#x0003e;5 Bio Unit/mL), regardless of storage conditions (i.e. &#x0003c;&#x02212;15&#x000b0;C up to 12 months, from +2 to 8&#x000b0;C up to 12 months, +25&#x000b0;C up to 1 week, thawing up to three times after freezing in &#x0003c;&#x02212;15&#x000b0;C for 3 months). Procedures to eliminate the risk of bacterial contamination of the product were secured according to Medical Products Agency regulations. The egg yolk products were frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in bottles until used. The egg yolk contains two parts: low-density lipoproteins and water-soluble proteins. Approximately 30% of the water-soluble proteins comprise IgY. One egg yolk is made up of approximately 100 mg IgY. Of that amount, up to 10% are reported to form specific antibodies (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Protein concentration in the water-soluble part in all batches was calculated to 1.8 mg/mL as determined by the Bradford assay. Thus, the assumption for the IgY concentration was calculated to be 0.18 mg/mL.</p><p>The eggs were hatched at OVA Production AB, Sweden. Cobra Biologics AB, Sweden, purified the antibodies.

However, because of a high dropout rate, the study was discontinued before completion. The high number of deceased and those with HTTP because of disability and transportation issues made up the major proportion of the study participants. Thus, leaving the study process was the main cause of terminating the study. This fact mirrors that the patient group, which was the target group in the present study, had a high degree of comorbidities and high age that are known to predispose death and disability (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Most related side effects were mild among the treated participants. However, in one case, treatment had to be interrupted because of intensive nausea and vomiting.</p><p>This study provides some information about the duration of carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria. Only one-third of the participants screened for persistent faecal carriage in our study were ESBL positive, indicating a high proportion of spontaneous eradication. The median interval between the initial detection of ESBL genes and the faecal screening performed within this study was significantly shorter in the ESBL-positive group than in the ESBL-negative group. These results are consistent with previous studies on colonisation with ESBL-producing <italic>Enterobacteriaceae</italic>. The median time for carriage has been reported to be 6.6 months and might be prolonged in some patients (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, carriage can also be transiently negative over time, indicating that persistence of ESBL-producing bacteria is sometimes overlooked with conventional screening methods (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>Fimbriae are important components for bacterial adhesion to the host cells. Thus, IgY specifically binding to these antigens and others from the bacteria may have the ability to prevent these ESBL-producing bacteria from colonising the gastrointestinal tract (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). ESBL genes are not linked to specific antigens but may exert their effect on the specific bacteria in an unknown manner. The hypothesis is that specific IgY exerts its effect locally in the intestine by decreasing adherence of the pathogen to the gut epithelium. Another theoretical mechanism is that IgY binds to specific antigens on the bacterial surface, which prevents bacteria from interacting with different epitopes in the gut environment to survive.</p><p>This study reveals no information on IgY concentrations in faeces. For correlation studies, IgY concentrations could be analysed along with determinants of polymerase chain reaction -positivity of ESBL genes. However, because of pharmacokinetic difficulties to establish a steady-state concentration in this particular fluid with the current dosing used, we decided not to attempt it. Instead, we propose to develop a gut model in which IgY binding can be studied. Analysing antibody activity in stool samples has inherent technical challenges. The stomach contains pepsin. Digestion of immunoglobulins with pepsin normally produces one F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment and numerous small peptides of the Fc portion. Secondary anti-IgG antibodies are primarily directed against the conserved Fc portions of the antibody. If the antibodies are digested by pepsin, the F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment could still bind the bacteria, but because of the limited reactivity between the F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment and the secondary antibody, the F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment will give a very weak signal in ELISA assays. It has recently been shown that specific IgY enhances phagocytosis of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacteria and that this process was independent of Fc-mediated mechanisms (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Such an observation suggests that the F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment could also have an antibacterial effect.</p><p>Oral administration of egg components is considered safe in that they are part of the normal food intake. Furthermore, immunotherapy with IgY does not have the risk of resistance, and toxicity is low. The only precaution to consider is egg allergy. The stability of IgY is shown high <italic>in vitro</italic> in temperatures below 40&#x000b0;C and in acidity at pH&#x0003e;4 (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), indicating that IgY activity remains after passage through the ventricle. As an extra protection against acidity, sodium hydrogen bicarbonate was used.</p><p>At the time of the initial idea of this study, we were in the midst of a turbulent hospital care situation, that is, we were treating a large number of patients infected or colonised with ESBL-producing <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic>. The hospital's structure, care process, and economic status were all put under tremendous stress. The timeline for the development of this study was severely delayed because of different manufacturer and regulatory regulations. Thus, we propose that further studies on IgY chicken antibodies should be done in a preclinical setting to better understand the mechanisms of action. Human studies of this kind may be performed as a long-term investigation on discovered carriers of ESBL genes in faeces. Such an ongoing study process may be suitable to intensify in an outbreak situation. For now, increasing the inclusion rate to a reasonable level in such a study should be done in medium- to high-prevalent regions.</p><p>In summary, the present study of anti-ESBL IgY for the eradication of ESBL <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> in faecal carriers was prematurely discontinued because of high mortality and other factors resulting in a low inclusion rate. Spontaneous eradication of ESBL-producing bacteria was frequently observed in recruited participants, which is consistent with previous reports.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Grants from Uppsala Bio-X and the Swedish Society of Medicine were gratefully received.
