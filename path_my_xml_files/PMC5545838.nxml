Having a psychiatric illness increases likelihood of being a victim of DVA. Despite the evidence of a high risk for DVA and the serious effects of violent victimization in psychiatric patients, detection rates are low and responses are inadequate. The aim of the BRAVE (Better Reduction trough Assessment of Violence and Evaluation) study is to improve detection of and response to DVA in psychiatric patients. In this article, we present the protocol of the BRAVE study which follows the SPIRIT guidelines.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The BRAVE study is a cluster randomized controlled trial. We will include 24 community mental health teams from Rotterdam and The Hague. Twelve teams will provide care as usual and 12 teams will receive the intervention. The intervention consists of 1) a knowledge and skills training for mental health professionals about DVA, 2) a knowledge and skills training of DVA professionals about mental illness, 3) provision and implementation of a referral pathway between community mental health and DVA services. The follow up period is 12&#x000a0;months. Our primary outcome is the rate of detected cases of recent or any history of DVA in patients per team in 12&#x000a0;months<bold>.</bold> Detection rates are obtained through a systematic search in electronic patient files. Our secondary aims are to obtain information about the gain and sustainability of knowledge on DVA in mental health professionals, and to obtain insight into the feasibility, sustainability and acceptability of the intervention. Data on our secondary aims will be obtained through structured in depth interviews and a questionnaire on knowledge and attitudes on DVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This study is the first cluster randomized controlled trial to target both male and female psychiatric patients that experience DVA, using an intervention that involves training of professionals. We expect the rate of detected cases of DVA to increase in the intervention teams. With early detection of victimization of DVA in psychiatric patients we hope to improve the mental health of psychiatric patients in the short and long term.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">

In the Netherlands approximately 45% of all persons experience at least one form of DVA during their life time and estimates suggest that approximately 200.000 Dutch persons per year are victimized by an intimate partner or family member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. DVA is the most prevalent form of violence and affects men, women and children in all segments of society.</p><p id="Par18">The definition of DVA can vary. DVA can be defined as &#x02018;any incident of threatening behaviour, violence or abuse (psychological, physical, sexual, financial or emotional) between adults who are or have been an intimate partner, family member, friend or otherwise closely related (i.e. a care taker or roommate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">In addition to immediate physical injuries and long term conditions such as chronic pain (e.g. back or neck), gynaecologic problems such as chronic pelvic pain or sexually-transmitted diseases and hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], DVA is associated with a range of psychosocial and mental health problems, including loneliness, anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorders, substance abuse and psychosis which can be transient as well as chronic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Research has found a high prevalence of DVA among psychiatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and, across all diagnostic categories, an increased likelihood of being a victim of DVA among women and men with psychiatric disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Results from the Dutch nationwide study on victimization in psychiatric patients supports the results and mentioned reports a 6-fold increase of DVA in severely mentally ill (SMI) patients as compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Although in the majority of cases of DVA men are perpetrators and women are victims, in the last decade an increasing amount of research showed that, at least among psychiatric patients, men are often victims of DVA as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In other words, despite the absolute DVA prevalence in males is lower compared to females, in psychiatric patients this gender difference is greatly reduced. In patients the risk among men increases steeply compared to the general population, more so than in female psychiatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This phenomenon is mostly overlooked.</p><p id="Par22">In addition because of the social stigma associated with (male) victims of DV and the few studies on male victimization of DVA, under detection in general but in males specifically, is likely as well.</p><p id="Par23">Despite the evidence of a high risk for DVA in psychiatric patients and its serious consequences on patients and their families, detection rates of DVA remain low. Around 10&#x02013;30% of cases are detected by psychiatric service providers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Clinicians often report barriers to ask for experiences of concurrent DVA. These barriers include the fear to confront and offend patients or the fear to induce false memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and perceived lack of knowledge and expertise to address the abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Moreover, after the detection of DVA, treatment plans rarely take these experiences of DVA into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These figures are alarming and indicate that a great need to invest in interventions to improve the identification of DVA victimization and provision of mental health services addressing the prevention of DVA (re-)victimization among psychiatric patients. Although there is little research on this subject, some have suggested the use of an individual screenings tool to improve detection of and outcomes for domestic violence in women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, a Cochrane systematic review of screening in primary care found that this did not increase referrals to services specialized in DVA nor did it decrease experienced DVA in victims [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These results suggest that information dissemination on DVA to professionals and patients and a screenings tool for DVA in isolation does not create consistent, sustainable improvements in identification and response to DVA.</p><p id="Par24">As was shown in studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], identification rate of victims of DVA by health care professionals can increase with a sustainable training of professionals and changes in policy including the implementation of a referral and care pathway within health care systems. Apart from a positive effect on detection rate, these type of interventions result in more referrals to specialist services for DVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The BRAVE study is informed by the Linking Abuse and Recovery through Advocacy (LARA) pilot study in mental health services and Identification and Referral to Improve Safety (IRIS) cluster trial in primary care conducted in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], as both of these studies showed promising results. Detection and referral rates increased after a multi-faceted intervention was provided to clinical teams which included training by the DVA sector and a referral and care pathway which included referral to the DVA sector; the level of functioning and abuse experienced by psychiatric patients in the LARA study was measured and also improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The BRAVE study is the first randomized controlled trial which focuses on males and females who have a mental illness.</p><p id="Par26">The BRAVE study is an interventional study. The intervention consists of: 1) a knowledge and skills training for mental health professionals about DVA, 2) knowledge and skills training of DVA practitioners about mental illness, 3) the provision and implementation of a direct referral pathway between community mental health services and DVA services for victims of DVA with mental illnesses. The effect of this intervention will be tested in a cluster randomized controlled trial comparing the detection rate of domestic violence in psychiatric patients of community mental health teams in the intervention condition versus teams in the control condition. Furthermore we aim to assess the feasibility, sustainability and acceptance of the intervention for clinicians, policy makers, managers and victims of DVA in both the community mental health services and the DVA services. We expect that the number of detected cases of DVA will increase in the intervention group compared to the control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Domestic violence and abuse services in context of the public health system in the Netherlands</title><p id="Par27">In the Netherlands, domestic violence and abuse (DVA) services are part of the public health system. The public health system is financed by government, and services are free of charge for every citizen. The public health services cover a wide range of problems, such as domestic violence, youth work, and housing. Public health services are the responsibility of the municipality. With regards to DVA, starting from 2015, every municipality in the Netherlands has installed a helpline service, for both professionals and victims of DVA, named Veilig Thuis (Safe Home).</p><p id="Par28">A Veilig Thuis-service functions as a gatekeeper. They assess cases of (suspected) DVA, provide advice in cases of (suspected) DVA and coordinate referrals to third party services on DVA. Veilig Thuis (VT) covers both child abuse and intimate partner violence.</p><p id="Par29">All municipal VT-services adhere to national DVA guidelines (diagnostic and referral guidelines). These guidelines are general in nature, which means that slight differences in interpretation and execution may exist between municipalities.</p><p id="Par30">Thus, the municipal care for victims of DVA offers the following services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Informal advice:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par32">Assessment: if a person calls the helpline, VT will assess the situation during that phone conversation. The helpline service is available for everyone with a concern regarding DVA. This could be, for example, a co-worker, victim of DVA or a clinician.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par33">Advice: after assessment VT will offer advice to whomever using the helpline. This advice ranges from passively monitoring the situation to notifying the police because of a (potentially) dangerous situation. VT can also give referral advice.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par34">Formal advice:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par35">Assessment: the helpline can also be used for (health care) professionals who want to ask for a formal advice in a case of (suspected) DVA from VT. This means that VT will be officially involved, they will assess the situation in person and provide an official report after their assessment which includes directives for specialized services.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par36">Referral: after assessment, VT will refer the case for the care they deem necessary to stop the violence. This care can vary from empowerment courses delivered by third party DVA services or social work services to temporary eviction of the perpetrator. If a case is deemed dangerous, VT can directly report the case to the police and safeguard the victim through admission in a safe house.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p id="Par37">VT employs a variety of professionals namely, doctors specialized in DVA behavioral experts, nurses. Most employees answering the helpline are social workers.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Legislation</title><p id="Par38">All professionals working in health care are encouraged to, and in the case of child abuse are obliged to, follow a protocol on (suspicion of) DVA by law. This protocol is called &#x02018;Meldcode&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Our aim is to improve and further implement this protocol in daily practice as a part of the referral pathway. The Meldcode consists of 5 steps a health care professional should follow when DVA is suspected. The steps are: 1) screening for possible signals of DVA, 2) consultation of a colleague or a DVA professional working at VT, 3) discuss suspicion of DVA with the client/patient, 4) assessment of the severity of the violence. In this step a consultation of a DVA professional at VT is possible, 5) patient referral to a service specializing in DVA (if deemed appropriate) or a formal assessment from VT. If at step 5 the health care professional decides to formally ask advice from VT, VT will assess the situation and refer to/involve the care that they think is needed to stop the violence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p id="Par39">The study will be conducted in the municipalities of Rotterdam and The Hague, the Netherlands. DVA services provided in these municipalities are provided by VT Rotterdam and VT The Hague (see previous paragraph for details). Mental health care in these municipalities is provided by two big community mental health clinics (CMH) i.e. BAVO Europoort (Rotterdam) and Parnassia The Hague. These clinics provide both out-patient and in-patient mental health care and cover the Rotterdam- Rijnmond and the Hague area, which inhabits approximately 2.5 million people. Service use is free of charge for all citizens with health insurance, which is obligatory in the Netherlands, after paying a limited contribution with a maximum of 385 euros per year.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethics</title><p id="Par40">This design takes into account some important dilemmas with regards to studying a population at risk for DVA. In this study, screening for domestic violence is an integral part of the intervention, because it is considered unethical to screen for domestic violence while not offering any kind of help to positively screened patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">There is a high level of acceptance for screening among women with severe mental illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, we need to protect professionals and patients from violence as a consequence of disclosure of domestic violence by offering skills and information on how to assess risk of and respond to violence. This theme will be a substantial part of the training of professional and intervention of the patient. Adverse events will be reported to the researcher and scientific committee.</p><p id="Par42">Professionals interested in taking part in the in-depth interviews will be asked to sign an informed consent prior to the interview.

If patients are interested they will receive an information letter about the study and a researcher will approach the patient to obtain informed consent.</p><p id="Par44">With regards to our primary parameters, data will be collected on team level, and cannot be traced back to individual patients nor clinicians. Data of patients within teams will be stored and analysed anonymously. With regards to our secondary parameters, data on individual professionals (the data of the short questionnaire on DVA and the transcripts of the semi-structured interviews) will be linked to subjects using an identification number.

We do strive however, to implement champions of DVA in each intervention team and support meetings where participants can ask questions about complicated cases of DVA. While we strive to set up support meetings, these meetings fall beyond the scope of this study.</p><p id="Par46">The Medical Ethical Committee of the Erasmus MC Rotterdam approved the BRAVE study.

A CMH team consists of approximately 10 mental health professionals including a psychiatrist, psychologist, social psychiatric nurses and social workers. Their caseloads consists mostly of patients with schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder or chronic depression. The level of intensity of care can vary over time and from patient to patient. Each CMH team provides outreaching care for patients living in a certain district of The Hague or the Rotterdam &#x02013; Rijnmond area. The districts in this study are defined through postal codes.

Attendance will be monitored. During, and after initial training, teams are actively encouraged to implement the techniques learned in their daily practice.</p><p id="Par70">After the training, clinicians will receive an extended manual incorporating good practice guidelines and information on local/national DVA services. To improve implementation of the knowledge gained in the training, each team in the intervention condition will be recommended to assign a advocate on DVA. Advocates in the intervention teams will collect all problems and questions regarding DVA in their team. We will maintain close contact with the DVA advocates throughout the study through e-mail. Advocates can address problems in the collaboration with DVA practitioners and/or referral to DVA services to the DVA expert team in the institution. This expert team is not part of this study and is already in place at the two participating institutions before the beginning of this study. We will also hand out posters with conversational techniques on DVA and cards team members can use as an aid when talking to their patients about DVA.</p><p id="Par71">The teams in the control condition will not receive any additional training in DVA. Clinicians in the control condition however, can refer patients to DVA services(according to standard practice), when they detect a patient suffering from DVA.<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2)</label><p id="Par72">

The Meldcode is explained in more detail in the section legislation. Professionals will be provided with a visual outprint of the Meldcode, contact information on local DVA services and information on resources on DVA in their own organization in the manual of the training.

Outcomes will be obtained through a systematic search in electronic patient files at the participating mental health institutions. We will search the electronic patient files using a set of keywords, their synonyms, (miss-)spellings and words closely associated with DVA. Our main keyword will be domestic violence. This keyword will first be piloted and validated. A specialized software program will be used to analyze the information in the electronic patient files of the detected cases to determine words closely associated with domestic violence. To validate the detected cases, we will assess each detected case of DVA individually using information from the electronic patient file. Non-cases will be verified randomly. Reliability of the data extraction will be evaluated by repeating the data extraction on a subset of teams by a second independent researcher and compare the outcomes. To ensure comparability in timing, we will pair control and intervention teams and obtain outcome data simultaneously. We expect an underreporting of detected cases and over-reporting of referred cases by the clinicians in the patient records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since these biases will affect both intervention and control condition equally, study results will remain valid.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Secondary aims and outcomes</title><p id="Par80">The BRAVE intervention has the following secondary aims and outcomes:</p><p id="Par81">Aim 1 - to assess gains and sustainability in knowledge on DVA among mental health professionals.</p><p id="Par82">Aim 2 - to assess the feasibility, sustainability and acceptance of the intervention among CMH teams and,</p><p id="Par83">Aim 3 - to assess the (possible) referral pathway to DVA services and the implementation of the Meldcode.</p><p id="Par84">We will assess Aim 1 using a structured questionnaire &#x02013; The BRAVE Survey - developed specifically by the study team, to assess CMH teams knowledge and attitudes regarding DVA.</p><p id="Par85">Aim 1 - the BRAVE survey</p><p id="Par86">The BRAVE survey was informed by the PREMIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and PROTECT questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par87">All members of the included teams will receive this survey. The survey has a total of 53 questions divided into 5 sections: (1) Respondent profile, (2) Previous Courses on DVA (3) Skills in management of DVA, (4) Knowledge on DVA and (5) Opinions on DVA. Section 1; &#x0201c;Respondent profile&#x0201d; consists of 7 questions, of which 3 are multiple choice and 4 questions an individual can fill in. Participants are asked about their professional background (work experience, current profession, educational level) and general information (date, age, gender); section 2; &#x0201c;Previous courses attended on DVA&#x0201d; consists of a multiple choice question about previous courses on DVA. If participants check yes they are asked 4 questions about duration of this course and when this course was completed. Section 3; &#x0201c;Skills in management of DVA&#x0201d; consists out of 7 multiple choice statements. Participants can check the box on the Likert scales, ranging from 1 (not skilled) to 5 (very skilled), the extent to which they feel skilled to handle/judge a particular described situation regarding DVA. Section 4; &#x0201c;Knowledge on DVA&#x0201d; consists of a total of 14 multiple choice statements. For the first three questions, participants need to check the box on Likert scales, ranging from 1 (nothing) to 5 (a lot). These questions are followed by 10 multiple choice questions with statements about DVA where participants can choose between true (1) and not true (2). The last question in this section asks the participants to combine the correct described statement with the right stage of the process of discontinuing a relationship with a perpetrator. Section 5; &#x0201c;Opinions on DVA&#x0201d; consists of 16 statements on DVA where participants can choose whether they agree on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (do not agree) to 5 (agree).</p><p id="Par88">To be able to compare the scores of the survey, sections 3 (Skills), 4 (Knowledge) and 5 (Opinions) will be calculated separately per participant and will then be aggregated at a team level.

In this protocol, we will measure the efficacy of an intervention to improve knowledge and skill training for professionals about DVA and mental illness, as well as to implement a referral pathway between CMH and DVA services for DVA victims with mental illness. According to these premises, we underline the importance of this intervention for psychiatric patients suffering from DVA.</p><p id="Par123">This study is the first cluster randomized controlled trial targeting both male and female psychiatric patients who potentially experience DVA, using an intervention that involves a training of mental health and DVA services, and the focus on the implementation of a referral protocol. Among victims of DVA, loss to follow up is considered a risk. MacMillan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported 42% loss over an 18&#x000a0;months follow up period. This high percentage loss is partly due to the nature of the problem studied. Victims of DVA show a high level of mobility and might be at high risk for subsequent violence after disclosure of the DV. By assessing our primary outcomes at team level, we minimize biases caused by individual drop out.</p><p id="Par124">Furthermore, by randomizing teams we avoid contamination of skills and techniques of professionals in the intervention condition to the professionals in the control condition. However, since a cluster RCT is less precise than an individual trail, the chance of failing to detect a true intervention effect might increase (type II error). Also, the number of clusters in this trail is relatively small (i.e. 24 clusters), therefore randomization might partly fail, which would cause the patients in the control and intervention condition to differ from each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par125">We do not foresee many risks in the attainment of this study. However, possible risks could occur if the mental health institutions discontinue facilitation of the CMH teams or reorganize the team structure, for instance by merging existing teams during the study period. This will affect the number, size and composition of clusters. This might lead to contamination and decrease of power. Also, municipal reorganization of the DVA services might affect the attainment of this study.</p><p id="Par126">With better detection rates of DVA, the focus of research on this topic could shift towards improvement of treatment, prevention and interventions on DVA on an individual level.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BRAVE</term><def><p id="Par5">Better reduction through assessment of violence and evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CMH</term><def><p id="Par6">Community mental health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DVA</term><def><p id="Par7">Domestic Violence and Abuse</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FACT</term><def><p id="Par8">Functional assertive community treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par9">Intraclass Correlation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IF</term><def><p id="Par10">Inflation factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRIS</term><def><p id="Par11">Identification and Referral to Improve Safety</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LARA</term><def><p id="Par12">Linking Abuse and Recovery through Advocacy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MEC</term><def><p id="Par13">Medical Ethical Committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par14">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMI</term><def><p id="Par15">Severe mental illness</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VT</term><def><p id="Par16">Veilig Thuis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par127">The BRAVE study is funded through the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (abbreviated as NWO), NWO; grant number 432&#x02013;13-803.
