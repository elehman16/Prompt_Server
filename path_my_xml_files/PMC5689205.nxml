The purpose was to gain insight into the extent by which the intervention was adopted and implemented as intended and to understand how educators observed its effectiveness and maintenance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Public schools located in seven municipalities in Denmark were invited to enroll their 4th to 6th grade classes in the project. Of these, 24 school decided to participate in the project in the school-year 2015&#x02013;16 and were randomly (cluster) allocated to either intervention or control group. A process survey was completed online by school personnel at the start, at midterm, and at the end of the school year. Additionally, informal interviews and observations were conducted throughout the year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">At the 12 intervention schools, a total of 148 educators were involved in the implementation of the programme over the school-year. More than nine out of ten educators integrated brain breaks in their lessons and practically all the physical education teachers used the physical education lesson plans. The educators delivered on average 4.5 brain breaks per week and up to 90% of the physical education teachers used the project lesson plans for at least half of their classes. Half of the educators initiated new recess activities.</p><p id="Par4">A total of 78%, 85% and 90% of the educators believed that the implemented recess, brain break and physical education components &#x02018;to a high degree&#x02019; or &#x02018;to some degree&#x02019; promoted the pupils&#x02019; well-being, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">This study shows that it is possible to design a school-based PA intervention that educators largely adopt and implement. Implementation of the PA elements was stable throughout the school year and data demonstrate that educators believed in the ability of the intervention to promote well-being among the pupils. Finally, the study show that a structured intervention consisting of competence development, set goals for new practices combined with specific materials, and ongoing support, effectively reached a vast majority of all teachers in the enrolled schools with a substantial impact.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">Date of registration: retrospectively registered on 24 April 2015 at Current Controlled Trials (DOI 0.1186/<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12496336">ISRCTN12496336</ext-link> &#x02013; named: &#x0201c;The role of physical activity in improving the well-being of children and youth&#x0201d;).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12966-017-0614-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Well-being</kwd><kwd>School</kwd><kwd>Process evaluation</kwd><kwd>Cluster RCT</kwd><kwd>Implementation</kwd><kwd>RE-AIM</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007437</institution-id><institution>TrygFonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013 Pulje- Nr.24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Skovgaard</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par13">School-based approaches promoting physical activity (PA) are recommended because in most countries the majority of children and adolescents spend many hours in school every day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A school setting also makes it possible to reach children and young people who are fairly inactive during their leisure time. Furthermore, in many countries health and well-being are an integrated part of the state school curriculum, which means that there are qualified educators in the form of teachers, pedagogues and other adults teaching at the school, alongside existing cultures and infrastructures for teaching and learning about activities that relate to health, well-being and PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Well-being can be defined in different ways, but in the Danish school system, well-being is most often understood in relation to social and academic factors, which are focus areas in the annual &#x02018;school well-being survey&#x02019;. The understanding of well-being used in this project is based on the self-determination theory, where self-realization and vitality are central aspects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Well-being is enhanced if the three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence and social relatedness is satisfied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Engaging in physical activity can be more or less conducive for fulfilling the three psychological needs, which is dependent on the context and the social environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recently, Lubans and colleagues offered a conceptual model describing three possible mechanisms between PA and various mental health outcomes. The model suggests three hypotheses: a neurobiological; a psychosocial; and a behavioral hypothesis which could explain the rationale and possible impact of PA on well-being [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In recent years, a number of school-based interventions have been conducted with a focus on PA and well-being with small to moderate positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Many of these studies were small-scale studies; conducted over a relatively short period of time (4&#x02013;20&#x000a0;weeks intervention); lacking a control group; or used a cross-sectional design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In order to construct evidence applicable to real-world settings, it is crucial to evaluate the feasibility of the intervention programme, and this is no easy task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Several studies have addressed the implementation of physical activity programmes in schools, identifying several determinants of a successful implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In a systematic review, Naylor et al. described the most common categories used in previous studies, such as 1) provider characteristics, 2) characteristics of the innovation, 3) the delivery system and 4) the support system, all of which is critical to consider when designing school-based PA interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Many programmes however fail to evaluate the process of the interventions, which could be an explanation for their general low effectiveness and, more importantly, could hinder the flow of information to future interventions that might improve implementation mechanisms.</p><p id="Par15">The RE-AIM framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) has been developed to guide the evaluation of issues relating to the external validity that is, &#x000b4;finding out which populations it works for and how best to make it work in those populations&#x000b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The framework has been used to assess school-based PA interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and to guide process evaluations in cluster randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The RE-AIM framework encourages planners, evaluators, and policy-makers to pay more attention to essential programme elements, including external validity. In this way, the sustainable adoption and implementation of effective, generalizable, evidence-based interventions can be improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The <italic>Move for Well-being in School</italic> intervention (MWS) aimed to improve psychosocial well-being among school-aged children and youths from 4th to 6th grade (10&#x02013;13&#x000a0;years) through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a multicomponent, school-based, physical activity intervention.

Informed by the design phase, an initial intervention programme was assembled. Also, the main theoretical driver of the programme development originated from the area of motivation, as construed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan&#x02019;s self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The pilot phase encompassed the assessment of the initial intervention programme in four schools over a four-month period, to evaluate the feasibility of the implementation in a real-world setting.</p><p id="Par19">The RCT included the implementation of the final intervention programme. Based on initial screening municipalities were selected from the following criteria a) geographic and demographic variation, b) variation in schools size and c) variation without extremes in municipal budgets for public schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. A total of 11 of 98 Danish municipalities were contacted and seven agreed to participate either by contacting schools themselves or by allowing the research team to contact schools in the municipality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The research team held individual meetings with all interested schools and a total of 24 schools were enrolled. A stratified randomization was conducted with three strata and with the constraint of an even distribution of schools from each municipality in the intervention group and the control group respectively. The three strata were defined by school typology, based on school size and district socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of recruitment, randomization, and measures.

Two process meetings, by the research team, were conducted at each school (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The PA program included physical education, recess, theme days and brain breaks. In short, the educators should conduct two daily brain breaks lasting five minutes per class; facilitate new activities during recess three times per week lasting 30&#x000a0;min; complete three theme days focusing on well-being and PA; and finally, half of physical education classes should be taught according to the special MWS lesson plans designed for the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Timeline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12966_2017_614_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par46">The objective of this study was to evaluate the implementation of Move for Well-being in School using the RE-AIM framework. Often, as is the case with MWS, interventions address several outcomes simultaneously and are comprised of a number of components that interact and affect outcomes. Moore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] remarked that interventions are often delivered in systems that are complex and respond unpredictably. In order to contain this complexity, intervention evaluations have to move beyond a focus on effectiveness alone. Process evaluation is one way to investigate other important dimensions in health interventions.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Reach</title><p id="Par47">As stated in the results section, schools were selected to ensure comparability to most Danish schools in terms of number of pupils, expenses per pupil, and socioeconomic status of the pupil&#x02019;s parents. We included 24 schools but had difficulties reaching schools through the municipal authorities. Municipalities were reluctant to put pressure on schools due to a recent extensive school reform and consequently increased workload. Therefore, with permission from the municipalities, the schools were contacted directly. The schools agreeing to participate could be grouped into two basic categories: 1) schools that already had a consolidated focus on school PA and were interested in improving the already high standards; and 2) schools with low experience and capabilities regarding school PA and with obvious challenges meeting the target of 45&#x000a0;min of school PA per day. This variation could contribute to understanding the differences in school management and educators&#x02019; motivation for participating in the project and capacities for taking on MWS. According to Scaccia et al. the ability to take on a particular innovation depends on &#x0201c;<italic>a) the motivation to implement an innovation, b) the general capacities of an organization, and c) the innovation-specific capacities needed for a particular innovation&#x0201d;</italic>, also referred to as organisational readiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The &#x02018;organisational readiness&#x02019; could be reflected in the response rates, which showed that some schools only achieved answers from half of the educators, while other schools had a response rate of 100%. Presumably, non-responding educators were less involved in the programme and implemented fewer activities and components. The differences in response rates between schools might, therefore, bias the results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Effectiveness</title><p id="Par48">As an indicator of effectiveness, we used the educators&#x02019; perception of the pupils&#x02019; change in well-being. The definition of well-being and introduction to the key elements of the self-determination theory was presented in the available materials and during the competence development program. Still, it is uncertain whether the educators&#x02019; perceptions accurately reflect actual changes in pupils&#x02019; well-being. Nonetheless, the overall belief in the positive effects of the intervention is evident and it is essential to the educators&#x02019; motivation to implement and maintain the programme.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Adoption</title><p id="Par49">The adoption rates for both physical education and brain breaks were high, but the adoption rate of the recess activities was much lower, which may reflect the fact that not all educators are appointed for recess duty. Recess is used by many educators as a time for preparation and coordination or having a break and an informal talk with colleagues. Having &#x02018;recess duty&#x02019; is tantamount to just ensuring pupils are not getting in trouble or injured. Some teachers also hold the view, that recess is free time for the pupils and should not be influenced in any way by the adults.</p><p id="Par50">The recess activities could, therefore, be experienced as a rather radical change compared to previous practices in the area. In general, the literature holds that the more radical a change is, the more uncertainty it creates and the more difficult the implementation is [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Whereas the educators generally found it difficult to intervene during recess due to time constraints, the challenges for brain breaks revolved around spending time away from the key academic subject. Two reasons why adoption in physical education might be less challenging is that physical education teachers have PA competences and education, and secondly that the physical education lessons should be conducted anyway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In that sense the physical education component and the lesson plans could be regarded as a help to an existing task and not as extra work, which was stated by some of the PE teachers involved in the competence development program. This finding is also supported in the proces evaluation by Steeinhuis et al., where an intervention that involved extra work on top of a heavy workload of regular duties were seen as a barrier for implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">The fact that no school withdrew from the project, together with the high response rates for the process survey, lends confidence in the representativeness of the presented data. The role of the coordination groups at each school consisting of educators and management representatives could partly explain the high participation and adoption rate. Active management participation and involvement have in previously process evaluations been stated as facilitator for engaging in project interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Implementation</title><p id="Par52">The implementation of brain breaks was 4.5 per educator per week with major differences between educators and an overall average of 8.6 brain breaks per class per week for all intervention schools. Barriers for conducting brain breaks relates to difficulties integrating it to the normal practice. Finally, some brain breaks lasted more than 5&#x000a0;min, which might let the educators settle for one per day of longer duration.</p><p id="Par53">Overall, the physical education set goal was met, with at least half of physical education lessons being MWS lessons. This was probably because physical education teachers perceived it as a help to their planning, and because this element is directed at teaching and learning and thus resembles normal school practice and is related to the academic subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] . Interventions that align directly with a school&#x02019;s mission are easier to integrate into the school&#x02019;s policy and practices and are more likely to be prioritised, implemented with due care and quality, and sustained over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">The observations of and interviews with the physical education teachers supported the findings that the MWS lessons plans were positively received. They also indicated that lack of time for preparation; lack of coordination between teachers; and challenges with some pupils&#x02019; acceptance of the new physical education practice were among the biggest barriers to the implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The physical education teachers that attended the workshops emphasised these as highly significant for their preparation and for their motivation for the project. The educators stated that the practical learning of brain breaks and physical education, and the opportunity to meet with their colleagues were pivotal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similar findings are reported by Castelli et al. in their examination of the strength of evidence from studies of professional development effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Several studies have previously reported barriers and facilitators in implementing school-based PA interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

The remaining comments revolves around change in PE culture with four comments, challenges in recess with four comments and finally one comment on &#x02018;lack of commitment among colleagues&#x02019;, &#x02018;pupils avoid academic for more brain break time&#x02019; and &#x02018;noise during brain breaks&#x02019; respectively. These factors affecting implementation in MWS matched the categories by Nayor et al. presented earlier. The two most common facilitators in the project were the competence development program and the opportunity for local tailoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Maintenance</title><p id="Par56">Both adoption and implementation are relatively stable between T1 and T3. During the school year the coordination group received bi-weekly information letters by e-mail; received two follow-up visits from the research team; conducted a mid-term theme day; and were invited to attend the fourth workshop half way through the school year. The relatively low level of input from the research team required for ongoing implementation provided an important enticement for the maintenance of the MWS initiatives. Furthermore, the fact that the intervention was conducted over a whole school year and employed teacher-delivered strategies is in the process evaluation literature perceived as facilitators for increasing maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Finally, the fact that nine out of ten educators would recommend the MWS programme to other schools and felt that participation had improved their school, lead us to believe that the intervention can be maintained over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par57">This study have shown that it is possible to design a school-based PA intervention that educators largely adopt and implement. Implementation of the PA elements was stable throughout the school year and data demonstrate that educators believed in the ability of the intervention to promote well-being among the pupils. There were, however, large differences between schools in implementation, which can be explained by differences in existing capabilities and motivation. Finally, the MWS show that a structured intervention consisting of competence development, set goals for new practices combined with specific materials, and ongoing support, effectively reached a vast majority of all teachers in the enrolled schools with a substantial impact.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par65">
