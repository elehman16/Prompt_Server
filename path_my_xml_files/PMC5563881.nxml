Annually 43.7 billion dollars are expended for patients with depression among them 28% are directly for depression and other costs are related to mortality and morbidity due to depression (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, routine depression treatments include tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>); use of other therapeutic methods such as complementary treatments (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) or injection methods such as botulinum toxin (Botox) are suggested in some studies (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Botox is a drug with multiple applications in dermatology treatments especially with cosmetic purposes (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).
