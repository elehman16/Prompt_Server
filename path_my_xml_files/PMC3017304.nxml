The reported incidence of chronic pain in patients who underwent laparoscopic hernia repair is a serious problem. The techniques of dissection, mesh fixation, and the mesh material used have all been identified as being part of the problem. Excellent biocompatibility through a unique combination of a lightweight open porous polypropylene mesh covered with a covalent-bonded titanium layer has been claimed. The aim of this study was to find out whether the titanium surface alone or the difference in material load between the two available meshes influences clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three hundred eighty patients with 466 inguinal hernias were operated on between 2002 and 2006 with the laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) technique. Mesh fixation with staples was carried out routinely. After the dissection was completed just prior to the implantation of the mesh, patients were randomized into two groups. In Group A, 250 (53.6%) inguinal hernias were repaired with a 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh, and in Group B, 216 (46.4%) inguinal hernias were repaired with a 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh. The primary outcome was chronic pain 3&#x000a0;years after surgery. The degree of pain was determined using a visual analog scale (VAS) with a range from 0 to 10. The secondary outcome was the rate of recurrence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The postoperative period of observation was at least 3&#x000a0;years for every patient. In both groups, 90% of the patients could be questioned and examined clinically: in Group A (Light), 5.3% of the patients and in Group B (Extralight), 1.5% of the patients suffered from chronic pain. Chronic pain was significantly more common in Group A than in Group B (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.037). There was no difference with respect to the rate of recurrence: for Group A it was 3.1% and for Group B it was 2.6% (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.724).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Chronic pain is not very common in patients who have had their inguinal hernias repaired with titanium-covered polypropylene mesh. Reducing the material load from 35 to 16&#x000a0;g/m<sup>2</sup> seems to further improve the biocompatibility of these meshes, thus improving the clinical outcome by reducing chronic pain to a rare event. The role of staples in causing chronic pain following inguinal hernia repair may be overestimated. There was no evidence supporting the notion that the use of the 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized meshes is associated with increased recurrence rates.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hernia</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>TAPP</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Titanized polypropylene mesh</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Soci&#x000e9;t&#x000e9; Internationale de Chirurgie 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most commonly performed operations in the world. Every year almost 60,000 inguinal hernia repairs (IHR) using transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) and extraperitoneal (TEP) techniques are performed in Germany [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the majority of cases postoperative recovery is without complications and return to normal activities is possible within 1&#x000a0;week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. However, some patients complain about postoperative pain for several weeks and some suffer from chronic groin pain for months or even for years. Chronic pain was defined as &#x0201c;lasting for 3&#x000a0;months or more&#x0201d; using the definition of the International Association for the Study of Pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In their meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, McCormack et al. found the incidence of chronic pain after inguinal hernia repair using the TAPP technique to be at 13.8% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In the literature, several risk factors for chronic inguinal pain are mentioned. These are young age, female gender, medial hernia, open repair technique, postoperative complications, need for operation for recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], presence of preoperative pain, neurotoxic chemotherapy, depression, neuroticism, anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and an observation period of fewer than 3&#x000a0;years after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the staples used for mesh fixation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and the alloplastic mesh itself may also be major causes for chronic postoperative pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies proved that there is a correlation between the weight, biocompatibility, and shrinkage of polypropylene meshes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There have been numerous clinical reports pointing out the tendency of implanted mesh to shrink extensively and migrate and penetrate neighboring organs, have an oversized load of material, and cause an associated chronic inflammatory reaction and even carcinogenic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A great effort was put into the development of meshes that have improved biocompatibility.</p><p>Since 2001 titanium-covered polypropylene meshes, referring to a new type of compound material, are available. The titanium is covalently bonded to the alloplastic surface of the mesh. There is evidence from animal experiments that the titanium-coated polypropylene meshes induce a less pronounced foreign body reaction (i.e., less shrinkage) compared with identical meshes lacking a titanium coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>To improve the outcome for their patients some surgeons have begun performing inguinal hernia repair using these titanized meshes. However, it was not clear which mesh to use for which kind of hernia, and it was also not clear how the 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> (Light) and the 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> (Extralight) versions differed concerning the rate of recurrence or chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this prospective, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial was to compare the incidence of chronic inguinal pain and the rate of recurrence after laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) hernia repair using 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> (Light) and 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> (Extralight) titanized polypropylene mesh.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients who were at least 18&#x000a0;years old and presented at the General Surgery Unit of Agatharied Academic Teaching Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich with a diagnosis of an inguinal or a femoral hernia were eligible to enter the study. The hernia repair was to be a laparoscopic tension-free TAPP technique with mesh fixation using titanium staples. Patients were randomized intraoperatively to receive either a 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> (TiMESH-Light&#x02122;, pfm medical ag, Cologne, Germany) or a 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> (TiMESH-Extralight&#x02122;, pfm medical ag) mesh for the repair of the inguinal hernia. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (Ethical Committee) and informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>All patients who were class IV or class V as defined by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) were excluded, as were those who had contraindications for general anesthesia. Further exclusion criteria were acute intra-abdominal infection such as peritonitis, previous major abdominal procedures, or a history of ileus. Patients who were participating in another trial, younger than 18&#x000a0;years, and mentally immature were also excluded.</p><p>Randomization was carried out using a lottery system. Letters were prepared prior to starting the trial and stored in a box. Each letter was drawn from the box and opened by a nurse just after dissection of the inguinal region and hemorrhage control were finished. The only influence that the surgeon had was the choice of the size of the mesh to be 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;cm or larger. In patients with bilateral hernias, both sides were repaired with the same type of mesh. Patients were not aware of which kind of mesh was used for the repair. During the consent process (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) prior to entering the trial, patients were informed that two new types of titanized polypropylene meshes are available and that we wanted to find out which one is the better with respect to postoperative pain and recurrence.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Design of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="268_2010_850_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>All patients underwent standardized TAPP repair in the presence of a surgeon experienced in TAPP repair who either performed the procedure himself or supervised it in a teaching situation. There were 13 surgeons who performed the operations. General anesthesia was used in all cases. All patients received standardized postoperative oral pain medication consisting of diclofenac 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;50&#x000a0;mg, novaminsulfone 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;500&#x000a0;mg, and omeprazole 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;20&#x000a0;mg. Four times per day pain levels were routinely controlled using the VAS ranging from 1 to 10. If at any time levels above VAS 3 were detected, additional medication (oxycodone/naloxone [Targin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] 10&#x000a0;mg or piritramide [Dipidolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] 15&#x000a0;mg) was administered until the patient reported levels below VAS 3. All patients were given standardized postoperative instructions that did not limit their activities. They could participate in sports as usual within the first 10&#x000a0;days except heavy-weight body building and anything that caused high-frequency movements of the psoas muscle, e.g., mountain biking.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>The herniotomy was carried out with the patient under general anesthesia with a single shot of prophylactic antibiotic (cefuroxime 750&#x000a0;mg). The operation was performed with the patient in the Trendelenburg position. The bladder was drained using a catheter. After pneumoperitoneum was induced, the 10-mm optic trocar was introduced at the umbilicus. Following inspection of the abdomen and the hernia, a 5-mm trocar was placed at the left lateral midclavicle. On the right lateral midclavicular line, a 12-mm trocar was placed to insert the stapler.</p><p>From the umbilical artery medially to 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;cm past the inguinal ring laterally, the abdominal wall (peritoneum) was incised describing an arc. The epigastric vessels were identified. The medial compartment was completely dissected to the midline, exposing the rectus muscle, the horizontal pubic ramus, Hesselbach&#x02019;s triangle, Cooper&#x02019;s ligament, and the iliopubic tract. The femoral hernia orifice was exposed. The dissection went deep into the prevesical space. The peritoneum was dissected from the spermatic cord cranially to about midpsoas. In lateral hernias, the sac was completely reduced and separated from the deferent duct and testicular vessels. In direct hernias, the pseudosac was completely dissected and the hernia orifice was freed from tissue. Perihernial lipomas were excised. In all cases, titanized meshes, either TiMESH-Light or TiMESH-Extralight (15&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;cm or 15&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;15&#x000a0;cm mostly cut down to 15&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;cm) were used. Meshes were not incised.</p><p>Staple fixation of the mesh was done in the vast majority of repairs. In special cases, e.g., extremely large hernias, suture fixation was used, and in very small lateral hernias no fixation was used. Mesh was fixed with two to six titanium staples by using either an Endopath Multifire stapler (EMS, Ethicon Endo-Surgery Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA) or an Endo-Universal stapler (Auto-Suture, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). One staple each was placed at the transverse fascia at the ventral border of the mesh medially and laterally to the epigastric vessels. The other staples were optional and were placed as follows: one staple to Cooper&#x02019;s ligament, one to the suprapubic connective tissue in the midline, and the last staple could be variably placed, always keeping at least a 3-cm safety distance to the inguinal ligament.</p><p>The peritoneum was closed using either staples or a running suture. In patients with bilateral hernias, the same procedure was performed on both sides. The placement of one Redon drain (Suru International, Mumbai, India) at the end of the procedure was optional. After removal of the trocars, the umbilical port site was closed at the level of the fascia. The skin was sutured. Umbilical hernias, when detected, were closed simultaneously by suture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome of the trial was chronic inguinal pain more than 3&#x000a0;years after inguinal hernia repair with TAPP technique. Chronic pain was defined as pain that persisted for more than 3&#x000a0;months after surgery and was present at the time of follow-up examination. It included patients who regularly consumed painkillers to control inguinal pain after hernia repair at the time of follow-up examination. The postoperative follow-up period for every hernia was at least 3&#x000a0;years. All patients were personally questioned and examined in detail at least 3&#x000a0;years after surgery by the same examiner.</p><p>Measurement of pain for all patients was also performed by only one examiner who used a standardized pain protocol (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The intensity was measured with a 10-cm VAS from 0 (no pain) to 10 (agonizing). Patients describing persistent pain were referred for further neurological, orthopedic, urological, gynecological, and psychiatric investigation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). When no extrainguinal cause for the pain could be found, the pain was considered to be a result of the procedure.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Hernia follow-up: standardized pain protocol accounted for every single hernia repaired</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

Meanwhile, the attention has turned to other measures of success. Chronic pain has become a major focus in the last few years and there have been numerous studies dealing with pain after IHR, its type and frequency of occurrence, its risk factors, and profiles of patients predisposed to the condition. The roots of the problem are nerve injury, tissue injury, the material used for the repair, and the method of mesh fixation. Anatomical changes also might be a cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>We found in our prospective, randomized, single-blinded trial that 3&#x000a0;years after IHR with the TAPP technique 5.3% of the patients suffered from chronic pain after the implantation of the 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh (TiMESH-Light). After hernia repair with the 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh (TiMESH-Extralight), which made up the second arm in the trial, chronic pain was detected in only 1.5% of the patients. This difference was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.037). The only difference between the two meshes was the material load. There was no difference in the baseline characteristics between the groups, so the reduction in chronic pain in Group B can be attributed only to the lighter-weight mesh. This is in line with the experimental results of Junge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] who very clearly demonstrated significantly improved functional consequences and morphologic tissue response with material-reduced mesh compared to a common heavy-weight polypropylene mesh. Klosterhalfen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] found in histological studies of long-term implanted meshes that the reduction of mesh material reduced the acute inflammatory reaction, caused less formation of connective tissue, and hardly maintained a chronic inflammatory process. There is much experimental evidence in the literature that material composition and mesh structure may significantly affect foreign body reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent extensive review by Weyhe et al. of current randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies led to the conclusion that light meshes seem to have some advantages with respect to postoperative pain and foreign body sensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, Light meshes offer no advantage with respect to alleviating &#x0201c;severe chronic groin pain.&#x0201d; We confirmed this in our study. The only two patients in the TiMESH-Extralight group with chronic pain reported it to be quite strong. Weyhe et al. also found that the use of Light meshes was associated with an increased recurrence rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In the present study we did not find a difference between the 35- and the 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> versions with respect to recurrence. Nonetheless, light-weight meshes have replaced their heavy-weight counterparts almost completely. This is clinical reality today, and it is independent of the fact that it may be difficult to prove why these Light meshes are favored. In our study, the lower rate of chronic pain detected in the arm with the lighter mesh confirmed expectations.</p><p>In a recent review of the literature, the incidence of chronic pain after IHR was reported to range between 25 and 30% in the majority of studies, with 2-9% reported as severe pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. McCormack et al. found that the incidence of chronic pain after IHR with TAPP technique was 13.8% in a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which was more than 5% lower than for the examined open repairs. Aasvang and Kehlet found in their review of the present literature that inguinal herniorrhaphy may be followed by a risk of chronic pain in about 12% of patients (18% after open and 6% after laparoscopic repair), with a clinically significant effect on daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Grant et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] found pain and numbness to be less of a problem after laparoscopic repair than after open repair. A well-conducted, large, randomized controlled multicenter trial found a 10% incidence of chronic pain after laparoscopy and 14% after open surgery in 1983 patients (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) without significant differences in VAS scores between the two groups at 6, 12, and 24&#x000a0;months. Kroninger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported chronic pain at a rate of 15% after TAPP repair in a long-term follow up (&#x0003e;52&#x000a0;months).</p><p>Several trials reported the incidence of chronic pain due to IHR after a follow-up of 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Our patients were followed up for 3&#x000a0;years after surgery, so the number of patients feeling pain may be reduced as a result of the follow-up time interval used. Courtney et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] used the Wisconsin Brief Pain Questionnaire, which measures pain severity and the impact of pain on function using 0-10 rating scale, to assess the long-term outcomes in 126 patients who reported severe or very severe pain within 3&#x000a0;months after IHR. Of the 86 who responded after 2.5&#x000a0;years, 71% still reported pain, which was severe or very severe in 26% of the cases and mild or very mild in 45% of the cases. This study demonstrates that the number of patients complaining and the severity of the pain both diminish over time. However, despite some available data, there is an overall lack of well-designed prospective studies quantifying the time course of post-herniorrhaphy pain. Even in view of the evidence suggesting a &#x0201c;burn-out&#x0201d; effect of the pain complaints, we find that the very low rate detected in both of our TiMESH groups cannot be attributed only to the time factor.</p><p>The incidence of short- or long-term chronic pain after laparoscopic IHR with TAPP technique as reported in the literature is generally higher than the results of the present trial. Chronic pain in 5.3% of the patients after 3&#x000a0;years after IHR with TAPP technique using 35-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh (Light) offers a good result in comparison with the literature. A rate of 1.5% when 16-g/m<sup>2</sup> titanized polypropylene mesh (Extralight) is used can be classified as a rare event. The data are rather solid since it is derived from a prospective randomized study with a large sample size of 466 hernias repairs and a high-quality follow-up, i.e., physical examination and personal questioning of 90% of the patients operated on. de Jonge et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] stated after an extensive review of randomized trials, considered to be the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of evidence, that the majority were using the VAS to assess pain, suggesting that there is a certain amount of standardization that can better enable interstudy comparison. Even though this particular quality standard was met by the present study, current instruments used for the evaluation of chronic pain need to be improved and prospectively validated.</p><p>The mesh used is the most probable reason for the low rate of chronic pain in this study. There are several modern concepts integrated into these prosthetic meshes, such as the light weight, pore size&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], monofile fiber, and titanium surface, that may have made a clinical difference, at least in this study, when compared to other meshes used in hernia repair. The low rate of chronic pain detected in both groups in the present study may have to do not only with the reduced weight but also with the unique titanium surface. With respect to several histological and histochemical parameters of biocompatibility, the titanized polypropylene mesh proved advantageous compared with the other modern meshes in animal experiments. Heavy-weight titanium-coated polypropylene meshes induce a less pronounced foreign body reaction than identical meshes with no titanium coating. Since the amount of material implanted is identical, this must be attributed solely to the titanium coating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The favorable biocompatibility of the titanized meshes that supposedly cause less foreign body reaction and less shrinkage than other modern meshes as demonstrated in animal experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] may also hold true in humans.</p><p>What causes the pain in those patients still suffering after 3&#x000a0;years? In addition to the mesh there is surgical trauma, direct nerve injury, and the use of staples that may have also played a role here. There are numerous published reports of nerve entrapment by tacks placed during laparoscopic repair. Laparoscopic hernia repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] without the use of tacks has been described and it eliminates the risk of misplaced tacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, it is more cost effective because staplers are expensive. Others do advise to use staples because the rate of recurrence may be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present study, staples were used in both groups to an equal extent. The rate of recurrence was the same in both groups but not the rate of chronic pain. The role of staples as a major cause of chronic inguinal pain cannot be supported by our data.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was not sponsored or supported in 480 any way by industry.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mohr</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bauer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x000f6;bler</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Woldenga</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><source>BQS-Qualit&#x000e4;sbericht 2002- Modul 12/3: Hernienoperationen</source><year>2003</year><publisher-loc>D&#x000fc;sseldorf</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Bundesgesch&#x000e4;ftsstelle Qualit&#x000e4;tssicherung gGmbH</publisher-name></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hamza</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Gabr</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammadi</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Khalil</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Four-arm randomized trial comparing laparoscopic an open hernia repairs</article-title><source>Int J Surg</source><year>2010</year><volume>8</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>25</fpage><lpage>28</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/j.ijsu.2009.09.010</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19796714</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Classification of chronic pain.
