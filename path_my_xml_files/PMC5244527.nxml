It impairs the quality of life of patients and decreases their functional capacity. Aquatic therapy has already been used for managing the symptoms of this syndrome. However, aquatic therapy has only recently been introduced as a treatment modality for improving proprioception in fibromyalgia. The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two physiotherapy protocols, one in and one out of water, for improving balance and decreasing pain in women with fibromyalgia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study protocol will be a single-blind randomised controlled trial. Forty women diagnosed with fibromyalgia will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: Aquatic Therapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) or Land-based Therapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). Both interventions include 60-min therapy sessions, structured into 4 sections: Warm-up, Proprioceptive Exercises, Stretching and Relaxation. These sessions will be carried out 3 times a week for 3&#x000a0;months. Primary outcomes are balance (static and dynamic) and pain (intensity and threshold). Secondary outcomes include functional balance, quality of life, quality of sleep, fatigue, self-confidence in balance and physical ability. Outcome measures will be evaluated at baseline, at the end of the 3-month intervention period, and 6-weeks post-treatment. Statistical analysis will be carried out using the SPSS 21.0 program for Windows and a significance level of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 will be used for all tests.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study protocol details two physiotherapy interventions in women with fibromyalgia to improve balance and decrease pain: aquatic therapy and land-based therapy. In current literature there is a lack of methodological rigour and a limited number of studies that describe physiotherapy protocols to manage fibromyalgia symptoms. High-quality scientific works are required to highlight physiotherapy as one of the most recommended treatment options for this syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Date of publication in ClinicalTrials.gov: 18/02/2016.

In 2010, following the release of the new diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], a new definition for FM was adopted. In addition to pain, it includes other important symptoms such as fatigue, restless sleep, cognitive problems and a variety of somatic symptoms.</p><p>The mean prevalence rate of FM in Europe is 2.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and the prevalence in Spain in those greater than 20&#x000a0;years of age is 2.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Worldwide, the incidence of FM is increasing at an exponential rate, demonstrating that FM is a common clinical condition that will require increasing specialised attention. FM causes disability, which is associated with high indirect costs derived from absenteeism and the use of health care resources. This is not only a major health problem, but also a significant socioeconomic problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are many available treatments to manage FM, however, only a few are supported by scientific evidence. The latest report of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] agrees with current clinical practice guidelines (CPG) which state that aerobic exercise is the only treatment option for the management of FM based on strong scientific evidence. CPG from Germany and Israel consider aquatic therapy as the best aerobic exercise program for this type of patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] however, for the EULAR, the effectiveness of exercise does not depend on the environment where it is performed (in or out of water).</p><p>Both land-based and aquatic therapy programs have shown benefit in the treatment of FM. Land-based treatment includes different types of exercises that train aerobic ability, strength or flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in a specific or general manner. Improvements in pain intensity, physical function and quality of life have been noticed. However, there are few studies with an appropriate methodological design that describe the intervention protocol and include physiotherapy as a treatment method. The properties of water make the aquatic environment one of the best places to carry out an exercise program: It reduces the impact on joints, improves microcirculation, facilitates relaxation, decreases the number of contractures and improves muscle tone due to its natural resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite aquatic therapy showing benefits for the management of some FM symptoms, results should be analysed with caution because of the low methodological quality of studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Pain and quality of life are the most studied outcomes in FM. This protocol will focus on balance. Recently, it has been shown that patients with FM have problems with motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and postural balance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Numerous observational studies have shown that there is a real balance disorder in patients with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The results revealed patients&#x02019; difficulty to move quickly or to change center of body mass, while maintaining postural stability. Patients also perceive their own impaired balance, with 45% self identifying this problem as one of the ten most debilitating symptoms of FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Lack of self-confidence in balance seems to have a direct relationship with muscular strengh and an inverse relationship with pain, disease severity and frequency of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Nowadays, health professionals agree that non-pharmacological therapy should be the first choice of treatment for FM, leaving the pharmacological therapy as a second-line intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This fact reveals the importance of researching and developing new and effective forms of treatment that constitute reliable and safe alternatives for patients with FM.</p><p>The main objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of two physiotherapy protocols for improving balance and decreasing pain in women with FM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The study will be a single-blind randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Enrollment and eligibility criteria</title><p>The sample will consist of 40 women, members of the &#x0201c;Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Multiple Chemical Sensitiviy Association&#x0201d; (ACOFIFA), in A Coru&#x000f1;a (Spain).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

Mechanical parameters of the movement will subsequently be analysed with the Computer Vision Mobility (CvMob) software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]; the analysis is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Patients will be instructed to attend the study wearing a form fitting top and shorts, or swim suits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and to take off their shoes during all tests. The CvMob is an open source tool for movement analysis, created with the OpenCv and Qt libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The software uses computing vision techniques, pattern recognition and optical flow to make object tracking possible, generating data of trajectory, speed, acceleration, and angular movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The equipment consists of a digital camera and CvMob program. The camera, a &#x0201c;Casio Exilim EX-ZR1000&#x0201d; model, with a resolution of 16.1 megapixels and 120 frames/s, will be used to record videos. The camera will be attached to a tripod and will be positioned at a distance of 2.27&#x000a0;m from the patient during the Romberg&#x02019;s test and at 3.15&#x000a0;m for the gait test. For a proper analysis, the CvMob should always be calibrated at the begginning of each video. Calibration consists of providing a reference measurement to the software, which will be used to do all of the calculations. For the Romberg&#x02019;s test, the instrument used to calibrate the system consists of a brown cardboard marked with two yellow points placed at a 20&#x000a0;cm interval distance. A mark painted on the floor of 21.5&#x000a0;cm in length will be used for the gait test. A series of markers will be placed on certain bony landmarks to facilitate registration of different motion parameters and further analysis. For static balance, the total speed, mean, standard deviation and amplitude of oscillation around the medio-lateral (ML) and anterior-posterior (AP) axes will be studied. The results that CvMob provides for these parameters are equal to those given by a conventional force platform. The gait speed and the length/height of step will be studied for dynamic balance. All of these parameters are explained in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Analysis and data extraction for the oscillation around the AP axis in Romberg&#x02019;s test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12891_2016_1364_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

</p><p>A recent study of validity and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] has shown that CvMob is a reliable tool for two-dimensional analysis of human gait. The results have revealed a strong correlation between CvMob and &#x0201c;Vicon Motion System&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], a three-dimensional capture motion system with a high technological precision for movement analysis. In addition, a strong correlation has also been observed in both inter and intra-rater analysis. This demonstrates that CvMob results are reproducible by different researchers and by the same person, at different times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Static Balance</title><p>Romberg&#x02019;s test:</p><p>This test assesses the integrity of proprioception. Central postural control depends on three systems: Visual, vestibular and proprioceptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. If the patient has a loss of proprioception, balance is maintained through activation of the visual and vestibular systems. However, if the patient is also deprived of eyesight, any proprioceptive disorder compensated by this system, will be detected and balance will be lost.</p><p>In order to increase test sensitivity, the Romberg&#x02019;s test will also be performed with feet in the tandem position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, 4 tests will be carried out, with a single attempt for each one and with a 10-s pause between each test:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Test 1: Feet together, arms along the body and eyes open.

It also evaluates stability during ambulation and direction changes while in gait without using compensatory strategies. The test consists of standing up from a chair with armrests and walking, at a normal speed, for 3&#x000a0;m, turning 180&#x000b0; and walking back to the chair. It will be practised once in order to insure that methodology is clear. At the time of assessment, only one single attempt will be registered. The test is measured in seconds and quantifies the time that the patient takes to complete the walk. A time of 10&#x000a0;s or less is considered normal and a time longer than 14&#x000a0;s is indicative of impaired balance and a high risk of falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Gait test:</p><p>The patient will have to walk, at a normal speed, for 8&#x000a0;m. The test will be practised once. As a limitation of optical range of the camera, only 3&#x02013;4 gait cycles will be captured. Therefore, the 3 central meters of the walk should be used in the analysis of gait parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Pain</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Pain intensity</title><p>It will be measured with the EVA, a 10&#x000a0;cm long line with the value 0 on the left indicating &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and the value 10 on the right indicating the &#x0201c;worst imaginable pain&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].

The FIQR is composed of 21 questions that make reference to the week prior to answering the questionnaire. Each question is based on an 11-point numeric rating scale of 0 to 10, with 10 being &#x0201c;worst&#x0201d;. The questionnaire is divided into three linked domains: Function, overall impact and symptoms. The &#x0201c;symptoms&#x0201d; domain contains four new questions relating to memory, tenderness, balance and environmental sensitivity (to loud noises, bright lights, odours and cold temperatures). The total FIQR score is the sum of the following 3 domain scores that can reach a maximum of 100 points: The &#x0201c;function&#x0201d; score (from 0 to 90) is divided by 3; the &#x0201c;overall impact&#x0201d; score (from 0 to 20) is not changed and the &#x0201c;symptoms&#x0201d; score (from 0 to 100) is divided by 2.

The transversus abdominis, pelvic floor muscles, internal oblique and multifidus form the local musculature. The most important aspect of achieving core stability will be co-activation of the first two muscles, for which patients will have to place their pelvis in a neutral position. Before starting the interventions, patients will receive anatomy and palpation classes to aid in identification of the involved musculature and how its contraction is perceived.</p><p>The protocols have been created by the main researcher based on available scientific evidence. The protocols were designed with the intention of being as similar as possible in order to attribute any statistically significant difference in outcomes between the two groups to the environment where the interventions were performed. Sessions will be pre-programmed with a progression in difficulty over the intervention period: Shorter pauses, higher exercise intensity, eyes closed, etc.</p><p>Patients will not be allowed to begin any other activity during the study period.
