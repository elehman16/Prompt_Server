However, this method needs to alter the instrument for testing tolerability of the patient. The objective of this study was to compare continuous low pressure support (PSV) and the T-piece method (T) before discontinue mechanical ventilation and extubation in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a prospective open-label randomized control study (non-inferiority trial) in SICU patients who were intubated and used mechanical ventilation, and appropriated discontinuation of the ventilator between June 2011 and November 2013. All patients underwent the same weaning protocol. The appropriated patients for discontinuation of MV were randomized into low pressure support up to 7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and T-piece method. Reintubation within 72 hours, pneumonia after extubation, and hospital mortality were recorded. The statistical significant difference was considered when <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 520 patients were randomized into two groups: low pressure support group (260 patients) and T-piece group (260 patients). There was no difference in age, gender, body mass index, comorbidity, site of surgery, Charlson Comorbidity Index and Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health II score between groups (<italic>P &#x0003e;</italic>0.05). Regarding the intention to treat analysis, there were no differences between groups in reintubation rate (PSV 10% vs. T 14.6%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.109), pneumonia after extubation (PSV 14.2% vs. T 11.9%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.435) and hospital mortality rate (PSV 3.1% vs. T 3.5%; <italic>P </italic>= 0.805).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The outcomes after discontinuation of the mechanical ventilator between low pressure support and T-piece was not difference in term of reintubation, pneumonia after extubation and hospital mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Chittawatanarat</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Thongchai</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><article-title>Spontaneous breathing trial with low pressure support protocol for weaning respirator in surgical ICU</article-title><source>J Med Assoc Thai</source><year>2009</year><issue>92</issue><fpage>1306</fpage><lpage>12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19845238</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><name><surname>Esteban</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Alia</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordo</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Extubation outcome after spontaneous breathing trials with T-tube or pressure support ventilation.
