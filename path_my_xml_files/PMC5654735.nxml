Despite recommendations, most diabetic patients fail to perform regular physical activity [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A major objective of the caring medical team is to find better methods to encourage and incentivize physical activity in these patients.</p><p>Apart from the obvious aim of improving persuasiveness in the communication between the patient and the health care providers on the issue of exercise [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there have been attempts to explore alternative approaches to improve adherence to physical activity in diabetic patients, including financial incentives [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and community programs [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The smartphone revolution has brought entirely new opportunities for communicating with patients on a continuous basis and measuring movement, as well as other parameters, longitudinally.</p><p>A very large proportion (30%-70%) of the population in developed and developing countries owns a smartphone [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the last decade, there have been multiple studies of mobile phone interventions using short message service (SMS) messages to improve health-related behaviors (reviewed in De Jongh et al [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), and there are several previous studies that have tried to assess the effect of mobile phone apps in encouraging physical activity (reviewed in Bort-Roig et al [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). These studies use random messages or a display that quantifies the amount of activity performed. None of these studies used a personalized learning algorithm to tailor messages to individuals. For example, two small-scale studies targeted patients with type 2 diabetes and took advantage of the ability of the patients&#x02019; smartphone to recognize physical activity patterns [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but the feedback was either the count of the number of steps walked, with no encouragement message, or a feedback provided by the nurse that cannot be scaled to a wide audience.</p><p>The impact of wearable activity monitors (such as Fitbit, Apple iWatch, and Microsoft Band) on encouraging exercise has not been assessed yet in an academic research setting.</p><p>The novel means of persistent communication afforded by smartphones, coupled with the ability to provide reinforcement to patients, as well as the almost immediate means to quantify its effect, has a potential to improve patient care on a wide scale, but the use of personalized SMS messages that take into account the actual quantified behavior that needs to be reinforced has not been reported yet.</p><p>Machine learning algorithms aim to discover a pattern, usually from previously-collected data. Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], in contrast, are algorithms that learn by observing the result of an action taken by them and so can be applied in settings where data are scarce or varying. RL algorithms have been successfully applied in areas ranging from computer games [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to health [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the latter, Paredes et al [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] used RL to select interventions to assist mildly depressed individuals, showing that RL-selected interventions were more effective than those selected using other strategies. Adaptive experimental design [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] has been used to speed clinical trials and optimize treatment in a hospital setting [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The idea of highly personalized interventions for medical research has been suggested in the past, mostly to evaluate individual interventions without temporal correlations. Nahum-Shani et al [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] proposed using just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), which &#x0201c;adapt over time to an individual&#x02019;s time-varying status, with the goal to address the individual&#x02019;s changing needs for support.&#x0201d; Whereas JITAIs were usually described in terms of predefined rules [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], Klasnja et al [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] suggested to implement them through microrandomized trials, where randomized interventions could be used to estimate the causal effect of interventions in JITAIs. In all these cases, interventions are commonly envisioned as a way to evaluate the effectiveness of single interventions. Here, we focus on learning a policy that will maximize physical activity when each person receives multiple interventions over time.</p><p>RL is frequently applied through algorithms, which assume that the states of the system and its environment can be deduced, such as Q-learning [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or the ones that can also operate in a stateless environment such as temporal difference (TD, lambda) [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Both these algorithms can deal with discounted rewards in a principled manner. However, implementing these algorithms requires further assumptions (which can also be learned from the data) on the behavior of people, including, for example, the discount factor. In our implementation, described below, we chose a method which makes minimal assumptions on people&#x02019;s behavior and the change in them over time. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of automatically tailored, personalized feedback in increasing the adherence of diabetic patients to a personal physical activity regimen recommended by their diabetes specialist. We used a smartphone app that measured physical activity (especially walking) and sent feedback, in the form of SMS messages, to users. A learning algorithm, trained using the RL framework, was used to predict the message most likely to increase activity on the following day. The primary outcome of this study was persistent improvement in physical activity. The secondary outcome was improved glycemic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>We developed a mobile phone app that runs in the background of patients&#x02019; smartphones and collects the amount of physical activity performed by patients. These data were transmitted to a central server.</p><p>Each morning an RL algorithm assessed, for each patient, which SMS message would likely increase the physical activity of the patient in the upcoming day, and that message was sent to the patient. Users were represented to the RL algorithm by their demographics, past activity, expected activity, and message history.</p><p>The effectiveness of each message was assessed the following morning by calculating the amount of activity the patient performed since the last message was sent to him or her, and this signal served as the reward for training the RL algorithm.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>Adult patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited for a 26-week-long study from the endocrinology and diabetes outpatient clinic at a tertiary hospital. Inclusion criteria were nonoptimal glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c] over 6.5%), a sedentary lifestyle with no dedicated physical activity up to the recruitment to the study, and ownership of an Android-based smartphone with a data connection (Wi-Fi at home or cellular data). Exclusion criteria were other types of diabetes and any disability that precludes walking for 20 min. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Rambam Health Care Campus. All patients gave written informed consent. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, registration number NCT02612402.</p><p>Note that HbA1c is the common measure for control of blood glucose level in people with diabetes. It refers to the levels of glycated hemoglobin, a form of hemoglobin that is measured to identify the average plasma glucose concentration.</p><p>At recruitment, all participants received information on the importance of physical activity and a personal prescription for an activity plan, including the number of sessions of activity per week and time span for each per session (ie, at least 2 hours of walking per week divided to 3 walking sessions per week). The target physical activity level was decided by the physician and the patient, taking into account the physical condition of the patient, medical disabilities, and significant schedule limitations.</p><p>A dedicated smartphone app was installed on the participant&#x02019;s mobile phone. This app used the phone accelerometer to sense when participants were performing physical activity (defined as walking or running for 10 min or longer) and transmitted this information once every 2.5 hours to a central server. The app was verified for its ability to measure walking when the mobile phone was on the participant&#x02019;s body, as well as in a bag or purse. Feedback was provided to patients through SMS messages.</p><p>To preserve battery life, the smartphone app sampled the accelerometer once every 3.5 min, and if walking was detected, kept monitoring the accelerometer until no walking was detected. Only contiguous walks of 10 min or more were collected, as shorter walks have a small effect on improvement in clinical outcomes. Patients were told at recruitment that only walks 10 min or longer will be counted and were asked to carry their cellphone during such walks.</p><p>Intensification of dietary or medical treatment was not restricted when this was considered appropriate by the medical team. The HbA1c measurements were performed by standard procedures before recruitment and every 3 months in the health maintenance organization lab of each subject. The patients filled a Quality of Life Questionnaire [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] before and after 6 months of participation in the study. They also filled a short questionnaire assessing satisfaction of the experience of using the app.</p></sec><sec><title>Types of Feedback Messages</title><p>Patients were randomized into a control arm and a personalized arm. The medical team was blinded to the type of messages each subject received. The control arm received identical unchanging once-weekly reminders to exercise. Patients in the personalized arm received daily feedback messages and weekly summaries.</p><p>We note that there are differences in both frequency and content between the messages for the control and treatment arms. For this reason, as will be explained below, two policies were used for the treatment arms, and these are further compared.</p><p>Following Elliot and Church [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we sought to have three types of messages: mastery, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance, as well as a no-message condition. The daily feedback messages could be one of the following four messages (in parenthesis, the nomenclature of [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]):</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Negative feedback: &#x0201c;You need to exercise to reach your activity goals. Please remember to exercise tomorrow&#x0201d; (Performance avoidance).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Positive feedback relative to self (referred herein as positive-self): &#x0201c;You have so far achieved N% of your weekly activity goal. Your exercise level is in accordance with your plan. Keep up the good work&#x0201d; (Mastery).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Positive feedback relative to others (referred herein as positive-social): &#x0201c;You have so far achieved N% of your weekly activity goal. You are exercising more than the average person in your group. Keep up the good work&#x0201d; (Performance approach).</p></list-item><list-item><p>No message</p></list-item></list><p>The percentage of the weekly goal (&#x0201c;N%&#x0201d;) was given as an integer greater than or equal to zero, computed according to the length of activity so far, compared with the length of activity expected given the exercise plan of the individual.</p><p>In general, messages did not necessarily reflect reality. For example, patients were not divided into groups, as is implied in the positive-social message. Similarly, a negative message might be sent even though the patient has already achieved their activity goal. However, to allow the algorithm to learn a policy, we did not set constraints on the possible messages to be sent.</p><p>On most weeks, the weekly summary message was as follows: &#x0201c;Please remember to exercise this week to reach your activity goals.&#x0201d; When patients reached a significant exercise achievement (as described below), and not more than once per 3 weeks, they could receive one of the following messages:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Maximal increase: Over the past week you increased your activity more than at any previous week.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Significant increase: Over the past week you increased your activity more than most previous weeks.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximal social: You won the first place! Last week you increased your activity more than any other participant in the experiment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Significant social: Last week you increased your activity more than most participants of the experiment.</p></list-item></list><p>SMS messages were not sent to participants whose data were not received 12 hours or more before the current time to reduce the chance that the system would send a message based on incorrect data.</p></sec><sec><title>Feedback Message Policies</title><p>After an initial period of 3 months where feedback was sent according to a predetermined policy detailed below (&#x0201c;initial policy&#x0201d;), the decision on which daily feedback message to send was decided by a learning algorithm (&#x0201c;learned policy&#x0201d;). To allow the algorithm to collect information of outcomes to less likely feedback policies, exploration [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] was used for messages that were deemed less likely to succeed such that they were sent with significant probabilities, as detailed below. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> shows an outline of the two feedback policies.</p><p>The initial algorithm (herewith referred to as &#x0201c;Initial policy&#x0201d;) was set so that no message was sent on 20% of days. For the remaining days, we drew a uniform random number between 0 and 1. If that number was larger than the expected fraction of weekly activity on that day, the user would receive the negative feedback message. Otherwise, they would receive one of the positive messages, with equal probability. This policy was based on the results of Elliot and Church [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] but also provided sufficient randomness for exploration.</p><p>After a sufficient number of instances were collected, we implemented a learned decision mechanism for deciding on the feedback message. This mechanism received, for each user, the following set of attributes:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Activity attributes:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Number of minutes of activity in the last day.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cumulative number of minutes of activity this week.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fraction of activity goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fraction versus expected at this point in the week.</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Demographics:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Age</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gender</p></list-item></list></list-item><list-item><p>Feedback attributes: Number of days since each feedback message was sent.</p></list-item></list><p>The attributes allowed the algorithm to model each person on each day through several aspects relevant to their behavior, including past activity (through the activity attributes), their demographics, and past interactions with the system (via the feedback attributes). The latter were added so that repeated messages could be used or avoided, if necessary, as determined by the learning algorithm.</p><p>Let x<sub>i,t</sub> denote a vector of the attributes above, for person i at time t, and let y<sub>i,t</sub> denote the change in activity from day t to day t+1, that is, the number of minutes of activity on day t+1 divided by those on day t. Following the Kesler construction [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], we augment x<sub>i,t</sub> with an action vector A such that the j-th element of A is equal to 1 if and only if message j was sent on day t.</p><p>The training data consisted of all previously collected x<sub>i,t</sub> and y<sub>i,t</sub> pairs. We trained a learning algorithm, specifically a linear regression algorithm with interactions, to predict y<sub>i,t</sub> from x<sub>i,t.</sub></p><p>The learning algorithm was rerun every day, and the most up-to-date model was used for prediction.</p><p>To predict the most appropriate action on day &#x003c1;, we applied the model to each x<sub>i,&#x003c1;</sub> and computed the resulting predicted y<sub>i,&#x003c1;</sub>. We then performed Bolzmann sampling [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] with T<sub>Boltzmann</sub>=5 on the outputs of the learning algorithm to choose the feedback message to be given. Thus, actions were chosen relative to their predicted effectiveness. This was done so that actions predicted not to be the best ones would still be tested, in addition to exploiting those actions predicted to be the best ones for the user. T<sub>Boltzmann</sub> was set based on the initial policy data so that each of the four messages was sent with a probability higher than 10%. We did not adjust this parameter during the experiment.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The two message policies.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v19i10e338_fig1"/></fig><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Patient characteristics.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="660" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="210" span="1"/><col width="210" span="1"/><col width="210" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 female</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 female</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age in years, mean (SD<sup>a</sup>)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.7 (2.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">55.1 (3.6)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial HbA1c<sup>b</sup> (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.7</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table1fn1"><p><sup>a</sup>SD: standard deviation.</p></fn><fn id="table1fn2"><p><sup>b</sup>HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>There are many algorithms for addressing reinforcement learning problems. Most algorithms (Q-learning, TD learning, etc) rely on either having access to the true underlying state, or to high-quality features that represent the dynamics well. In our approach, we mostly tried to predict the effect of different actions on the immediate activity level given the current state of the patient rather than trying to change the patient&#x02019;s state. Thus, our policy is more of a &#x0201c;contextual bandit&#x0201d; type of algorithm [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

Interrupted transmission was mostly because of the change of the mobile phone or phone number during the study. Analysis was done on all participants who successfully initiated app use, including the participants who did not complete the 26 weeks of the experiment. Thus, dropout was relatively late in the experiment.</p><p>All patients reported that they did not perform regular physical activity before recruitment, but there is naturally no objective accelerometer data for the amount of activity performed before recruitment. We decided that we could not separate the timing of providing the physical activity prescription from the recruitment process without causing any data collected in the first few weeks after recruitment to be biased.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Different Messages Over Time</title><p>We explored how each of the messages separately and how each two consecutive messages affected the change in the amount of activity and found significant differences in the reaction of participants to different messages and message sequences.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref> shows the average improvement in activity (y<sub>i,t</sub>) for each of the four messages and the feedback effectiveness, which is the improvement in activity, weighted by the probability of each feedback message. The best increase in activity was found on the day after a positive-social message, whereas negative messages and positive-self messages led to a decrease in the amount of activity. This is congruent with experiments conducted by Elliot and Church [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The differences in the change of activity between the initial policy and the learned policy were statistically significant (analysis of variance, ANOVA; <italic>P</italic>=.004).</p><p>One of the attributes given as inputs to the learned policy was the time since each feedback message was sent. This provides a limited form of historical context to the policy, allowing feedback to be dependent between days. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure3">Figure 3</xref> shows the average improvement in activity for feedback on day N, given the feedback on the previous day (N-1). We note that this figure is based on pairs of messages chosen by the algorithm and not random selection.</p><p>As the figure shows, for example, even though on average negative feedback produces a negative change in activity, negative feedback is correlated with a positive change in activity if given before a positive-self feedback. Similarly, positive-social feedback repeated day after day is correlated with a lower change in activity.</p><p>Differences in activity were statistically significant (ANOVA; <italic>P</italic>=.059 for the previous action and <italic>P</italic>=.02 for the current action, and <italic>P</italic>=.02 for the interaction of the two actions). Thus, time-dependent feedback is correlated with higher average change in activity.</p><p><bold>Variability in Patient Response</bold></p><p>The average improvement in activity varies among patients. To demonstrate this, we represented each user according to the average change in their activity following each daily feedback message (ie, a four-dimensional vector). We limit this analysis to 22 users in the treatment arm who received at least two different messages.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref> shows the results of clustering users using k-means with 3 clusters. As the figure demonstrates, one group of patients (cluster 1) reacted negatively to any feedback message. In contrast, patients in cluster 3 reacted positively to messages, especially positive-social or positive-self. This demonstrates the importance of individually tailored feedback delivered by our algorithm.</p><p>Users in the different clusters differed in their demographics. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref> shows the percentage of females and the average age of patients in each cluster. As the Table shows, cluster 3, where patients reacted positively to messages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure4">Figure 4</xref>), is dominated by males. In contrast, cluster 2, where reactions to messages were overall weaker, comprises mostly women. Age variations are minor across clusters. Indeed, an ANOVA model with age and gender as independent parameters shows that age is not statistically significantly correlated with change in activity, whereas gender is (<italic>F</italic>=9.65, <italic>P</italic>=.002). Thus, there are significant correlates between patient gender and reaction to messages, demonstrating the importance of tailoring feedback according to these parameters and therefore providing them to the decision algorithm.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demographics of patients by cluster.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="623" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="141" span="1"/><col width="142" span="1"/><col width="142" span="1"/><col width="141" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographic</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cluster 1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cluster 2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cluster 3</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (%)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">50 (2/4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">67 (6/9)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (1/5)</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Average age, in years</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">57</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">54</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">56</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Change in activity following feedback messages for the two feedback policies.

These jumps seem to correspond to major adverse weather events and may be caused by new ways in which people behave because of these events, creating unexpected data that cause the algorithm to learn a new hypothesis.

Here, we developed a system that takes advantage of the continuous monitoring and communication afforded by smartphones to explore an alternative approach for improving adherence. In this pilot study, we evaluated the effect of feedback messages provided to patients directly by a mobile phone based on their success in obtaining physical activity goals, as measured by a computerized mobile app. This requires careful integration of hardware, software, and human guidance.</p><p>Our system used reinforcement learning to learn the feedback that will be most effective for each individual in any given situation, thus creating a highly personalized reminder service. Our results, as evident in the clusters of reactions to different feedback and the effect of message sequences, show the importance of tailoring messages to each individual and at each time.</p><p>We found that constant unvarying weekly reminders to perform physical activity are not effective in increasing activity and that patients were not satisfied with receiving them. On the other hand, changing the messages based on the activity performed as determined by the learning algorithm was effective in increasing both the length of time walked and the rate of walking. Indeed, the RL algorithm learned to sequence messages to improve efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>In our approach, we learned a single model rather than a plurality of models. We ignored pertinent issues such as the sex and age of the user. It stands to reason that building multiple models from data (eg, one for women and one for men) could yield better results. Such an approach would require a larger population and would probably call for a different type of algorithm that takes into account contextual parameters as well to lead to much better performance [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Our approach is fairly unique in that we conducted training within an experiment. In RL terminology, this is called on-policy learning. In many treatments, one must follow an off-policy scheme: collect data using one policy (usually a historical policy) and try to learn a new policy without actually executing it. This leads to several problems such as large variance and bias, as exploration cannot be done where it matters most [<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In our setting, this was not the case, and we had the luxury of training and using the same policy.</p><p>Patients were satisfied with the experience of using the app when they received personalized messages generated by the algorithm. The length of participation and allocation to the learned policy group for which the learning algorithm was used were correlated with superior improvement in HbA1c over competing policies, namely, weekly reminders and policies that do not take into account the specific context and attributes of each user.</p><p>Our results suggest that this novel concept for increasing physical activity can be implemented economically, efficiently, and effectively, leading to desired highly positive results. Notice that our approach not only allows for a predictive tool (going beyond current messaging systems) but also provides a method for personalized care.</p><p>The use of mobile phones as measurement tools is advantageous in that it does not require patients to maintain a separate device to participate in the experiment. It also has drawbacks in that measurements may be less accurate than those of dedicated devices and that patients may sometimes forget to carry them during exercise, leading to an underestimate of their exercise levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This small-scale study demonstrates the general concept that continuous monitoring and personalized guidance generated by a computer can have a significant impact on patient behavior. Unlike many current e-medicine systems that require input from the patient or the health care provider, the use of an automatic algorithm can be applied to very large groups of subjects. We plan to expand our result to the even more general concept that digitally generated health coaching of humans can have a positive impact. Further studies at larger scale and for longer periods are needed to evaluate whether the digital revolution and the potential to directly communicate with large groups of subjects and to assess the actual behavior reinforced can lead to a major improvement in their health-related behaviors or in their actual health.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>Conflicts
