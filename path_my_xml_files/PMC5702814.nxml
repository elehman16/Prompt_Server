robot assisting technology. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
exercise with the RKO (RKO-exercise) in stroke patients with hemiplegia. [Subjects and
Methods] Participants were nine stroke patients with hemiplegia, residing in a
convalescent rehabilitation ward. The duration of the RKO-exercise program was 10 days.
Participants were evaluated three times prior to intervention, once after intervention,
and one month post intervention. Each session consisted of standard-of-care physical
therapy for 60 minutes and RKO-exercise for 20 minutes. Dependent variables were 10-meter
gait speed, cadence, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) score, stride length, the absolute value of
left-right symmetry of the step length, and one-leg support period while walking. Data
were analyzed using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA. [Results] Stride length, left-right
symmetry of the step length, and one-leg support period while walking changed following
the RKO exercise program. 10-meter walking speed, cadence, percentage of one-leg support
period (affected side), and BBS changed significantly at one month post treatment time
points. [Conclusion] It is expected that RKO-exercise helps recovery process after the
stroke. RKO-exercise effectively treats impaired mobility in patient status-post
stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Robotics Knee Orthosis (RKO)</kwd><kwd>Hemiplegia</kwd><kwd>Enhancement of recovery process</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a common, serious, and disabling global health-care issue<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Rehabilitation treatments following stroke seek to improve
patients&#x02019; independence. Neuroplastic mechanisms underlie functional improvements after
stroke<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. An effective use of brain
neuroplasticity is essential for promoting functional recovery in these patients.</p><p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines neuro-rehabilitation as &#x0201c;a problem-solving
process in which the person who experiences a neurological impairment or loss of function
acquires the knowledge, skills, and supports needed for their optimal physical,
psychological, social, and economic functioning<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.&#x0201d; Recent advances in robotic technology have made inroads to
rehabilitation, in particular neurorehabilitation. Lower extremity robotic exoskeletal
devices include the Lokomat, LOPES Exoskeleton Robot, Hybrid Assistive Limb (HAL) and WPAL
augment high-dose intensive training and facilitate the repetitive practice of specific
functional tasks<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. These factors are important
for recovery after stroke.</p><p>Bionic-Leg (Alter-G, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is a portable, wearable, battery-powered
knee-ankle-foot orthosis with active robot assisting technology (also referred to as the
Robotics Knee Orthosis or RKO), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The bionic-leg (Alter-G, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1920-g001"/></fig>. This training orthosis supports knee mobility when standing or walking. The RKO
receives pressure-related information from a plantar sensor and angle-change information
from a knee sensor.</p><p>The time that wear the RKO is about 5 minutes. The level of assistance is able to be varied
according to the patient&#x02019;s ability level.</p><p>Past reports indicate that exercise with the RKO (RKO-exercise) improves balance and
walking ability in patients with chronic stroke symptoms<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. And the recent study
examined the effects of RKO-assisted exercise for five patients with chronic stroke
symptoms, using an ABA-type single case study design. Phase A of the ABA design was standard
exercise and Phase B consisted of RKO-exercise. All patients underwent 30 days of treatment,
involving 10 days of standard exercise, 10 days RKO-exercise, and another 10 days standard
exercise. The dependent variables of interest included the Berg Balance Scale score, stride
length, step length, the duration of one-leg support time, and the 10-meter gait time
improved during Phase B<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This investigation had major limitations in that it was a single case study design with no
statistical analyses. This study sought to quantify the effects of RKO-exercise via

exhibited serious hypertension on walking, circulatory disease, respiratory disease, or
extreme weakness. All participants received physical clearance to participate; those who did
not were excluded.</p><p>A researcher explained the purpose of the study to all participants, and each participant
provided written informed consent. Research approval was granted by the Ethics Committee of
Teikyo Heisei University (No 27-83) and the Tokusyuukai Group (TGE00581-017). </p><p>RKO-exercise were administered over 10 days. Dependent variables were sampled three times:
prior to RKO-exercise treatment, after RKO-exercise treatment, and one month post
RKO-exercise treatment. The intervention consisted of 60 minutes of standard-of-care
physical therapy, followed by 20 minutes of RKO-exercise. Only standard-of-care physical
therapy was offered during the post intervention and one month post intervention
periods.</p><p>Standard-of-care physical therapy exercises targeted range of motion, neurovascular
function, balance, basic movements, and activities of daily living. Therapists administering
RKO-exercise were trained by Alter-G trained physical therapists. RKO-exercise included
sit-to-stand, paralytic lower extremity weight bearing, and walking. Sit-to-stand exercises
included squatting in addition to repeated stand-sit. Paralytic lower extremity
weight-bearing exercises consisted of weight shifting and one-leg standing. Walking tasks
were identical to those carried out during standard-of-care physical therapy. Participants
used ortop AFOs made by Pacific Supply. It is short type of plastic AFO and used for slight
drop foot. Because RKO offers no assistance during dorsal ankle flexion. In all sessions,
the therapist encouraged participants to consciously monitor right and left symmetry with a
mirror. The therapist offered minimal assistance and patients independently practiced all
tasks, except for when new tasks were introduced.</p><p>The RKO has three adjustable component settings: threshold (the lower limit of force that
must be generated to initiate device assistance), assistance (the percentage of body weight
assistance provided during limb extension), and resistance (resistance to flexion during
stair descent or stand-to-sit transfer motion). The RKO also has three global settings.
Min=assistance of 30%, low resistance, and threshold of 35%. Mod=Assistance of 45%, medium
resistance, and threshold of 25%. Max=assistance of 65%, high resistance, and threshold of
15%. All participants in the study were set to Mod owing to the sitting ability and degree
of hemiplegia and sensory dysfunction.</p><p>The variables of interest included 10-meter walking speed (normal speed), cadence, stride
length, step length (affected side and unaffected side), the left&#x02013;right symmetry of the step
length (1-affected side/unaffected side)<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, the percentage of one-leg support period during the walking cycle

Balance Scale (BBS).</p><p>Participants were instructed to walk in a straight line, at a comfortable speed, for 16
minutes. There were 3 meter runways at the start and end of a 10 meter test walkway, and
patients used their usual walking aids and ankle&#x02013;foot orthoses.</p><p>The video camera HC-WXF990&#x02005;M (Panasonic, Japan) was fixed to a 50-cm tripod and set five
meters from the walking line to fully capture the participants while they were walking.
Video images were analyzed by Dartfish Software (Dartfish Japan Co. Ltd.), and each variable
was averaged over five repetitions of the walking cycle.</p><p>During statistical analysis, the before treatment, after treatment, and one month post
treatment time points were made autonomous variables. We performed one-way repeated measures
ANOVA using SPSS 14 OJ for Windows. The level of significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Results are presented in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Result of evaluation items</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Evaluation items</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prior to RKO-exercise treatment</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After RKO-exercise treatment</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">One month post RKO-exercise treatment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gait speed (m/min)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.8 &#x000b1; 10.6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.7 &#x000b1; 16.6<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.5 &#x000b1; 22.8<sup>a,b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cadence (steps/min)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.3 &#x000b1; 23.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.9 &#x000b1; 24.8</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65.9 &#x000b1; 30.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stride length (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.1 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.2 &#x000b1; 10.4<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">76.8 &#x000b1; 29.1<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step length affected side (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 &#x000b1; 5.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.5 &#x000b1; 6.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.2 &#x000b1; 9.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Step length unaffected side (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 &#x000b1; 8.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.3 &#x000b1; 12.2<sup>a</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.7 &#x000b1; 26.1<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The left&#x02013;right symmetry of the step length [1-affected side

status-post stroke. Walking and balance significantly improved after treatment and one month
post treatment, compared to before treatment. The participants of this study were
status-post stroke and residing in a convalescence ward. It is general that they recover if
they receive rehabilitation. The characteristic point of this study is that there were
significant improvements in stride length, step length (unaffected side), the absolute value
of left&#x02013;right symmetry of the step length, and the absolute value of left&#x02013;right symmetry of
the percentage of one-leg support period during walking, 10 days after RKO-exercise
treatment.</p><p>RKO-exercise treatment involved sit-to-stand, paralytic lower extremity weight bearing, and
walking. Participants were instructed to attend to left&#x02013;right symmetry and repeatedly
practice each task.</p><p>As a result, the speed of weight shifting to the paralytic lower extremity improved, as did
the left&#x02013;right symmetry of the one-leg support period during the walking cycle. Although
these improvements did not directly correspond with weight-bearing capacity of the paralytic
lower extremity, it appears to be an indirect factor. Increases in step length (of the
unaffected side) and stride length were suggested by improving weight-bearing capacity of
the paralytic lower extremity.</p><p>RKO-exercise decreased the necessary level of assistance provided by therapists, compared
with standard physical therapy, and enabled the RKO users to increase knee-joint mobility
with assistance from the RKO. Movement repetitions with mirror-based visual feedback may
improve the efficiency of motor learning.</p><p>These results could be realized as a result of recovery process after the stroke as well as
the effects of the RKO-exercise. The recovery process after stroke is classified into three
stage. In the acute stage, motor recovery depends on residual corticospinal tract
excitability from onset to 3 months (1st stage recovery). In the next stage, alternative
output systems are used according to intracortical excitability depending on intracortical
disinhibition at the peak of 3 months (2nd stage recovery). At 6 months and beyond
training-induced synaptic strengthening becomes better established, and new networks are
better reorganized (3rd stage recovery)<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.The large recovery of function after the stroke is by 3 month from
onset (1st stage recovery)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. And the
time of the recovery in the 1st stage recovery is different by a person. Participants of
this research were onset from 1 month and half to 3 months. Therefore, the large recovery of
this result might occur accidentally during the intervention term of RKO-exercise.</p><p>These results also could be realized as a result of increased exercise time as well as the
effects of the RKO-exercise. The time of intervention term of RKO-exercise was longer than
the term of the standard physical therapy. The quantity and frequency of exercise will be an
important factor in acquisition of the athletic skill<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, even the standard physical therapy might be the same
result if the exercise time was extended.</p><p>Although this was an investigation of the effects of RKO-exercise, it is also possible that
standard-of-care physical therapy produced similar improvements. This is a limitation of
this research. Future, well-powered investigations should include treatment and no-treatment
cohorts. RKO therapy requires additional research. Questions remain as to the effects of
RKO-exercise on other functional modalities, the ideal duration of treatment period, the
ideal frequency of treatment, when to begin RKO-exercise treatment, and treatments&#x02019; effects
under various assistance settings. RKO is a promising new technology for delivering
rehabilitation to patients following stroke.</p><p>This project affirmed the ability of RKO-exercise to improve walking and balance
abilities.</p><p>RKO-exercise effectively treats impaired mobility in patient status-post stroke. RKO has
possibility as one of aids in rehabilitation treatment.</p><p>Future, this research need randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of the
standard therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All authors contributed equally in the preparation of this manuscript. This work was
