It has two functions; mu-opioid receptors agonism, as well as, serotonergic activities. It has shown that tramadol overdose may induce serotonin syndrome (SS). This study evaluates whether early treatment with chlordiazepoxide could prevent SS in admitted tramadol overdoses.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>In this single blind randomized control trial, 50% of admitted tramadol overdoses in Imam Reza (p) Hospital from 21 September 2011 to 21 January 2012 were recruited. Cases received chlordiazepoxide and controls received placebo. Clinical findings were recorded in a pre-designed spread sheet every 6 hours in the first 24 hours of admission. SS was determined by two independent methods; Hunter Criteria (HC) and Radomski Criteria (RC).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>In total, five patients developed SS when HC or RC was taken into account. Among them, four cases were shared. None of the SS cases diagnosed with HC received chlordiazepoxide. However, just one SS case diagnosed with RC was from the case group. Based on HC, chlordiazepoxide decreased the Risk Ratio (CI 95%) of SS to 0.80 (0.66-0.97) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.025).

This center is a 41-bed Toxicology Ward which receives around 12,000 referrals each year. Mashhad is the second major city of Iran with a population of approximately 3,000,000.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligible patients were aged between 15 and 60 years and were referred for tramadol overdose. Exclusion criteria included mixed overdoses and history of epilepsy.</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the regional Ethics Committee, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (2011-6710). An informed consent form was completed on arrival by one of the adult companions of each patient and was repeated retrospectively by the patient 24 hours after admission. Process of clinical evaluation and data gathering did not influence patient's medical treatment.</p><p>A previously used questionnaire[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] was modified to document demographics (number and strength of tramadol tablets, age, gender, history of addiction, and type of addiction) and clinical findings (vital signs and size of pupils). Observations were recorded in this sheet every 6 hours during the first 24 hours after admission.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Serotonin Syndrome (SS) was determined by two independent methods. SS was diagnosed via Hunter Criteria (HC),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] if one of the following events happened: (1) Spontaneous clonus; (2) Inducible clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis; (3) Ocular clonus plus agitation or diaphoresis; (4) Tremor and hyperreflexia; (5) Hypertonia; (6) Temperature above 38&#x000b0;C plus ocular clonus or inducible clonus.</p><p>SS was also diagnosed via Radomski Criteria (RC),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] if at least four major or three major plus two minor variables (listed below) developed. Major criteria include (a) mental findings (consciousness impairment, elevated mood, and semicoma/coma); (b) neurological symptoms (myoclonus, tremor, shivering, rigidity, and hyper-reflexia); (c) vegetative symptoms (fever and sweating). Minor criteria include (a) mental findings (restlessness and insomnia); (b) neurological symptoms (incoordination, dilated pupils, and akathisia); (c) vegetative symptoms (tachycardia, tachy/dyspnea, diarrhoea, and hyper/hypotension). The SS diagnosis via RC was withdrawn if (1) clinical features described in the first criterion were an integral part of the underlying psychiatric disorder prior to commencing the serotonergic agent; (2) Other aetiologies (e.g., infectious, metabolic or endocrine, substance abuse or withdrawal) had not been ruled out; (3) A neuroleptic drug had been started or increased in dosage prior to the onset of the signs and symptoms listed above.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization</title><p>After assessing for eligibility criteria and to avoid selection bias, patients were consecutively recruited and randomly divided into two single blind groups.

The first case was selected by chance. The random allocation sequence was generated by moving to the next number from the random-number table. In the case group, chlordiazepoxide (10 mg every 8 hours) (<italic>n</italic> = 25) and in the control group placebo tablets were administered every 8 hours (<italic>n</italic> = 25).

Older opioid addicts are probably less familiar with Tramadol as it has been popularized in recent years. In addition, tramadol could be used to treat premature ejaculation, which is more common in younger cases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Frequency of mid-sized pupils was also similar to our previous experience.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>Frequency of SS in the current study was relatively higher in comparison with previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Tramadol induced SS was treated with cyproheptadine, as well as, fluids within 24 hours, which is similar to previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Cyproheptadine efficacy could be related to its inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 2a (5HT2a). 5HT is one of serotonin receptor families (5-HT<sub>1</sub> to 5-HT7) and 5-HT2A receptor is a subtype of it.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The efficacy of external cooling, supportive therapies, chlordiazepoxide, and cyproheptadine has been shown in many other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p><p>It has been previously shown that benzodiazepines may be used to treat agitation and tremor in SS.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] This study demonstrated that chlordiazepoxide can decrease the risk of SS based on HC. In addition, it decreased the frequency of spontaneous clonus and diaphoresis, which was probably the reason for no SS occurrences among the case group. Unlike previous findings,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] agitation and tremor in these subjects were not controlled with chlordiazepoxide.</p><p>Although spontaneous clonus and diaphoresis decreased in cases, the frequency of SS diagnosed by RC was not affected. This could be related to the method of measurement of the Radomski scale, in which at least 3 major criteria should be observed. Based on these data, HC is more sensitive when intervention is taken into account, which is consistent with previous reports.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>Radomski and colleagues revised Sternbach Criteria and developed RC to diagnose SS in 2000.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In later stages, a new set of decision rules, &#x0201c;the Hunter Serotonin Toxicity Criteria&#x0201d;, was developed. It is suggested that HC are simpler, more sensitive, and more specific than Sternbach's criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Evaluating SS with these two methods in the current research (HC and RC) will also provide evidence for future validation of these criteria.</p><p>This study confirms the previous hypothesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] that chlordiazepoxide could be effective in prevention of tramadol overdose induced SS.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitation</title><p>The number of cases diagnosed with SS were limited (<italic>n</italic> = 5). This research could be under-powered to detect potential impacts of chlordiazepoxide when SS is evaluated via RC.
