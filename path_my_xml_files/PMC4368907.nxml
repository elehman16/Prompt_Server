However, neurobehavioural impairments have not decreased, imposing an increasing burden on health and education systems. There remains an inverse relationship between cognitive functioning and gestational age, with the most preterm survivors being most affected by poor cognitive functioning.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6 n-3) is a major lipid in the brain and is known to be involved in neurogenesis and neurite growth.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Infants born very preterm are deprived of the placental supply of DHA that occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy and have lower brain concentrations of DHA than term-born infants,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> possibly contributing to their high risk of developmental delay. The only trials where the dose of DHA has matched the estimated in utero accretion rate of DHA (&#x02248;45&#x02005;mg/kg/day)<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and was inclusive of breast milk feeding have shown some short-term benefit of DHA supplementation.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> The DHA for the Improvement of Neurodevelopmental Outcome in preterm infants (DINO) trial is the largest published trial of DHA supplementation in very preterm infants.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The DINO trial showed that although mean cognitive development at 18&#x02005;months&#x02019; corrected age (CA) was not altered overall, the proportion of infants with severe developmental delay was significantly reduced. In prespecified subgroup analyses, the greatest effect was seen in girls and there was a strong suggestion of benefit in the smallest infants.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Assessing neurodevelopment within the first 2&#x02005;years of life remains a cornerstone of preterm infant follow-up ensuring early detection of problems and initiation of appropriate support services. However, developmental outcomes measured in the first 2&#x02005;years may not accurately predict a longer term developmental outcome.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Related to this, some cognitive domains that are hypothesised to be influenced by DHA, such as executive function and memory, are difficult to reliably assess in early childhood. We therefore aimed to determine the effect of DHA given up to term equivalent to infants born less than 33&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation, on neurodevelopment at 7&#x02005;years&#x02019; CA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a follow-up at 7-years&#x02019; CA of infants who participated in the DINO randomised controlled trial.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Initial study&#x02014;the DINO trial</title><p>The DINO trial methods have been previously published.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Between 2001 and 2005, 657 infants born &#x0003c;33&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; gestation from five Australian tertiary hospitals were randomised, from within 5&#x02005;days of their first enteral feed, to receive a high-DHA or standard-DHA diet until 40&#x02005;weeks&#x02019; CA. Infants were excluded if they had a major congenital or chromosomal abnormality, were from a multiple birth in which not all live-born infants were eligible, were in other trials of fatty acid supplementation, or if fish oil was contraindicated in the lactating mother. Mother&#x02013;infant pairs were randomly assigned a unique study number using a computer-driven telephone randomisation service according to an independently generated randomisation schedule. Stratification was by centre, birth weight (&#x0003c;1250 and &#x02265;1250&#x02005;g) and infant sex. Multiple births were considered a single randomisation unit. Participants were enrolled and assigned to their study group by research nurses at each centre.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Dietary treatments</title><p>Lactating women with infants randomised to the high-DHA group took DHA-rich tuna oil capsules daily to achieve a breast milk DHA concentration &#x02248;1% of total fatty acids without altering the naturally occurring concentration of arachidonic acid. Infants requiring formula received a high-DHA preterm formula (&#x02248;1.0% DHA and &#x02248;0.6% AA). The high-DHA diet provided &#x02248;50&#x02005;mg/kg/day of DHA. Lactating women with infants randomised to standard-DHA took placebo soy oil capsules. Infants requiring formula received standard preterm infant formula (&#x02248;0.35% DHA). The standard-DHA diet provided &#x02248;20&#x02005;mg/kg/day of DHA. Postdischarge, women who were breast feeding were encouraged to continue, and those using formula were encouraged to use a commercially available term formula supplemented with DHA. Parents, clinicians and all research personnel were blinded to the participant study group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Present study&#x02014;follow-up at 7&#x02005;years&#x02019; CA</title><p>The parent or guardian of each participant provided written informed consent. A letter of invitation was sent to caregivers of eligible children followed by a telephone call. Of the 657 infants randomised to the DINO trial, 626 children were eligible to participate in the 7-year CA follow-up (ie, had not withdrawn from the study or died). Clinicians and researchers remained unaware of group allocations; the statistician was unblinded during the 18-month CA analysis of the DINO results. Twelve families (6 children in each group) requested to be unblinded after publication of the 18-month CA results. Assessments were administered by trained psychologists blinded to group allocation and the 18-month CA assessment results. Assessments were conducted at the participating perinatal centre; if this was unsuitable for the family, assessments were conducted elsewhere. The assessment, including short breaks, took 3&#x02005;h and was conducted within &#x000b1;3&#x02005;months of the 7-year CA date. In difficult to locate families, efforts to conduct an assessment continued beyond this age. The child's CA (chronological age reduced by the number of weeks born before 40&#x02005;weeks of gestation) was used to calculate age-standardised test scores, thus avoiding a known bias in cognitive scores which we have reported to be clinically important at all ages through childhood.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The primary outcome was general intellectual ability as assessed by the Full Scale IQ of the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI). The WASI consists of four subtests (Vocabulary, Similarities, Block Design and Matrix Reasoning) and provides a brief and reliable estimate of the child's intellectual functioning. These four subtests yield the Full Scale IQ which is age standardised with a mean of 100 (SD 15). In the event that children had a recent Full Scale IQ assessment using a different psychological test, the results from that test were used.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcomes included cognitive domains that have been previously demonstrated to be areas of concern for preterm children, as well as those domains thought to be sensitive to DHA depletion and included intellectual impairment, Verbal and Performance IQ, attention, memory and learning, executive functioning, behaviour, visual-spatial perceptual skills, educational progress and quality of life. Intellectual impairment, assessed using the WASI Full Scale IQ, was defined as mild (IQ &#x0003c;85) and major (IQ &#x0003c;70). Verbal and performance IQ scores were acquired from the WASI. Subtests of the Test of Everyday Attention for Children measured selective attention (Sky Search), sustained attention (Score!), shifting attention/attentional control (Creature Counting) and divided attention (Sky Search Dual Task).<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The score for Divided Attention was calculated by multiplying the proportion of visual stimuli found by the proportion of auditory stimuli counted, multiplied by 10 (with 10 signifying a perfect score).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Aspects of executive functioning were assessed with the Rey Complex Figure, the Fruit Stroop Test and the parent-completed Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Functioning (BRIEF).</p><p>Short-term verbal memory and learning were assessed with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test. Visual Perception was assessed with the Visual-Spatial Relations, Visual Figure-Ground and Visual Closure subtests of the Test of Visual Perceptual Skills, third edition. Educational progress was assessed with the Word Reading, Spelling, and Math Computation subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test fourth edition. Parents were also questioned on whether their child had repeated a year at school.</p><p>Child behaviour was assessed with two parent-completed questionnaires; the Conners 3rd Edition ADHD Index (Conners 3 AI-parent) which screens for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire which screens for emotional and behaviour problems. General health status and health-related quality of life were measured using parent-completed questionnaires: the Multi-attributed Health Status Classification System&#x02014;Health Utilities Index Mark 3 and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory.</p><p>Information on family functioning (Family Assessment Device), and recent family events (Recent Life Events Questionnaire) were collected through parent-completed questionnaires. General child health, home environment, DHA containing diet and supplement use were collected.</p><p>If the child was unable to complete an assessment due to severe developmental delay, they were assigned the lowest possible score. Outcome scores were recorded as missing if the child was uncooperative or they were untestable due to a motor or sensory impairment.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Sample size and statistical analysis</title><p>This follow-up study was designed in 2007 before the 18-month CA assessments had been completed. We anticipated a follow-up rate of at least 90% at 7&#x02005;years, that is, &#x0003e;590 children (295 per group). Using blinded 18-month Mental Development Index results available at the time, we estimated that the design effect due to the non-independence of multiple births was 1.14 (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.70, average of 1.20 infants per mother), giving an effective sample size of 259 children per group at 7&#x02005;years. With these assumptions, we had 85% power (&#x003b1;=0.05) to detect a four-point minimum difference in the Full Scale IQ scores (SD 15) between groups. In prespecified subgroup analyses by randomisation strata (sex and birth weight &#x0003c;1250&#x02005;g), we had 85% power (&#x003b1;=0.05) to detect a six-point difference (SD 15).</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>All participants who consented to participate in the 7-year CA follow-up (whether they completed the assessments or not) were analysed according to the group to which they were allocated. To address missing outcome data, multiple imputation was performed separately by treatment group using chained equations<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> to create 100 complete data sets, under the assumption that data were missing at random. Imputation models included covariates prespecified for adjustment and auxiliary variables that helped to satisfy the missing at random assumption or that were predictive of outcomes. Following analysis, the effect estimates from the imputed data sets were combined using Rubin's rules.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The primary analysis was based on imputed data and included all participants who consented to the follow-up study. Sensitivity analyses were performed on the available data and on imputed data for the 657 children in the original sample, excluding deaths. All analyses produced similar results and only the results of the primary analysis are presented.</p><p>Outcomes were analysed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) to account for clustering due to multiple births. Normally distributed outcomes were analysed using a linear GEE, with the effect of treatment expressed as a mean difference with 95% CI. Binary outcomes were analysed using log-binomial GEE, with the effect of treatment expressed as a relative risk (RR) with 95% CI. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses were performed, with adjustment for the stratification variables (centre, birth weight, sex). Statistical significance was assessed at the two-sided p&#x0003c;0.05 level. All analyses followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan and were performed using SAS V.9.3 (Cary, North Carolina, USA) and Stata Release V.12 (Statacorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study participants</title><p>The participant flow for infants randomly assigned to receive the high-DHA or standard-DHA diet and assessed at 7&#x02005;years&#x02019; CA is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014007314F1">figure 1</xref>.

The strengths of the study include the sample size which was large enough to detect a four-point difference in Full Scale IQ if it existed, the low risk of bias achieved through blinding of research personnel, outcome assessors and participants (apart from the 12 families that requested to be unblinded), and the minimal rate of attrition. The follow-up had clinically relevant prespecified primary and secondary outcomes and a prespecified analysis plan. Robust objective assessments of neurodevelopmental outcomes were undertaken by psychologists after extensive training and ongoing auditing. Our study was a pragmatic trial involving five Australian perinatal centres suggesting generalisability of the results to the wider preterm infant population in developed countries. However, the study relied on the infant achieving full enteral feeds to receive the full dose of DHA delivered either through human milk or infant formula. DHA is well absorbed by preterm infants<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and this was reflected in the increase in the erythrocyte membrane phospholipid DHA status of infants in the treatment group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The erythrocyte DHA status achieved in the high-DHA group was greater than previous trials that used lower DHA doses,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> although it did not quite reach our target level.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This may be due to the variation of DHA in breast milk, maternal compliance and delays in achieving the full DHA dose from intolerance to enteral feeds.</p><p>A limitation of the study was not including a teacher assessment of the child's behaviour as the diagnostic accuracy of both the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the BRIEF is superior when both parent and teacher reports are used.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>

Poorer scores on some but not all indices of parent-reported executive function and behaviour were found, although there was no evidence of effect modification by sex.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Executive function has not been assessed during childhood in preterm infant DHA supplementation studies. Given the possibility of poorer executive function and conduct problems we found in girls who received a high-DHA diet, it will be important to determine if there is evidence of a difference in later childhood or adolescence. It is possible that the potential differences found may reduce with age.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Biological and environmental factors interplay to influence cognitive development. In the long term, the effect of the family and environment may have a greater influence on cognitive outcomes.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> The most frequent indicator used for the family and environmental effect on cognitive outcomes in preterm infants has been maternal education level.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> While a composite measure of socioeconomic status may provide a more discriminant indicator, maternal education has consistently been shown to be associated with cognitive achievement.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> There were no differences in maternal education level attained between the high-DHA and standard-DHA groups in our 7-year follow-up and the education level was similar to the Australian average. Therefore, at least on this somewhat limited indicator of socioeconomic status, both groups had the same socioeconomic influences. A weakening of differences in cognitive outcome between 18&#x02005;months and early childhood was also seen in the &#x02018;Caffeine for Apnoea of Prematurity&#x02019; trial where a cognitive benefit was found at 18&#x02005;months, but by 5&#x02005;years of age there was no difference.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus, the early benefits of specific neonatal interventions appear to wane in middle childhood, but this does not discount delayed effects.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Conclusions and policy implications</title><p>There is limited evidence that DHA supplementation given in the first months of life to preterm infants benefits school-aged outcomes. Our results indicate that provision of enteral feeds containing a DHA dose of &#x02248;1% of total fatty acids in the newborn period provides little evidence of long-term benefit.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the families who generously participated in this study.
