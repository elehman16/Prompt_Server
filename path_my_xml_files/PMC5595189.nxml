Such low compliance inevitably contributes to hospital-acquired infections that negatively affect patients&#x02019; well-being and hospitals&#x02019; finances. The design of the present study is predicated on the assumption that most people who fail to clean their hands are not doing so intentionally, they just forget. The present study will test whether psychological priming can be used to increase the number of people who clean their hands on entering a ward. Here, we present the protocol for this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will use a randomised cross-over design. During the study, each of four wards will be observed during four conditions: olfactory prime, visual prime, both primes and neither prime. Each condition will be experienced for 42 days followed by a 7-day washout period (total duration of trial=189 days). We will record the number of people who enter each ward and whether they clean their hands during observation sessions, the amount of cleaning material used from the dispensers each week and the number of hospital-acquired infections that occur in each period. The outcomes will be compared using a regression analysis. Following the initial trail, the most effective priming condition will be rolled out for 3&#x02009;months in all the wards.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research ethics approval was obtained from the South Central&#x02014;Oxford C Research Ethics Committee (16/SC/0554), the Health Regulatory Authority and the sponsor.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN (15397624); Edge ID 86357.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Priming</kwd><kwd>Environmental Engineering</kwd><kwd>Hand-Hygiene</kwd><kwd>Hospital Acquired Infections.</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Health Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strength and limitation of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This study uses a methodologically robust design to assess the effects of novel interventions to improve hand&#x000a0;hygiene compliance in hospital.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The interventions are informed by behavioural psychology theory.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is pragmatic because the setting reflects usual clinical care.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The primary outcome is hand&#x000a0;hygiene compliance at the ward entrance.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A substantial proportion of these HAIs are avoidable through simple measures, including better hand&#x000a0;hygiene.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Unfortunately, observations suggest that compliance with hand&#x000a0;hygiene recommendations is typically less than 50%.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> As human behaviour is at the heart of hand&#x000a0;hygiene compliance, interventions informed by suitably rigorous behavioural research may help increase it.</p><p>Interventions to change people&#x02019;s behaviour can target the reflective (ie, controlled) and/or reflexive (ie, automatic) processes posited by dual-process theories.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> While the precise nature of these processes is debated, generally it is agreed that reflective processes are slower, more analytic and more controlled, whereas automatic processes are faster and less deliberative.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The question as to whether controlled, automatic or both processes should be targeted to change behaviour depends on a range of factors, including the practicalities of the situation at hand.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The present study focuses on interventions that target automatic processes using primes to nudge people entering a ward to clean their hands.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This focus was selected because so many people already know that they should clean their hands in hospital, and all hospital staff receive mandatory training on how to clean their hands.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, in the absence of personalised feedback, a large educational campaign is unlikely to yield large and sustainable effects.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Furthermore, many people who do not clean their hands are likely not doing so intentionally; it is more likely they are simply forgetting.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Placing primes into the hospital environment that nudge more people to clean their hands is a novel way forward.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Priming techniques use existing state&#x02013;action associations that trigger habitual actions by making those habitual actions more accessible in memory.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Stimuli referred to as priming cues have been used successfully to activate health-related behaviour. For example, to encourage greater physical activity in one study, participants were asked to make a sentence out of scrambled words such as fit, lean, active and athletic and that resulted in more participants using stairs instead of elevators.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> More relevant to the present study, visual and olfactory primes have already been used to increase hand&#x000a0;hygiene compliance in two studies.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The present study aims to extend the findings from these studies.</p><p>In the first study, medically trained participants were asked to examine an actor complaining of palpitations.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> During the examination, participants&#x02019; hand&#x000a0;hygiene behaviours were monitored using a video surveillance system. Participants were randomly assigned to experience either a standard environment (control group) or a citrus-smelling environment (intervention group). While only 51% of participants in the standard environment cleaned their hands before interacting with the actor, 80% of participants in the citrus-smelling environment did.</p><p>In the second study, the entry way to an active surgical ward was modified from a standard&#x000a0;environment to include either a citrus&#x000a0;smell or a picture of someone&#x02019;s eyes above an alcohol gel dispenser.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A researcher recorded in real-time whether people entering the ward used the gel dispenser. While only 15% of people used the gel dispenser in the standard environment, 47% did so when the citrus&#x000a0;smell was present, and 33% did so when the picture of someone&#x02019;s eyes was present.</p><p>While the findings from previous study in an actual hospital environment are encouraging, the present study addresses some of its limitations. First, the previous study was only conducted in a single surgical ward in the USA; this raises the concern that the previous study&#x02019;s findings might be context&#x000a0;specific. To overcome this limitation, the present study will be performed in three non-surgical wards and one surgical ward in the UK.</p><p>Second, each prime in the previous study was only active for four non-consecutive days. This raises the concern that the effects found in the previous study do not endure beyond this short time&#x000a0;frame. To overcome this limitation, the primes in the present study will each be active for 42 consecutive days.</p><p>The present study will also extend the previous study&#x02019;s findings in five important ways. First, whereas the previous study only tested each prime in isolation, the present study will also test the primes&#x02019; joint effects by presenting them simultaneously. In so doing, our results will be able to suggest whether two primes have greater effects than one.</p><p>Second, the previous study only examined the proportion of people using a gel dispenser, whereas the present study will also assess the amount of gel material used from the dispensers. This addition is beneficial because it would be infeasible for our observers to record hand&#x000a0;hygiene activity every moment the study is active.</p><p>Third, whereas the previous study only assessed the primes&#x02019; effectiveness in increasing people&#x02019;s use of a gel dispenser, the present study will also assess the primes&#x02019; effectiveness in increasing people&#x02019;s use of soap dispensers. Observing both is important because although hand rub gels protect against the spread of the infection known as methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), they&#x000a0;do not protect against the spread of another type of infection known as <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> infection&#x000a0;(CDI).<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Fourth, whereas the previous study only recorded the gender of the people entering the wards, we will also record their roles at the hospital (eg, doctor&#x000a0;or nurse). As hospital staff receive mandatory hand&#x000a0;hygiene training, plausibly staff may clean their hands more often than visitors. Interestingly, at least two studies have found that nurses are more likely to clean their hands than doctors.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref> A study of hand&#x000a0;hygiene behaviour within airport settings suggests that women may be more likely to clean their hands after using the restroom than men.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> However, whether the primes affect these different types of people differently is largely unknown.</p><p>Fifth, we will compare the number of HAIs that occur in each condition: neither prime, olfactory prime, visual prime&#x000a0;and both primes. We acknowledge that the brief duration of the present study may prevent us from finding a significant effect between conditions. To anticipate this potential shortfall, a roll-out of the most effective prime from the initial study is planned for 3&#x02009;months across all four of the wards incorporated in the initial trail. The change in the number of HAIs that occur in the observed wards over this time, in contrast to those that have occurred over the previous 10&#x02009;years, will be fed into an economic model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Objectives/hypotheses</title><p>The present study has five objectives.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Objective 1&#x000a0;</title><p>To compare the proportion of people who use the gel and soap dispensers when they enter a ward during each of our four conditions (neither prime, olfactory prime, visual prime&#x000a0;and both primes) and to assess whether the primes&#x02019; effects change over time.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Hypothesis 1</title><p>The proportion of people who use the gel and soap dispensers will be greater when the olfactory and/or visual primes are present than when they are not.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Hypothesis 1b</title><p>&#x000a0;The proportion of people who use the gel and soap dispensers will be greater when the olfactory and visual primes are presented in combination than when either prime is presented alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Objective 2&#x000a0;</title><p>To corroborate the findings from objective 1 using the amount of gel and soap materials used from the dispensers.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Hypothesis 2a&#x000a0;</title><p>The amount of product used from the gel and soap dispensers will be greater when the olfactory and/or visual primes are present than when they are not.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Hypothesis 2b</title><p>&#x000a0;The amount of product used from the gel and soap dispensers will be greater when the olfactory and visual primes are presented in combination than when either prime is presented alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objective 3</title><p>&#x000a0;To assess the effectiveness of the primes for different types of people; differentiated specifically based on their role at the hospital (doctors, nurses, other hospital staff or visitors) and gender (female&#x000a0;or male).</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Hypothesis 3a&#x000a0;</title><p>The proportion of hospital staff who clean their hands will be greater than the proportion of visitors who clean their hands.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Hypothesis 3b</title><p>The proportion of women who clean their hands will be greater than the proportion of men who clean their hands.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objective 4&#x000a0;</title><p>To compare the number of HAIs that occur during the study across our four conditions.</p><sec id="s2d1"><title>Hypothesis 4a</title><p>&#x000a0;There will be fewer HAIs when the olfactory and/or visual primes are present than when they are not.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Hypothesis 4b&#x000a0;</title><p>There will be fewer HAIs when the olfactory and visual primes are presented in combination than when either prime is presented alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Objective 5</title><p>&#x000a0;To assess the cost-effectiveness of the interventions in terms of cost per additional percentage of compliance, cost per avoided HAI and cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Hypothesis 5&#x000a0;</title><p>Within the first part of the present study, the effectiveness of the primes can be compared against a control condition wherein there are no primes.

Note that while the&#x000a0;trial takes place in a hospital, it does not fit WHO&#x02019;s definition of a clinical trial and was retrospectively registered at the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number&#x000a0;(ISRCTN) registry.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>No participants will be recruited into the study.

Whether people clean their hands on entering a ward is affected by the design of the physical environment. Hospitals already actively recognise the importance of the environment in this regard. Gel and soap dispensers are placed at every ward&#x02019;s entrance to ensure that people can clean their hands.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Unfortunately, making the opportunity available has not proven sufficient to ensure compliance. Evaluating the effectiveness of environmental primes that nudge people to clean their hands on entering a ward is a promising way forward.</p><p>Most healthcare workers already know why hand&#x000a0;hygiene is important and how to adequately clean their hands.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> However, as hospitals are busy places, it is inevitable that sometimes other activities will take priority over effective hand&#x000a0;hygiene practices.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> If this happens too frequently, not cleaning one&#x02019;s hands may become an enduring habit. The degree to which this happens is unknown, but any degree is unfortunate. To make compliance with effective hand&#x000a0;hygiene practices easier, hospital administrators should aim to design the environment in such a way that such practices become habitual, default behavioural patterns that are rarely forgotten.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The primes to be investigated in this study provide a potentially powerful mechanism for achieving this fundamentally important goal.</p><p>While the present study does not attempt to uncover the theoretical mechanism that may underlie the olfactory and visual primes&#x02019; effects, previous experiments have done so. The olfactory primes may activate hand&#x000a0;hygiene via an associative mechanism, that&#x000a0;is, the citrus smells found in many cleaning products may stimulate the desire to clean. Indeed, in a previous study, a clean smell increased the number of people who cleaned up after themselves while eating crumbly cookies.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Regarding the visual prime, previous studies suggest that pictures of eyes may nudge people to comply with known social rules. For example, pictures of eyes similar to the picture to be deployed in the present study have been used successfully to increase the amount of money people contribute voluntarily to charity and reduce the incidence of thefts.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>

In consequence, one practical limitation of our study is that the primes are not the only active interventions taking place at the hospital. While it would be ideal to restrict all other interventions during our study, this is not realistic. Owing to the importance of minimising HAIs, the hospital is not able to stop active in-house campaigns regarding hand&#x000a0;hygiene; for example, signage reminding people to clean their hands and mandatory training of staff will remain in place throughout the duration of the present study. Therefore, to be significant, the interventions&#x02019; effects need to be more powerful than the effects the hospital would expect based on its existing practices.</p><p>Another practical limitation is that observers will only monitor the soap and gel dispensers located near the wards&#x02019; entrances. The choice to only observe at this location is a limitation because the entrances contain a very narrow subset of all the dispensers. Wards typically have dispensers at all points of care, for instance, alcohol gel dispensers are often placed outside the entrances to wards and near the bedside of each patient; in some cases, portable dispensers are carried around (eg, in people&#x02019;s pockets or handbags).<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> While ideally we would like to gather data from all relevant locations in each ward, such a strategy is not possible practically.</p><p>We have chosen instead to monitor the dispensers located near the wards&#x02019; entrances because it allows a limited number of observers to more easily record each unique opportunity for hand&#x000a0;hygiene complaint behaviour. Increasing the number of observers beyond this practical minimum would likely interfere with the&#x000a0;hospital&#x02019;s day-to-day routines, thereby increasing the chances of a Hawthorne effect. Hawthorne effects occur when participants become aware that they are being observed and change their behaviour accordingly.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>At least two consequences of this limitation should be noted. First, our data will not capture any delayed effects of the primes; for example, if our primes increase hand&#x000a0;hygiene complaint behaviours at patients&#x02019; bedsides, this will not be detected. This limitation affects objectives 1, 2 and 3 of our study.</p><p>An additional limitation of the study is that the relationship between our data and the incidence of HAIs will be incomplete. Indeed, not all HAIs are hand&#x000a0;hygiene related. As for those HAIs that are hand&#x000a0;hygiene related, they could arise owing to a lack of compliance beyond the confines of the ward entrances under observation. This limitation may undermine our fourth and fifth objectives.</p><p>Another limitation is that additional covariates will not be measured to account for other factors that affect gel and soap use, such as variations in the amount of ward traffic over the year. We did not add covariates about seasonal variations because a previous study has suggested that temperature variations occurring during a study performed during the same season do not affect hand&#x000a0;hygiene behaviours.<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In addition, Larson <italic>et al</italic> found that handwashing practices did not differ significantly by season.<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><p>A further limitation is that our primary outcome data are reliant on human observer&#x02019;s ratings. However, although using human observers creates a limitation, it also offers a distinct advantage over automated data collection. Specifically, human observers can count the number of opportunities for people to clean their hands in addition to whether said people clean their hands. Notably, sophisticated automatic counters are being developed that can record both opportunity and occurrence and can even give people personalised feedback. This technology is exciting but is still cost prohibitive and likely will not address the cleaning behaviours of hospital visitors. While future studies may be able to take advantage of this new technology, at present, human observers remain the most fruitful means of data collection available.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e278" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017108.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e280" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-017108.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> The protocol was collaboratively developed by all coauthors.
