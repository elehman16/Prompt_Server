Existing treatments for psychotic experiences, pharmacological and psychological, are only partially effective (<xref rid="bb0145 bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Leucht et al., 2013; van der Gaag et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach to developing a much more efficacious treatment is to target the main mechanisms causing the delusions. We take a step by step approach to translation of the advances in understanding persecutory delusions (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Garety, 2014</xref>), based upon an interventionist-causal model approach (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Kendler and Campbell, 2009</xref>). One of the putative causal factors with the greatest empirical support is negative beliefs about the self (<xref rid="bb0075 bb0135 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2002; Kesting and Lincoln, 2013; Tiernan et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore in the current study we aimed to reduce negative thoughts about the self in order to test the effect on clinical paranoia.</p><p>Negative thoughts about the self can lead to feelings of being different, apart, inferior and hence vulnerable, a perspective central to the theoretical conceptualisation of the paranoia hierarchy (see <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;1</xref>) (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2005</xref>). Paranoia will flourish when an individual perceives him or herself as vulnerable. Three recent systematic reviews have established that paranoia is associated with negative cognitions about the self (<xref rid="bb0095 bb0135 bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Garety and Freeman, 2013; Kesting and Lincoln, 2013; Tiernan et al., 2014</xref>). There is also longitudinal and experimental support. In a study of 301 patients with psychosis assessed three times over 12&#x000a0;months, negative cognitions about the self predicted the persistence of persecutory delusions, with little evidence of reverse causation (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2012</xref>). A study of sixty patients with persecutory delusions showed that negative beliefs about the self predicted the persistence of paranoia over the next six months (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Vorontsova et al., 2013</xref>). In an experimental study using virtual reality it was shown that increasing negative views of the self leads to an increase in paranoia in vulnerable individuals (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2014a</xref>). There are numerous other reports of links between negative self-concepts and paranoia (<xref rid="bb0025 bb0120 bb0150 bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bentall et al., 2009; Hutton et al., 2013; Lincoln et al., 2013; Atherton et al., in press</xref>). Adverse experiences and environments will have a major contribution to the development of negative self-concepts (e.g. <xref rid="bb0165 bb0100 bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Selten and Cantor-Graae, 2005; Gracie et al., 2007; Bentall et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The clinical implication is that reducing negative thoughts about the self will lead to reductions in persecutory delusions. Consistent with this, self-esteem interventions for patients with psychosis have also been shown to lead to improvements in positive symptoms (e.g. <xref rid="bb0140 bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Lecomte et al., 1999; Hall and Tarrier, 2003</xref>). These studies have not examined persecutory delusions specifically. We set-out to reduce the short-term negative self-cognitions in patients with persistent persecutory delusions. Our view is that concepts such as negative self cognitions, self-esteem, and negative social comparison are closely related phenomena, tied to levels of depression. Therefore we measured all of these concepts. The evaluation was an early Phase II clinical trial, but with similarities to an experimental test. We used both standard CBT techniques for negative thoughts but also techniques from positive psychology to increase positive thoughts about the self (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Freeman, 2012</xref>); this was on the basis of clinical experience and research that shows that negative and positive affect are inversely correlated and overlap in genetic and environmental causes (e.g. <xref rid="bb0130 bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Kendler et al., 2011; Nes et al., 2013</xref>). That is, our approach was to try to diminish negative thoughts and build positive thoughts. This is consistent with <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Woods and Tarrier's (2010)</xref> argument that &#x02018;positive and negative characteristics cannot logically be studied or changed in isolation&#x02019;. The primary hypothesis was that a brief intervention focused on reducing negative beliefs about the self would immediately post-treatment produce reductions both in negative beliefs and in paranoia. The secondary prediction was that there would be improvements in related variables: positive beliefs about the self, comparison of self to others, self esteem, well-being, anxiety, and depression. Of course improvements in well-being and depression in this group would be valuable irrespective of effects on paranoia; almost half of patients with persecutory delusions have well-being scores in the lowest 2% of the population (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., 2014b</xref>) and a similar proportion meet diagnostic criteria for depression (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Vorontsova et al., 2013</xref>). We also examined whether any improvements due to treatment would be maintained at a follow-up assessment, although at this stage of intervention development we were focussed upon immediate change with treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Method</title><sec id="s0025"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>30 patients were recruited from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust. The inclusion criteria were: a current persecutory delusion as defined by <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Garety (2000)</xref>; scoring at least 3 on the conviction scale of the PSYRATS (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Haddock et al., 1999</xref>); the delusion had persisted for at least three months; a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or delusional disorder (i.e. a diagnosis of non-affective psychosis); negative beliefs about the self as indicated by endorsing at least one negative schematic belief on the Brief Core Schema Scale (BCSS; <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2006</xref>); aged between 18 and 70; and where major changes in medication are being made, entry to the study would not occur until at least a month after stabilisation of dosage. The exclusion criteria were: a primary diagnosis of alcohol or substance dependency; organic syndrome or learning disability; a command of spoken English inadequate for engaging in therapy or the assessments; and currently having individual CBT (though previous experience of CBT was not an exclusion criterion). Recruitment into the study is summarised in the CONSORT diagram (see <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). It took place from September 2012 to March 2014 (though not continuously), with final data collection completed in May 2014. It is of note that no patient with a persecutory delusion was excluded on the basis of not endorsing at least one negative schematic belief on the BCSS.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.2</label><title>Research design</title><p>The study was a randomised controlled evaluation. Patients with persecutory delusions were randomised to the CBT intervention in addition to standard care or to standard care. Randomisation was carried out in a 1:1 ratio using varying randomised permuted blocks via a sequence obtained from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com" id="ir0010">www.randomization.com</ext-link>, which was conducted by a researcher independent of the recruitment and assessment process. Random allocation followed completion of the baseline assessment. Informing patients of allocation was carried out by the trial therapists, who opened an allocation envelope. Assessments were carried out by a rater, a graduate psychologist (NE), blind to allocation. Precautionary strategies included: the therapist being encouraged to consider room use and diary arrangements in the light of potential breaks of masking&#x0037e; patients being reminded by the assessor not to talk about treatment allocation&#x0037e; and, after the initial assessment, the assessor did not look at the patients' clinical notes until the last of the ratings had been collected. If a blind was broken then another researcher within the team carried out the assessment. 28 out of 29 eight week assessments were carried out blind and all 12&#x000a0;week assessments were carried out blind. The assessment measures were completed at 0&#x000a0;weeks (baseline), 8&#x000a0;weeks (end of therapy), and at 12&#x000a0;weeks (a one month follow-up). The study had received approval from an NHS research ethics committee and was registered (ISRCTN06118265).</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.3</label><title>Planned interventions</title><p>The intervention was described to patients as having the aim of improving self-confidence, and was provided in six sessions to each individual over eight weeks. It was provided by clinical psychologists (DF, KP, BS, FW), with occasional support from a graduate psychologist (EC, RL) particularly for helping patients with tasks between sessions (e.g. going outside to do an activity). The strategies used were indicated in the literature to be effective at reducing negative beliefs about the self and boosting positive beliefs (and did not challenge or review the delusion itself). The strategies are described in detail in <italic>You Can Be Happy</italic> (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Freeman, 2012</xref>), which was provided for a number of therapy patients. The intervention is designed to provide clear and simple messages for patients to take into their day-to-day lives. There was an explicit agenda made with the patient to focus upon three areas: 1. negative thoughts about the self, 2. positive activities, and 3. positive thoughts about the self. Negative thoughts about the self were normalised, made understandable in the context of a person's experiences, and reviewed. Where voices were encouraging negative thoughts about the self the patient was helped to see this as a poor source of information and to disengage attention. Written accounts by other patients were provided. Activities were structured around the concept of five-a-day for mental well-being (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Foresight Mental Capital and Wellbeing Project, 2008</xref>): connect, be active, take notice, keep learning, and give. The aim was to increase the number of these activities a patient did during the week. Positive thoughts were encouraged by reviewing the person's strengths, savouring, and keeping a diary of positive events. Positive music and pictures were also used. The patients wanted to focus on improving their self-confidence but in the instances where paranoid thoughts were brought up then the therapist would empathise with the distress and the self-confidence techniques would be framed as a way of building up strength to help deal with the difficult events occurring in the person's life. Tasks were set between sessions and there were supportive telephone calls or texts, and a graduate psychologist could visit to help with carrying out of an activity. Throughout the intervention the person's main negative self-belief and a positive self-belief were measured to monitor progress. All trial patients continued to receive standard care. Standard care was delivered according to national and local service protocols and guidelines. It usually consisted of prescription of anti-psychotic medication, visits from a community mental health worker, and regular outpatient appointments with a psychiatrist.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.4</label><title>Primary outcome measures</title><sec id="s0045"><label>2.4.1</label><title>Brief Core Schema Scales (BCSS) (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2006</xref>)</title><p>The self-report BCSS, developed with non-clinical and psychosis groups, has 24 items assessing negative and positive beliefs about the self and others each rated on a five-point scale (0&#x02013;4).

We set-out to test this directly in patients with persecutory delusions. The interest at this stage was the immediate effects of targeting cognitions about the self. We did not try to determine which specific intervention techniques may change the mechanism. This focus on mechanism change is similar to an experimental study, though closest to a Phase II early clinical trial. The evaluation proved feasible, acceptable, and had good methodological rigour for an early stage test: assessments were blind, all patients attended all therapy sessions, and there was an exceptionally high follow-up rate. There were important gains for the patients with CBT in psychological well-being, depression, positive beliefs about the self, self-esteem, and social comparison. There were small improvements in negative beliefs about the self. As predicted there were also improvements in overall levels of paranoia and the main persistent persecutory delusions, although these did not reach statistical significance. Our view is that this indicates the potential value of targeting negative cognitions in patients with persecutory delusions.</p><p>The patients all had delusions that had persisted for a considerable period of time despite medication. Other psychotic experiences such as auditory hallucinations were very common. The therapy was very well-received: all patients attended all the sessions. Indeed there was a general readiness of patients to attend further treatment sessions. We found that positive psychology techniques and activity were most used, with much less work directly on negative views about the self. Patients appreciated a shift of focus away from their problems towards their strengths. The improvements in psychological well-being during the trial are notable and are clearly important in their own right as an outcome. This work is likely to have wider applicability to patients with psychosis. Nonetheless it may be argued that this therapy focus led to less change in negative self cognitions, which may have the closest connections to paranoid ideation. Measurement issues may also be important here, since the Brief Core Schema Scale (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2006</xref>) was not developed as an outcome scale, whereas the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Tennant et al., 2007</xref>) is well-received by patients. Further, we are struck by the gains not being maintained. Although our focus was on short-term change, we still expected gains to last. Our other brief interventions have maintained treatment gains over several months (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Freeman et al., submitted for publication</xref>). Given the theoretical and research foundations for the link between negative self cognitions and paranoia, and the promise of the current study, we believe that this treatment development needs to be pursued. Our recommendations are that intervention needs to be lengthened, the targeting of negative cognitions and positive cognitions needs to be directly compared, and that an attention control condition would add strength to the judgements that can be reached. Negative self cognitions in patients with severe paranoia are likely to reflect deeply engrained self views which relate to appraisals of negative experiences over the life course, and may indeed be maintained by ongoing adverse experiences and social circumstances. How to improve negative cognitions in patients with paranoia is likely to prove an area of key interest in the future. We expect such treatment approaches in future clinical practice to be combined with interventions that target other key causal factors in paranoia (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Freeman and Garety, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0120"><title>Role of funding source</title><p>The study was included as part of a programme of research within a Medical Research Council (MRC) Senior Clinical Fellowship awarded to Daniel Freeman.

My self-confidence has got better and I think more positively. Before, everything seemed like a really big problem and I worried a lot. I do still worry, but I tell myself I can't do anything about it so I write it down instead. I'm feeling really good at the moment.&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patient 2<break/>&#x0201c;Things are good now. I'm now able to help my wife more, it's easier to spend time with my grandchildren and I'm much more patient. I went to see my psychiatrist last week and he said I'm the best he's ever seen me. It was really helpful to talk about the personal stuff for the first time and sharing it with someone who understands. It was tough but it's gotta get bad before it gets better. When I spoke to my daughter she thought it was too tough, but something inside me told me to keep going. I'm really glad I did.&#x0201d;</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Patient 3<break/>&#x0201c;I think I am more confident and I have a slightly different bearing. The way I feel in myself and the way I am in myself. I feel more confident, a general sense of being more confident&#x02026; It really helped me to reverse the balance and swing the pendulum back. It's such a change to think about strengths after years of going to the doctors and saying what's wrong. I've started giving my doctor and care co-ordinator that I meet a copy of my CV with my education, work I've done and voluntary experience on. I tell them that this is the me that you don't see when I'm well.&#x0201d;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="t0015" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>The
