This study examined the impact of switching to mTHS on biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs relative to menthol CCs (mCCs) and smoking abstinence (SA).MethodsIn this three-arm, parallel-group study, 160 Japanese adult smokers (23&#x02013;65 years; smoking &#x02265;10 mCCs per day) were randomized to mTHS (n = 78), mCC (n = 42), or SA (n = 40) for 5 days in confinement and 85 days in ambulatory settings. Endpoints included biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs, human puffing topography, safety, and subjective effects of smoking measures.ResultsAfter 5 days of product use, the concentrations of carboxyhemoglobin, 3-hydroxypropylmercapturic acid, monohydroxybutenyl mercapturic acid, and S-phenylmercapturic acid were 55%, 49%, 87%, and 89% lower (p < .001), respectively, in the mTHS group than in the mCC group. Other biomarkers of exposure (measured as secondary endpoints) were 50%&#x02013;94% lower in the mTHS group than in the mCC group on day 5. These reductions in the mTHS group were maintained at day 90, similar to the SA group. Switching to mTHS was associated with changes in human puffing topography (shorter puff intervals and more frequent puffs). The urge-to-smoke and smoking satisfaction levels on day 90 were similar in the mTHS and the mCC groups.ConclusionSwitching from mCCs to mTHS significantly reduced exposure to HPHCs relative to continuing smoking mCCs with concentrations similar to those observed following SA in Japanese adult smokers.ImplicationsThis randomized study compared the impact of switching to a modified-risk tobacco product candidate mTHS on biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs of cigarette smoke relative to continuing smoking cigarettes or abstaining from smoking in sequential confinement and ambulatory settings. The study showed that switching to mTHS was associated with significant biomarker reductions within 5 days in confinement, these reductions being maintained throughout the ambulatory setting up to day 90. The results provide evidence that switching to mTHS reduces real-life exposure to HPHCs in adult smokers.Philip Morris Products S.A) --><volume>20</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>161</fpage><lpage>172</lpage><history><date date-type="received"><day>31</day><month>5</month><year>2016</year></date><date date-type="accepted"><day>25</day><month>10</month><year>2016</year></date></history><permissions><copyright-statement>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017.

Subsequently, THS 1.0 was developed, the tobacco stick still heated externally, at a peak temperature of the tobacco of approximately 550&#x000b0;C. The THS 1.0 was test-marketed in Switzerland, Japan, Australia, and Germany between 2006 and 2010. For both products, nicotine delivery has been shown being too low to satisfy consumers and/or to suppress smoking abstinence (SA) symptoms, despite attempts to compensate for the lower nicotine exposure by increasing the number of product uses.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;15</xref></sup></p><p>Incomplete withdrawal suppression with Accord<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> had already previously been reported.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Consumers also reported shortcomings in the sensory and taste characteristics as well as dislike of the somewhat bulky design.</p><p>The development of THS 2.2 addressed the previous shortcomings highlighted by consumers and further enhanced the physical and chemical characteristics of mTHS. The heating temperature is now &#x0003c;350&#x000b0;C, resulting in substantial reduction in exposure to HPHCs, while delivering nicotine comparable to cigarettes. Several studies have not only shown that THS 2.2 and its earlier prototypes reduce exposure to HPHCs in cells and animals,<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref></sup> but also in smokers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> These previous studies have been largely conducted in confinement and thus may not reflect regular long-term use in ambulatory settings. Accordingly, clinical studies are needed to confirm these earlier studies, and to provide evidence that MRTPs, like the THS, reduce exposure to HPHCs during extended use.</p><p>This study was part of a clinical assessment program on both the menthol and the regular THS variants. The regular variant has been assessed first in two 1-week confinement exposure reduction studies, one conducted in Poland (NCT01959932) and one in Japan (NCT01970982). The assessment of the regular variant under ambulatory conditions is also part of a 6-month exposure response study, currently underway in the United States (NCT02396381). The aim of the study reported here was to examine the impact of mTHS on biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs after 5 days of confinement and a further 85 days in an ambulatory setting in Japanese adult smokers to support prior studies in Eastern populations (NCT01780714 [unpublished data] and NCT01780688<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>). To achieve this aim, a three-arm parallel-group study design was used in which mTHS was compared against continuing smoking menthol conventional cigarette (mCC). The effects of switching to mTHS on biomarkers of exposure levels were examined in smokers, and SA was included as a gold standard for reducing the risks of smoking. The ambulatory period was included to examine the exposure&#x02013;reduction effects of mTHS in real-life conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s7"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization, Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines,<sup><xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and national regulations, and was approved by the local Institutional Review Board in July 2013 before starting the study.

The reductions were apparent within 5 days of product use in confinement and were maintained for a further 85 days in ambulatory settings in the mTHS group, consistent with the lower concentrations of HPHCs in the THS aerosol relative to the CC aerosol.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref></sup> In view of the fact that product use was strictly monitored during confinement, relatively high COHb concentration of approximately 2.5% were found on day 5 in both the mTHS and in the SA groups after having decreased from about 5.1% at baseline. As reference ranges of 1&#x02013;3% have been reported,<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> the observed levels appear still normal and possibly reflect environmental exposure.</p><p>Despite the high variability associated with the Ames test, there was a clear trend in the decrease in carcinogens of tobacco smoke after switching to mTHS as compared with those continuing mCC, with a similar trend in the SA group. These findings provide additional evidence of reduced exposure when switching to mTHS, because the Ames assay is indicative of exposure to genotoxic agents. The reduction in urine mutagenicity as soon as 5 days after switching to mTHS is in agreement with the published half-life of smoking-related urine mutagenicity (approximately 7&#x02013;23 hours).<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The source of the high variability of the urine mutagenicity values is likely due to (1) the relative high sensitivity of this assay to diet, as previously reported,<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> even in nonsmokers, (2) individual metabolic differences, and (3) variability of the cellular-based assay itself.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>CYP1A2 is involved in the activation of carcinogenic heterocyclic and aromatic amines.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> These active metabolites (N-acetoxy derivatives) can react with DNA to form covalent heterocyclic amine-DNA adducts.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> The extent of tumor induction resulting from these DNA adducts is dependent on the amount of aromatic or heterocyclic amines converted to the reactive, carcinogenic metabolites, which is in turn dependent on CYP1A2 activity and likely to enhance the risk of tobacco-related cancers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The induction of CYP1A2 activity is largely driven by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> This study has shown that exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon such as B[a]P was reduced by about 77% at the end of the exposure period, which likely explains the approximately 31% reduction in CYP1A2 activity in the mTHS group, similar to the reduction in the SA group, as compared with mCC. This further supports the potential of mTHS to lower the risk of certain tobacco-related cancers. In line with these data from human exposure, in a previously reported study conducted in Apoe<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice for 8 months, cigarette smoke induced both gene, and protein expression of CYP1A2 in the liver (the main site of CYP1A2 expression), while exposure to THS aerosol did not. Furthermore, switching to THS aerosol following cigarette smoke exposure led to a reduction in CYP1A2 gene and protein expression to levels approaching those of cessation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p>Several other MRTPs are under development and have been evaluated in randomized studies. In a study by Ogden et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> adult smokers were switched to tobacco-heating cigarettes, snus, and ultralow machine yield tobacco-burning cigarettes. They noted that switching to these products achieved meaningful reductions in exposure to many potentially harmful constituents of cigarette smoke. Likewise, Miura et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> compared a noncombustion inhaler-type product to CCs containing 1 mg tar, and to SA for 4 weeks in a residential setting in Japanese adult male smokers. They reported that switching to the noncombustion inhaler-type product achieved significant reductions in 14 biomarkers of exposure, and that the concentrations of these biomarkers (except for nicotine and NNK) after 29 days were similar to those in the SA group. Sakaguchi et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> compared the effects of a prototype heated cigarette with those of CCs containing 10 mg tar for 4 weeks in a residential setting in Japanese adult smokers. They also reported that switching to the heated cigarette markedly lowered the biomarkers of exposure to nicotine, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acrolein, hydrogen cyanide, crotonaldehyde, NNK, pyrene, and 4-aminobiphenyl, but not carbon monoxide compared with continuing CCs.</p><p>Clinical studies can indicate adult smoker acceptance of the product through measures such as nicotine pharmacokinetics and smoker satisfaction questionnaires. A recently reported nicotine pharmacokinetic study showed that the THS replicates the nicotine delivery profile of cigarettes, indicating that it has the potential to be an effective substitute for CCs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Since other factors such as taste, flavor, and sensory experience are also important for adult smoker&#x02019;s longer-term acceptance, additional tools to measure subjective effects such as mCEQ, QSU-brief, and MNWS were applied in this study. The results indicate that the mTHS delivered similar levels of acceptability than the smoker&#x02019;s usual cigarettes, at 5 and 90 days after switching, and could substitute for the accustomed nicotine concentrations at the beginning of the study. This is also reflected in the high compliance level in the mTHS group during the ambulatory period. As compliance with SA was also high, cultural effects may as well have exerted a favorable influence in the present Japanese study population. Other than in typical smoking cessation studies, where essentially abstinence is ascertained, the present design included regular site visits with comprehensive assessments, including physical examinations as well as urine and blood sampling. This may also have contributed to the high compliance levels.</p><p>The switch to mTHS led to relatively small changes in smoking topography. Smaller and more frequent puffs with a shorter inter puff interval and a lower average puff volume were taken with the mTHS than with mCC to achieve a comparable total puff volume on day 90. The number of tobacco sticks used per day in the mTHS group on day 90 was slightly lower than the number of mCCs used per day in the mCC group. The mCEQ, MNWS, and QSU-brief questionnaire scores observed in the mTHS and mCC groups were very close, with a maximum difference of 0.5 points between the two groups, and a stabilization of the different scores noticeable after a few days of confinement. The findings on the mCEQ, QSU-brief, and MNWS, the changes in puffing topography and the number of products used per day indicate that smokers found the mTHS an acceptable alternative to combustible cigarettes.</p><p>The incidence of AEs was relatively low and only one (diarrhea) was considered related to the mTHS.</p><p>There are limitations of this study that warrant mentioning, including the potential for dual use in the mTHS group and the opportunity to resume mCC smoking in the SA group in the ambulatory period, which could have confounded the results. However, these limitations are addressed by the study design, comprising sequential confinement, and ambulatory periods, and by the fact that the exposure reduction seen under very controlled conditions was sustained in the ambulatory, more real-life environment. Furthermore, cigarette smoking in the SA group was low, as demonstrated by subjective (participant-reported) and objective (biomarkers of exposure) data.</p><p>Overall, the study design and methodology supports the robustness of the finding that switching to mTHS led to significant reductions in biomarker levels within 5 days in confinement, which were maintained throughout the ambulatory setting up to day 90, thus providing evidence that switching to mTHS reduces real-life exposure to HPHCs in adult smokers.</p></sec><sec id="s22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that switching from mCCs to mTHS was associated with significant reductions in biomarkers of exposure to HPHCs relative to continuing mCCs in Japanese smokers. The impact of switching to the mTHS on biologically relevant risk markers is described in a separate publication.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>
