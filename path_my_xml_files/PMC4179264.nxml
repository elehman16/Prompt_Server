Although associated with slightly more local reactogenicity this technique offers the advantage of eliminating the risk of needle stick accidents in the healthcare setting. The Biojector utilizes single use cartridges for intramuscular administration hence removing the possibility of transferring blood borne pathogens between individuals. In addition to its safety advantages, Biojector administration of vaccines has been associated with improved immune responses in both preclinical as well as clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0106240-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106240-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. More than a decade ago others had shown that immunization of rabbits with a malaria DNA vaccine via Biojector resulted in improved antibody titers compared with needle injections <xref rid="pone.0106240-Aguiar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In one of the earlier clinical studies that compared routes of administration, higher rates of seroconversion as well as higher antibody titers were seen in response to a hepatitis A vaccine in the Biojector group as compared to needle and syringe (N/S) groups <xref rid="pone.0106240-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>The Vaccine Research Center (VRC) has extensive experience with use of Biojector for administration of plasmid DNA vaccines. Biojector administration has been utilized for evaluating vaccines for SARS, West Nile virus, influenza and HIV previously <xref rid="pone.0106240-Ledgerwood1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106240-Martin2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. The results of VRC 008, a Phase I study comparing HIV DNA vaccine delivery by Biojector versus N/S followed by rAd5 (recombinant adenoviral serotype 5 vector vaccine) boost showed that delivery of HIV DNA vaccine by Biojector significantly improved both humoral and cellular immune responses post boost and that the magnitude of immune responses is affected by the method of delivery <xref rid="pone.0106240-Graham3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>The study described in this report was conducted concurrently with HVTN 505, a large Phase 2b efficacy trial evaluating VRC's HIV DNA prime and rAd5 vaccine boost regimen. One of the purposes of the current study was to answer important scientific questions about the administration of the rAd5 vaccine to prepare for the HVTN 505 study outcome. The outcome of HVTN 505 study showing no efficacy at protection from HIV infection precludes any further testing of this vaccine regimen <xref rid="pone.0106240-Hammer1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the data from our trial are informative for other vaccine programs for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>, <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>, dengue virus, influenza, Ebola and others utilizing recombinant adenoviral vectors <xref rid="pone.0106240-Lasaro1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106240-Ledgerwood3" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Data from a previous clinical trial that evaluated a homologous rAd5 HIV vaccine regimen showed that boosting with the same viral vector increased Env-specific antibody responses but did not increase T cell responses <xref rid="pone.0106240-DeRosa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In our study, we included subjects who had been previously vaccinated with the rAd5 HIV vaccine to assess whether pre-existing vector-induced Ad5-specific antibody had any effect on antibody responses to the recombinant Env antigen. The molecular targets of neutralization differ if Ad5 immunity is generated by natural infection versus vaccination with replication-defective viral vectors. Neutralizing activity generated by natural infection is more determined by fiber-specific antibody, while rAd vector immunization elicited neutralizing activity is more dependent on hexon-specific antibody. Hence, evaluating the effect of pre-existing immunity is complex in subjects who had received at least one dose of rAd5 vaccine before as a minority had exposure to natural infection prior to receiving the initial rAd5 vaccine <xref rid="pone.0106240-Cheng1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Prior to this study all rAd5 vaccinations in VRC clinical trials were administered by needle and syringe. This study was conducted to evaluate whether Biojector delivery of rAd5 would improve immunogenicity to the recombinant antigen as it does for DNA plasmid vaccines. We report here the results of a Phase I clinical trial comparing Biojector to N/S delivery of rAd5 vaccine in a healthy volunteer population divided into two groups comprised of those receiving a primary immunization (group 1) or those receiving a secondary immunization after having received at least one rAd5 HIV injection in a prior study (group 2).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for the trial and supporting CONSORT checklist is provided as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0106240.s001">Checklist S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study was reviewed and approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Institutional Review Board and was performed in accordance with all applicable U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulations and principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinski.

Group 1 included eight subjects with low (&#x0003c;1&#x02236;500) and twelve subjects with high (&#x0003e;1&#x02236;500) adenovirus serotype-5 antibody (Ad5 Ab) titers at screening equally distributed between the Biojector and N/S groups. Consideration of Ad5 Ab titer in the randomization ensured balance of Ad5 serostatus within each injection method to allow comparison of immune responses by injection method. Group 2 included participants who had received at least one rAd5 injection in a prior study. There were no limitations on the timing of their previous rAd5 dose and they were randomized in a 1&#x02236;1 ratio to receive vaccine via Biojector or N/S. Randomization to the injection device became known to both the study staff and the subjects by completion of an enrollment in the electronic database.</p><p>All subjects self-reported reactogenicity on 5-day diary cards following the study injection. Local reactogenicity parameters solicited on the diary card included sore/blister at site of vaccination, pain/tenderness, swelling and redness. Solicited parameters of systemic reactogenicity were malaise, myalgia, headache, chills, nausea and highest measured temperature. Reactogenicity was graded as mild, moderate, or severe. Clinical and laboratory follow up was through week 24 of the study. All adverse events (AE's) were reported for the entire duration of the study for individual participants, assessed for relationship to study vaccine (unrelated, probably not/unlikely, possibly, probably or definitely related). The Division of AIDS table for Grading Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, December 2004 was used for severity grading of adverse events.

Moreover, previous clinical studies have shown improved immune responses as a result of Biojector delivery of vaccines <xref rid="pone.0106240-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106240-Aguiar1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106240-Raviprakash1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. In particular, DNA vaccine delivery by Biojector was associated with improved antibody and T cell responses following rAd5 vaccine boost <xref rid="pone.0106240-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The current study was conducted to evaluate if using this method of delivery of rAd5 would be safe and immunogenic in subjects receiving primary and secondary immunization. We found that overall; rAd5 vaccination by this mode of delivery was well tolerated. Needle-free delivery of rAd5 was immunogenic indicating the integrity of the rAd5 vector is not compromised by shear forces associated with this mode of delivery. However needle-free injection of rAd5 vaccine does not increase its immunogenicity as previously observed for DNA vaccines. This suggests that needle-free delivery may have increased the immunogenicity of DNA by improving transduction efficiency, but for a vector like rAd5, which already has high transduction efficiency, the added value appears to be limited.</p><p>Needle-free injection systems like the Biojector device eject fluid through a small orifice under pressure penetrating all layers of skin. This potentially creates a more widespread intramuscular distribution, which improves immunogenicity possibly due to wider dispersion and activation of dendritic cells in the skin <xref rid="pone.0106240-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. While needle-free delivery of rAd5 vaccine showed an increased frequency of local and systemic reactogenicity in the Biojector groups in comparison to the N/S groups, this observation would not preclude clinical use of this device. Increased reactogenicity was also noted previously in VRC 008 study comparing Biojector and N/S delivery of a HIV DNA vaccine. This finding is consistent with previous experience with needle free devices used for vaccine delivery <xref rid="pone.0106240-Mathei1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0106240-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Data from non-U.S. populations have shown as high as 90% of Ad5 seroprevlance in populations targeted for vaccination especially in the developing world <xref rid="pone.0106240-Kostense1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Pre-existing adenovirus immunity has been reported to diminish the magnitude of immune responses induced by the Ad5 vector <xref rid="pone.0106240-McElrath1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In the RV172 trial there was a non-significant trend of lower magnitude of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses in participants with higher baseline Ad5 titers. A modest reduction in the frequency of IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell ICS responses was also seen in the Ad5 seropositive vaccine recipients compared to those who were seronegative in the HVTN 204 study <xref rid="pone.0106240-Churchyard1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Other mechanisms of delivery may potentially modulate the effect of anti-vector immunity upon the immunogenicity of the rAd5. In parallel with the current study, another study compared subcutaneous, intradermal and intramuscular routes of administration of rAd5 vaccine boost after a DNA HIV vaccine prime and revealed a higher frequency of local reactions after subcutaneous and intradermal administration but no difference in humoral or cellular responses in the three study arms <xref rid="pone.0106240-Koblin1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In our study, Biojector delivery did not significantly improve vaccine immunogenicity in the setting of pre-existing Ad5 Ab.</p><p>Our study found that Env-specific antibody responses were more than 10-fold higher in subjects who received a secondary dose of rAd5 vaccine (group 2) than after a primary dose (group 1). A similar finding was noted in the HVTN 068 study where homologous immunization 24 weeks after the initial dose with a recombinant adenoviral vector vaccine enhanced post-boost Env specific antibody responses (20-fold to gp 140 and 8-fold to gp 41) in subjects with no pre-existing Ad5 immunity, but no increase in T cell responses were seen <xref rid="pone.0106240-DeRosa1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Group 2 included a minority of subjects (one in the N/S and 3 in the Biojector groups) who had preexisting immunity to Ad5 as a result of natural infection prior to receiving their first dose of rAd5 vaccine. The boost in response observed after another dose of rAd5 vaccine was seen in subjects with pre-existing neutralizing activity derived from natural infection and rAd5 immunization as well as in those with neutralizing activity from prior rAd5 immunizations alone. It is possible that the peak antibody response could be slightly different in the primary versus the secondary immunization groups. Therefore, comparing the responses at 4 weeks post immunization could potentially be misleading. However, in prior studies, the differences in 2, 4, or 6 weeks time points post immunization have been subtle and would not account for a 10-fold difference in response.</p><p>Subjects receiving secondary immunization included in our study had received their previous dose of rAd5 at varying intervals in the past with wide range of time periods between their previous and current rAd5 doses. We found that homologous boosting with rAd5 gene-based vectors can boost antibody responses despite pre-existing vector-specific immunity and this effect can be seen regardless of a prolonged interval between prime and boost.</p><p>IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot responses were similar in subjects receiving primary or secondary immunization. CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses evaluated at 4 weeks post rAd5 vaccine were of low magnitude and remained low throughout the study. Previous reports have described that rAd5 HIV vaccine induces primarily CD8+ T cell responses, which are considered an important element in controlling HIV infection <xref rid="pone.0106240-Musey1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0106240-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. There may be a modest increase in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in those receiving secondary immunization with Biojector delivery but the group sizes were too small to achieve statistical significance.</p><p>Although our study was limited by small group sizes and varying intervals of the previous rAd5 vaccine dose in those receiving a secondary immunization, we showed that Biojector delivery of the VRC rAd5 vaccine is well tolerated. Although needle-free delivery of rAd5 induced significant humoral and cellular immune responses it does not significantly improve vaccine immunogenicity. The most important finding in this trial was that homologous boosting with rAd5 gene-based vectors boosts antibody responses despite pre-existing vector-specific immunity and regardless of interval between prime and boost. Even though the negative results of HVTN 505 study will halt further evaluation of this rAd5 vaccine, results from our study remain applicable to other vaccine platforms that utilize recombinant adenoviral vectors. Our study suggests whether delivered needle-free or by N/S, additional doses could be considered if needed to extend the duration of immunity in prior recipients of recombinant adenoviral vector vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0106240.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>VRC 015 study CONSORT checklist of information.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0106240.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0106240.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Study Protocol VRC 015, A phase I, open-label clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and Immunogenicity of a multiclade recombinant HIV-1 adenoviral vector vaccine in uninfected adults randomized to needle or Biojector methods of intramuscular injection.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0106240.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the study volunteers and the community advisory board that support the importance of clinical trials evaluating candidate HIV vaccines.
