Non-major AE (NMAE) was defined as an event related to the PM implant procedure or the underlying medical condition without serious or potentially serious consequences, such as prolongation of hospitalization or the need to re-admit the patient to the hospital. For example, an episode of atrial fibrillation might have been classified as MAE or NMAE depending on its tolerability and need for continued or repetitive in-hospital care.

These differences were all statistically non-significant.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>Discussion</title><p>Telecardiology has unequivocally made positive contributions to the follow-up of patients, particularly for recipients of permanent PM, cardioverter defibrillators, and cardiac resynchronization devices. All manufacturers of implantable devices are currently involved in developing and perfecting these systems, which are all capable of remote consultations. However, their implementation remains heterogeneous, because of variable organizational or administrative factors among countries, including reimbursement for telemedicine. The HM system used in this trial allows a time-limited follow-up of the functions of implanted devices, as well as the continuous, daily surveillance of transmitted data, which can be reviewed on a dedicated and secure Internet site. A particularly notable characteristic of HM, besides its scheduled transmissions, is the warning messages that are issued in case of technical dysfunction or detectable clinical abnormality and that are addressed to the physician in charge of the patient via e-mail, fac simile, or text message or via all these means of communication. These warnings allow the anticipation and, when appropriate, the management of potentially harmful medical events. It is, however, noteworthy that HM is not a means of real-time management of emergencies, rather than a close surveillance system.</p><p>OEDIPE was the first trial designed to examine prospectively the role that HM might play in the first month after implantation of pacing systems or replacement of pulse generators. The increased risk of complications incurred in the weeks following implants of PM, as well as the medical and economic importance of shortening the hospital stay after surgical procedures, is well known.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EUN250C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EUN250C13">13</xref></sup> By study design, nearly 90% of the patients in the active group were discharged from the hospital within 24 h, compared with &#x0003c;30% in the control group. Although overnight hospitalizations for first implants and ambulatory replacements of pulse generators have been implemented in experienced medical centres, the mean post-operative hospital stay of 2.8 days in our control group indicates that these practices did not represent standard care among the 39 centres included in this study. The ability to remotely follow recipients of implanted devices post-operatively might facilitate the shortening of hospital stays.</p><p>The proportion of patients with at least one treatment- related MAE was similar in both study groups. This even distribution between the two groups satisfied the primary objective of the study, which was to confirm that HM allowed a significant shortening of the post-procedural hospitalization, while preserving a safety level similar to that associated with standard patient care. It is noteworthy that whereas the cumulative number of MAE was significantly lower in the active than in the control group, that of NMAE was significantly higher, such that the overall number of AE was similar in both groups. Instead of reflecting a higher morbidity, the higher number of NMAE in the active group might be attributable to the early detection of technical or clinical anomalies, which, otherwise, might have remained unnoticed without telecardiology surveillance. It is also noteworthy that, in both groups, 50% of the AE occurred in the hospital and could have been detected without the assistance of HM (<italic>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="EUN250TB3">3</xref></italic>). However, in the active group, after discharge from the hospital and up to 30 days of follow-up, 12 warning messages prompted the early detection of 4 MAE and 8 NMAE out of a total of 20 AE. The relatively high number of post-operative AE observed in this study was probably due to the inclusion of events that were not procedure-related, such as atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. However, these rhythm disturbances developing in the immediate post-operative period might be, in some cases, the first indication of an early complication. The single non-cardiac death observed in this trial was not related to the procedure, though was classified as MAE according to the pre-specified definitions of our protocol. This single death had no effect on the overall statistical outcome.</p><p>The retrospective analysis of the pooled data from the two groups, including the data from the control group available <italic>a posteriori</italic> to the expert committee, showed that over 80% of the technical AE could have been detected early. Although HM is sensitive in the detection of technical complications and arrhythmic episodes, its sensitivity is lower with respect to medical AE related to the surgical procedure, such as pulse generator pocket complications or development of a pneumothorax. Furthermore, warnings may be non-specific, as a single anomaly may trigger several different kinds of messages. From this perspective, HM is not an automatic surveillance system, and its data must be critically reviewed by the physician.</p><p>In the control group, the medical reaction time, based strictly on overtly abnormal clinical manifestations, was considerably longer than in the active group. The analysis of AWARE, a retrospective study of &#x0003e;11 000 patients in 23 countries, revealed that AE occurred, on average, 26 days after the last visit, advancing the diagnosis by a mean of 154 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EUN250C14">14</xref></sup> In the OEDIPE trial, besides the surveillance data routinely transmitted to the Internet site, an estimated 1 &#x000b1; 1.5 additional warning messages/patient/month were issued during the study, decreasing to 0.5 warning message/patient/month past the fifth day of enrolment in the trial, an estimate concordant with the 0.6 message/patient/month reported during the long-term follow-up of AWARE. The gradual decrease in the rate of warning messages following device implantation appears related to the optimization of the alert settings and to the elimination of warnings after a first event, for example, a first automatic mode switch. It is noteworthy that 40% of the overall patient population transmitted no warning message, though seven patients did experience a medical AE that could not have been detected by telecardiology. This strongly suggests that the absence of warning message excludes reliably the occurrence of undetected technical AE. A similar 47% of patients regularly monitored by telecardiology transmitted no warning message in the AWARE study.</p><p>Although HM decreased the duration of post-operative hospitalization by nearly 50% compared with the control group, the decrease in overall costs associated with this shortening of the hospital stay was not statistically significant, because of the reimbursement scheme based on diagnosis-related groups. Finally, the SF-36 questionnaire showed that telecardiology had no negative effect on the patients' quality of life.</p><p>The results of the OEDIPE trial, which combines abbreviated hospitalization with telecardiology follow-up after the first implant of pacing systems or replacement of pulse generators, demonstrate that this programme was safe and facilitated the monitoring of patients in the month following the procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by <grant-sponsor>Biotronik Inc.
