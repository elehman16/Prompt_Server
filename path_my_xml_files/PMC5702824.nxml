mobilization and chest wall stretch on respiratory muscle tone and stiffness and chest
expansion in stroke patients and to compare the effects of both interventions. [Subjects
and Methods] Subjects were randomly assigned to a rib cage joint mobilization group (n=15)
or a chest wall stretch group (n=15). Respiratory muscle tone and stiffness were measured
using a myotonometer, and the chest expansion was gauged using a measuring tape. [Results]
A significant difference was found on comparing the respiratory muscle tone and stiffness
on the affected and sound side before intervention. Although both groups showed an
increase in respiratory muscle tone and stiffness after intervention, no significant
difference was found. A significant increase in chest expansion was observed; however, no
significant difference was observed in the variations between the groups. [Conclusion]
This study suggests that rib cage joint mobilization and chest wall stretch exercises can
be used to increase chest expansion potential and respiratory muscle tone in patients with
chronic stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rib cage joint mobilization</kwd><kwd>Chest wall stretching</kwd><kwd>Muscle tone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the common problems that hospitalized stroke patients have is more likely to be
inspiration than expiration<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. An
inspiratory disorder is caused by respiratory muscle weakness<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> on the affected side and rib cage contracture<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interventions that increase rib cage mobility are
necessary, as the increased rib cage movement is effective in enhancing pulmonary function,
rib cage expansion, and respiratory muscle activation in stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Recent studies have objectively proved that stretch exercises and joint mobilization are
efficient methods for improving respiratory function in stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, even
though joint mobilization and stretch exercises both increase respiratory muscle
activation<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and rib cage expansion, no comparison has been made between the two
interventions. Since the measurement of respiratory function has only been made with regard
to pulmonary function, respiratory muscle activity, and chest expansion<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, an analysis of
respiratory muscle tone and stiffness by comparing unaffected and affected sides is
needed.</p><p>In previous studies, most cases involved the consideration of stretching exercises that
increase pulmonary function performed by stroke patients as compared with the control
group<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even though there are some
studies comparing joint mobilization exercises with threshold inspiratory muscle training or
respiratory muscle resistance exercise, the mobilization exercises in the previous studies
were combined with massage and applied to the entire rib cage<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The joint mobilization exercises in this study, however, are
characterized by the provision of vibration to a restricted area to induce the restoration
of movement<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of this study was to
investigate the immediate changes in respiratory muscle tone and stiffness and chest
expansion by comparing rib cage joint mobilization and chest wall stretch.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study involved 30 patients who had been diagnosed with stroke for 6 months or more,
and who were admitted in A and B Hospital in Anyang City, Gyeonggi. Subjects included those
who scored more than 24 points in the Korean mental status examination, who were at stage IV
or above in the Brunnstrom stage, who were at stage II or below in the Modified Ashworth
Scale (MAS), who had no orthopedic disease in the rib cage, and/or those who felt a firm
end-feel in their hands when slowly bending their whole body over in a lateral position.
Patients with a history of respiratory diseases or those who were considered to be unfit to
participate in the study by their physicians were excluded. Following selection, the
subjects were randomly divided into two groups: the rib cage joint mobilization (RCJM) group
(n=15; 12 males and three females; seven right hemiplegia, eight left hemiplegia; mean &#x000b1; SD:
weight, 72.7 &#x000b1; 2.8&#x02005;kg, time since stroke 10.6 &#x000b1; 0.9 months), and a chest wall stretch
exercise (CWSE) group (n=15; 10 males and five females; four right hemiplegia, 11 left
hemiplegia; mean &#x000b1; SD: weight; 70.3 &#x000b1; 1.5&#x02005;kg; time since stroke 11.9 &#x000b1; 3.1 months). In
addition, this study was approved by the local ethics committee of Yong-In University, and
the research was conducted after written consent was obtained from the subjects.</p><p>The entire evaluation was overseen by one physiotherapist who had had more than 5&#x02005;years of
work experience. In order to measure the muscle tone and stiffness of the stroke patients,
we used Myoton<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>PRO (Myoton AS, Estonia), the reliability and validity of which
has been proved<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The frequency (Hz)
represents the duration of the effect of the testing end on the muscle and is therefore
expressed as the muscle tone. Subjects underwent initial measurements after resting in the
supine position for 20 minutes. This study is based on a previous study, which measured
respiratory muscle activity, and aims to further measure the rectus abdominis muscles (RA),
external oblique abdominal muscles (EO), upper trapezius muscles (UT), both large latissimus
dorsi muscles (LD)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM). The SCM, RA, and EO were measured in the supine position,
whereas the LD and UT were measured in the prone position. First, the muscle belly of the
muscles to be measured in the supine position was marked using a marker that is harmless to
the human body. The measurement tool was placed vertically along the skin marker, and then
the muscles were measured 5 times. These subsequent 5 averages were used as data values.
With the patient in the prone position, the measurements were taken in the same manner as
the supine position. For this study, the post-test measurement was taken immediately after
the intervention.</p><p>Subjects&#x02019; chest expansion ability was measured using a tape measure (Hoechstmass-Rollfix,
Germany) while the subject breathed. While standing in an upright position, the subject
placed their arms and legs in a comfortable manner. The upper chest expansion was measured
horizontally along the chest using the fifth thoracic spinous processes as a basis, whereas
the lower chest expansion was measured using the tenth thoracic spinous processes as a
basis. Each patient&#x02019;s chest circumference was measured at their maximum inspiration and
expiration points, and the final measurement data were obtained by subtracting the minimum
inspiration value from the maximum expiration value. The inter-rater reliability of this
measurement method was found to be 0.99, which is close to 1<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, both joint mobilization and stretch exercises were performed by a
practitioner, who had taken the International Maitland Teachers&#x02019; Association level I course.
The intervention was performed while checking the patient&#x02019;s condition, and when there were
complaints of pain. The rib cage joint mobilization procedure consisted of applying a
posteroanterior unilateral costovertebral pressure, a posteroanterior unilateral
costovertebral pressure, and a posteroanterior central vertebral pressure<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before the initiation of the intervention,
the researcher applied posterior-anterior central vertebral pressure on the thoracic
zygapophyseal joint and costovertebral joint, and the joint with the most severe
hypomobility was noted. Joint mobilization was applied to the joint with hypomobility, with
the applied intensity being grade III<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Each intervention was performed as three sets of 30 repetitions for a minute with 1-minute
intermissions between the sets. The whole intervention took about 18 minutes to
complete.</p><p>For the chest wall stretch exercise, two kinds of stretch exercises were used. For the
first stretch exercise, the subjects were asked to lie in a supine position and inhale.
While inhaling, the space between the third and eighth ribs was stretched downward using the
index finger. When exhaling, the same method was used. In total, four kinds of stretch
exercises were performed 10 times each, ensuring that the total intervention time did not
extend beyond 10 minutes<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The second
stretch exercise, the trunk muscles stretch exercise, was performed as follows: (1) trunk
rotation from a sitting position, (2) lateral bending from a side-lying position, and (3)
trunk extension from a supine position. All of these were performed through active-assisted
exercises. If needed, a pillow was used<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The intervention was a repetition of 30 seconds of holding the
position and 30 seconds of rest, and it lasted for a total of 10 minutes.</p><p>All collected data were statistically analyzed using Windows version SPSS 20.0 (IBM,
Armonk, NY, USA). To test the normality of the subjects, the Shapiro-Wilk test was performed
to confirm normal distribution, and homogeneity was examined using an independent t-test and
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. The differences in respiratory muscle tone and stiffness and chest
expansion ability of paralyzed and non-paralyzed subjects were analyzed using a paired
t-test. The difference between the intervention groups was determined using an independent
samples t-test, and all statistical significance levels were set at p=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the present study, a significant difference in the tone and stiffness of SCM, EO, UT,

In this present study, the subjects showed a significant
increase in the tone and stiffness of SCM, EO, UT, and LD compared with the injured side
before the intervention took place. These results are considered to be due to excessive
respiration from the uninjured rib cage that occurred as the paralyzed side&#x02019;s respiratory
muscle was weakened.</p><p>In the present study, both the RCJM group and the CSWE group showed a significant increase
in the extension of chest expansion after intervention, and, while there were no significant
differences in their muscle tone and stiffness, there was an improvement on average.</p><p>According to Wang et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, the increase
in muscle tone and stiffness of respiratory muscles among paralyzed patients following
respiration exercises was a positive change in their respiratory muscles. Park<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that there was an increase in chest
expansion and respiratory muscle activity when rib cage joint mobilization was applied to
stroke patients. The findings of Yilmaz Yelvar et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> support our findings, as they demonstrated that after frequency
treatment was applied to patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the patients
showed an increase in inspiratory and expiratory pressures, even if their rib cages had
limitations. This is thought to be because of the repetitive motion of the joints and
because the chemical or mechanical stimuli are removed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, thus improving the flexibility of the chest and increasing the
muscle tone and stiffness of the respiratory muscles of the paralyzed area and also
increasing the range of motions in the rib cage.</p><p>In a previous study, Rattes et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>,
showed that the pulmonary function and total chest capacity of 10 stroke patients increased
after intervention with respiratory stretch exercises and that intercostal stretch applied
to healthy subjects resulted in an increase in their parasternal activity<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the increase in muscle length
during stretching affects the force-length relationship<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it is possible to increase muscle tone and stiffness and the
range of chest movements by increasing one&#x02019;s force production capacity.</p><p>In a study by Kim et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, which
compares stretching exercises and joint mobilization effects, patients with neck pain were
used as subjects. Upon comparing the two intervention methods applied, results showed that
the patients&#x02019; cervical range of motion significantly increased, but that there was no
significant difference between the each groups. In this study, both methods resulted in a
significant increase in chest expansion before and after the intervention. However, similar
to the previous study, there was no significant difference between the two intervention
methods in terms of respiratory muscle tone and stiffness and chest expansion ability.</p><p>This is thought to be because stroke patients experience a decrease in respiratory muscle
tone and stiffness, muscle shortening, and joint contracture all at the same time<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, both methods were necessary to
increase muscle tone and stiffness and chest expansion ability. In addition, there was no
difference between these two intervention methods because of this reason.</p><p>In this study, we could not control the psychological factors affecting muscle tone. The
effects were immediate, but the more long-term effects are yet to be seen. In future
studies, it may be possible to see greater differences if the psychological factors
affecting the subjects, and especially if both immediate and long-term effects, are taken
into consideration.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Pinheiro</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Polese</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Faria</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Inspiratory muscular weakness is most evident in chronic
