N=70 patients were evaluated. Primary efficacy outcome was ocular surface (OS) staining change on day 35 (D35), compared to baseline. Fluorescein and lissamine green were used for staining of cornea and conjunctiva. Secondary efficacy outcome included tear film breakup time, OS staining score on day 84 (D84), ocular comfort index, as well as patients&#x02019; and doctors&#x02019; evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared to day 0 (D0), 0.2% HA achieved a 47.7% reduction in staining score (&#x02212;3.00&#x000b1;2.81 [standard deviation] points, n=38 patients) at D35; 0.18% HA showed a 41.2% reduction (&#x02212;2.59&#x000b1;2.20 [standard deviation] points, n=32 patients). Statistical analysis showed noninferiority in efficacy of 0.2% HA compared to 0.18% HA on D35. At D84, the reduction in staining score had further increased to 64.5% for 0.2% HA and to 56.4% for 0.18% HA. Both eye drops improved tear film breakup time and ocular comfort index values. Investigators and patients assessed both treatments with 5 of 7 points (Likert Scale, medians). The rate of adverse events (AE) was 2.3% for 0.2% HA and 7.1% for 0.18% HA with no serious AE.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>0.2% and 0.18% HA eye drops significantly improved signs and symptoms of dry eye disease and were well tolerated with few AEs. Noninferiority of 0.2% HA compared to 0.18% HA was demonstrated for reduction of OS lesions. In some parameters, there was a nonsignificant trend in favor of 0.2% HA concentration.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>dry eye</kwd><kwd>hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>ocular surface lesions</kwd><kwd>ocular staining</kwd><kwd>keratoconjunctivitis sicca</kwd><kwd>eye drops</kwd><kwd>unpreserved</kwd><kwd>hyaluronate</kwd><kwd>fluorescein</kwd><kwd>lissamine green</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial condition that affects tears and ocular surface (OS).<xref rid="b1-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> DED can be associated with inflammation.<xref rid="b3-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Lesions of the cornea and conjunctiva may occur, affecting the integrity of the OS.<xref rid="b1-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients with DED may experience foreign body sensation, burning, itching and aching sensations, heavy eyes, fatigued eyes, and a decreased quality of vision, eg, stray light.<xref rid="b4-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> DED may also increase the risk of infections of the OS.<xref rid="b5-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The current understanding of the pathogenesis of dry eye is that the instability of the tear film and the increase of osmolarity result in a vicious circle and lead to inflammation of the OS.<xref rid="b3-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Substitution therapy is the therapy of choice for most forms of DED. The goal of topical therapy in the form of lubricating eye drops is to control the activity and progression of the disease, to decrease signs and symptoms related to dry eye, and, as such, to contribute to prevent or delay health consequences.<xref rid="b2-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Eye drops for DED therapy usually contain chemically inert macromolecules that adhere to the OS and can bind and retain water molecules. One of today&#x02019;s most commonly used polymers for tear substitution is sodium hyaluronate, resp. hyaluronic acid (HA). HA is a naturally occurring glycosaminoglycan or mucopolysachharide with a molecular weight of 50,000&#x02013;8,000,000 Da depending on substrate and method of presentation. HA is considered the most recent generation of dry eye lubricating therapy and is a naturally occurring polysaccharide mainly found in the vitreous body of the eye<xref rid="b6-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> as well as in tear fluid. HA has been used for many years in ophthalmology as a viscoelastic during cataract surgery, keratoplasty, and other procedures. HA eye drops for DED treatment entered the market in the early 1990s.<xref rid="b7-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Concentrations of HA in ophthalmics range from 0.003% to 0.4%.<xref rid="b8-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For DED therapy, higher HA concentrations, between 0.1% and 0.4%, are usually used.<xref rid="b7-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b10-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b15-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Preservative-free artificial tears have become more and more common in DED therapy. This is due to the fact that preservatives in ophthalmics, including the most frequently used benzalkonium chloride, have cytotoxic properties, disturbing the tear film. Especially during long-term use, preserved eye drops may cause more damage than benefit. When added as excipients in eye drops, preservatives may counteract the beneficial effect of the other ingredients and may even cause DED.<xref rid="b16-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>In previous clinical investigations performed in a similar population, 0.18% HA was demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior on the relief of symptoms of dry eyes over a saline solution and as noninferior to a 0.3% carbomer solution in a 304 patients, three parallel group clinical study.<xref rid="b11-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Based on these findings, the choice of 0.18% HA as comparator for a 0.2% HA formulation appeared to be scientifically relevant to perform this noninferiority study.</p><p>Some of the most serious consequences of untreated DED are lesions or epithelial defects of the cornea and conjunctiva. Cell defects can be quantified by staining with fluorescein or lissamine green.<xref rid="b17-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> While fluorescein stains corneal lesions by permeating in intercellular spaces associated with epithelial cellular disruption,<xref rid="b18-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> lissamine green stains damaged or devitalized conjunctival cells.<xref rid="b19-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Our study used staining scores to quantify the clinical effect of unpreserved 0.2% HA (Hylo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Confort Plus; Laboratoires Ursapharm Sas, Sarreguemines, France), which has a molecular weight of 2,400,000&#x02013;2,800,000 Da and 0.18% HA (Vismed<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Multi, TRB Chemedica AG, Haar, Germany).

Pinto-Fraga et al<xref rid="b14-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and Lopez-de la Rosa et al<xref rid="b13-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> describe in double-masked, randomized trials reduced corneal and conjunctival staining after 1 month application of unpreserved 0.2% or 0.3% HA eye drops, respectively, while saline 0.9% alone yielded increased staining values, indicating exacerbation of DED. In another study, 0.4% HA was used and led to a decrease in rose bengal staining after 7 days of treatment, probably due to the higher HA concentration.<xref rid="b8-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> It may be concluded that 0.1% HA in eye drops may not be adequate to improve rose bengal staining in DED but enough for fluorescein staining.</p><p>In the present study, OS staining served as the primary outcome variable. On D35, a 47.7% reduction in staining score in the 0.2% HA treatment group and a 41.2% reduction in patients treated with 0.18% HA were observed. Staining values further decreased between D35 and D84. On D84, staining was reduced 64.5% with 0.2% HA and 56.4% with 0.18% HA, compared to baseline values at D0. Despite the tendency for lesser staining with 0.2% HA eye drops, there was no statistical difference in our study between 0.2% and 0.18% HA. Statistical analysis of the present data, based on criteria predefined in the study protocol, shows noninferiority of 0.2% HA compared to 0.18% HA. Investigators and patients assessed both eye drops with a median score of 5 of 7 points (Likert scale).</p><p>Alteration of the OS can be considered a hallmark of DED and thus an important clinical marker for therapy success.<xref rid="b23-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> HA has excellent moisturization and surface cell adhesion properties and is a component of the natural tear fluid.<xref rid="b24-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Its properties led to the development of HA-containing eye drops and gels for DED treatment. HA eye drops may be promoting OS tissue healing by humidifying the OS, thus bringing back the integrity of corneal and conjunctival epithelium. It has been shown that topically applied HA stimulates wound healing in an animal model<xref rid="b25-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation, thus improving dry eye symptoms.<xref rid="b26-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Both eye drops of this study were unpreserved but had different excipients (0.2% HA: sorbitol, citrate buffer, 0.18% HA: sodium chloride, potassium, magnesium, calcium, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium citrate). While it cannot be excluded that excipients could account for the slightly higher efficacy of 0.2% HA, the difference could be due to the 0.02% higher HA concentration, compared to 0.18%. As Abelson<xref rid="b27-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> points out, direct comparisons of HA products should take into account that the viscoelasticity and efficacy of HA-based products do vary not only by concentration but also depend on molecular weight.</p><p>The study safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of both tested HA eye drops and were judged as being related to the dry eye underlying condition. The rate of AEs and treatment discontinuation due to AEs was 2.3% for 0.2% HA and 7.1% for 0.18% HA. No serious AE was reported.</p><p>Both eye drops caused clinically and statistically relevant improvement of &#x0003e;50% in staining score and 40%&#x02013;50% in OCI throughout the study. The data suggest that 0.2% HA and 0.18% HA are efficacious concentrations of HA for treatment of moderate to severe dry eye. Safety data were consistent with the known safety profile of both investigational products. Thus, 0.2% HA and 0.18% HA fit well into the big portfolio of novel topical treatment options of DED.<xref rid="b28-opth-11-631" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study suggests that both 0.2% HA and 0.18% HA are efficacious and safe for the treatment of moderate to severe DED.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This clinical study was funded by Ursapharm.
