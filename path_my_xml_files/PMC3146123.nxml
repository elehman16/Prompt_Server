Opioids are the important analgesic used for intraoperative and postoperative pain relief. But opioids itself has its own side effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>. Nowadays drugs like COX2 inhibitors and calcium channel modulators (Pregabalin and Gabapentin) are been increasingly used for postoperative pain management effectively. This has the advantage of avoiding the side effects of oipiods. Pregabalin and Gabapentin are structural analog of GABA. Pregabalin selectively binds to &#x000e1;2&#x000e4; subunit of voltage-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels which results in reduction of neurotransmitter release and hence a decrease in neuronal hyperexcitability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. Pregabalin is several times more potent than the gabapentin. It is rapidly absorbed orally, achieves peak plasma levels within 30 min to 2 h<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. Pregabalin has fewer side effects, with the most common adverse events being dizziness and somnolence. Any visceral irritation causes release of excitatory neurotransmitters which causes pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>.

In a study conducted by R. Jokela et al, showed no reduction in anxiety scores seen with 75mg and 150mg, which was conducted in laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>. The reduction in anxiety score showed no difference between pregabalin 150mg and pregabalin 300mg groups, but was appreciably better than the placebo group. As our study was conducted in patients with spinal anaesthesia who were conscious we were able to assess the anxiety level more appropriately. The time of rescue analgesia required by the patients was increased in pregabalin group. Pregabalin 300mg showed more effective prolongation of analgesia than pregabalin group 150mg and group P (0). Pregabalin 300mg showed prolonged analgesia after spinal anaesthesia. This prolongation in the analgesia was correlating well with the half life of pregabalin which is 4.6 hrs to 6.8 hrs<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>. The advantage was that along with prolongation of analgesia there was no hemodynamic instability.</p><p>Experimental models of neuropathic pain and inflammatory hyperalgesia have shown that g-aminobutyric acid analogues such as gabapentin and pregabalin have antinociceptive and antihyperalgesic properties<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>. Central neuronal sensitization may result in an amplification of postoperative pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, and that preoperative administration of gabapentin, may reduce the degree of central sensitization<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. Because of its absence of hepatic metabolism, it has good pharmacokinetic properties and fewer drug interactions which make it a better drug than Gabapentin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>.</p><p>On comparing the complications like sedation, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, the incidences of dizziness in patients receiving pregabalin 300mg was more than those who receiving 150mg and placebo group. Incidence of the nausea and vomiting (P=0.47, and P=0.69) showed no significant difference between the groups.</p><p>A. Agarwal et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> showed that a single dose of pregabalin 150mg was effective in reducing postoperative pain after laproscopic cholecystectomy. He also showed that 150mg has no significant complication than placebo group.</p><p>In a study conducted by Hill et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> compared pregabalin (50 and 300 mg) to placebo and 400 mg of ibuprofen in 198 patients who had undergone elective surgery to remove one or two third molars in terms of pain relief and pain intensity. Pain relief and pain intensity were significantly better in the 300 mg pregabalin group.</p><p>In a study conducted by Wichai Ittichaikulthol MD et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref> 300 mg pregabalin administered 1 hr pre-operatively before abdominal hysterectomy with/without salphingo-oophorectomy significantly reduced, VNRS pain score and improved satisfaction score at 24 hr post operatively.</p><p>In a study conducted by R. Jokela et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref> they found that 300 mg of pregabalin was more effective than pregabalin 150 mg. The incidence of dizziness, headache and blurred vision were higher in the 300 mg pregabalin group. Garaj<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref> reviewed the pharmacology of pregabalin and found that somnolence (29.2%) and dizziness (22.2%) were the most common side effects which were similar to the present study (dizziness/ somnolence 34.21%) which was well seen in our study.</p><p>Patient satisfaction in our study also showed good with pregabalin 300mg group (73.00&#x000b1;5.75) than 150mg group (69.60&#x000b1;11.66) and group P(0) (37.7&#x000b1;12.66).</p><p>The reduction in mean blood pressure and heart rate was seen in all groups, which was significant between pregabalin group and placebo group. But there was no significant difference seen between 300mg and 150mg groups. This may be due to the effect of spinal anaesthesia which was given, but further studies have to be done to evaluate this finding.</p><p>With this study, we came to know that pregabalin significantly reduced anxiety level, requirement of supplementary analgesic, than placebo group. Complications like sedation, dizziness was more with 300mg than 150mg, and patient satisfaction showed almost equal between 150 and 300mg group.</p><p>We conclude that Pregabalin 150mg would be the optimal preemptive dose for hysterectomy under spinal anaesthesia. Pregabalin being an oral drug which would be easy for the patients to take and also its prolongation of the neuraxial block helps in immediate postoperative analgesia and further reduction of other parentral analgesics. Further studies should be done to find optimal dose of pregabalin for other various surgery done under neuraxial block.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref
