It is a heterogeneous disorder that is recessively inherited and results from various mutations of the genes which code for globin chains of hemoglobin (Hb) leading to reduced or absent synthesis of globin chains.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The reduced supply of globin diminishes the production of hemoglobin tetramers, causing hypochromia and microcytosis. Unbalanced accumulation of &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; subunits occurs because the synthesis of the unaffected globins proceeds at a normal rate. Unbalanced chain accumulation dominates the clinical phenotype. Clinical severity varies widely, depending on the degree to which the synthesis of the affected globin is impaired and the synthesis of other globin chains is altered, and co-inheritance of other abnormal globin alleles.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The basic nature of these genetic defects has not been defined. Different types of thalassemia with different clinical and biochemical manifestations are associated with defects in each kind of polypeptide chain (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4;). In contrast to the hemoglobinopathies, no basic chemical abnormality of hemoglobin species lies behind the thalassemias.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In Ayurveda, <italic>Acharya</italic> Charaka described <italic>Beejadushtijanya Vikara</italic>. He explained that specific <italic>Avayava</italic> would be <italic>Vikrita</italic>, if <italic>Doshas</italic> vitiate specific <italic>Beeja</italic> or <italic>Beejabhaga</italic>. Considering this it can be considered as thalassemia. It can also be called <italic>Sahaja</italic> or <italic>Aadibalapravritta Vikara</italic>.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Thalassemia: A health burden</title><p>As per the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates, 4.5% of the world's population are carriers of hemoglobinopathies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Over 200 million people in the world and around 20 million in India carry the gene for &#x003b2;-thalassemia. One lakh children are born the world over with the homozygous state for thalassemia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Frequency of thalassemia gene in the Indian population varies between 0 and 17% in different ethnic groups, with an average of over 3%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The frequency of Thalassemia trait is 3-18% in northern India and 1-3% or less in the south. A higher frequency is noted in certain communities, viz. Sindhis, Kutchis, Lohanas, Bhanushalis, Punjabis, Mahers, Agris, Goud Saraswats, Gowdas, etc.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Also, 10,000 thalassemic children are born every year in India.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Nearly Rs. 1000 crore is spent for the treatment of thalassemia per annum. One out of every eight carriers of thalassemia worldwide lives in India. This is of particular importance in developing countries like India, where it increases the burden of health care delivery system.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The mainstay of managing these cases is repeated blood transfusion. Due to frequent blood transfusion, patients develops iron overload which results in growth failure, hypogonadism, diabetes, and hepatic disease. It can be reduced by regular chelation therapy. But iron chelators are costly and have side effects like growth retardation, visual and auditory toxicity, cataracts (with desferrioxamine) and arthropathy, and agranulocytosis (with deferiprone).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>To observe the efficacy of <italic>Triphaladi Avaleha</italic> as a hepato-splenoprotective agent, RBCs life prolonger and iron chelator in the management of thalassemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection of the patients</title><p>Pre-diagnosed patients of thalassemia major attending the OPD of Department of Kaumarabhritya, I.

All these factors improve the quality of life of thalassemic patients.</p><p>Serum ferritin level is the hematological criterion for assessing iron overload in thalassemic patients. Decreased serum ferritin indicates decreased iron overload in the patients. Though the comparative data are statistically not significant, the trial group decreased serum ferritin level by 3.75%, while in control group, serum ferritin level was increased by 23.96%. This showed that trial drug had good result to decrease the iron overload in thalassemic patients in comparison to control drug. The level of serum iron was increased. No particular reason was found for the decrease in serum ferritin and increase in serum iron levels. Further extensive studies are needed to evaluate these findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p>There is no exact correlation for thalassemia in Ayurveda. <italic>Beejabhagavayavadushti</italic> is found to be the chief factor in this disease.
