Latanoprost is a prostaglandin analog used to treat glaucoma. It can cause adverse effects, such as periocular hyperpigmentation.

Digital photographs were taken at baseline and 3 months after the last treatment session.

The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran. The research project number was 392019. Subjects were 28 otherwise healthy individuals, aged 15 to 50 years, with skin phototype II to IV with hypopigmented scars. Reasons for exclusion were: Pregnancy or intention to become pregnant; breastfeeding; severe systemic diseases; history of having taken systemic retinoid within the previous 6 months; using depigmenting or pigmenting products on the scar site during the preceding 3 months; and allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the product under investigation.</p><p>After written informed consent, the patients were allocated into two groups using a table of random numbers: fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser plus latanoprost 0.005% (<italic>n</italic> = 14) (group A), and fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser plus placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 14) (group B). On the first visit, a general clinical examination and an interview on medical history and concomitant therapies were performed. Questionnaires that included information about age, sex, time of scar appearance and scar location were completed. The product to be tested was latanoprost 0.005% (50 Mcg/Ml ophtalmic Solution; SinaDarou Co., Iran) packaged in droppers as against the placebo (Distilled water) packaged in identical droppers. Each subject received one of both products with the dose of one drop over an area measuring approximately 2 by 2 cm, twice daily for 24 weeks on the scar locations. The first topical application was performed on site by the investigator and for the first week. After being familiarized with the method of correct application, each subject applied the products at home for the following 23 weeks. At the end, drug accountability was performed to control compliance. Each group underwent six treatment sessions at 1-month intervals of fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser (Edge fractional, Jeisys Co., Seoul, South Korea). The treatment settings were 400 to 500 mJ, pulse interval 0.03 ms and 0.4-mm density in square shape scan pattern fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser. Patients were also instructed to avoid the use of any systemic or topical drug during the course of treatment. Photographs were taken using identical camera settings (Canon D30, Canon Inc., Tokyo, Japan), lighting, and patient positioning at baseline and 3 months after the last treatment session.</p><p>Two blinded dermatologists performed clinical assessments in a blinded fashion by comparing before and after photographs using a 4-point scale (grade 1, 0-25% = minimal improvement; grade 2, 26-50% = moderate improvement; grade 3, 51-75% = marked improvement; and grade 4, &#x02265;76% = near total improvement). Local tolerance was evaluated at each assessment period (1-month intervals) by direct evaluation for erythema, crusting and desquamation. Also, investigators assessed and recorded possible side effects, including bleeding, pain, pruritus, burning, and contact dermatitis, hypertrichosis at each visit (between 1-month intervals). Three months after the final treatment session, the data were reassessed and analyzed. Patient satisfaction was scored from 0 to 10 on a visual analog scale from (VAS).

Most patients had marked clinical improvement in their hypopigmented scars. So, our observations suggest that latanoprost may be used for treating such scars. Theoretically, the mechanisms of the function of laser resurfacing include tissue ablation, immediate collagen shrinkage, and dermal collagen remodeling. Columns of microscopic ablated epidermis and dermis, after treatment with fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser, may result in macroscopic epidermal regeneration as evidenced by clinical improvement of scar and skin color and texture.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] It is possible that fractional resurfacing causes normal melanocytes from surrounding tissue to repopulate this newly resurfaced tissue resulting in increased overall pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] But histologic studies are needed to further elucidate the healing process and confirm the movement of melanocytes into the treated area.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Glaich <italic>et al.</italic>, used the 1,550-nm fractional laser to treat seven patients with hypopigmented scars on the face, and found 51% to 75% improvement in six of these patients after two to four treatments. Patients also reported improvement lasting longer than 3 months after the last treatment.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Darkening of eyelid skin or other sites around the eye has been reported as an occasional side effect associated with Prostaglandin Analogs therapy (PGAs) (e.g. latanoprost).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Latanoprost is a 17 phenyl-substituted analogue of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), which is used for open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension as an ophthalmic solution because of its efficacy and minimal systemic adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, a cause-and-effect relationship has been questioned by some authors because the evidence is based predominantly on case reports.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The prostaglandin-associated pigmentation is most noticeable in the skin of the eyelids and can become apparent in a matter of months, although it has been reported that the side effect can take as long as 3 years after the start of prostaglandin treatment to become manifest.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The mechanism by which PGA-associated periocular skin pigmentation occurs is unclear.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These events seem to involve melanogenesis, without there being obvious melanocyte proliferation, inflammation or melanocyte atypia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It is likely that the PGAs stimulate prostaglandin receptors, such as the FP receptor, to initiate melanogenesis and tissue darkening.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Also PGF2_ stimulates the activity and expression of tyrosinase, the ratelimiting enzyme in melanin synthesis, and the PGF2 alpha receptor has been shown to be up-regulated by UV radiation in melanocytes <italic>in vitro</italic> and in human skin <italic>in vivo</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The grade of hyperpigmentation increases with increased exposure to the drug, suggesting a possible dose dependency of the PGAs -induced pigmentation.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] It should be noted that frequent contact of the topical prostaglandin analogue with the skin is a contributing factor to pigmentation and that PGAs -induced pigmentation appeared most frequently after 3 months.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Also in our study, patients were instructed to apply topical latanoprost twice a day for 6 months. The results of the Massaki <italic>et al.</italic> study showed that combining fractionated laser systems with topical bimatoprost, a PGA, and tretinoin or pimecrolimus had significant improvement (&#x0003e;50%) in more than 85% (12/14) of the patients treated.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This result is compatible with our study. The limitations of our study were small sample size, lack of histopathologic evaluation and lack of objective methods for result assessment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion although Fractional CO<sub>2</sub> laser plus topical latanoprost provides a safe and effective treatment of hypopigmented scarring, further studies are needed to help define the optimal treatment parameters and other potential indications for this topical latanoprost.
