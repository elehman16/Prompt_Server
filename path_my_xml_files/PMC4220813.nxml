There are approximately 18,000 patients in the UK with MFS. MFS is diagnosed clinically using the Ghent criteria which emphasizes the identification of a positive family history, ectopia lentis, aortic root dilatation Z-score &#x0003e;2, and a systemic score of clinical features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Twenty-five percent of cases are the result of a new mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene, and are often more seriously affected than familial cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gene mutations in <italic>FBN1</italic> have been demonstrated in 92% of classically affected MFS type 1 cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other genes capable of causing familial ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms are now being described, but these families can usually be differentiated clinically from MFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root is the most serious cardiovascular manifestation of MFS. This results from weakening of the tissues within the aortic wall and consequent reduced ability to contain the forces associated with cardiac ejection. The natural history of aortic root aneurysms is expansion over many years followed by dissection and rupture and premature death. In addition, myxomatous valve changes with insufficiency of the mitral and aortic valves, and progressive myocardial dysfunction can also occur and require intervention, and a wide range of non-cardiac manifestations affecting skeletal and ocular systems result in significant morbidity and mortality. The average age at death of an untreated MFS patient is 32&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Current treatment includes careful follow-up and prophylactic surgical intervention to replace the aneurysmal root when the risk of spontaneous dissection or rupture exceeds that of surgery. For most patients this risk is judged by the size of the aortic root, with the standard threshold at which patients are usually considered for prophylactic surgical treatment being 50&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In some patients with an adverse family history, or where pregnancy is considered or where rapid dilatation is observed, surgical intervention may be considered at diameters below 50&#x000a0;mm.</p><sec><title>Medical treatment</title><p>The goal of medical therapy in MFS is to slow or arrest the development of clinical manifestations of MFS. With respect to the cardiovascular system, the current gold standard for medical treatment is with oral beta blockers. Beta blocker therapy has been shown in retrospective and prospective studies to reduce the rate of aortic root dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and is associated with an increase in life span [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mechanism is unknown but is likely to be mediated through reduction in left ventricular ejection force, blood pressure, and pulse pressure, all of which potentially reduce aortic wall stress. However, recent studies in children with MFS and a meta-analysis have cast doubt on the efficacy of beta blocker therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, many patients cannot tolerate beta blockers (approximately 25% to 50% of MFS patients), either because they have asthma, which affects about 20% of MFS children, or because of intolerable side effects including dizziness, nightmares, and lethargy, or can only tolerate them in small doses. Furthermore, beta blocker therapy does not alter the underlying process that results in weakness and dilatation of the aortic wall.</p></sec><sec><title>Fibrillin-1</title><p>Fibrillin-1 is the major component of extracellular myofibrils which form the backbone of the elastic tissues in the extracellular matrix. Original hypotheses of the pathogenesis of MFS were based on a simple model of aortic dilatation occurring as a mechanical consequence of abnormal elastic tissues. However, such a hypothesis does not explain many manifestations of MFS including excessive growth and abnormal alveolar septation.</p><p>Elucidating the mechanisms of aortic dilatation has been facilitated by the development of an MFS knockout mouse. The so-called mgR mouse has an identical mutation of fibrillin-1 as that seen in human MFS and the mutant allele produces structurally normal fibrillin-1 protein at 15% of the normal level. The mouse manifests all the clinical features of human MFS including the mouse equivalent of postnatally-acquired aortic disease and death by aortic dissection, as well as lung and skeletal findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Homozygous mgR mice die between 3 and 6&#x000a0;months of age of dissecting aortic aneurysm. The mice show loss of structural integrity of the aortic wall with cystic medial necrosis, histologically identical to that seen in human MFS. Breach of the elastic laminae in fibrillin-1 mutant mice is believed to allow infiltration of inflammatory cells into the media, resulting in intense elastolysis associated with increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Research in this mouse model has elucidated a much more complex role for fibrillin-1 in the regulation of extracellular activity of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-&#x003b2;). Abnormal fibrillin-1 leads to excess activity of TGF-&#x003b2; in extracellular tissues and this appears to contribute to the pathogenesis of many of the phenotypic features of MFS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Myxomatous changes of the mitral valve in mutant mice were correlated with excess TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, and prevented by TGF-&#x003b2; antagonism <italic>in vivo</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, increased TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in association with increased MMP expression was also observed in the dura and aortic wall of fibrillin-1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These mice were shown to have excess immunoreactive free TGF-&#x003b2;, and systemic administration of a TGF-&#x003b2; neutralizing antibody rescued lung morphogenesis in fibrillin-1-deficient mice, and attenuated changes in the aortic wall.</p></sec><sec><title>The renin-angiotensin system and TGF-&#x003b2; regulation</title><p>Extracellular TGF-&#x003b2; is also regulated by the autocrine molecule angiotensin II. Activation of the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) can increase the production of TGF-&#x003b2;, which may be responsible for many of the cellular events in the tissue of patients with MFS including proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and levels of MMPs. By contrast, activation of the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2) has beneficial effects on aortic wall homeostasis. Selective inhibition of the AT1 receptor therefore offers a therapeutic target to favorably modify the pathogenesis of tissue injury in MFS. AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) include a number of commonly used antihypertensive medications including losartan and irbesartan. In the experimental mouse, ARB administration resulted in a clinically relevant decrease in TGF-&#x003b2; signaling, reduced plasma levels of free TGF-&#x003b2;, reduced tissue expression of TGF-&#x003b2;-responsive genes, and reduced levels of intracellular mediators within the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling cascade, such as phosphorylated Smad2.</p><p>Habashi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] reported that five young Marfan mice were given 0.6&#x000a0;g/L of losartan, consumed through their drinking water for a period of 6 to 10&#x000a0;months. Another group of ten MFS mice were given a placebo, and a third group of seven MFS mice were given a dose of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L of propranolol, a beta blocker. A fourth group of eleven wild-type mice without MFS served as a control group. The mice studied were 2&#x000a0;months old when therapy was started, equivalent to human teenage years. These mice already had enlarged aortas. After the mice were treated for 6&#x000a0;months, examination of the aorta histologically showed losartan, as opposed to placebo or propranolol, prevented elastic fiber fragmentation, and blunted TGF-&#x003b2; signaling in the aortic media. Additionally, echocardiographic measurements of aortic root growth in losartan MFS mice were comparable to the normal control group of mice (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55), and the absolute aortic root diameter between losartan MFS mice and the normal control group at the end of treatment was also similar (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32). Losartan MFS mice also showed significant improvement in aortic wall thickness and aortic wall architecture compared to placebo, and normalization relative to the normal control group. In comparison, propranolol-treated MFS mice showed a slower rate of aortic growth compared to the placebo group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001), but showed no effect on aortic wall thickness or aortic wall architecture compared to the placebo group, thus limiting its effect in slowing the rate of aortic growth.</p><p>Therefore it is particularly attractive to consider the use of an ARB, which both lowers blood pressure comparably with beta blocker therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (a known positive effect in MFS) and leads to a clinically relevant decrease of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These data support the hypothesis that many features of MFS are probably due to failure of proper regulation of TGF-&#x003b2; function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>ARBs in human MFS</title><p>Pilot data of 18 severe neonatal MFS cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] treated with losartan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] indicated that placing an affected infant on an ARB was associated with a reduction in the rate of aortic root dilatation. Preliminary data indicated the average change in aortic root diameter pre-losartan treatment was 3.5&#x000a0;mm/yr and following losartan treatment was 0.5&#x000a0;mm/yr. This compares with an average change in aortic root diameter of 1.67&#x000a0;mm/yr in patients treated with beta blockers alone. This pilot data suggests that a clinical trial of an ARB may demonstrate effects more specific than, and probably additive to, beta blockers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>In the Aortic Irbesartan Marfan Study (AIMS), we wish to translate the pre-clinical, neonatal, and pediatric work into a randomized clinical trial (RCT) to investigate whether the ARB irbesartan can reduce aortic dilatation in patients with MFS compared to placebo. All patients will receive standard treatments including beta blocker therapy if tolerated. We believe this will provide additional information regarding the effects of combined therapy as well as the effects in patients intolerant of beta blockers. Furthermore, we propose to examine the effects of irbesartan in a wider age range, extending the upper adult age limit to 40&#x000a0;years, since patients are often first diagnosed in adulthood.</p><p>A study funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) of losartan versus beta blocker is being carried out in the USA. This study has recruited 604 patients and is also evaluating effects on aortic dilatation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The USA study has a different design to the one described in this protocol, since the AIMS trial is comparing irbesartan versus placebo, but the two trials will provide complementary information on this important question.</p><p>It is widely accepted that aortic root dilatation is the hallmark of serious cardiovascular complications in MFS. Furthermore, aortic root dilatation is usually the major factor considered in referring patients for surgery. Therefore, while being a surrogate outcome measure, clinical outcome and the decision to intervene are directly related to aortic dilatation. We have considered conducting a clinical outcome study in MFS (evaluating the effects of irbesartan on rates of death, aortic surgery, or other serious cardiovascular complications) but this study would probably take 10&#x000a0;years or more to complete in order to assess the true long-term effects of treatment. For this reason we have selected the rate of aortic root dilatation as the primary outcome measure. We believe that the main benefit of ARB treatment will be in the prevention of aortic complications when applied as a prophylactic measure in patients with MFS who are either in their growing years or in adulthood prior to the development of severe dilatation. We consider that this is too long to wait to introduce a potentially lifesaving treatment for young patients at risk of severe complications. It is important to be aware of the level of evidence needed to introduce a new treatment for MFS, but the carefully considered opinion of the MFS experts collaborating in this study is that a significant reduction in aortic dilatation would provide important clinical benefits to patients, and that this measure is a robust surrogate for clinical outcomes. Previous studies that showed the benefits of beta blockers in MFS used the same outcome of aortic dilatation as the primary outcome measure. We also know that there is increasing use of ARBs among patients with MFS even though there is no clear evidence of efficacy or indeed safety for this indication, and thus there is an urgent need to complete studies of the efficacy of ARBs in MFS.</p></sec><sec><title>Feasibility</title><p>MFS patients require lifelong monitoring and many need major surgery. As a healthcare burden comparison there are about 8,000 patients with Cystic Fibrosis in the UK who generally require a greater level of ongoing healthcare support than MFS patients, but there are important similarities in that both conditions are inherited, affect young people, and reduce life expectancy.</p><p>MFS patients currently suffer great fear about their long-term prognosis and if effective, irbesartan would provide a lifesaving treatment option which could extend life span into the normal range. There is tremendous support from the medical community and lay MFS population to perform this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim of study</title><p>To investigate whether the angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan reduces the rate of aortic dilatation in MFS compared to placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This trial is an investigator-led, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase III, multicenter study.

Fibrillin-1 mutation analysis will be performed for those patients whose mutation status is unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Aortic dilatation will be measured by echocardiography. All annual echocardiograms will be analyzed by an established echo core laboratory. Patients will be seen in centers that have routine access to standard M-mode, two-dimensional (2-D) echocardiography. Transthoracic M-mode, 2-D, and Doppler echocardiograms will be performed by experienced technicians, according to a standardized protocol. Each center will be trained on the standardized protocol prior to commencing the trial. Aortic root diameter will be measured at the annulus, in the sinuses of Valsalva at the tip of the open cusps at 90&#x000b0; to the direction of flow, the sinotubular junction, ascending aorta, aortic arch, and descending aorta.</p><p>Each echocardiogram will be sent electronically to the echocardiographic core laboratory at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, where a single experienced investigator will supervise the reading and interpretation of all echocardiograms according to a standardized protocol to reduce variability due to observer variation. The echo core laboratory will be blinded to the study drug allocation to eliminate any bias in echo measurement. Quality control processes will be developed as part of the echo protocol.

For patients who have not already had fibrillin-1 mutation screening, but who are considered clinically affected with MFS, a 5&#x000a0;mL EDTA blood sample will be collected and stored for assay. Samples will be analyzed and funded as per usual local arrangements.</p><p>Samples from units which do not have funding for these tests should be sent directly to the Sonalee Laboratory, St. George&#x02019;s, University of London, London, UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Samples will be entered in the research program assay, and research laboratory reports will be issued.</p><p>A separate genetic sub-study will be undertaken to investigate the correlation between the response to medication and the site and type of mutation which determine the phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Patients will consent to this sub-study separately from the main trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional investigations and sub-studies</title><p>To increase knowledge about the underlying disease and the potential mechanism of action of ARBs, several sub-studies are proposed. The main proposed sub-studies are:</p><p>1. Genetic sub-studies: a) fibrillin-1 mutation analysis; and b) pharmacogenetics sub-study</p><p>2. Total circulating TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><sec><title>Electronic case record form (eCRF)</title><p>Trial data will be captured on a web-based eCRF. The eCRF will be designed in accordance with the requirements of the trial protocol and will comply with regulatory requirements. Access to the eCRF will be password-protected.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacovigilance</title><p>The Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust (Sponsor) has delegated responsibility for pharmacovigilance to the trial coordinating center, the CTEU of the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust. The CTEU will be responsible for recording all reported SAEs from investigational trial sites, and expedited reporting of SUSARs in accordance with statutory regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse event (AE)</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an IMP, whether or not considered related to the IMP.</p></sec><sec><title>Adverse reaction (AR)</title><p>Adverse reactions (ARs) are all untoward and unintended responses to an IMP related to any dose administered. All AEs judged by either the reporting investigator or the sponsor as having reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as ARs.</p><p>In the event an AR is reported during the trial, investigators will assess the severity of the AE using the following criteria, detailed on the AE report form in the eCRF:</p><p>1. Mild: awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would not require medication</p><p>2. Moderate: discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual activities</p><p>3. Severe: inability to do work or usual activities; signs and symptoms may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation and/or treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Unexpected adverse reaction (UAR)</title><p>An unexpected adverse reaction (UAR) is an AR, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the applicable product information (summary of product characteristics, SmPC). When the outcome of the AR is not consistent with the applicable product information this AR should be considered as unexpected. Side effects documented in the SmPC which occur in a more severe form than anticipated are also considered to be unexpected.</p></sec><sec><title>Expected drug-related AR</title><p>Expected drug-related ARs will be referred to the SmPC as provided and the summary in Additional file. Symptomatic hypotension defined as systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;90&#x000a0;mmHg in combination with dizziness and/or syncope on standing is considered an expected AR and will be reported on a specific AE form. Any other AR will be reported on a generic AE form on the eCRF.</p></sec><sec><title>Reporting ARs</title><p>Investigators will report all ARs on the AE report form in the eCRF including information of the event, details of date of onset, frequency, severity, and potential relationship to treatment, outcomes, and action taken. Investigators will make a clinical judgement as to the appropriate action required depending on the severity of the reaction. This could include monitoring the patient over a period of time, interrupting the drug regime, discontinuing the patient from the trial, or continuing with the trial as specified. Investigators will submit AE reports to the CTEU after each patient visit. The CTEU will maintain a database of all ARs. AEs will be reviewed at regular intervals by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) for signal and trend analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious adverse events (SAEs)/reactions</title><p>SAEs or reactions are defined as any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing inpatient hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.</p><p>Should a study participant become pregnant while undertaking the trial, or aid in the conception of a child while they are participating in the trial, the pregnancy and resulting child should be followed up for a period of no less than 18&#x000a0;months. In this trial should a child be followed up and diagnosed with MFS, this would not be considered unexpected due to the nature of the syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Expected SAEs (as a result of the underlying disease)</title><p>Expected SAEs as a result of the underlying disease include: admission or procedure for MFS including treatment for cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ocular, and thoracic complications; aortic dissection; aortic regurgitation requiring surgery; emergency or elective aortic root and/or valve replacement surgery; cerebrovascular accident; and cardiovascular death, sudden death, or death during surgery.</p><p>Expected SAEs will be reported as per the usual data capture requirements for the study and are not subject to expedited reporting.</p><p>Other SAEs which are not expected irrespective of causality will be subject to SAE reporting requirements. In the event of an SAE, investigators will report details on the SAE form on the eCRF including date of event, admissions, diagnosis details, date of discharge, or death. SAE reports must be completed within 24&#x000a0;hours of the investigator&#x02019;s knowledge of the SAE. Investigators will be able to submit follow-up SAE reports should further information become available. Investigators will be expected to assess and assign causality and expectedness of each event on the form using the definitions described below. The CTEU will review all SAE reports. The Chief Investigator/deputy will review the SAE reports and inform the CTEU of the assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Definitions for assessment of causality</title><p>The definitions for assessment of causality include:</p><p>1. Unrelated: there is no evidence of any causal relationship</p><p>2. Unlikely: there is little evidence to suggest there is a causal relationship (for example the event did not occur within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). There is another reasonable explanation for the event (for example the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition, other concomitant treatment)</p><p>3. Possible: there is some evidence to suggest a causal relationship (for example because the event occurs within a reasonable time after administration of the trial medication). However, the influence of other factors may have contributed to the event (for example the patient&#x02019;s clinical condition, other concomitant treatments)</p><p>4. Probable: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship and the influence of other factors is unlikely</p><p>5. Definitely: there is clear evidence to suggest a causal relationship and other possible contributing factors can be ruled out</p><p>6. Not assessable: there is insufficient or incomplete evidence to make a clinical judgement of the causal relationship.</p></sec><sec><title>Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs)</title><p>A serious adverse reaction (SAR) can be considered unexpected when the AR is not consistent with the applicable product information or expected SAEs listed above. All SUSARs related to an IMP, which occur during the trial, are subject to expedited reporting. Where applicable, if an event is considered a SUSAR, the patient should be unblinded from the study allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Reporting of SUSARs</title><p>A full and detailed account of the SAE must be recorded on the SAE report. The SAE report must be completed within 24&#x000a0;hours. A medical summary should also be faxed to the CTEU within 24&#x000a0;hours. The Chief Investigator/deputy will review the report and summary and inform the CTEU of the assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Expedited reporting of SUSARs</title><p>All SUSARs will be reported to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) by the CTEU. All SUSAR reports will be unblinded prior to submission. A SUSAR which is fatal or life threatening will be reported to the MHRA and the main REC by the CTEU as soon as possible and within 7&#x000a0;days of knowledge of the event. A SUSAR which is not fatal or life threatening must be reported to the MHRA and the main REC as soon as possible and within 15&#x000a0;days of knowledge of the event. The CTEU will inform all relevant parties of any reported SUSARs within 15 working days.</p></sec><sec><title>Annual reporting</title><p>The CTEU will submit annual safety reports of all suspected SARs in accordance with regulatory requirements to the MHRA and the main REC. Annual safety reports will be submitted to the MHRA on the date of the original clinical trials authorization. Annual progress reports will also be submitted to the main REC. There is no requirement for local trial sites to submit progress reports to local RECs.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical considerations</title><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The primary outcome is absolute change in aortic root diameter per year. The sample size calculation was based on estimates obtained from a database of MFS patients maintained by AC, co-investigator and lead Geneticist. Information was extracted from this database for all patients who met the following criteria: age at first echo between 6 and 40&#x000a0;years; at least two serial echo measurements; and time between the first and last valid measurement between 0.9 and 5.1&#x000a0;years.</p><p>This provided a database of 254 patients who had a median (interquartile range) follow-up time of 3.4 (2.4, 4.5) years. The data were cleaned and reviewed and during this time the average rate of aortic dilatation was approximately 1&#x000a0;mm per year, with a standard deviation of 1.8&#x000a0;mm. Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> shows the number of patients required to test for a difference between an annual dilatation rate of 1&#x000a0;mm on placebo against hypothesized rates on irbesartan.

Allowing for a 20% drop-out (including missing data and non-compliance) we aim to recruit 245 patients in each group, making a total of 490 patients. Expansion rates according to treatment group would be regularly reviewed by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) who would advise the Steering Committee if there was clear evidence of benefit before the scheduled end of the study, or alternatively may advise if there is no real possibility of finding a difference (performing a 'futility&#x02019; analysis) either because irbesartan does not have the expected effects, or if aortic expansion rates are slower than expected in the control group. We have selected a proportional reduction of 50% of dilatation rate per annum (0.5&#x000a0;mm) largely on pragmatic grounds. If irbesartan only offered a very modest reduction in rate we are much less certain that this could be translated into a clinical benefit. We are also measuring a surrogate outcome (aortic dilatation) but one which is closely related to adverse clinical events in this population.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis in this study is the comparison of the rate of annual aortic dilatation in those patients treated with irbesartan compared to placebo. The annual rate of dilatation will be calculated by estimates of mean values of the annual echocardiograms adjusting the time of follow-up to a 'common&#x02019; start point, that is, the baseline measurement. An independent samples <italic>t</italic>-test will be used to test for a difference in the rate between the irbesartan and placebo groups, assuming that the measurement of annual dilation follows a normal distribution. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used if the analysis of the primary outcome is adjusted for any other variables. The primary analysis will be carried out according to the intention-to-treat principle in which all randomized patients will be included according to their initial randomized allocation irrespective of whether they continue to take the assigned treatment or not. Patients who are not followed up to the end of the study for whatever reason will have the last echo measurement included in the analysis. Patients will be followed from the time of randomization to the end of the study period. Thus individual patients will have a variable follow-up period. No formal method for imputing missing aortic diameter values is proposed as the comparison will be performed on the mean of group data. Secondary analyses include comparison of other measurements using appropriate comparative and descriptive statistics.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulatory and ethical considerations</title><sec><title>Regulatory framework and approval</title><p>This study is a randomized trial of an IMP (licensed product in new conditions of use; new dosing schemes/new target population), and as such will comply with the European Clinical Trials Directive and the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004.
