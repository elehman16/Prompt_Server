We allocated 40 patients to either a <italic>tai chi</italic> treatment group or a no-treatment control group. The <italic>tai chi</italic> group performed 60 min of <italic>tai chi</italic> twice weekly for eight consecutive weeks and 8 weeks of home-based <italic>tai chi</italic>, after which the group showed significant improvement in disease activity and flexibility compared to the control group. All outcome measures were significantly lower in the <italic>tai chi</italic> group than they were during pre-treatment, while they did not change in the control group. These findings suggest that <italic>tai chi</italic> can improve disease activity and flexibility for patients with AS. <italic>Tai chi</italic> is an easily accessible therapy for patients and, as such, may be an effective intervention for AS.

Because of its insidious nature, this condition's diagnosis may be delayed until the final stage of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). AS treatment aims to prevent the stiffness and flexion deformity that accompany the disease and to maintain a healthy physical and psychologic state for the patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>First-line treatments for AS include physical exercise and the administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). Of many available treatments, physical exercise appears to benefit patients coping with the disease because activity provides opportunities to enhance their sense of control over its symptoms, especially pain and immobility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p><italic>Tai chi</italic> is a combination of physical exercise and relaxation techniques rooted in ancient Chinese philosophy and is used to enhance its practitioners&#x02019; mental and physical health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Several previous studies have determined that <italic>tai chi</italic> is beneficial for balance control, flexibility, aerobic capacity, headache (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), improving immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) and psychologic variables such as depressive symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), mood and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). It also improves muscular strength and reduces the risk of falls in the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16 B17 B18">16&#x02013;18</xref>). <italic>Tai chi</italic> also has been determined to improve symptoms related to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Based on these findings, it is reasonable to assume that <italic>tai chi</italic> can help patients with AS. However, no studies have been conducted on the effect of <italic>tai chi</italic> exercise in AS patients. The present study clinically assesses <italic>tai chi's</italic> effects on disease activity, flexibility and depression in patients with AS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with AS were recruited through bulletin board advertising to participate in an 8-week <italic>tai chi</italic> program at the University Medical Center's Rheumatism Center. Patients were eligible to participate in the program if they (i) were out-patients with no complications, (ii) could understand the content of questionnaires and experimental schedules, (iii) had no changes in their current prescription medication in the past 4 weeks, (iv) were classified as functional class II for AS according to the Modified NY, USA Criteria for AS and (v) had not experienced <italic>tai chi, qigong</italic> or other related relaxation training.</p><p>Sixty-one patients were eligible per our study's criteria. We randomly selected 40 subjects from among the volunteers and allocated them to either the <italic>tai chi</italic> group (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 20). The study's dropout rates were 35 and 15% for the <italic>tai chi</italic> and control groups, respectively, so that both pre- and post-test data for 8 weeks of <italic>tai chi</italic> were available from 13 subjects in the tai chi group and 17 controls. The primary reasons for dropout in the <italic>tai chi</italic> group were that participants moved to another city (three subjects), had no time available to participate (two subjects) or were readmitted to the hospital (two subjects). The primary reason for dropout in the control group was failure to complete due to having no time available to participate (three subjects) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). We conducted additional analysis to compare the demographic and pre-test data for the dropouts to those of the remaining members of the <italic>tai chi</italic> and control groups, which revealed no significant differences.
<fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Diagram of study design showing the flow of participants.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nem048f1"/></fig></p><p>Subjects were informed about the nature of AS and the study procedures. We received approval for the study from the University Hospital's Institutional Review Board before we approached the subjects; all subjects provided written informed consent.</p><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>This study's outcome measures included the following: (i) disease activity (as the primary outcome measure) and (ii) finger to floor distance (FFD) and depression (as secondary outcome measures). Outcome measures were assessed by a nurse, who did not know the experimental protocol or the subjects&#x02019; allocation, before and 8 weeks after the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Disease Activity</title><p>Disease activity the week prior to study admission was measured as a baseline reading using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), which includes six questions related to five symptoms during the past week: fatigue, spinal pain, joint pain, tenderness and morning stiffness. All items are scored on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS), on which higher scores reflect greater disease activity. Analysis of this experiment indicated a high level of internal consistency (Cronbach's &#x003b1; = 0.94).</p></sec><sec><title>Finger to Floor Distance (FFD)</title><p>FFD was measured with the patient bending forward maximally with knees straight. We used a ruler to assess flexibility by measuring the FFD. Two measurements were made and averaged.</p></sec><sec><title>Depression</title><p>The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) was used to measure the subjects&#x02019; depression level. The CES-D is a 20-item self-report questionnaire that has been used extensively for research purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It assesses the current level of depressive symptomatology over the past week and has been shown to possess good internal consistency (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.85 as reported by Radloff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>); <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.96 in the present study). Participants indicate their level of endorsement of each item on a four-point scale ranging from &#x02018;rarely or none of the time (less than one day)&#x02019; to &#x02018;all of the time (5&#x02013;7 days)&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention program used 21 movements based on <italic>tai chi</italic> for (RA) developed by Dr Paul Lam <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The <italic>tai chi</italic> for RA consisted of a warm-up exercise (10 min), 21 main movements (30 min) and a cool-down exercise (5 min). This study's warm-up and cool-down exercises involved stretching and relaxing the head, neck, upper and lower body and whole body. The exercises were not modified from original <italic>tai chi</italic> for the arthritis program.</p><p>The 21 basic <italic>tai chi</italic> movements involved commencement form, opening and closing hands, single whip, waving hands in the cloud, brush knee and twist step, playing the lute, stepping forward to deflect downward, parrying and punching, pushing the mountain, closing form and alternating sides for all previous motions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Subjects in the <italic>tai chi</italic> group attended two group <italic>tai chi</italic> classes per week for 8 weeks, led by two instructors (the first two authors, ENL and YHK, who are certified as <italic>tai chi</italic> instructors and have 4 years of instruction experience). The instructors explained and demonstrated how the exercises should be performed and the subjects followed. A videotape was shown during the group session. We also individually instructed subjects in the appropriate movements. Six weeks were devoted to learning the <italic>tai chi</italic> routine, so the subjects were actually performing the routine competently for the last 2 weeks. A special guide book for home practice was produced, which contains pictures and written descriptions of the same exercise as the <italic>tai chi</italic> program. Subjects were asked to practice their exercises at home for repetition with the guide book (once daily for first 6 weeks and twice daily for last 2 weeks) and were telephoned by the researchers twice each week. Participants recorded the frequency and duration of their <italic>tai chi</italic> performance at home in their exercise log, which the instructors assessed during every weekly session (final compliance with home-based <italic>tai chi</italic> was 93.3% according to the exercise logs).</p><p>Subjects in both groups received standard drug treatments provided by the outpatient clinic. Control subjects received no other treatment and did not participate in any structured exercise programs during the study period. They were contacted by researchers twice weekly by telephone to confirm that they were not taking part in any other exercise activities and to provide impetus to keep them engaged in the study. Control group subjects who were interested in <italic>tai chi</italic> were provided with an exercise program after the study ended.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>No Differences in Baseline Homogeneity Between the Two Groups</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the demographic characteristics of subjects in the <italic>tai chi</italic> and control groups.

Subjects in the active treatment group showed greater improvement in disease activity and flexibility after 8 weeks than controls. This result supports previous findings that <italic>tai chi</italic> benefits flexibility and disease activity in different conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). The results of the current study also suggest that <italic>tai chi</italic> may be used to treat symptoms of AS. This finding has not been previously reported.</p><p>The effect size (ES) in terms of disease activity (BASDAI) improvement was significant for the <italic>tai chi</italic> group versus the control group. Compared to previous studies, the ES of tai chi (0.60) was greater than that of home exercise (0.09) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), conventional exercise (0.24) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), global posture re-education (0.15) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and NSAIDs (0.55) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>FFD improvement was significant for the <italic>tai chi</italic> group versus the control group. The ES of <italic>tai chi</italic> (0.30) was greater than that of home exercise (0.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), but group exercise (0.38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and home-based exercise (0.39) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) resulted in a higher ES than <italic>tai chi</italic>.</p><p>One-third of AS patients experienced depression related to pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In our study, the depression level decreased (i.e., improved) more in the <italic>tai chi</italic> group than in the control group; however, the difference was not significant. These results are consistent with previous results. For example, Taylor-Piliae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) reported no significant changes in depression level after six or 12 weeks of <italic>tai chi</italic>. Data from other studies also failed to find an effect on depression level of two or three times weekly <italic>tai chi</italic> for 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, an average of four times weekly tai chi for 18 weeks reduced depression level in osteoarthritic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We speculate that training time and duration seemed to relate to reducing depression level, but further studies are required to prove this.</p><p>Assuming that <italic>tai chi</italic> is a potentially useful treatment option for patients with AS, its possible mechanism of action may be of interest. When performed regularly, the physical exercise of <italic>tai chi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) affects the cardiovascular and muscular systems, resulting in muscular adaptation and, ultimately, increased muscle strength. Physical activity can also improve joint stability and aid in reducing excess weight, effectively decreasing joint pain, increasing function and improving other symptoms related to AS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34 B35 B36">34&#x02013;36</xref>).</p><p>This study has several limitations, including its small sample, high dropout rate and lack of an equivalent exercise control group to estimate the expectation effect. Moreover, we cannot completely confirm the absence of performance bias, such as complete separation of contact between the two groups, which may indicate a possible placebo effect in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that <italic>tai chi</italic> improves flexibility and positively influences levels of disease activity in AS patients. <italic>Tai chi</italic>, which is easily accessible to patients, may also be an effective intervention for AS. Further randomized studies, with more objective measures, larger samples, measurements after multiple sessions and long-term follow-up, are needed to verify <italic>tai chi's</italic> effects on patients' quality of life, pain, mobility, psychologic variables and physical functional improvement.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation
