However, some problems exist regarding the use of fissure sealants on erupting first molars considering their long eruption time, moisture-sensitivity of the conventional fissure sealants and deep pits and fissures of the newly erupted first molars [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, there are other challenges of using sealants such as their inability to penetrate well into the grooves, presence of gingival operculum distal to the teeth and insignificant effect of fluoride on occlusal pits and fissures [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Inadequate isolation and saliva contamination during the procedure are the main reasons for failure of fissure sealants in their first year of application [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The conventional resin sealants require an isolated, completely dry work field for their clinical success; this decreases their success rate in semi-erupted permanent first molars since complete isolation of such teeth is difficult [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Efficient cleaning of occlusal grooves, application of a low viscosity hydrophilic bonding agent beneath the sealant and complete isolation of tooth improve the efficacy of sealants [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Recently, some modifications were made in chemical formulation of sealants [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Resin sealants are bonded to the underlying enamel using the acid-etching technique [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By creating a physical barrier as such, metabolic communication between the microorganisms present in the occlusal grooves and oral environment is prevented [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although glass ionomers and composite resins are extensively used in dental procedures, their main shortcoming is their moisture susceptibility. Even in case of complete drying of tooth, some moisture still remains in the tooth structure [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Embrace is a moisture-resistant resin sealant, which does not contain bisphenol A or bis-GMA [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It has a hydrophilic-base and contains di-tri-acrylate and multi-functional monomers. It also contains 36.6% filler particles, which are activated by moisture [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It has the advantages of providing an optimal bond in wet environment, optimal retention, high marginal adaptation, smooth margins, low technical sensitivity and fluoride release potential [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After curing, its acidic pH becomes neutral, making it almost insoluble in water [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Due to optimal properties, this sealant has been suggested for use in uncooperative children and cases of difficult isolation [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Several previous studies have compared Embrace hydrophilic sealant with the conventional hydrophobic sealants, yielding controversial results [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some of them have reported higher success rate for hydrophilic sealant [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] while some others did not find any significant difference between the two types [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Another study showed inadequate retention of Embrace [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Considering the existing controversy in this respect, this study sought to compare the one-year clinical success of Embrace hydrophilic and Helioseal-F hydrophobic sealants in permanent first molars of children aged six to nine years.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This split-mouth randomized single blind clinical trial was conducted on 23 cooperative children between six to nine years [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] who were rated 3 or 4 using the Frankel&#x02019;s behavior rating scale.

In the first appointment, all children received oral hygiene instructions including proper use of dental floss, tooth brush and toothpaste, and the need for fissure sealant treatment of all four permanent first molars was confirmed by clinical examination using a dental mirror and a dental explorer (Atlasdent, Tehran, Iran). In the next appointment, the children were requested to brush their teeth to ensure the accuracy of tooth brushing technique. Dental prophylaxis and cleaning were done for all teeth using a low-speed hand piece and a prophy brush (Atlasdent, Tehran, Iran) to remove debris from the grooves. The occlusal surfaces of the teeth were rinsed with water and checked by an explorer. Permanent first molars were isolated using cotton rolls and saliva ejector. Allocation of type of sealant to the right/left quadrant of the maxilla/mandible was done randomly by flipping a coin. Sealant was applied by a second-year post-graduate student of pediatric dentistry under the supervision of a pediatric dentist.</p><p>In group one, the occlusal surface of the teeth was dried and etched with 37% phosphoric acid (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) for 15 seconds according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, rinsed for 30 seconds and air-dried with oil- and water-free air spray. Under cotton roll isolation and upon observing the chalky white appearance, Helioseal-F sealant (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was applied and directed into the pits and fissures by a sterile explorer and light cured for 40 seconds by a light-curing unit (Monitex, Tokyo, Japan) with a light intensity of 400mW/cm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>In group two, the occlusal surface of the teeth was dried and etched with 37% phosphoric acid (Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein) for 20 seconds according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, rinsed for 30 seconds and gently dried with cotton rolls in such a way that the occlusal surface had a shiny appearance. Embrace WetBond (Pulpdent Co., Watertown, USA) was applied and directed into the pits and fissures by a sterile explorer and light cured as described for group one. Next, the occlusion was checked in both groups (both sides) using an articulating paper, and occlusal interferences were eliminated. All phases were carried out according to the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. Follow-up sessions were scheduled at three, six and 12 months for assessment of sealants [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

At 12 months, 62.5% of Embrace and 60% of Helioseal-F cases had complete retention (P=1.000).</p><p>No significant difference was noted in terms of smoothness of surface between the two groups. At 12 months, 32.5% of Embrace and 27.5% of Helioseal-F sealants lost their surface smoothness (P=0.846). With regard to color match, 82.5% of teeth in Embrace and 77.5% of those in Helioseal-F group still had optimal color match at one year (P=0.527). Marginal adaptation was not significantly different either between the two groups at any time point. At 12 months, 60% of teeth in Embrace and 62.5% in Helioseal-F group had acceptable marginal adaptation (P=0.841). At the 12-month follow-up, three teeth in Embrace and one tooth in Helioseal-F group were carious; this difference between the two groups was not significant (P=0.317). Friedman test showed that the two groups were not significantly different in terms of the five success criteria (altogether; P&#x0003e;0.05). No significant differences were noted in loss of retention of sealants between the maxilla and mandible, between the two types of sealants at each time point or among different time points (all P&#x0003e;0.05).</p><p>The difference in retention of sealants in the occlusal, palatal or buccal fissures was not significant either at any time point (P&#x0003e;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study assessed and compared the clinical success of Embrace hydrophilic and Helioseal-F hydrophobic sealants in 23 permanent fist molars of children between six to nine years in a split mouth design using modified Ryge (USPHS) criteria at three, six and 12 months. The results showed no significant difference between the two sealants in any of the five assessed success criteria. Fissure sealants prevent the penetration of microorganisms, foods and saliva into the pits and fissures and inhibit subsequent development of caries [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Occlusal fissures are eight times more susceptible to caries than smooth surfaces [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Thus, sealant retention is especially important. The conventional resin sealants have high technical sensitivity and their clinical success is affected by patient cooperation, contamination of the area and expertise and skills of the operator [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, moisture susceptibility complicates sealant therapy in semi-erupted teeth and uncooperative children [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Risk of occlusal caries is the highest in the first years following eruption of teeth because the enamel is slightly porous and the grooves are full of cellular and organic debris.</p><p>Risk of occlusal caries is the highest in the first years following eruption of teeth because the enamel is slightly porous and the grooves are full of cellular and organic debris. Thus, it is important to find a sealant with high clinical success rate for use in semi-erupted molars, which are difficult to isolate [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The manufacturer claims that Embrace sealant is self-priming and self-adhesive and has low technical sensitivity. It is activated with moisture and releases fluoride. It also chemically bonds to tooth structure [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. It is devoid of bis-GMA and bisphenol A. It is important in that bis-GMA tends to bond to estrogen receptors [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Most composite resins and sealants have bis-GMA and bisphenol A diglycidyl ether methacrylate in their composition. Evidence shows that complete polymerization does not occur in these compounds, and free monomers are detectable in the saliva. Bisphenol A and aromatic compounds react with biological molecules and bond to estrogen receptors [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Our results regarding lack of a significant difference in the clinical success of the two sealants was in line with those of Bhatia et al, [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Bhat et al, [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Subramaniam et al [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In the study by Bhatia et al, [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] retention of Embrace was slightly superior to that of Delton conventional sealant. They explained that the efficacy of sealants mainly depends on the clinical procedural steps and quality of the material.</p><p>They used Simonsen&#x02019;s criteria for assessment of retention; but retention alone cannot be the only indicator of clinical success of a sealant. Material properties such as solubility are very important in clinical success of restorations and fissure sealants. High solubility of a dental material results in its degradation and decreases the longevity of restoration [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Filler content, filler size, filler surface area, type of filler particles and degree of polymerization all affect the solubility of materials. Voids created during application or mixing prevent polymerization and increase solubility of materials [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, the procedural steps and technical sensitivity of sealants have a direct effect on their stability. Moreover, some researchers believe that compounds containing bis-GMA have lower solubility than compounds devoid of it or those containing UDMA [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Water sorption also affects the stability and retention of fissure sealants. Presence of hydrophilic compounds such as HEMA results in greater water sorption [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, Embrace is expected to have higher water sorption due to its hydrophilicity. However, clinical success of a restoration in the oral environment is the result of interaction of several factors including physicochemical properties, method of application and technical sensitivity. For fissure sealants, isolation is very important, and materials providing an acceptable wet bond are preferred. In vitro studies have shown that Embrace has a higher tensile strength than resin cements [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, it has lower viscosity, forms longer resin tags, provides high marginal adaptation and well penetrates into deep grooves compared to bis-GMA sealants [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, due to its hydrophilicity, Embrace has lower technical sensitivity than Helioseal-F [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Embrace is acidic before curing. After light curing, it has a neutral pH with physicochemical properties similar to those of conventional sealants. In presence of moisture, it flows on the surface and bonds to tooth structure [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, it does not require a bonding agent; whereas, hydrophobic (conventional) sealants do not bond to wet surfaces [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Despite lower technical sensitivity of Embrace than Helioseal F, they both have similar wear, water sorption, solubility and retention [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, in case of difficult isolation (uncooperative patients, those with physical or mental disabilities, semi-erupted molars, etc.), Embrace is recommended for fissure sealant treatment [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In the study by Bhat et al, [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Embrace was not significantly different from two conventional sealants in terms of retention but it showed significantly higher retention than glass ionomer, which is probably due to the weaker bond of glass ionomer to the enamel.</p><p>Subramaniam et al. [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found results similar to ours using modified CCC criteria, which is a visual-tactile index that assesses several clinical criteria including discoloration, caries and surface texture of sealant determined by use of a periodontal probe. In a study by Ratnaditya et al, [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] retention of Embrace was significantly higher than that of Delton after two years. They used Simonsen&#x02019;s criteria for clinical assessment of retention of fissure sealants. Moreover, retention of Embrace in mandibular teeth was greater than that in maxillary teeth. They explained the reason to be better visibility of mandibular teeth and the gravity. They mentioned that occlusal stress affects sealants in maxillary molars earlier after eruption compared to mandibular molars [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in our study, no significant difference was noted in retention of sealants between the maxilla and mandible. We believe that sealant retention is not influenced by the maxillary or mandibular arch if a good-quality sealant is properly applied.</p><p>In contrast, Schlueter et al. [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] showed significantly lower retention of Embrace than Helioseal-F at one year. They used the clinical index of retention and sealant quality, which included air inclusion, marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration and pit and fissure caries. They found no significant difference in retention of sealants between the maxilla and mandible. Use of different etching times for the two sealants may be responsible for their different retention. They attributed the lower success rate of embrace to difficult moisture control in grooves since the grooves should not be too dry (to see the chalky white appearance) or too wet (to see water droplets) and this is hard to achieve in the clinical setting. The other reason was assumed to be water sorption by Embrace and subsequently increased solubility and higher risk of disintegration [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Smoothness of the surface was a success criterion evaluated in the current study, which indicates wear resistance of the material. The two sealants showed similar smoothness, which indicates similar wear resistance [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another criterion was marginal adaptation. Poor marginal adaptation may be due to incomplete polymerization of sealant, inadequate light intensity of the light-curing unit or water sorption. In the current study, change in marginal adaptation was minimal in both groups.</p><p>Erroneous technique (i.e. working in wet environment) and wear due to occlusal loads are the two main reasons for failure and loss of fissure sealants [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The two sealants were not significantly different in terms of caries in our study, which may be due to fluoride uptake by the adjacent enamel. Even in case of loss of sealant, the rest of the sealant often remains in the grooves and serves its protective role [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Occlusal surfaces of the first and second molars have the highest risk of occlusal caries [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the current study, both sealants were equal in terms of caries prevention. The allocation of sealants to jaws and quadrants was random to prevent bias [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The follow-ups were scheduled at three, six, nine and 12 months. Some cases of failure occurred as early as three months, which indicates that an appointment must be scheduled for patients as early as three months. Also, since retention showed a descending trend over time, a 12-month follow-up is also required.</p><p>The new generation of fissure sealants containing hydrophilic monomers appears to have lower technical sensitivity since it is moisture-tolerant. Also, it does not require a bonding agent for wet bonding. It decreases the treatment time and enhances patient cooperation [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Future studies with longer follow-ups are required to assess the performance of these sealants over longer periods of time. Moreover, other properties of Embrace such as its fluoride release potential, water sorption, microleakage and compressive strength must be evaluated in future in vitro studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the results showed that the one-year clinical success of Embrace hydrophilic sealant was similar to that of Helioseal-F hydrophobic sealant.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1-</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bhatia</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Shirol</surname><given-names>DD</given-names></name></person-group>
