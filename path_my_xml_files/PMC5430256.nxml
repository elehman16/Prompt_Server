stimulation to muscles related to hand functions on dexterity, strength, and sensory
function in patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects and Methods] A total of 10 stroke
patients with hemiplegia participated in this study. They were divided into two groups: a)
Experimental and b) Control, with five randomly selected subjects for each group. The
experimental group received vibratory stimulation, while the control group received the
traditional physical therapy. Both interventions were performed for 30 minutes each
session, three times a week for four weeks. [Results] There was a significant within-group
improvement in the box and block test results in both groups for dexterity. Grip strength
improved in both groups but the improvement was not statistically significant.
[Conclusion] The vibratory stimulation activated the biceps brachii and flexor carpi
radialis, which increased dexterity to grasp and lift the box and block from the surface.
Therefore, repeated vibratory stimulation to muscles related to hand functions improved
hand dexterity equality to the traditional physical therapy in patients with chronic
stroke.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chronic stroke</kwd><kwd>Dexterity</kwd><kwd>Vibratory stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In previous literatures, approximately 65% reduction in sensory function including tactile
and proprioceptions has been reported among stroke patients<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because post-stroke patients usually have sensory impairments and
mobility disorders, restricting their performance of functional tasks, the intervention to
increase both sensory and motor functions is crucial in their rehabilitation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Various interventions for the improvement
of upper limb functions were performed for patients with hemiplegia. Further, related study
was actively and widely conducted to find ways to enhance sensory stimulation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these, a sensory stimulation
intervention was found to diminish spasticity and co-contraction of hemiplegic upper limb,
resulting in gentle movement<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous
study, the sensory stimulation to a muscle affected the primary motor cortex and
somatosensory area by Ia afferent fiber from muscle spindle, improving both sensory and
physical functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the recent study,
vibratory stimulation applied at the palm of the affected hand improved grasp and shoulder
functions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, vibratory
stimulation of pectoralis minor, elbow flexors, and wrist flexors influenced the upper limb
functions of patients with hemiplegia<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Vibratory stimulation applied to elbow flexors and flexor carpi radialis also improved the
reaching function of the affected upper limb<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and proprioception of elbow joint in able-bodied individuals,
influencing upper limb movement and sensory function<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although many studies have reported
that this intervention improves upper limb and sensory functions in patients with
hemiplegia, they did not reveal its effect on the strength and sensation of the hand.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of repeated vibratory
stimulation to muscles related to hand function on dexterity, strength, and sensory function
in patients with chronic stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was performed at B hospital in South Korea from April 1 to May 2, 2016 following

diagnosis of stroke from a physician, 2) no pain from vibration, 3) above 24 points in Mini
Mental State Examination, 4) ability to grasp, and 5) sensory below 6.65&#x02005;mm of
mono-filament. Patients having other neurologic disorders were excluded in the study. The 10
subjects were divided into two groups: a) Experimental Group (EG) and b) Control Group (CG),
with five randomly-selected subjects for each group. The EG received vibratory stimulation
while the CG received the traditional physical therapy. Both interventions were done for 30
minutes each session, three times a week for four weeks. Thrive MD-01 (Thrive Co., Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan) was used for vibratory stimulation and applied by 2 testers with a frequency
of 91&#x02005;Hz and an amplitude of 1.0&#x02005;mm for 20 minutes a session to the biceps brachii and
flexor carpi radialis in the EG while sitting on a chair. Forearm and hand were placed
comfortably and the hand grasped a dynamometer with 20% of maximal grip power. The procedure
of applying the vibratory stimulator was that the biceps brachii and flexor carpi radialis
in the affected side were placed on the heads of the vibratory stimulators and tied together
by straps. Two&#x02005;kg of weights were put on the neck portion of the vibratory stimulators to
fix the location of stimulation during the operation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Box and block test (BBT) was used for hand dexterity. It was
originally used for assessing a patient with physical disorder by converting the number of
block size of 1 inch carried from a box to another box for 1 minute. The intra-rater
reliability of left hand and right hand were r=0.99 and r=1.00 respectively<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, grip strength (GS) was used for hand
strength and assessed from non-dominant hand to dominant hand. To assess for grip strength
of the hand, the patient&#x02019;s shoulder should be adducted with the elbow joint in 90 degrees
flexion and the forearm in neutral position. The test was performed three times and yielded
the mean<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. And Weinstein monofilament
(Baseline, USA) was used for sensory test in the affected hand. The test was performed with
from 2.83&#x02005;mm of the filament to gradually thicken filaments for 1.5 second each until the
filament applied was bent and respond was elicited a total of three times and yielded the
mean. The inter-rater and intra-rater reliability were r=0.78&#x02013;0.89 and r=0.96
respectively<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>All data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) version 18.
Wilcoxon signed ranked test and Mann Whitney test were used to determine variations within
each group and between the two groups, respectively. All data were presented as mean with

of the affected hand and upper limb and weakness is a representative positive symptom from
the upper motor neuron lesion. Therefore, basic and instrumental activities of daily living
are a huge challenge to them. Every movement is initiated from stimuli and the stimuli are
delivered by ascending tracts from the skin, joint and muscle etc. to primary somatosenory
area. After the integration of the sensations coming from the each sensory receptor,
cerebral cortex gives a command to the spinal cord for movement. When human beings conduct
some movements in bearing the body weight especially, more information is transmitted to the
cerebral cortex and it can adjust and refine the movements more efficiently. Like this,
movement like dexterity and strength develops sensation and vice versa. In this study,
dexterity, strength and sensation were assessed altogether pre- and post-intervention. Low
amplitude vibratory stimulation or transcranial magnetic stimulation to a muscle in a
previous study proved to induce variations in motor excitability. In addition, applying
vibratory stimulation to a muscle continuously for 90 minutes for three days induced
longstanding variations in motor activity in both patients and able-bodied individuals<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, BBT for hand dexterity
significantly improved in both groups while GS for hand strength improved in both groups but
the improvement was not statistically significant. Although the current study results did
not show superior effect of the vibratory stimulation over conventional therapy for
dexterity, it demonstrated that both interventions were effective for dexterity. One
possible reason for the effectiveness of vibratory stimulation is that the vibratory
stimulation affected the proprioceptors in the muscles. In turn, related muscles were
reorganized in the brain, resulting in more accurate and powerful movements. Moreover, the
stimulation activated the flexor muscles such as the biceps brachii and flexor carpi
radialis, which increased the muscle power to grasp and lift the box and block from the
surface. It has been shown in previous study that a reduction in muscle tonus and an
increase in motor function coupled with a reduction in motor thresholds and an increase in
motor map size of both flexors<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, in the previous study, the use of functional vibratory stimulation (FVS) applying
to the arm improved flexion of the hemiparetic shoulder. FVS carried to the palm made the
patient repeat flexing his hemiparetic shoulder to operate objects with his hand. This study
tried to verify if FVS giving to the hemiplegic upper extremity could influence voluntary
movements of the extremity by growing the excitability of the motor cortex or motor neurons
in the spinal cord via somatosensory-evoked potentials<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, vibration stimulation giving to the biceps brachii
and flexor carpi radialis influenced grasping the block and transferring it to the other
place. In conclusion, interventions using vibratory stimulation and traditional PT are
equally effective for improving dexterity in the subjects with chronic stroke. The
limitation of the present study was a short duration of the intervention to elicit treatment
outcomes in grip strength and sensation in patients with chronic stoke. In addition,
activations of the target muscles were not objectively measured during activities and the
sample size was small. In future follow-up studies, it is suggested to increase the duration
and sample size and also use electromyography to verify the muscle activations during
activities.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Matyas</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>Oke</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name></person-group>:
