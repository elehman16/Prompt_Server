Cancer cachexia involves relatively similar losses of adipose (fat) and muscle tissue which differs from simple starvation or conditions such as anorexia nervosa, where the majority of weight loss is from adipose rather than muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of cachexia in cancer patients is dependent on the type and site of the tumour, and can range from 31% to 87% of all cancer patients. While low incidences are reported in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer and sarcomas, rates up to 83% in pancreatic cancer patients and over 85% in patients with gastric cancer have been reported. Small-cell and Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients also experience a high incidence of cachexia, at 57% and 61% respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It is estimated that cachexia is present in up to 80% of cancer patients at death, and the main cause of death in 20% of all cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cancer cachexia is associated with a deterioration of functional status and quality of life and is also associated with poor survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Cachectic patients have lower response rates to chemotherapy and shorter median survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While much of the cachectic weight loss is from adipose tissue, it has been suggested that it is the loss of muscle mass that accounts for mortality and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Muscle wasting is the main cause of impaired function, leading to respiratory complications and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Recently there has been a shift from the use of the cytotoxic platinum-based drug carboplatin to cisplatin in the treatment of NSCLC. Cisplatin is associated with side effects, amongst these cachexia and anorexia, thereby confounding the symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>A recent review has shown that over the last few decades a number of studies have attempted to reduce patients' cachexia. This has involved the investigation of several pharmacological agents. Unfortunately these studies demonstrated either no or limited benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Research into methods to combat cachexia has therefore recently progressed to the combination of agents e.g. megestrol acetate and ibuprofen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and nutritional supplements, nutritional support, anti-inflammatory and anaemia support, all again with mixed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Such results would suggest that there is a need for a new approach to the management of cancer cachexia. Based on the literature for rheumatoid arthritis cachexia group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and other cancer groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] the combined use of anti-inflammatory agents, improved food intake, especially protein and the performance of progressive resistance training (PRT) anabolic exercise, to stabilize the cachectic patient would appear worthwhile investigating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><sec><title>Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID)</title><p>The use of NSAIDs in cancer patients is not widespread due to concerns regarding cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) inhibition, and its effect on gastrointestinal mucosal lining resulting in gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The development of selective COX-2 inhibitors has led to the possibility of their use in reducing tumour-mediated prostaglandin levels safely and could help alleviate or control cancer cachexia. The selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib has shown potent anti-tumour growth inhibitory and anti-tumour preventive effects in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>The use of celecoxib has been investigated in eleven cachectic patients with head and neck and gastrointestinal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Patients were randomised to celecoxib 200 mg twice daily or placebo for 3 weeks. The patients on celecoxib reported good compliance and no adverse events were seen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Patients receiving celecoxib showed a non-significant increase in body weight, (mean change +1.0 kg compared with placebo group mean change -1.3 kg), and a significant increase in mean change score of the Quality of life (QoL) Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment (FAACT) questionnaire compared to a decrease in the placebo group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.05). These results would appear to suggest that only targeting inflammatory suppression may have some benefits but will not produce a clinically significant increase in lean body mass.</p><p>Recently, Mantovani and colleagues conducted a phase II non-randomised prospective study investigating celecoxib at a dose of 300 mg per day for four months in twenty-four advanced cancer patients (mixed tumour sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Results (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) showed a significant decrease in the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;) levels and a significant increase in lean body mass (by bioelectrical impedance). Significant improvements were also seen in QoL European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30), performance status according to the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG ) PS scale, Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and grip strength, along with good compliance and again no grade 3 or 4 toxicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Endpoints from study investigating single agent celecoxib by Mantovani et al [21]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Baseline</th><th align="left">After treatment</th><th align="left"><italic>p </italic>values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">TNF-alpha (pg/ml)</td><td align="left">36.8 &#x000b1; 14.1</td><td align="left">29.9 &#x000b1; 12.2</td><td align="left">0.007</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">LBM (Kg)</td><td align="left">45.4 &#x000b1; 6.7</td><td align="left">45.8 &#x000b1; 6.6</td><td align="left">&#x0003c; 0.0001</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">QoL</td><td align="left">66.3 &#x000b1; 19.9</td><td align="left">75.3 &#x000b1; 10.1</td><td align="left">0.024</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">ECOG PS</td><td align="left">1.5 &#x000b1; 0.67</td><td align="left">1.2 &#x000b1; 0.59</td><td align="left">0.0023</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">GPS</td><td align="left">1.3 &#x000b1; 0.77</td><td align="left">0.8 &#x000b1; 0.7</td><td align="left">0.0004</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Grip strength</td><td align="left">20. 8 &#x000b1; 4.7</td><td align="left">24.0 &#x000b1; 5.5</td><td align="left">0.004</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>TNF-alpha = Tumour Necrosis Factor-alpha, LBM = Lean body mass, QoL = Quality of life, ECOG PS = Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance status, GPS = Glasgow prognostic score.

It is hypothesised that the increase in protein degradation may reflect the increased activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the lysosmal system, and that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has the predominant role in patients experiencing weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Conversely the anabolic pathway involves the activation of the P13K/Akt and mTOR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], leading to phosphorylation and activation of its downstream target proteins, the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The decrease in protein synthesis is hypothesised to be due to changes to the phosphorylation of these initiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT)</title><p>While a variety of pharmacological approaches have been examined for their ability to reduce or reverse cachexia in humans, one approach that has been largely ignored is that of PRT. This is most surprising as PRT has been shown to be a potent stimulus for enhancing muscle growth and strength and mass in a variety of groups including athletes, older adults and for other cancer groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. PRT may down-regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine activity and increase the phosphorylation of intramuscular amino acid signalling molecules mTOR and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>PRT has been used in patients with well-controlled rheumatoid arthritis with cachexia. This phase II study reported that when PRT was performed an average 2.5 times a week for 12 weeks, significant increases in total body skeletal muscle mass occurred with an adjusted (post-test scores adjusted for pre-test scores) total lean mass of 45.0 &#x000b1; 0.3 kg in the training group and by 43.8 &#x000b1; 0.3 in the control group (<italic>P</italic>= 0.005). PRT seemed to be a safe and effective intervention with no exacerbation of the activity of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Aerobic exercise and PRT has become popular in the cancer community in recent years. There is now extensive literature supporting PRT as the most effective method for improving muscle function and strength, and reducing the effects of sarcopenia in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Physical activity has showed consistent improvements in patient rated QoL scores, by patients that are experiencing both health and disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This benefit has been investigated in patients with cancer, although mainly in the breast cancer patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A recent New Zealand study described a positive relationship between quality of life and physical activity in prostate cancer survivors on androgen-deprivation therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The positive relationship between physical activity levels and quality of life in these prostate cancer survivors concurs with the findings of a systematic review examining body composition, functional performance, QoL and physical benefit of exercise in prostate cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Results support the benefits of exercise in improving muscular endurance, aerobic endurance and overall QoL as well as reducing fatigue in prostate cancer patients. This review also recommended that the exercise performed should include a substantial PRT component and be group-based to facilitate greater psychosocial benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. A recent systematic review examined the benefit of an exercise intervention on health related QoL and exercise capacity specifically in NSCLC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Exercise interventions included resistance training, stretching exercises, aerobic training and education regarding exercise, under supervised or unsupervised conditions. Sixteen studies involving thirteen patient groups were assessed. The studies included two randomised controlled trials and nine case series. It was concluded that improvements were seen in patients' exercise capacity when participating in exercise pre-operatively. For patients participating in exercise post-treatment, improvements in exercise capacity was seen, but results for health-related QoL were conflicting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. None of the above studies looked at exercise in relation to the symptom of cachexia.</p></sec><sec><title>Combined approach</title><p>In a recent review it has been shown that resistance exercise and amino acids can independently stimulate skeletal muscle synthesis and that muscle synthesis is greatly increased if amino acids, especially leucine are ingested after the resistance training exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Studies in the older adult have confirmed that providing this nutrition after exercise increases muscle synthesis, although at a slower rate, to levels similar to younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Recently an open non-randomized phase II study looked at the efficacy and safety of an oral amino acid functional cluster supplementation in twenty-five cachectic cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. All patients had advanced cancer at mixed tumour sites. The results of this study showed a significant increase in grip strength (28.2 &#x000b1; 9.5 vs. 30.4 &#x000b1; 9.2, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001), along with the trend of an increase in body weight (Kg) (53.1 &#x000b1; 10.6 vs. 54.2 &#x000b1; 11.1, <italic>P </italic>= 0.056). Improved levels of fatigue on the QoL multidimensional fatigue symptom inventory-short form (MFSI-SF) were seen. A decreasing score is associated with a lower level of fatigue (25 &#x000b1; 8.1 vs. 22 &#x000b1; 7.3, <italic>P </italic>= 0.181). Decreasing CRP (24.7 &#x000b1; 18.1 vs. 17 &#x000b1; 11.4, <italic>P </italic>= 0.066) and interleukin-6 (IL-6 pg/ml) levels (21.3 &#x000b1; 16.4 vs. 13.7 &#x000b1; 4, <italic>P </italic>= 0.157) were also seen. This study suggests that amino acid supplementation may be a beneficial option for the treatment of cancer cachexia, and the integration of an amino acid supplementation into a multi-dimensional approach based on diet, exercise, nutritional support and molecularly targeted drugs for the management of cancer cachexia should be the next step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Such results provide further evidence that PRT is a potent anabolic stimulus and that the anabolic response to PRT can be augmented with pharmacological agents that target selected aspects of the catabolic pathways. The application of such a paradigm in cachectic cancer patients would therefore warrant investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Essential amino acids &#x000b1; resistance training</title><p>Intravenous and orally administered amino acids have been investigated in a number of settings in relation to protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].

Unfortunately in many advanced solid tumours this is unachievable, especially in the case of NSCLC patients. The next best options are to increase nutritional intake and to counteract the weight loss, address the anorexia and reduce inflammation, along with the metabolic alterations i.e. loss of body fat and the skeletal muscle wasting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the current investigation aims to examine a novel treatment regimen that may alleviate and/or stabilise this weight loss. With the goal of increasing muscle anabolism with PRT and essential amino acids high in leucine post exercise, the overall aim is to stabilise the effect of muscle catabolism/anabolism to a net gain in muscle mass. The investigation shall employ a multi-targeted approach by utilizing data gained from the literature to target and decrease the pro-inflammatory cytokines by using a COX-2 inhibitor (celecoxib) and decrease the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway with a proteasome inhibitor EPA. This feasibility study is required before recruiting to a full study to determine if a multi-targeted therapy including PRT is acceptable to this study population along with gaining data around recruitment and retention and safety around this type of clinical study. Variance and intra-patient correlation of the secondary outcomes will then be used to power the main study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Trial organisation</title><p>Auckland's Cancer Cachexia evaluating Resistance Training (ACCeRT) is designed and coordinated by the Department of General Practice and Primary Health Care, University of Auckland, New Zealand.

There are data indicating that a multi-targeted approach is the way forward in this condition. This study aims to provide the information required to conduct a full study to identify a novel treatment regimen that will alleviate and/or stabilise cancer cachexia weight loss and is acceptable to patients with this condition. ACCeRT offers to our knowledge for the first time the initial step required to investigate the importance of stimulating the anabolic skeletal muscle pathway with the use of PRT followed by essential amino acids, alongside the use of this combination of the anti-cachectic agent EPA and anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>ACCeRT: Auckland's Cancer Cachexia evaluating Resistance Training; AEs: Adverse Events; CNS: Central nervous system; CRP: C-reactive protein; COX-1/COX-2: Cyclo-oxygenase-1/-2; ECOG: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; PS: Performance status; EPA: Eicosapentaenoic acid; EAA: Essential amino acids; EORTC QLQ-C30: European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30; FAACT: Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment; GPS: Glasgow prognostic score; IL-6: Interleukin-6; KS: Karnofsky Score; MRI: Magnetic resonance imagining; MFSI-SF: Multidimensional fatigue symptom inventory-short form; NSCLC: Non-small-cell lung cancer; NSAID: Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs; PFS: Progression-free survival; PRT: Progressive resistance training; QoL: Quality of life; RECIST: Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours; SAEs: Serious Adverse Events; TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumour necrosis factor alpha.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declare that they have no competing interests.
