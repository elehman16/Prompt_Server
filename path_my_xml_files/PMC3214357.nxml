Patients were randomly divided into 2 study groups (30 patients in each group). Care was taken to match the patients of the 2 groups by age and clinical criteria. They complained of about 2 voids per night. We divided the patients into 2 study groups. Patients belonging to group A (n = 30) received placebo and patients of group B (n = 30) received 0.1 mg desmopressin at bed time for 8 weeks. Patients were assessed after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment.

Nocturia is a highly prevalent condition and its symptoms do not differ in men and women quantitatively or qualitatively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref> Nocturia causes insomnia or sleep interruption in adult men, which has a negative impact on quality of life (QoL) and quality of sleep (QoS).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Nocturia is defined as increased nocturnal urine output (nocturnal polyuria) and/or diminished nocturnal bladder capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> with a mean of 2.5 or more episodes per night.

Nocturnal polyuria index increases significantly with age (p &#x0003c; 0.0001) and no gender differences are reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></p><p>Nocturia is caused due to various factors like behavioral or environmental and pathologic conditions including lower urinary tract obstruction, anxiety or primary sleep disorders, sleep apnea, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes mellitus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> Nocturia may be caused by combination of these and even other conditions may be attributed including nocturnal polyuria, reduced nocturnal or global bladder capacity, global 24-hour polyuria, or a combination of these factors. Nocturia has been only recently classified on the basis of its etiology and pathogenesis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></p><p>Nocturia may be due to urological and non-urological diseases and some of the possible underlying non-urological diseases may be life-threatening.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> Although several related factors are identified, none account for a substantial proportion of the population burden, indicating the multifactorial etiology of nocturia is found.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>The factors with the great impact at the population level are urinary urgency, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and snoring for men, and overweight and obesity, urgency and snoring for women. In addition, prostate cancer and antidepressant use for men, coronary artery disease and diabetes for women, and restless legs syndrome and obesity for both sexes are some other related factors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></p><p>Nocturia, especially in men, should be treated independent of other urinary tract symptoms. The proper diagnosis and differentiation from other underlying causes of nocturia should lead to appropriate and effective management of this problem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></p><p>A disorder of the vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) system with low or undetectable levels of vasopressin bedtime affects elderly people and may cause an increase in the nocturnal urine output, which in extreme cases accounts for 85% of the 24-hour dieresis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Alpha (1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors are used in men with symptoms indicating benign prostatic hyperplasia and one of their consequences is reduction of nocturia. Antimuscarinic drugs are used to depress involuntary bladder contractions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Desmopressin, a synthetic antidiuretic hormone analogue, is currently approved for the treatment of nocturia along with nocturnal polyuria or multiple sclerosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref> Desmopressin is a synthetic replacement for vasopressin, the hormone that reduces urine production.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref> Desmopressin may be prescribed nasally, intravenously, or in the form of tablets. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators believe desmopressin pills are safe for bedwetting treatment of otherwise healthy patient. Desmopressin limits the outflow of amount of water in the urine. It binds to V2 receptors in renal collecting ducts, causing water reabsorption. It also stimulates release of factor VIII from endothelial cells by stimulating the V1a receptor. Desmopressin degrades slower than recombinant vasopressin, and needs less frequent administration. Moreover, it has less effect on blood pressure, while vasopressin may cause arterial hypertension. It is usually in the form of desmopressin acetate, DDAVP. Patients taking DDAVP likely stay dry 4.5 times more than those taking a placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>Desmopressin does not cause transient or mild disorders so is safer to use.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref> Its side effects may be headache, facial flushing, nausea, hyponatremia, and seizures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></p><p>In the present study, we compared the efficacy of desmopressin with placebo for the treatment of nocturia in a clinical trial, doubleblind study in elderly men. The present study could have certain peculiarities that have not been considered in similar researches reported so far from Iran. To find out the tolerability of the effective dose of drug, we administered the lowest dose of desmopressin to avoid its side effects. More so, minimum dose of desmopressin (0.1 mg) was prescribed in 2 period of time (4 weeks in each period). This study was gender specific. Our patients were only men and not considering other sex. It was also age specific considering men older than 50 years.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we assessed the effect of oral dose of desmopressin bedtime by measuring changes in the number of nocturnal voids from placebo to active treatment. 93 patients were screened in urology clinic of Imam Reza hospital in Tehran, Iran during 2008-2009 to determine the number of nocturnal voids. The main inclusion criteria were voiding twice or more per night.</p><p>The main exclusion criteria were as: uncontrolled disease such as diabetes and cardiac disease, use of diuretics, hypertension, diabetes insipidus, diseases which influences medulla of kidney such as medullary cystic of kidney diseases, multiple sclerosis, urge incontinence and recently surgical treatment for BPH, known functional disease in urinary system for example neurogenic bladder. 33 patients were excluded from the study on different grounds; 20 patients were excluded because of their unwillingness to continue the treatment and 13 patients on the basis of our exclusion criteria.</p><p>60 cases fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled for evaluation of efficacy of oral desmopressin for treatment of nocturia. Safety was evaluated on the basis of reported adverse effects. During the study, 1 hour before bedtime until 8 hours after taking of either desmopressin or placebo, patients drank only to satisfy their thirst, avoiding liquids with a diuretic effect. In case of observing any side effect of the drug, patient was excluded from the study. A consent form was filled by every patient.</p><p>The mean age of patients was 63.38 years with standard deviation of 11.82.

Outcome was evaluated in 3 periods (before treatment, at intervals of 4 and 8 weeks after treatment).</p><p>At last, patients were evaluated considering 3 aspects of nocturia i.e. number of voids (2, &#x0003c; 2, and &#x0003e; 2 episodes), mean number of nocturia, and mean duration of the first sleep period. Safety was evaluated from reported adverse events. The sleep quality was assessed using a quality-of-life questionnaire administered by urological societies, completed by patients before and after the interventions.</p><p>Statistical differences between outcomes of the two groups revealed that differences were significant between the 2 treatment regiments.
