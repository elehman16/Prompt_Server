Partnering with FMs decreases patient anxiety, confusion and agitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], reduces complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], decreases intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and improves long-term cognitive performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Overall, partnering with families helps patients feel more secure and increases patient and family member satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

In an environment where the FM best knows the patient and the heath care team best knows the patient&#x02019;s medical condition, we envision both coming together to make shared decisions and optimize patient outcomes. However, many FMs do not have the knowledge or confidence to perform this role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Accordingly, we set out to develop interventions that support families in this key partnering role.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conceptual model of family engagement in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many factors impact medical decisions for a patient. Patient factors include the patient as a person and their medical condition. Patient as a person represents the person&#x02019;s prior experiences, values, preferences and goals. Environmental factors include the health care environment situated within a larger societal context. Family members may engage in care or decision-making. The family&#x02019;s role in care gives purpose in crisis and may help family members cope with the exposure to critical illness. Their direct participation may also improve patient adherence to treatment plan and attainment of treatment goals. In shared decision-making the family is engaged as a member of the health care team. The family is typically most familiar with the patient as a person and the patient&#x02019;s past health status. The clinicians are typically most knowledgeable of the patient&#x02019;s critical illness. The decision-support intervention is designed to facilitate communication between the family and clinicians about the patient as a person and their medical condition. Family engagement in this manner facilitates a shared medical decision that is consistent with the patient&#x02019;s values and goals in the context of their illness experience and medical condition, and is congruent with what the patient would choose if they were competent to make such a decision. Thus, we hypothesize that family engagement can influence family response to critical illness, and also the treatment plan. Ultimately, both patient and family outcomes are optimized</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2379_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p id="Par9">To inform the development of the interventions, we used three theoretical frameworks (<italic>Lightening our Load</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], <italic>Working to Get Through</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and <italic>Facilitated Sensemaking</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]) developed by members of our team. These models recognize the importance of FM involvement and participation in communication, decision-making, and bedside care. The resultant sense of purpose and control may reduce post-intensive care syndrome, a series of stress-related complications experienced by FMs of critically ill patients (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Post-intensive care syndrome among families of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors.

We hypothesize that the multi-faceted strategies that engage families in patient care will: (1) increase the patient&#x02019;s nutritional intake; (2) optimize physical recovery in older critically ill patients at high risk of nutritional problems; (3) reduce FMs&#x02019; psychological distress; (4) improve family satisfaction with decision-making; and (5) reduce the duration of ICU stay for future decedents. We further hypothesize that the trial will be feasible (as judged by enrollment rates and compliance with the protocol), the interventions efficacious, and contamination rates low (&#x0003c;10% of families in the usual care group will have been exposed to either or other interventions).

By comparing the effects of the two treatment groups to the usual care group, we will understand the overall treatment effect of each intervention. To control for the possibility that the extra time and attention provided to families through the interventions may alter their perception of care and impact the outcomes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], we will also compare the treatment effects between two active interventions, thereby addressing this potential &#x0201c;placebo effect.&#x0201d; The comparison of the two active interventions groups will be considered secondary to the comparisons of each active group to the usual care group.

The dietitian will collect the patient&#x02019;s brief nutritional history, verbally communicate the results of the nutritional risk assessment to the FM and clinical team, and place copies of the assessment in the hospital record. In addition, they will educate the FM about nutritional support in the ICU, focusing on capacitating all FMs to interact with health care providers (HCPs) and ask them about the nutrition that their critically ill relative is receiving. The FM will be provided with a booklet that reiterates the nutritional information and includes materials to help the family approach and ask questions of HCPs.

The dietitian will communicate with the FM throughout the ICU stay to answer questions and identify unmet needs.</p><p id="Par18">At or near the time of the patient&#x02019;s ICU discharge, the dietician will provide further education based on the patient&#x02019;s current nutritional status (i.e., receiving nutritional support, eating by mouth, swallowing difficulties), information about the nutrition that the patient can expect once on the ward, and will show the FM an educational video specific to nutrition after ICU discharge. As soon as the patient transitions to oral intake, the dietitian will introduce the FM to the nutrition diary, an oral intake audit tool to record the patient&#x02019;s oral food intake at each meal. The patient will be followed by the ICU dietitian while in the ICU and by the ward dietitian once transferred.</p><p id="Par19">Once patients in all groups are taking liquids by mouth, they will receive two or more Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS) per day (approximately 400&#x000a0;kcal/day) as the existing academic literature suggests a positive impact on patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This is considered to be part of standard of care, but in this nutritional intervention arm the FM will be encouraged to advocate for the patient to receive them, coach the patient to take them as ordered, and monitor oral intake of the supplements using the nutrition diary. A nutrition care plan for the ward will be developed by the dietitian and communicated to the FM and patient. A 3-day calorie count will be completed weekly to capture calories and protein consumed from oral intake, including ONS, while the patient is on the ward until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 4&#x000a0;weeks, whichever comes first. Just prior to hospital discharge, the dietitian will work with the patient and FM to develop a home nutrition plan provided to them in writing at the time of discharge.

Paper copies of the electronic content will also be given to FMs and a link to the website so they can return to review materials at a later date. After completing the ICU Workbook with FMs, the RC will verbally communicate the results of the exercises to the clinical team. The questions and answers will be summarized and copies of the report placed on the hospital record, and a copy will be given to the FMs. Next, the RC will work with the health care team to arrange a family meeting including the attending physician and bedside nurse to review patient goals of care within 72&#x000a0;h of completing the ICU Workbook. The RC will attend this meeting to record its content using the Observing Patient Involvement (OPTION) tool (described below).

The future phase III IMPACT trial will likely have two co-primary outcomes related to the nutritional and decision-support interventions. For the nutritional intervention, the primary outcome will represent the patient&#x02019;s physical recovery long term (i.e., 6-minute walk distance at or before hospital discharge, activities of daily living, and the 36-item Short Form survey (SF-36) Physical Function at 6&#x000a0;months) as suggested by current experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Secondary outcomes include adequacy of nutrition in the ICU, ONS consumption on the wards, time to discharge alive from hospital (time-to-event analysis with death as competing risk), ICU and hospital outcomes (mortality and length of stay), 90-day readmission rates, and the cost-effectiveness of the intervention. We expect that as a consequence of their involvement and engagement in patient care, FMs&#x02019; psychological well-being will be improved as well in this group. For the decision-support intervention, the primary outcome will be a measure of family psychological well-being (symptoms of depression and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]), and post-traumatic stress disorder (Impact of Events-Revised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]) 6&#x000a0;months after the ICU stay). Secondary outcomes will include family satisfaction with decision-making using the Decision-making component of the Family Satisfaction with ICU Care (FS-ICU24) subscale and length of ICU stay for decedents (a marker of poor quality end-of-life (EOL) care from patients&#x02019; perspective and that has been responsive to prior palliative care interventions in the ICU).</p><p id="Par23">For the purpose of this phase II study, we are evaluating more proximal (short-term) outcomes and process measures. These outcomes will be collected by the RC and will be assessed 2&#x02013;3 weeks after ICU-related death or discharge or prior to hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> presents all process measures (short-term or long-term) planned for the current phase II and future III studies. To enable comparisons across all three groups, all process and outcome measures will be performed for all patients. With respect to the nutritional intervention, one of the key short-term outcomes will be nutritional adequacy during ICU stay. We have previously shown that patients who receive greater nutritional adequacy support in the ICU have better long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the ICU, to assess nutritional adequacy, the total amount of energy or protein received from either enteral nutrition (EN) or parenteral nutrition (PN), inclusive of propofol, will be divided by the amount prescribed in the baseline assessment and expressed as a percentage for patients in all groups. Unfortunately, no easy method exists to measure nutritional adequacy on the hospital wards where patients are likely taking nutrition by mouth. We plan to do 3-day calorie counts weekly for 4&#x000a0;weeks during the hospital study as well as collect the use of ONS from all study patients.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Outcomes considered in the IMPACT protocol program of research</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Process measures</th><th>Short-term (hospital) outcomes<sup>a</sup> (current phase II)</th><th>Long-term (months following hospital discharge) outcomes (future phase III)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Nutritional intervention</td><td>Compliance with the intervention Met with dietitian early in ICU stay and at ICU discharge to review materials Received a nutrition plan at ICU and ward discharge Used nutrition audit tool</td><td>Nutritional adequacy during ICU stay Consumption of Oral Nutritional Supplements during hospital stay Intake on hospital wards (3-day calorie count) Hand-grip strength at or before hospital discharge</td><td>Measures of patient&#x02019;s long-term physical recovery (e.g., 6 MWD at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months)</td></tr><tr><td>Decision-support intervention</td><td>Compliance with the intervention Met with RC early and went through the myicuguide website Family meeting to review intervention output within 72&#x000a0;h of encounter Patient-centered report from MyICUGuide on chart during ICU and hospital stay and attending physician aware of contents of this report</td><td>Use of shared-decision making (OPTION<sup>a</sup> tool) during initial family conference Change in decisional conflict at 1&#x000a0;week Family satisfaction with decision-making at ICU discharge (or 2&#x02013;3 weeks later for decedents)</td><td>Measure of family member&#x02019;s long-term psychological well-being Length of ICU and hospital stay for decedents</td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Contamination (families exposed to an intervention to which they were not assigned) Exposed to myicuguide website Exposed to OPTICs content</td><td>Overall family satisfaction with ICU care at ICU discharge (or 2&#x02013;3 weeks later for decedents)</td><td/></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Table of current and projected outcomes for the IMPACT program of research</p><p><sup>a</sup>All outcomes listed in this column will be measured in all randomized patients</p><p>6MWD, 6-minute walk distance, <italic>ICU</italic> intensive care unit</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par24">For the purposes of this phase II trial, we will assess physical recovery by measuring hand-grip strength at hospital discharge for patients in all groups.
