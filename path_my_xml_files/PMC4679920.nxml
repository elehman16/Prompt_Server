Usually, the debridement is carried out by irrigating the tendon sheath in a proximal to distal direction facilitated by two small incisions. It is unclear whether intraoperative irrigation by itself is adequate for healing or if it should be combined with postoperative irrigation in the ward. The hypothesis of this prospective randomised trial is that intraoperative catheter irrigation alone is as effective as a combination of intraoperative and postoperative intermittent catheter irrigation in the treatment of purulent flexor tenosynovitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>In this investigator-blinded, prospective randomised trial, 48 patients suffering from purulent flexor tenosynovitis are randomised in two groups. Intraoperative catheter irrigation of the flexor tendon sheath and antibiotic treatment is identical in both groups, whereas only the patients in one group are subjected to intermittent postoperative catheter irrigation three times a day for 3&#x02005;days. The primary outcome measure is total active range of movement of the affected finger after 3&#x02005;months of surgery. The secondary outcome is the need for reoperation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The research ethics committee of Pirkanmaa Hospital District has approved the study protocol. The protocol has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov registry (#NCT02320929). All participants will give written informed consent. The study results will elucidate the role of postoperative irrigation, which can be criticised as being labour consuming and unpleasant to the patient. The results of the study will be disseminated as a published article in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number:</title><p>NCT02320929; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>INFECTIOUS DISEASES</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Background</title><p>Without immediate and adequate treatment, purulent flexor tenosynovitis of the hand may result in prolonged pain, stiffness and even permanent functional disability. Successful management of purulent flexor tenosynovitis is based on surgical debridement followed by intravenous antibiotic treatment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Several surgical methods have been described to remove the purulent debris from the flexor tendon sheath.</p><p>Originally, Kanavel<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> reported extensive open debridement and irrigation, which today is applicable only in atypical or very advanced cases of purulent flexor tenosynovitis.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Open irrigation is carried out using either a midaxial or Bruner approach to the tendon sheath, and, after debridement, the wound has been described as being loosely closed with sutures.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Later, several authors<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;11</xref> described different surgical methods for catheter irrigation, which does not require extensive surgery and, at least theoretically, can facilitate faster recovery. The procedure involves irrigation of the tendon sheath in a proximal to distal direction facilitated by two small incisions; one proximal to the A1 pulley and one distal to the A4 pulley.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Closure of the proximal wound using sutures, with catheter in place, has been suggested, while the distal wound is left open with a small Penrose drain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The closed-catheter irrigation is normally continued in the ward for 48&#x02005;h,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and it can be continuous,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

However, no statistical analyses were conducted. Gutowski <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> compared catheter irrigation with open irrigation and debridement, and found no statistically significant differences, although there was a statistically insignificant trend towards increased frequency of reoperations in the open irrigation and debridement group. All in all, no procedure has been shown to be superior to another, but, nevertheless, the consensus currently favours intraoperative catheter irrigation to open drainage.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Most patients consider postoperative intermittent catheter irrigation in the ward an inconvenient and even painful procedure.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The existence of the catheter may also delay the beginning of hand therapy. And, when considering the resources, although postoperative irrigation is a simple operation, it is still labour consuming. Lille <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> conducted a retrospective study implying that intraoperative closed-catheter irrigation without postoperative irrigation might be as effective as a combination of intraoperative and postoperative irrigation. However, being retrospective, the study design suffers from several possible confounding effects (eg, sampling bias, observer bias).</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Primary aim</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to find if intermittent postoperative catheter irrigation of the tendon sheath provides any additional benefit after intraoperative irrigation in the treatment of purulent flexor tenosynovitis.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>The hypothesis is that intraoperative closed-catheter irrigation alone is as effective as a combination of intraoperative and postoperative intermittent closed-catheter irrigation, in the treatment of purulent flexor tenosynovitis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The trial is designed as a randomised, investigator and outcome assessor blinded single-centre trial with two parallel groups, and a primary end point of total range of movement of the affected finger after 3&#x02005;months of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Setting</title><p>The recruitment of the patients will take place in the emergency department of the Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.

The procedure for intraoperative irrigation of the infected flexor tendon sheath is a modification of a guideline described by Gutowski <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015008824F1">figure 1</xref>). The flexor tendon sheath is opened proximal to the A1 pulley of the affected finger. Bacterial cultures are collected and the appearance of the exudate is noted. An 18-gauge angiocatheter is inserted percutaneously into the wound, approximately 1&#x02005;cm proximal to the incision. The tip of the catheter is placed within the sheath under the A1 pulley and the catheter is secured to the skin, using a suture. A counter incision is made midaxially at the level of the A4 pulley. A midaxial incision is favoured in order to avoid inconvenient scarring on the palmar surface of the finger. The tendon sheath is irrigated with 50&#x02005;mL of physiological saline through a proximal catheter. The irrigation is continued until the output is clear. A small rubber drain is placed in both incisions to keep them open. If the thumb is involved, the catheter is placed in the flexor pollicis longus sheath distal to the carpal tunnel. If needed, a separate incision is made radial to the flexor carpi radialis tendon to drain the most proximal part of the tendon sheath. Depending on the group allocation after randomisation, the catheter is thereafter removed or retained. A normal hand dressing is applied.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015008824F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Schematic presentation of catheter irrigation.

On day 3, the tip of the removed angiocatheter is sent for bacterial culture. Hand therapy is initiated as early as possible in the ward. Antibiotic treatment is initiated in the operating room after the bacterial samples are collected. The primary antibiotic treatment is cefuroxime 1.5&#x02005;g three times a day. The secondary choice (in case of allergy) is clindamycin. After discharge, the peroral antibiotic (primarily cephalexin) is continued for 10&#x02005;days.

It also delays the beginning of hand therapy, since the catheter on the volar aspect of the hand blocks active and passive flexion exercises. In this era of multiresistant bacterial strains, any unnecessary handling of fluids, wounds and foreign bodies (eg, plastic angiocatheter) in hospital wards is a potential threat of superinfection. The objective of this prospective randomised study is to elucidate the necessity of postoperative irrigation.</p><p>Currently, prospective randomised trials are considered the best methodological approach for evaluating the efficacy of a specific intervention. The limitations of this study are: the patients cannot be blinded to the intervention and the statistical power is not adequate to show clinically relevant differences in reoperation rate, since the incidence is most likely low in both study arms. Since the requirement to include the patient in this study is that all four Kanavel signs<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> are positive, there is a chance that some patients having purulent tenosynovitis but lacking some of the signs may be excluded. The selection of our tertiary outcome variable, QuickDASH,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> can also be questioned, since the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ) has been postulated to be slightly more sensitive to functional changes concerning hand injuries.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> However, we justify our selection by the fact that the MHQ has not been validated in Finnish, and DASH has been shown to be similarly reproducible and valid for finger and wrist disorders as the MHQ.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been registered to ClinicalTrials.gov registry (#NCT02320929) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015008824TB1">table 1</xref>). Any protocol modifications will be documented in the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. None of the authors have any conflict of interest to declare. The patient will be asked for consent before entering the study and can discontinue the study at any time without any obligation to report a reason for the decision. Intraoperative catheter irrigation can be considered the gold standard when treating purulent flexor tenosynovitis. Postoperative irrigation is a normal procedure, supposedly benefiting recovery, but it is not imperative, and there is some evidence that it might be redundant.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The study results will elucidate the role of postoperative irrigation. If postoperative irrigation is found to be redundant, it may simplify the treatment in those units where it has been a standard protocol. The results of the study will be disseminated as a published article in a peer-reviewed journal. The study will be implemented and reported in line with the CONSORT statement.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015008824TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Items from the clinical trials.gov data set</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data category</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary registry and trial identifying number</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ClinicalTrials.gov<break/>NCT02320929</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Date of registration in primary registry</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 December 2014</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Date and version identifier</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 August 2015, v.1.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Source(s) of monetary or material support</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary sponsor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tampere University Hospital<break/>Teiskontie 35<break/>33520 Tampere<break/>Finland</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Secondary sponsor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">University of Tampere</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contact for public queries</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Olli V Lepp&#x000e4;nen, email: olli.v.leppanen@uta.fi, Tel.: +358-3-31167745</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Contact for scientific queries</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Olli V Lepp&#x000e4;nen, email: olli.v.leppanen@uta.fi, Tel.: +358-3-31167745</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Public title</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">The treatment of purulent flexor tenosynovitis&#x02014;is postoperative catheter irrigation necessary?</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scientific title</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">An investigator-blinded, randomised, 3&#x02005;months, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy of intraoperative tendon sheath irrigation only with both intraoperative and postoperative irrigation in the treatment of purulent flexor tenosynovitis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Countries of recruitment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Finland</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health condition(s) or problem(s) studied</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Purulent flexor tenosynovitis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention(s)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intraoperative tendon sheath irrigation; intraoperative and postoperative tendon sheath irrigation</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Key inclusion and exclusion criteria</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ages eligible for study: &#x02265;18&#x02005;years<break/>Sexes eligible for study: both<break/>Accepts healthy volunteers: no<break/>Inclusion criteria: clinical diagnosis of purulent flexor tenosynovitis with all four positive Kanavel signs<break/>Exclusion criteria: high-pressure, foreign body or chemical injuries that require open debridement; being a prisoner or military serviceman, being mentally retarded or having other factors that may affect decision-making</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study type</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Interventional<break/>Allocation: randomised<break/>Intervention model: parallel assignment<break/>Masking: single blind (investigator, outcomes assessor)<break/>Primary purpose: treatment</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Date of first enrolment</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">March 2015</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Target sample size</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">48</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recruitment status</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Recruiting</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Primary outcome(s)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total range of movement of the affected finger (time frame: 3&#x02005;months; not designated as safety issue)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Key secondary outcomes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Need for reoperation (time frame: 3&#x02005;months; not designated as safety issue); QuickDASH (time frame: 3&#x02005;months; not designated as safety issue); pain at rest (time frame: 3&#x02005;months; not designated as safety issue)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>QuickDASH, Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> OVL conceived of the study.
