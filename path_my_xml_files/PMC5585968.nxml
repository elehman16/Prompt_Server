We conducted a double-blind, two-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, lasting 23 months, to address this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">Eighty children with chronic mild/moderate eczema were randomly allocated to Group A (placebo) or Group B (treatment group; Galium-Heel&#x000ae;, a low-dose multicomponent medicine based upon natural substances; Guna-Interleukin 12 and Guna-Interferon-&#x003b3; administered twice a day for six non-consecutive months for each stage). LDM is characterized by the use of biological molecules, such as cytokines, neuropeptides, growth factors, hormones at very low concentrations, which correspond to physiological levels within the human body. The dosage of the cytokines used in this trial (IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12) is 10 fg/ml. The SCORAD index was evaluated by the same operator: subjects with a SCORAD index below 20 were considered to have mild eczema (61/80; mean: 10.79), whereas a SCORAD index between 20&#x02013;50 indicated moderate eczema (19/80; mean: 26.84). The data of 66/80 children were analyzed in stage 1 and those of 62/66 children in stage 2. The primary outcome measure was reduction of eczema severity assessed by the SCORAD index. Secondary outcomes were disease-free interval, and treatment safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The decrease in disease severity was greater in Group B than in Group A already in stage 1 (a decrease 63.9% versus 53.2%), but the difference was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.16). Moreover, subjective symptoms (itching and sleep disturbances) initially decreased and then worsened in Group A, whereas itching decreased linearly and sleep disturbances decreased significantly (<italic>p</italic>=0.049) in Group B.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Preliminary evidence suggests potential benefit, but further work is needed to validate this approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">The trial was registered with EudraCT number 2010&#x02013;018640-13 through the database of the National Clinical Trials Monitoring Centre Database (Osservatorio delle Sperimentazioni Cliniche, OsSC) of the Italian Medicines Agency.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Eczema</kwd><kwd>Immunomodulation</kwd><kwd>Low-dose medicine</kwd><kwd>SCORAD index</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>GUNA S.p.a &#x02013; Via Palmanova, 71 Milan, Italy</institution></funding-source><award-id>prot.n&#x000b0; 1119/10/002B</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par15">Eczema is the most frequent chronic inflammatory condition in childhood; indeed it affects up to 20% of children and starts in the first years of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, and disturbed skin barrier function as well as innate and adaptive immune defects, are associated with eczema onset, although the pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is a frustrating condition for both patients and caregivers because intense pruritus and sleep disturbances can be intractable, and can negatively impact on school, social and family life thereby resulting in psychological difficulties for all the family, and a high socioeconomic burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Conventional treatment of moderate-severe eczema may not be sufficient to control the activity of skin lesions, and a small subset of children require more aggressive systemic therapy which is not without side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Low-dose medicine (LDM) is a new therapeutic approach theorized and developed starting from the most recent knowledge in molecular biology, psycho-neuro-endocrine-immunology, and research results in the field of low dose pharmacology. The most intriguing aspect of LDM is the efficacy of oral administration of low dose &#x0201c;signaling molecules&#x0201d;. The use of physiological low doses (predominantly nanograms-femtograms) <italic>per os</italic> in LDM is made possible by the application of SKA (<italic>Sequential Kinetic Activation</italic>) technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. SKA is a sophisticated drug delivery system, developed according to a pharmaceutical techniques based upon a mechanical process.</p><p id="Par17">The action mechanism of SKA low dose cytokines consists in sensitization and activation of some units of cellular (or plasmatic) receptors in virtue of their low concentration, practically in their physiological working range between 10<sup>-12</sup>&#x000a0;M and 10<sup>-15</sup>&#x000a0;M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. LDM exerts pharmacomodulatory activity that can restore the homeostatic balance between the various lymphocyte populations, particularly in allergic and inflammatory diseases. In Gariboldi et al., low-dose concentrations of IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; have been used in the in vivo treatment of experimental allergic bronchial asthma (in an animal model) with very encouraging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cardani et al. demonstrated that oral administration of low-dose IL-10 and Ab anti-IL-1 is able to control intestinal inflammation in an in vivo animal model of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Roberti ML et al. demonstrated the immunomodulatory activity of IL-4, IL-10, and IL-11 in psoriasis vulgaris [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The purpose of our double-blind, two-stage randomized clinical trial was to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of long-term LDM treatment in children affected by mild/moderate chronic eczema.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par19">The aim of this double-blind, two-stage, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of long-term treatment (23&#x000a0;months) with LDM <italic>vs</italic> placebo in children with chronic mild/moderate eczema. Patients were randomized into either Group A (placebo group) or Group B (treatment group).

Subjects who satisfied the eligibility criteria were randomly allocated to Group A or Group B, and identified by their initials and a serial number. Group B (treatment group) was treated with Galium-Heel&#x000ae; (Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, Baden Baden, Germany), Guna-Interleukin 12 and Guna-Interferon &#x003b3; at the concentration of 10&#x000a0;fg/ml SKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] in hydro-alcoholic solution 30%. Each preparation was orally administered (8 drops in children aged &#x02264;5&#x000a0;years and 15 drops in children above the age of 5) twice daily for 6 non-consecutive months in each stage. This concentration is far from being toxic, therefore the concept of pharmacological use in terms of &#x0201c;pro-kg amount&#x0201d; would be nonsense.

In the first stage of this study, disease severity decreased in both groups, although more so in treated than in untreated children (63.9% vs 53.2%) (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The improvement in the untreated children may be partially explained by the clinical practice of treating the skin of patients using detergents and particular emollients and moisturizers.

In fact, the follow-up data showed an improvement in the SCORAD index in the two groups at both stages of the study, but the effect was more pronounced in Group B. Moreover, the finding that itching and sleep disturbances improved in Group A children between T0 and T8, and worsened greatly between T8 and T14 follow-up confirms that eczema is a complex disease in which the psychological aspect plays an important role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Itching and sleep disturbances improved in Group B children between T0 and T8, and between T8 and T14 follow-up thereby confirming the long-term immunomodulation of LDM (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Subjective symptoms improved in Group B between T0 and T8 and this improvement was maintained during T8-T14 (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This finding is even more relevant considering that the consumption of symptomatic drugs was 30% lower in Group B than in Group A (9&#x000a0;months/person <italic>vs</italic> 30&#x000a0;months/person; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) with an improvement in the family management of eczema according to the parents and children during control visits.

Specific studies about the stability of cytokines at intestinal pH have never been conducted, nevertheless the abundance of data produced about the pharmacological activity of those oral administered molecules in sub-nanomolar concentrations enhances the hypothesis of a mechanism overcoming the gastro-intestinal barrier. Moreover, it is difficult to investigate the pharmacokinetics of low-dose orally administered cytokines. The limits of sensitivity of current assay techniques do not allow to perform pharmacokinetic tests following the oral administration of the above mentioned proteins at the usual concentrations (fg/ml).

This immunomodulating effect could underlie the decrease in the SCORAD index and the clinical improvements seen in our study. In particular, IFN-&#x003b3; is a powerful modulator of the Th2 lymphocyte clone, and IL-12 is a strong signal of induction of IFN-&#x003b3;. In addition, IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; mirror the Th1/Th2 imbalance and the state of inflammation of eczema. Consequently, the expansion of the Th2 lymphocyte clone can be regulated by administration of low-dose SKA IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Consequently, we studied the immunomodulatory effect of IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 low-dose SKA. We did not identify a linear variation between blood levels of inflammatory cytokines and the clinical effects observed after administration of low-dose SKA IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 (data not shown). Similarly, we were unable to identify changes in the blood concentrations of these molecules that could support the clinical results, probably because of their brief half life and the very low concentration at which they were administered.</p><p id="Par46">In terms of pharmacoeconomics, the advantages of LDM treatments for chronic eczema are compelling, even though it is difficult to compare the costs of a topical/oral symptomatic therapy to an immunomodulating one.</p><p id="Par47">Since LDM therapies are mainly aimed at recovering the homeostasis of the entire system, the need of symptomatic therapies for the management of different and numerous symptoms results to be much lower, as emerged by this clinical trial (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).
