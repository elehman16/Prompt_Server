Few of them discontinue the treatment due to augmentation of RLS and appearance of impulse control disorders.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Among dopamine agonists, NEDAs such as ropinirole, pramipexole, and rotigotine have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recently, gabapentin enacarbil has also been approved by FDA for use in RLS.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In addition, treatment with iron (oral as well as IV) has also been reported to improve or resolve symptoms of RLS but lacks evidence.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>It has been observed in previous studies that RLS is commonly associated with depression though most of the commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs exacerbate the symptoms of RLS.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, there is mounting evidence that bupropion, a selective noradrenergic-dopaminergic reuptake inhibitor, does not exacerbate the symptoms of RLS.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In some studies, bupropion has been found to relieve symptoms of RLS with an added advantage of fewer side effects, tolerable adverse drug reactions (ADR) ADRs, and reasonable cost compared with dopamine agonists.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Considering these facts, it would be worthwhile to compare the efficacy of fixed-dose schedules of bupropion and ropinirole and iron alone for the treatment of RLS. To best of our knowledge, no such study is available so far. Thus, the present study was planned to compare the efficacy by assessing the improvement in severity of RLS over 6 weeks of therapy in patients receiving bupropion or ropinirole or oral iron therapy alone. Another aim of the study was to look for the tolerability of these medications among three groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Participants of either sex aging 18 years or more who attended the sleep clinic were screened for the presence of RLS according to the international RLS study group criteria.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Patients with the diagnosis of RLS were explained the rationale of the study and were requested to participate.

Similarly, cases where history was suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea, parasomnia, hypersomnia, and neurocognitive disorders were also excluded from the study. In addition, participants with either restrictive or obstructive pulmonary diseases or pregnant women were also not included in this study. All these conditions were diagnosed based on history, clinical examination, and laboratory investigations, wherever required.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Therapy</title><p>Cases who consented to participate in the study were randomly divided into three groups till we had thirty patients in each group who have completed 6 weeks of trial. After randomization, medicines were given in a double-blinded manner. Cases fell in one of the following groups: Group A: Bupropion (150 mg/day once daily for first 5 days followed by 300 mg/day in two divided doses), Group B: Ropinirole (0.25 mg before bedtime during first 2 weeks that was increased to 0.5 mg/day before bedtime afterwards), and lastly, Group C: Oral iron (150 mg elemental iron) along with folic acid (500 &#x003bc;g) once a day before bedtime. These doses remained fixed till the end of the study. The night-time doses in all groups were given 2 h before the bedtime.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Schedule of visits</title><p>Each case was assessed at the baseline, and thereafter, every 14<sup>th</sup> day with the margin of 1 day till 6 weeks. Thus, all the cases had four visits. Biochemical parameters were examined at the baseline and on the last visit. The severity of RLS and RLS-related quality of life (see below) were assessed on each visit. Adverse effects of the medications were recorded on second, third, and fourth visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Severity of restless legs syndrome</title><p>Severity of RLS was assessed using Hindi version of the international RLS severity rating scale.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The severity symptoms were assessed at the time of randomization, as well as at the time of follow-up once every 2-week for 6 weeks.

The lower the score means, the less-severe is the disease.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Based on the score, cases may be categorized into mild (1&#x02013;10), moderate (11&#x02013;20), severe (21&#x02013;30), and very severe (31&#x02013;40).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Restless legs syndrome-related quality of life</title><p>The patients were also assessed for their quality of life using Restless Legs Syndrome Quality of Life (RLSQoL) questionnaire[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] on every visit. It is a validated tool consisting of 18 questions based on how RLS affects the quality of life and measures three basic parameters that may affect the overall quality of life score, work statuses, and sexual interest.

Descriptive statistics was calculated. Categorical variable was presented as proportions. For continuous variables, skewing was calculated. Chi-square test was used to compare proportions between groups. Continuous variables across three groups were compared using one-way ANOVA. The response to therapy at various points was measured using mixed ANOVA with covariates. Baseline hemoglobin, serum ferritin, and serum folate were considered as covariates as they have been described in association with RLS. While comparing the change in RLS severity and RLS-related quality of life across four points of measurements, test of sphericity could not be met in this sample; hence, the Greenhouse-Geisser corrected degrees of freedom were used during interpretation of results. Leven's test depicted that variance was homogeneous.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>This study included a total of 103 patients, out of which thirty cases were assigned to each group.

It appears unlikely if we take into account the studies that have found that iron therapy and bupropion had shown greater improvement as compared to the placebo in the past.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Moreover, both bupropion and iron are at least theoretically involved in the pathophysiology of RLS by reducing the reuptake of dopamine and improving the dopamine synthesis, respectively.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Still, in the absence of the placebo arm, this notion cannot be completely ruled out.</p><p>Like earlier reports, the present study has also found improvement in the RLS-related quality of life in all three groups across time; however, in contradiction to previous studies, we did not find any difference between groups on this measure.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It could be related to the fact that earlier studies have compared the ropinirole or oral iron with placebo. Ropinirole is a known dopamine agonist, and thus it may reduce the burden of symptoms and thereby improves the quality of life. Other two molecules that we studied were also pathophysiologically related to the RLS and thus, they could not be considered as placebo.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] This could be one reason why we found improvement in RLS-related quality of life among all groups. The absence of difference among groups could be related to the fact that IRLS and RLSQoL address separate issues. Although Allen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] have reported a correlation between these two scales, Vishwakarma <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] did not find the same in the Indian population.</p><p>One of the major implications of this study is the use of bupropion in patients with RLS who also have comorbid depression.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, it must be noted that RLS may clinically mimic depression or may be found comorbid with depression or as an adverse effect of antidepressant therapy.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] As another implication, we also reinforce the conclusion that bupropion should be tested further as an agent to manage RLS in larger randomized, double-blind, controlled trials, especially those patients who are not able to tolerate dopamine agonists or alpha-2-delta ligand agonists.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>However, like any other study, this study also had some methodological limitations. First, the sample size was small. Second, the study period was short. Third, doses of the ropinirole were small as compared to the doses mentioned in literature, leaving a possibility that symptoms could be better managed with higher doses. Fourth, we did not control the groups for the presence of depressive symptoms. Fifth, disease duration was short. Sixth, cases included in this study were younger as compared to many of the earlier studies. Lastly, we did not have the placebo arm.</p><p>Despite, all these limitations, this is the first study to compare the efficacy of ropinirole with bupropion and oral iron therapy in a randomized, double-blind manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that ropinirole improves the symptoms of RLS, yet bupropion and oral iron therapy were also effective.
