Changes in the number and size of such endometriotic lesions were often used to assess the efficacy of treatment options for endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, there is no direct correlation between the extent of these lesions and the severity of the symptoms experienced by the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Potential explanations for this lack of correlation are that the level of pain induced by endometriosis might be determined by the depth of tissue intrusion of a specific lesion, or that there may be a direct interaction of endometriotic lesions and nerve fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Neither of these potential explanations can be assessed by visual inspection during surgery and are therefore not reflected in the respective scoring systems for endometriosis severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Typical symptoms of endometriosis include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and chronic pelvic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Pain is commonly considered the most relevant symptom and the primary reason for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Different tools for assessing pain in endometriosis, such as the visual analog scale (VAS) or numerical rating scales, have been used in the past. Recommendations on how to assess endometriosis-related symptoms in a way that allows for comparison of results between clinical trials have recently been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, publications on the validity of the pain and quality-of-life scales for use in endometriosis are still scarce and information on the psychometric properties of such tools in the indication of endometriosis are generally lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>When comparing the efficacy of different active treatments in endometriosis-associated pelvic pain (EAPP), a non-inferiority-also called a one-sided equivalence-study design is often used. This is because a new treatment modality might provide a benefit for the patient (e.g., better tolerability and/or safety) even if it is not superior to existing treatments with regard to efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The methodological principles for the non-inferiority trial design are described in the International Conference on Harmonisation guideline E10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The design of a non-inferiority study requires the a priori definition of a non-inferiority margin, often called delta, which describes the threshold value of clinical relevance.</p><p>There are clinical and statistical aspects to be considered when choosing a non-inferiority margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The major clinical requirement for choosing a non-inferiority margin is that any treatment difference smaller than the non-inferiority margin should not be of clinical relevance. The major statistical requirement for choosing a non-inferiority margin is that the non-inferiority margin is small enough to exclude the effect of placebo. The focus of this paper is to empirically define the threshold value of clinical relevance for EAPP measured on a VAS that fulfils these criteria. It should be noted that the definition of the clinically relevant threshold is independent of the difference between a given treatment and placebo. However, exclusion of the placebo effect needs to be considered when applying the threshold value of clinical relevance in a clinical trial.</p><p>The data for this paper derive from two recent randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in EAPP. Both trials used a very similar design, which is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The patients recorded their EAPP on a VAS at screening, baseline, during, and at the end of treatment (week 12). At the end of the treatment, patients also rated their satisfaction with treatment using a modification of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale-global improvement item [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This simple and well-established tool for the assessment of overall treatment effect was used as an anchor for the definition of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for EAPP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>These two international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies investigated the efficacy and safety of two different compounds in the treatment of endometriosis.</p><p>Study 1 was conducted at 33 centers in Germany (n = 19), Italy (n = 8), and Ukraine (n = 6).

From these measurements, the individual absolute change in EAPP was derived by subtracting the baseline VAS score from the VAS score at end of treatment. At the end of treatment, patients also rated their overall satisfaction using the CGI scale-global improvement item. For one patient, a missing assessment was replaced by the corresponding physician's assessment, because these two ratings showed substantial agreement (weighted &#x003ba; coefficient 0.69, n = 294; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.75), according to the definition of Landis and Koch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Missing VAS scores were not imputed. In cases where patients dropped out prematurely, the last available measurement under treatment was included in the analysis (last value carried forward method).</p><p>All variables were analyzed by descriptive statistics, either by absolute and relative frequencies for discrete data, or by the number of non-missing observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum for metric data.</p><p>Given that several categories on the seven-point GCI scale were rarely ticked by the women (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), the scale was aggregated to a three-point scale for further analyses. The entries "very much satisfied" and "much satisfied" were merged into "satisfied" and the entries "neither satisfied nor dissatisfied" to "very much dissatisfied" were merged into "undecided or worse", whereas the category "minimally satisfied" was left unchanged. These three resulting categories were of approximately equal size and there were no relevant differences in the VAS scores for the categories merged. This one-sided approach was used because the patients reporting themselves as "neither satisfied nor dissatisfied" showed, on average, a slight improvement of their VAS scores and because this approach also conserved the direction of the changes.</p><p>A bidirectional approach was additionally added as a sensitivity analysis, with the assumption that patients rate an increase in pain in the same way as a reduction in pain. For this analysis, the CGI categories were grouped into the three categories: "much change" (including the categories "very much satisfied", "much satisfied", "much dissatisfied", and "very much dissatisfied"), "minimal change" (including the categories "minimally satisfied" and "minimally dissatisfied"), and "no change" (the remaining CGI category "neither satisfied nor dissatisfied"). VAS score changes for satisfied patients (who were assumed to have a reduction in pain) were multiplied by-1 for this analysis.</p><p>Boxplots were drawn using the 10th and 90th percentile as endpoints of the whiskers.

A non-parametric discriminant analysis with normal kernels and unequal bandwidths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was performed. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the changes in VAS score with factor grouped CGI category was performed to estimate the mean differences and their 95% confidence intervals.

The best separation between women rating themselves "improved" and those rating themselves "minimally improved" was -27.6 mm on the VAS.

The standard deviation of the VAS scores at baseline was 17.3 mm (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>), yielding a distribution-based MCID of -8.6 mm when considering that a reduction in VAS score implies an improvement in EAPP.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The VAS is among the most widely used pain scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and has been used in many conditions, including acute and chronic pain of various origins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The validity and reliability of the VAS using anchor points of 0 mm (absence of pain) and 100 mm (unbearable pain) have been demonstrated for different pain indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and values for the MCID have been established for different types of pain; for example, in acute abdominal pain, the MCID is reported as 13 mm (95% CI, 10-17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], while MCID values appear generally to be lower for chronic pain compared to acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>The VAS was also commonly used in recent studies specifically designed to evaluate the pain associated with endometriosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, an empirical evaluation of an MCID for this indication has been lacking. The aim of this analysis was to derive an empirically validated MCID for EAPP and compare it to the MCID reported for other pain indications. We observed an MCID of approximately 10 mm for the change in EAPP measured by VAS, irrespective of whether an anchor-based or a distribution-based approach was used and irrespective of whether a one-sided or a bidirectional approach was used.</p><p>A relatively large proportion of women in the two studies reported that they were at least somewhat satisfied with their treatment, although both studies used placebo as a control group. This observation can be explained by the relatively large placebo effect, which is in line with other well-designed studies in this indication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Our empirical results for an MCID for EAPP measured on a VAS are comparable to the results for pain measured by VAS in other settings, e.g., pain self-assessment by patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or physician-assigned pain scores across different types of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. They are also in line with non-inferiority margins recently used in different chronic pain conditions, including chronic low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and ankylosing spondylitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>The limitations of our study were that we used only one anchor and we measured the anchor only at the end of the study. Hence the intra-subject variability of the anchor-based MCID could not be determined. Additional studies will be required to confirm that the results of our analyses are generalizable to other patient populations and other forms of endometriosis-associated pain.</p><p>The MCID of 10 mm for EAPP measured on a VAS could also be used to define a non-inferiority margin for the head-to-head comparison of two active treatments in a non-inferiority trial. In this case, the statistical requirement that the non-inferiority margin is limited by the effectiveness of the reference treatment with respect to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] has to be considered. For a meaningful result, the non-inferiority margin must be smaller than the difference between the reference active treatment and placebo.</p><p>In conclusion, the empirically validated MCID for EAPP measured on a VAS is 10 mm. This MCID could also be used to define a non-inferiority margin for a head-to-head comparison of two active treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All the authors except US are full-time employees of Bayer Schering Pharma AG.
