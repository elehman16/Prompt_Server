We hypothesized that it would be prudent to also consider an objectively assuring very rapid, on-treatment, virologic response to therapy at week 2 (vRVR) before taking the decision of shortening the treatment duration. So we planned this study to test whether a dual sofosbuvir/daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) treatment duration tailored according to achieving vRVR to 8 or 12&#x000a0;weeks is non-inferior to the recommended fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks course in non-cirrhotic Egyptian chronic HCV genotype-4 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted in an outpatient setting according to a prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative, non-inferiority study design. A hundred twenty eligible, non-cirrhotic, chronic HCV patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive daily doses in the form of one Gratisovir 400&#x000a0;mg table (generic sofosbuvir produced by Pharco Pharmaceuticals, Alexandria, Egypt) plus one Daktavira 60&#x000a0;mg tablet (generic daclatasvir produced by Dawood Pharm, Egypt) for either a fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks duration (reference group) or a response tailored duration (test group). In the test group the treatment duration was tailored according to the virus load tested by real time PCR into 8&#x000a0;weeks for patients who had undetectable HCV RNA level in their serum by the end of the second week of treatment (vRVR)), or 12&#x000a0;weeks for those who did not show vRVR. The primary outcome of the trial was the proportions of patients achieving SVR12 (HCV RNA below lower level of quantification at week 12 after end of treatment). The comparison between groups was based on testing the null hypothesis of inferiority of the response-tailored group with a pre-specified margin of non-inferiority (NI<sub>-m</sub>) of 0.1 (10%).</p><p>The protocol was registered with a WHO Clinical Trial Registration ID: ACTRN12617000263392. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372041" id="ir0005">https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=372041</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Starting from Jun, 5 2016, a hundred twenty eligible patients from 4 outpatient clinics in Alexandria, Egypt were randomized to either a fixed duration group (reference group: n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;60 patients) or a response tailored duration group (test group: n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;60 patients). During the whole period of the study, only 1 patient dropped-out from each group. Both were lost to follow-up after the 4th week's visit. Baseline characteristics in both groups were almost matching. Fifty eight out of the total 60 intention-to-treat (ITT) patients in the reference group achieved SVR12 (96.67% (95% confidence interval (CI): 88.64&#x02013;99%). Whereas, 59 out of the total 60 (ITT) patients in the test group achieved SVR12 (98.33% (CI: 91.14&#x02013;99.71%). The per-protocol (PP) analysis, excluding patients who dropped-out before collecting their final result, showed that 58/59 (98.31% (CI: 91&#x02013;99.7%)) of patients in the reference group and 59/59 (100% (CI: 93.89&#x02013;100%) of the test group achieved SVR12. Non-inferiority was declared since the upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for the difference in proportions of SVR12 between groups (P<sub>(reference)</sub>&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;P<sub>(test)</sub>) did not exceed the specified non-inferiority margin of +&#x000a0;0.1 (10%), both in ITT population (&#x02212;&#x000a0;1.67%, CI: &#x02212;&#x000a0;9.8%&#x02013;+5.9%), and in the PP population (&#x02212;&#x000a0;1.69%, CI: &#x02212;&#x000a0;9%&#x02013;+&#x000a0;4.58%). No fatalities or serious adverse events were reported during the period of the study. Similar rates of non-serious adverse events were reported in both groups with a trend of higher incidence rate in the fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks group; all were mild in severity.</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p>Shortening the duration of therapy based on observed vRVR could provide a prudent basis to avoid unnecessary long treatment courses. This could not only reduce the drug exposure and the risk of adverse drug reactions, but also cut the cost of full treatment course with such expensive medications by one third.

The significant existence of Resistance Associated Substitutions (RASs) is an example of an unpredictable virus related factor that can affect the response rate and it is still not routinely tested for on a wide scale (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Di Maio et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We had suggested in a previous study report (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Yakoot et al., 2016</xref>), that the speed of virus response during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of therapy could be regarded as an efficacy marker with a high positive predictability for sustained virologic response. It combines the measured displacement (reduction) of the virus load divided by the time which is another independent factor for response (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Pineda et al., 2017</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Sulkowski et al., 2016</xref>); (Speed (v)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Displacement of virus load (d)/Time(t)).</p><p>The very rapid virologic response (vRVR), defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA level at week 2 of therapy, was found, in our study to be a good positive predictor for SVR12 to dual therapy with sofosbuvir and ribavirin in patients with chronic HCV genotype-4. It had a high positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (95% CI, 90.8&#x02013;100%) and a high sensitivity of 82.6% (CI, 68.6&#x02013;92.2%) but with low negative predictive value (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Yakoot et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We suggested that achieving a vRVR could be used as a prudent objective qualifier to shorten duration of therapy. It objectively demonstrates that the treatment has been working against at least insignificant drug resistance and maintained for a period of at least 6&#x000a0;weeks after reaching viral negativity in the serum. This, in our assumption, might be enough time for the complete eradication of the virus from all liver cells and other hidden potential reservoirs such as platelets and mononuclear cells in blood or RES (ex: spleen) that could probably be the potential initiators for relapse.</p><p>Our new suggestion of tailoring the duration of therapy according to achieving a vRVR can be regarded as a <bold>positive</bold> response guided therapy. This is totally different from the previously implemented <bold>negative</bold> response guided therapy, in the pre- directly acting antiviral drugs (DAAs) era. Because now with the lower failure rates (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;90% success rates), achieved with DAAs, the early viral response kinetics (i.e. time to viral negativity) became strong positive predictors for treatment success but weak negative predictors for treatment failure (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Maasoumy et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although sofosbuvir with daclatasvir (SOF/DCV) dual therapy is the most widely used treatment protocol for chronic hepatitis C in Egypt, the country with highest prevalence of infection and the greatest number of treated patients, published data about this combination is still scanty.</p><p>All non-cirrhotic patients are being treated with a fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks protocol according to the Egyptian and EASL guidelines.</p><p>We have observed during our real life practice that the success rate is very high reaching above 95% and the majority of patients respond very early during the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (vRVR) and remain with undetectable HCV RNA in serum till the end of the 12&#x000a0;weeks post-treatment follow up period (SVR12). Also, we have noticed in many incidents that non-cirrhotic patients, who for any reason, interrupted treatment at as early as 8&#x000a0;weeks did not relapse.</p><p>This observation has lead us to further study our above mentioned suggestion that the vRVR might be used as a prudent qualifier to shorten the duration of therapy in this setting to 8&#x000a0;weeks as it allows a period of at least 6&#x000a0;weeks on observably working treatment after reaching undetectable HCV RNA level in serum. We planned this research to study whether the proportion of SVR12 in the response tailored duration (test group) is non-inferior to that in the recommended fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks duration (reference group). So we tested the null hypothesis of inferiority of a protocol tailored according to vRVR of 8/12&#x000a0;weeks versus the recommended fixed 12&#x000a0;weeks course of dual SOF/DCV treatment in non-cirrhotic Egyptian chronic HCV genotype-4 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The study was conducted in an outpatient setting according to a prospective, randomized, open-label, comparative, non-inferiority study design.</p><p>Male or female patients, between 18 and 70&#x000a0;years old who had a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis C and serum HCV RNA level above 10,000&#x000a0;IU/ml were screened for inclusion.

Because all investigators belong to the same medical school that values the role of psychological and spiritual support as factors affecting the immune system; all patients in both groups were treated the same with full psychological and spiritual support throughout the study visits with assurance, explanation and positive suggestions. In addition to this, perceiving the result of treatment with negative or very marked drop in the virus load as early as only 2&#x000a0;weeks of therapy, in our experience, may have a positive impact on our patients' spirits, immune responses, compliance and final results.</p><p>Our results agree with the strategy of shortening the duration of dual NS5B/NS5A combined therapy to 8&#x000a0;weeks, but based on an on-treatment response predictor rather than a baseline variable. This supports the findings of many other studies for the validity of early on-treatment response kinetics as a powerful positive predictor for the sustained virologic response to different combinations of DAAs therapy (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Sulkowski et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Maasoumy et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">D'Offizi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To our mind this patient-centered approach is more prudent as it objectively consider an assuring response to therapy before taking the decision.</p><p>Shortening the duration of therapy based on witnessed very rapid virologic response could provide a prudent basis to avoid unnecessary long treatment courses. This could not only reduce the drug exposure and the risk of adverse drug reactions, but also cut the cost of full treatment course with such expensive medications by one third.</p><p>We acknowledge the limitation of a small sample size based on rather a large non-inferiority margin of 0.1. With this margin we tolerated 10% lower SVR12 rate to gain almost over 30% reductions in the cost and the exposure to the drugs in addition to economize our overall budget of the study which is an important research concern in our community.</p><p>We encourage investigators to replicate this study model with larger sample size and smaller non-inferiority margins in a way for establishing more personalized therapy that consider the variability of response at a patient level rather than the mean or other points of estimate at a population level.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><title>Role of the Funding Source</title><p><funding-source id="gts0005">Abbass Helmy Charity</funding-source> and <funding-source id="gts0010">Pharco</funding-source> shared in funding the study, they contributed to study design, participated in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data, and in preparation and approval of this report.
