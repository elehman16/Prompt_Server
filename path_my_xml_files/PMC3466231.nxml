It is estimated to afflict 200 million women worldwide and reported a total of 700,000 vertebral fractures in USA each year <xref rid="pone.0046323-Iqbal1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) constitute a major health care problem worldwide, not only because of their high incidence but also due to their negative consequences on the patient's health-related quality of life and the high costs to the health care system <xref rid="pone.0046323-Cook1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Felsenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Lindsay1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Vertebral compression fractures can result in chronic back pain, kyphotic deformity and disability. The conventional treatments include medications, bed rest and bracing. But they are only partially effective for people suffering from osteoporotic VCFs. Previous studies have found that conservative treatments of symptomatic VCFs often fail to improve pain and mobility particularly in cases of chronic pain related to kyphotic deformity <xref rid="pone.0046323-Hallberg1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Therefore, VCFs were gradualy treated with minimally invasive approaches such as percutaneous vertebroplasty (VP) or percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (BK) in the past two decades <xref rid="pone.0046323-Wardlaw1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>VP was first described in 1987 by Galibert et al <xref rid="pone.0046323-Galibert1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. VP involves the percutaneous injection of bone cement, such as polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), directly into the cancellous bone of a vertebral body. This technique of VP was successfully used by Galibert to treat seven patients who had painful vertebral angiomas. Since then, the use of vertebroplasty has become popular for alleviating pain associated with a vertebral compression fracture and preventing the further loss of vertebral height or the progression of a kyphotic deformity <xref rid="pone.0046323-Movrin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, This technique has some shortcomings including complication of cement extravasation and failure to correct the kyphotic deformity caused by vertebral compression fractures <xref rid="pone.0046323-Yan1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In some cases, cement leakage into the epidural can result in paralysis due to spinal cord compression <xref rid="pone.0046323-Hulme1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>BK was introduced in 1998 as an improvement of VP <xref rid="pone.0046323-Garfin1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. BK was introduced by Kyphon to describe balloon-assisted vertebroplasty. In comparison with VP, a deflated balloon is inserted into the vertebral body through the pedicle and inflated to restore the height of a collapsed vertebral body and create a cavity inside. The balloon is then deflated and withdrawn. After removal of the balloons, PMMA is injected into the cavity at a proper velocity. Theoretically, the cavity made by the balloon allow the cement to be injected under low manual pressure and minimize the cement leakage <xref rid="pone.0046323-Movrin1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Weisskopf1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A unipedicular approach is often sufficient in vertebroplasty, kyphoplasty is often performed bipedicularly <xref rid="pone.0046323-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. BK is a minimally invasive procedure aiming to palliate back pain, stabilize the fracture, restore lost vertebral body height and correct kyphotic deformity <xref rid="pone.0046323-Voggenreiter1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Although VP and BK compared with conservative treatments have shown obvious therapeutic effects on osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures, especially in relieving back pain. There are still some concerns about the safty and impact on adjacent segment resulting from VP and BK procedures <xref rid="pone.0046323-Baroud1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Mudano1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since the inception of these procedures, many previous literatures evaluated the impact on the adjacent segment vertebral after the two procedures. However, there is not a published literature which evaluates the degeneration of adajecent disc after VP and BK procedures in the treatment of VCFs until now. The purpose of this study was to investigate the incidence of adjacent disc degeneration after the two procedures in the early stage and to determine whether the two procedures can accelerate the adjacent disc degeneration above the treated vertebral.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>We have received the agreements of all patients.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We have obtained the approval from ethics committee of our hospital.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We did not conduct our research outside of our country of residence.</p></list-item><list-item><p>All patients have provided their written informed consent to participate in this study.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The ethics committees of our hospital have approved this consent procedure.</p></list-item></list><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>A prospective study was conducted in this paper.

VP procedures were performed under general anesthesia using an 11 gauge trochar needle to cannulate the pedicle with the guidance of fluoroscopy. Needles were advanced to the anterior first third of the vertebral body under C-arm fluoroscopic aid. The liquid polymermethylmethacrylate (PMMA) was mixed with the powder to a dough-like texture. Under image control, the bone cement was injected alternatively through the left or right needles by using 1.5-ml syringes. 9 patients were all completed by uni-pedicular approach. Mean volume of 2.2 mLs (range 1.5&#x02013;3 mLs) cement was injected into the fractured vertebral body.</p><p>BK technique was used in 53 patients. BK were also performed under general anesthesia. Patients were placed in a prone position. A 0.5 cm skin incision positioned approximately 1&#x02013;2 cm lateral to the appropriate pedicle was made around the fractured vertebral pedicle under C-arm fluoroscopic guidance. Two 11 gage trochar needles were inserted into the pedicle percutaneously. Two 1.5 mm diameter guide pins were inserted through the trochar needles, and then two inflatable bone tamps were inserted into the fractured vertebral bodies. The balloons were dilated simultaneously under C-arm fluoroscopic monitoring. Ballooning pressures did not exceed 200 psi, and a balloon cavity was made in the vertebral body with 3&#x02013;4 mLs cavity.

But MRI scan were performed only at the first and last visits in order to save costs. The visits at the 3 months and 1 year postoperatively were not considered in this analysis.</p><p>Radiological criteria were used to define degneration of the adjacent disc. The degree of lumbar disc degeneration was categorized into five grades by one blinded spine surgeon according to the grading system proposed by Pfirrmann et al <xref rid="pone.0046323-Pfirrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046323-t002">Table 2</xref>). This system evaluates intervertebral disc structure, distinction of the nucleus and anulus, signal intensity of the disc, and disc height on T2-weighted midsagittal images. The reliability of this grading system has been tested and was shown to achieve excellent agreement in some previous reports <xref rid="pone.0046323-Pfirrmann1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Keorochana1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. The adjacent disc was considered to be involved when, on standard lateral X-ray films, adjacent disc height reduction (DHR) amounts approximately 20%. This need to be interpreted as disc degeneration <xref rid="pone.0046323-Schulte1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Berlemann1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The grade of disc degeneration adjacent to the fractured vertebral body was confirmed by the evaluation of the bony oedema in the fat suppressed sequences (STIR) and T2-weighted image of the magnetic resonance imaging in the sagittal plane and the height of degenerative disc was measured on the X-ray films.

It provides quick pain relief and com- plications are infrequent and mostly minor <xref rid="pone.0046323-Watts1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Although VP and BK procedures have been shown to be efficacious and obvious for short-term pain relief, it is still controversial whether the two techniques have an impact on the adjacent segments of VCFs by augmentation with bone cement <xref rid="pone.0046323-Ananthakrishnan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Fribourg1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Villarraga1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Previous papers all paid close attention to the incidence of vertebral fracture adjacent to the treated vertebral. However, changes of the adjacent disc after VP and BK procedures has not been involved in previous papers. Our current study aims to assess the degeneration of adjacent disc above the treated vertebral body. We hypothesized VP and BK procedures accelerate the disc degeneration adjacent to the fractured vertebral body.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that disc degeneration is influenced by some factors such as, age, body weight and gender <xref rid="pone.0046323-Okuda1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Elfering1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0046323-Pfirrmann2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this paper, in order to increase the reliability of the conclusions, characteristics of patients were also evaluated between two groups. P values of statistical analysis of these factors between the two groups are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0046323-t001">Table 1</xref>. The results showed no significant differences between two groups about these factors. Furthermore, adjacent disc degeneration above the fractured vertebral should not be found on the MRI scan at the first visit. Accordingly, the comparability is reasonable between the two groups. As we all know, age is one of the most important factors of resulting in disc degeneration. For this reason, we only observe the early degeneration of adjacent disc after VP and BK procedures in order to reducing the impact on disc degeneration caused by age.</p><p>Our results show that the incidence of adjacent disc degeneration in surgical treatment group is higher than that in control group, and it presents statistically significant difference between the incidence of adjacent disc degeneration in two groups. These suggest VP and BK procedures obviously accelerate the disc degeneration adjacent to the treated vertebral. In addition, we find that a high incidence of disc degeneration occurres in the VP group more than BP group. As a small sample in VP group, we did not conduct statistical analysis between the two groups. Some reasons such as reducing the deformation of the augmented endplate, increasing the pressure in the adjacent intervertebral disc and changing in spinal loading due to cement augmentation are contributed to explain why a higher incidence of adjacent disc degeneration in treatment group. Paul et al. <xref rid="pone.0046323-Hulme2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> found the deformation of the augmented endplate which was significantly reduced following cement augmentation played an important role in minimizing peak impact loads and reducing strain on intervertebral disc annular fibers. Therefore, the strain on intervertebral disc annular fibers were increased accompany with the reduction of the deformation of the augmented endplate. Applying an axial compression load, Polikeit et al. <xref rid="pone.0046323-Polikeit1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> predicted a pressure increase of 16% above the treated level and 13% below the treated level. Baroud et al. <xref rid="pone.0046323-Baroud1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> developed a finite-element model to examine cement augmentation on the loading in adjacent vertebral and confirmed the pressure in the adjacent intervertebral disc accordingly increased by approximately 19% and the inward bulge of the endplate adjacent to the one augmented increased considerably, by approximately 17%. Furthermore, Rohlmann et al. <xref rid="pone.0046323-Rohlmann1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> found if no compensation of upper body shift was assumed, the force in the erector spine increased by about 200% for the vertebroplasty but by only 55% for the kyphoplasty compared to the intact spine. Intradiscal pressure increased by about 60% and 20% for the vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. Rigid cement fixation could theoretically lead to degenerative changes in adjacent segment, and the augmented vertebral is likely much stiffer than the adjacent vertebral <xref rid="pone.0046323-Pflugmacher1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>Pain evaluated by VAS score and physical impairment measured by ODI decreased sig- nificantly postoperatively in surgical treatment group. Comparing to control group, VAS score and ODI had mild changes between different follow-up visits. However, statistically significant difference of VAS score and ODI were not found between the first evaluation postoperatively and the final follow-up in the surgical treatment group (P&#x0003e;0.05). This indicates that even if there is a higher incidence of adjacent disc degeneration in the treatment group, but the clinical outcomes have not been weakened because of adjacent disc degeneration.</p><p>Some limitations are to be presented in this study. We have a nonrandomized comparative design, and all patients were selected under controlled conditions for a purpose. An unequal number of subjects was classified in two groups and small size of patients was studied, these may lead to biased results. Furthermore, the follow-up period of observing adjacent disc degeneration was relatively short and the adjacent disc degeneration occurred after the follow-up time may be missed.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the present study, it suggestes that procedures of VP and BK can accelerate the adjacent disc degeneration above the treated vertebral body. But in the early stage, height reduction of degenerative disc adjacent to the treated vertebral body may not be obvious. Furthermore, clinical outcomes has not been weakened even in the presence of accelerated adjacent disc degeneration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Thanks Dr Huilin Yang, Juehua Jing, Hong Zhao and Li Ni for helping the author during the follow-up.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0046323-Kanis1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
