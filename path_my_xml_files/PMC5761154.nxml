For decades, hyperbaric oxygen has been employed in efforts to prevent those cases of osteoradionecrosis that are precipitated by dental extractions or implant placement. The evidence for using hyperbaric oxygen remains poor and current clinical practice varies greatly. We describe a protocol for a clinical trial to assess the benefit of hyperbaric oxygen in the prevention of osteoradionecrosis during surgery on the irradiated mandible.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">The HOPON trial is a phase III, randomised controlled, multi-centre trial. It employs an unblinded trial design, but the assessment of the primary endpoint, i.e. the diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis, is assessed on anonymised clinical photographs and radiographs by a blinded expert panel. Eligibility is through the need for a high-risk dental procedure in the mandible where at least 50-Gy radiotherapy has been received. Patients are randomised 1:1 to hyperbaric oxygen arm (Marx protocol) : control arm, but both groups receive antibiotics and chlorhexidine mouthwash. The primary endpoint is the presence of osteoradionecrosis at 6&#x000a0;months following surgery, but secondary endpoints include other time points, acute symptoms and pain, quality of life, and where implants are placed, their successful retention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The protocol presented has evolved through feasibility stages and through analysis of interim data. The classification of osteoradionecrosis has undergone technical refinement to ensure that robust definitions are employed. The HOPON trial is the only multi-centre RCT conducted in this clinical setting despite decades of use of hyperbaric oxygen for the prevention of osteoradionecrosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">European Clinical Trials Database, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=HOPON">EudraCT200700622527</ext-link>.

An important precipitating factor for mandibular ORN is surgical trauma, commonly dental extractions or implant placement following head and neck radiotherapy, but ORN can also occur spontaneously. ORN is painful and debilitating, often requiring surgical resection of the jaw and complex multidisciplinary management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The morbidity and mortality of ORN is significant and treatment outcomes often unsatisfactory. Post-radiation extractions should, self-evidently, be performed atraumatically and antibiotics are commonly prescribed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but there is a paucity of high-quality evidence to guide best practice in the prevention of ORN.</p><p id="Par22">Preventive approaches include pre-radiotherapy extraction of teeth and the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) treatments or prophylactic antibiotics for post-radiotherapy extractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The overall incidence of ORN among post-radiotherapy patients is not certain but may have declined with improvement of radiotherapy techniques including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) over recent decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the incidence of head and neck cancer, the proportion of cases receiving radiotherapy, and prognosis are all increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], contributing to an expansion in the &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; population where ORN prevention must be addressed. The risk of ORN with dental extractions is higher in the posterior mandible, with radiotherapy doses higher than 60&#x000a0;Gy (or with brachytherapy) and in smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">There have only been limited trials of prophylactic HBO. The single-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) by Marx et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] showed a significantly lower incidence of ORN after post-radiotherapy dental extractions in the HBO group when compared with the control group. There were two cases of ORN in 37 patients (5.4%) receiving HBO undergoing 156 extractions, compared with 11 cases in 37 patients (29.9%) undergoing 135 extractions receiving prophylactic penicillin, resulting in a number needed to treat (NNT) of 4. In a non-randomised retrospective study, Vudiniabola et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] showed that of 29 patients who received pre-extraction HBO, 1 (3.4%) developed ORN; and of 7 patients who did not receive HBO, 1 (14.3%) developed ORN. Despite improvements in radiotherapy since the time of these studies, and evidence of a decreasing incidence of ORN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], prophylactic HBO to prevent ORN has remained a standard of care for high-risk dental extractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">HBO is not available to all patients as it requires proximity to a chamber, it is costly (approximately &#x000a3;4000&#x02013;6000 per course) and sometime logistically problematic, requiring multiple daily visits. A typical protocol for prevention dictates 45&#x000a0;h of treatment over 30 compressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There are also risks associated with HBO therapy. A comprehensive recent safety review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] noted common temporary visual problems, Eustachian tube problems 2%, claustrophobia 2% and seizure&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01.</p><p id="Par25">A survey of UK practice revealed that, in a high-risk extraction of a lower mandibular molar, 33% &#x02018;never&#x02019;, 41% &#x02018;sometimes&#x02019; and 26% &#x02018;usually&#x02019; or &#x02018;always&#x02019; prescribe prophylactic HBO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Questionnaires of attitude to RCTs for HBO revealed that 93% of responders would wish to recruit such patients into multi-centre RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Additionally, there is a lack of agreement on HBO protocol, with some UK patients referred for treatment in centres using non-standard pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], lower than the typical 2.4 atmospheres (ATA) recommended in most ORN publications. Current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of ORN recommend the use of HBO only as part of a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">An additional question regarding the efficacy of HBO surrounds the placement of osseointegrated implants into the irradiated mandible, with the aim of preventing ORN or optimising bony healing and implant retention. Survey data again suggest wide disparity in practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] in the UK. No RCT has been carried out in this setting, and there are conflicting data from retrospective case control series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] as to whether HBO may enhance survival of implants in irradiated bone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par27">The objective of the HOPON trial is to determine the benefit of HBO in the prevention of ORN subsequent to a surgical procedure in the &#x02018;at risk&#x02019; irradiated mandible. The procedures included are high-risk dental extractions and the placement of implants. Additional outcomes are to document the incidence of ORN in the control group, the outcomes where ORN is diagnosed, and the retention of implants. The trial will also measure the effect of HBO in post-operative pain and effects on quality of life.

This was required to resolve inconsistencies which arose in cases where very small areas of exposed bone were seen: &#x02018;minor bone spicules&#x02019; (MBS) were apparent, which occurred in 19% of patients in this initial analysis. In reporting cases with MBS, some trial investigators took a pragmatic position in judging MBS as clinically unimportant, likely gradually healing, and not reflecting progressive ORN. Others classified as Notani 1 ORN based on rigid definitions in common clinical use. When MBS was added as an additional distinct category to the classification (as&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x000a0;mm<sup>2</sup>) this ambiguity was resolved and agreement between observers was achieved. This refinement was adopted by the protocol after discussion with trial oversight committees and the relevant regulatory bodies. A working assumption was made, after consultation, to group MBS with the healed (&#x02018;not ORN&#x02019;) cases, but another outcome measure of the trial will be to test this assumption against the outcomes for later time points. For the purpose of the HOPON trial, radiological signs alone, or pain alone, are not considered ORN unless accompanied by a breach in overlying skin or mucosa.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Criteria for diagnosis of osteoradionecrosis (ORN) in the Hyperbaric Oxygen for the Prevention of Osteoradionecrosis (HOPON) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Feasibility data revealed a somewhat higher dropout rate after randomisation in the HBO arm because of the increased opportunity available in the time taken to schedule HBO. Furthermore, the clinical question to be answered is the effect of HBO, but only among those receiving surgery, and not the effect of HBO in itself. Demographic and clinical factors for the HBO and control groups will be presented both &#x02018;as randomised&#x02019; and also &#x02018;as receiving surgery&#x02019;.

The test will be two-sided and a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 will be declared statistically significant.

The trial has received a clinical trial authorisation by the MHRA under the Medicines For Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004&#x000a0;S.I. 2004/1031 (MHRA <bold>r</bold>eference: 04196/0010/001-0019).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par59">Several areas of controversy have arisen during the development of the HOPON protocol. The first of these is the need for blinding. Some comparable trials in other fields of late radiation toxicity have used a sham HBO arm with the aim of producing a double-blind trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The sham HBO arm used in such trials varies considerably. One approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] utilises a breathing mixture of 9% oxygen and 91% nitrogen so that at 2.4 ATA, arterial PaO<sub>2</sub> is similar to breathing 21% oxygen at ambient air pressure. This, however, still exposes patients to the documented risks of hyperbaric pressure, and is by some considered unethical because of the implied issues of safety without any chance of benefit. Another approach used 40% oxygen and 60% nitrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] providing an alternative lower &#x02018;dose&#x02019; of oxygen treatment and correlation of outcome rather than a true control arm. More recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] sham HBO arm using air at 1.1 ATA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] or 1.3 ATA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] have been used to provide a minimal increase in partial pressure of oxygen (PpO<sub>2</sub>) while providing the sensations of compression. Regardless of mode of delivery, the provision of sham HBO treatments are equivalent in cost to those delivered on the treatment arm which, given finite resources, may impact the cost-effectiveness of such research. Finally, it is also uncertain whether the HBO chamber staff could ever be effectively blinded as they remain in control of the chamber. It is, therefore, possible that patients become unblinded when treated for over 30 treatment sessions, particularly as these sham treatments are delivered at a regular and different daily session to the oxygen treatments.</p><p id="Par60">The need for a blinded trial using sham treatments is considered desirable in trials where the primary endpoint is subjective or employ patient-reported outcome measures. In the HOPON trial the primary outcome is the presence of ORN, which is considered more objective, and additionally can be assessed on clinical photographs and radiographs at a remote time and location, by a panel of investigators who <italic>are</italic> blinded to the treatment arm received. However, the unblinded trial design for HOPON does introduce the possibility of reporting bias in some of the more subjective secondary outcomes such as quality of life or pain. Further, the unblinded design of the trial and need for extra treatments in the HBO arm introduces an inequality in time between randomisation and surgery for that arm. This potential methodological concern means that the time points commence at the time of surgery, rather than the date of randomisation, where it might be argued that only at randomisation are the two groups truly comparable.</p><p id="Par61">Another difficulty that has arisen during the feasibility stage of the trial is the difficulty in robust allocation of some early stages of ORN. These have subsequently been classified as minor bone spicules (MBS), but are not reflected within any of the classifications of ORN currently in use. This difficulty is presumably not unique to the HOPON trial, yet it is difficult to ascertain from other similar studies how such cases have been dealt with. This is a problem created by taking a working &#x02018;textbook definition&#x02019; of a clinical condition and extrapolating it as a primary outcome measure in a clinical trial. Because of the frequent (19%) finding of MBS during a blinded interim data review, it was logical to introduce an additional class to reflect this, the justification for which has been separately published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. To establish if any of the MBS cases in the HOPON trial will progress to clinically significant ORN, there is a secondary outcome measure of outcome of such patients at the conclusion of the trial. As a means to avoid any ambiguity, therefore, the use of the Notani classification with the additional category of MBS has been employed in order to avoid subjectivity and to enhance reliability and consistency of reporting.</p><p id="Par62">Further concerns were around how to deal with missing data, dropouts and the effect of differing complexity and length of treatment between the two arms. While ITT analysis is usual practice for the primary analysis in superiority trials, in this trial &#x02018;analysing as randomised&#x02019; would not answer the clinical question which relates to a fixed time following surgery, in other words the intended primary analysis is essentially on a per-protocol or treatment-received basis. While unusual, this is one of the circumstances in which, as Piantadosi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] has pointed out, too strict adherence to the ITT principle is unhelpful or inappropriate.</p><p id="Par63">The HOPON trial design has, therefore, evolved through analysis of feasibility data and through blinded interim data analysis. This is the only formally conducted, multi-centre, RCT conducted in this field that the authors are aware of, and it is the first since Marx&#x02019;s single-centre study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] published over three decades ago. The trial will provide data on the incidence of ORN after dental extraction and implant placement as well as the effect of HBO on retention of implants. Importantly, HOPON will provide translational resource for future studies of the genomic determinants of ORN in a group of patients treated to a defined protocol.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par64">Feasibility and interim analysis complete.
