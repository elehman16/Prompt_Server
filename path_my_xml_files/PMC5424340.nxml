The prevalence of CKD stages 1 to 4 has increased dramatically from 10% in 1988&#x02013;1994 to 13% in 1999&#x02013;2004 in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and 12.5% (representing 3 million adults) from 2007 to 2009 in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These higher rates of chronic disease may also lead to adverse outcomes and end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Globally, approximately 190,000 patients regularly received peritoneal dialysis (PD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] which is usually performed at home daily by the patient after receiving education and training by a dialysis health care professional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PD has been associated with a survival advantage, especially in the first few years of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; is the least costly of all the forms of dialysis (e.g. in Canada it has been recently estimated that maintaining a patient on PD compared to hemodialysis saves the healthcare system over $150,000 over a three year period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]; and higher levels of satisfaction with care than patients receiving hemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; and higher health-related quality of life (HrQOL) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of treatment for CKD, care is complex and requires significant personal involvement to integrate medication adherence, lifestyle modification and nutritional adaptation into a daily routine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. CKD patients are often not satisfied with their communication with their health care providers and are frequently unaware of their diagnosis or its implications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This may be due in part to the volume of CKD patients which have resulted in nephrologists seeing more patients in less time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Simultaneously, alternative methods of communication are being developed and embraced by a population with growing computer literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Emerging new technological solutions including the variety of applications and portals for health information are offering patients a better understanding of their diseases and evidence informed practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>One emerging technological solution is telehomecare, which refers to a model of care using information, communications, measurement and monitoring technologies to enable healthcare providers to link with patients at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Telehomecare has been associated with reduced risk of disease and other health-related problems and improved recovery in other patient populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Specific examples include less symptoms and fewer hospitalizations for persons with heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], increased compliance rates and feedback in cardiac rehabilitation patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and improved quality of life indicators in the pediatric palliative care population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Further, telehomecare can reduce costs associated with improved coordination, continuity of care, and access to specialized care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Although promising signs are emerging with various technologically enabled virtual care solutions for a variety of chronic illnesses, few are being employed with CKD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given that PD is performed in a home setting, patients using this modality are ideal candidates for support and monitoring using telehomecare services. Successful implementation of telehomecare is a complex, multi-factorial endeavor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Although there is growing support for more process evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], much less attention is being paid to the mechanisms for delivering interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the future scalability of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In this context, this paper provides the protocol for a realist evaluation that aims to understand how a telehomecare application aimed at enhancing CKD patients&#x02019; outcomes and experiences is implemented in practice, and to assess the usability, acceptability and scalability of this virtual care application. Realist evaluations are used to identify which components of the intervention are most effective and under what conditions with a focus on the contextual influences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A realist evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] using an embedded case study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] will be used to understand the usability, acceptability and scalability of a telehomecare application for patients with CKD undergoing PD. Through this type of design, researchers are able to understand how and why the implementation succeeds or fails. A realist evaluation 1) provides an explanation for why study outcomes occur; 2) involves multi-methods involving quantitative and qualitative approaches; and 3) uses a theory-driven approach that guides the study design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>This realist evaluation will be guided by the RE-AIM Conceptual Framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and the Institute of Healthcare Improvement (IHI)&#x02019;s Triple Aim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and Framework for Going to Full Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. These were selected by the research team to provide an evidence-informed, comprehensive, and contemporary framework to guide the study. Key concepts of the RE-AIM framework that underpin scalability include reach, effectiveness, and adoption (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). IHI&#x02019;s Triple Aim focuses on the extent to which health care innovations result in 1) improved population health, 2) enhanced patient experience, and 3) reduced health care costs, synergistic with the RE-AIM model&#x02019;s effectiveness domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The phases of the IHI framework include 1) set-up, 2) develop the scalable unit, 3) test of scale-up, and 4) go to full scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Key elements include adoption mechanisms (i.e., leadership engagement, communication methods, leveraging social networks, and building a culture of urgency and persistence); support systems needed to achieve large-scale programming (i.e., a learning system that connects adopters and experts, a data system to support measurement for improvement, infrastructure such as IT, equipment, etc.), building capability through training and support, and building reliable processes that support sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>RE-AIM Framework</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>RE-AIM Framework Dimension</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reach</td><td>Our scalability assessment will pay close attention to the &#x0201c;reach&#x0201d; of the telehomecare initiatives, which has important implications for their potential implementation across the province.</td></tr><tr><td>Effectiveness</td><td>We will explore perceptions and experiences associated with their participation in the demonstration initiative guided by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement&#x02019;s (IHI) Triple Aim of 1) improving population health, 2) enhancing patient experience, and 3) reducing health system costs.</td></tr><tr><td>Adoption</td><td>Our process evaluation will explore the extent to which health care practitioners and other key stakeholders agree to deliver the intervention as intended.</td></tr><tr><td>Implementation</td><td>Our process evaluation will focus explicitly on how and why the telehomecare initiatives are implemented in particular ways across different contexts.</td></tr><tr><td>Maintenance</td><td>Our scalability assessment includes the assessment of whether key stakeholders would continue delivering the telehomecare initiatives outside the scope of the research study over time.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>For this study, we hypothesize that successful adoption and scalability of the intervention will be influenced by a series of mechanisms including leadership engagement and culture, communication methods, social network, and reliable processes; structures including a learning system that includes training and support and infrastructure that connects adopters and experts, a data system to support measurement for improvement; that result in positive patient related outcomes and experiences.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention description</title><p>The CONNECT Trial Research Program was established to further investigate a telehomecare monitoring software (eQ Connect&#x02122; system, developed by eQOL Inc.) intended for use by patients on PD. The software provides support for patients undergoing PD through enabling communication between patients and the healthcare team, providing up-to-date patient health information, and ensuring patient compliance with PD regimens, and is intended to ultimately reduce barriers for PD uptake. The patient-facing part of eQ Connect&#x02122; (Patient Portal) is built to run on a mobile tablet, allowing for mobility, uncomplicated data recording, and ease of uploading data securely over the Internet. Information such as treatment progress, health status, supply usage, etc. is transferred to a secure data center when an Internet connection is available and the information is accessible to the patient&#x02019;s health care team from this center. The clinician-facing part of eQ Connect&#x02122; (Support Portal) is built on web technologies. See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Clinicians are able to gain access to the information entered by the patient through the application after securely logging in from any Internet web browser. This reduces the need to install additional software thereby utilizing existing computer infrastructure within hospitals and clinics.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>eQConnect Support Portal</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12882_2017_557_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>The realist evaluation that is further described in this paper is part of a larger evaluation of the eQ Connect&#x02122; intervention that includes a randomized, parallel-arm control trial (RCT) aimed at determining if utilizing eQ Connect improves selected clinical outcomes for PD patients (CONNECT Trial). The trial expects to enroll 500 APD/CAPD patients (250 intervention, 250 control) from across Canada.</p><p>One-year data was obtained from PD patients at London Health Sciences Centre to generate the baseline estimates of rates of technique failure, infections and hospitalizations. To determine the average rate of the outcome, we calculated the proportion of patients having at least one event, and cumulative incidence of the first and all events. The rate per 1-person time year can be calculated as a crude total, a crude average or from the regression model for count data. This resulted in rates ranging from 0.8766 to 3.4. Four different sample sizes equations were used to calculate the desired sample size based on our proposed analytic plan, which includes: proportions (generally considered conservative), based on the Cox PH/Poisson regression, inflating the Cox regression for correlation within patients and based on Lachin's formula (allowing for time and incompletely follow up). All sample size equations were calculated using a 5% two-sided level of significance, 80% power and assuming a 1&#x000a0;year follow up. Based on the baseline estimates, we allowed parameter values to vary as follows: baseline rate per patient-year from 0.8 to 3.4 and relative risk reduction of 0.2 to 0.35 (by 0.05). Given the funding sources and availability of patients, we can realistically enroll approximately 500 patients. Using the Lachin formula, we are adequately powered to detect a 0.25 or higher relative risk reduction for baseline rates of 2.0 or higher. This is based on a sample size equation that allows for rates with variable follow up time per patient.</p><p>Recruitment will occur continuously over a 2&#x000a0;year period to meet the target participant population.

This analysis will also yield a series of iteratively refined statements of the relationships between 1) key contextual factors, 2) the mechanisms by which they effect the implementation of the virtual care interventions, and 3) the impact on the outcomes of the intervention themselves referred to as &#x0201c;Context-Mechanism-Outcome Configurations&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These statements will then be used to revise the framework to more accurately reflect the key contextual influences and practices that constitute the implementation process of virtual applications (in this context telehomecare) to be used to &#x0201c;scale-up&#x0201d; the intervention across health care settings in Ontario.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are limitations inherent in our design including the generalizability of the quantitative data and the transferability of the qualitative data to other types of healthcare organizations due to study being conducted at two hospitals at a single site large acute care teaching hospital. There are also selection biases that are inherent in study participants volunteering to participate.</p><p>With our methodological approach, we aim to enrich the evolving field of virtual care applications (in our case telehomecare intervention) and implementation science. Our approach includes multiple sources of data aimed at elucidating the interpretations and actions of a diverse group of stakeholders triangulated with patient outcomes and experience measures. This includes gaining insights into how patients respond to the idea of the telehomecare interventions (whether certain populations were interested or not) and how they react to the interventions themselves (whether they viewed the experience positively). Our prospective realist evaluation study design approach will also capture the utility, benefits, and unintended consequences and our scalability assessment will inform future efforts to how best to &#x02018;scale up&#x02019; virtual care applications. Collectively, this study has the potential to contribute to accelerating knowledge by producing a comprehensive dataset on how remote telemonitoring can improve health care outcomes of peritoneal dialysis patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study design will provide insight into how a telehomecare application aimed at enhancing CKD patients undergoing PD outcomes and experiences is implemented in practice, and the usability, acceptability and scalability of this virtual care application. In addition to examining patient outcomes and experiences, we will elucidate which components of the intervention are most effective and under what conditions with a focus on the contextual influences. Collectively, our multi-method design will yield knowledge around how best to implement, sustain and spread the telehomecare application that will be useful to guide the development, implementation and evaluation of future virtual care applications aimed at improving the quality of care outcomes and experiences of patients.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study status</title><p>The study is actively recruiting participants from one of the two sites.
