The magnitude of this health problem has been widely studied and has been cited as the primary preventable cause of mortality and morbidity in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The available data indicate that the life expectancy of habitual smokers is reduced by 15-20 years and approximately half will die as a consequence of their habit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Taking this into account, it is surprising that the detrimental health effects of smoking have so little social impact and that smoking continues to be highly prevalent in our context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The health benefits of smoking cessation are well established. With few exceptions, future risk is reduced when smokers stop smoking and continue to decrease while smoking abstinence is maintained. Progression of smoking-related diseases is also slowed and life expectancy improves by an average of 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. For these reasons, anti-smoking efforts in all contexts provide one of the major central points around which many disease prevention strategies revolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Treatment of the effects of smoking is an important part of clinical practice and all health professionals need to offer help and support to all smokers as part of usual clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current guidelines base their recommendations on the &#x0201c;The 5As approach&#x0201d; (ask about tobacco use, advise to quit, assess willingness to make a quit attempt, assist in quit attempt, and arrange follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. According to this model, the health professional who knows the smoker&#x02019;s motivation can choose the strategy that has shown the greatest effectiveness in each situation. Nonetheless, cigarette smoking is a highly addictive habit that is difficult to give up, and achieving the motivation to quit smoking is always a challenge. The available data suggest that the majority of smokers are interested in quitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and that structured counseling by health care professionals is a motivational element for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, the rate of successful quit attempts is low and does not usually exceed 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To increase the success rate and accelerate change in smoking habits, it has been suggested that instead of providing patients with general information about the detrimental heath effects of smoking, they should be provided with personalized data on their risk of acquiring a disease related to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Health concerns are among the reasons most often cited as catalysts for smokers to make an attempt to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and studies suggest that the more a patient is aware of risks and benefits, the greater is their motivation and likelihood of success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similar to what occurs in smokers who have experienced smoking-related complications, providing information about testing for smoking-related harm or risks to health offers a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; that may facilitate behavioral change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this respect, we can conceptually distinguish three different feedback methods, depending on the approach used to assess risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]: the first explores biomarkers of tobacco exposure, such as levels of urine cotinine or exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO); the second gives information about added risk of diseases related to a smoking habit, such as genetic susceptibility to lung cancer; and the third focuses on smoking-related harms such as the presence of arterial plaque detected by echography or decreased pulmonary function quantified by spirometry.</p><p>Spirometry is the recommended method of testing pulmonary function to detect restricted respiratory flow in smokers susceptible to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The use of spirometry has become generalized in primary care because it is a simple, noninvasive procedure that provides valuable information about pulmonary function and risk of premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] that can increase motivation to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Some years ago, the Lung Health Study showed that significantly more participants included in an intensive smoking cessation program quit smoking, compared to those included in the usual program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Nonetheless, the experts involved in the most recent report published by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of spirometry improved rates of smoking abstinence or affected the management of the initial stages of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, various clinical trials have explored the effect on smoking cessation of providing feedback on spirometry results. The first study, published by Segnan et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], included 923 smokers recruited by 44 primary care doctors in Italy. Participants were randomly assigned to 4 different intervention groups: (a) a brief individual intervention, (b) an intensive intervention with 4 follow-up sessions, (c) an intensive intervention and treatment with nicotine gum, and (d) an intensive intervention and spirometry. The proportion of exsmokers at 12-month follow-up was 4.8&#x000a0;%, 5.5&#x000a0;%, 7.5&#x000a0;%, and 6.5&#x000a0;%, respectively, with no significant differences between the groups (RR: 1.19; 95&#x000a0;%CI: 0.62-2.30). Later, Buffels et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] published a study that included 215 smokers attending 14 primary care centers in Belgium who were prescribed treatment with nicotine, bupropion, or both and were randomly assigned to receive only a minimal intervention or the intervention along with information about their spirometry results. After 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, a nonsignificant effect in favor of the spirometry intervention was observed (RR: 1.17; 95&#x000a0;%CI: 0.66-2.06). More recently, Parkes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] published a clinical trial that included 561 smokers recruited in 5 primary care centers in England. All participants were assessed using spirometry and then randomized to receive personalized information about the results obtained, summarized as &#x0201c;lung age&#x0201d; compared to chronological age (intervention group), or to receive a letter reporting the results (control group). After 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, the rates of punctual smoking abstinence were significantly higher in the intervention group (13.6&#x000a0;% vs 6.4&#x000a0;% in the control group, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) and these participants had higher probability of successful smoking cessation than those who did not receive personalized spirometry results (RR: 2.12; 95&#x000a0;%CI: 1.24-3.62). Nonetheless, the observed abstinence rate could have been influenced by the intensity of the intervention that was administered (longer period of contact in the intervention group due to verbal reinforcement); it has been shown that abstinence rates are directly proportional to the intensity of the strategy used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>In a Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews article, Bize et al evaluated those three studies and 12 other clinical trials that have used various biomarkers as a motivational strategy for successful smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Unfortunately, the designs of the studies included in the review were so heterogeneous that only two pairs of studies were sufficiently similar in methodology and intervention to allow a combined analysis. The authors also found no evidence of significant benefits from the use of eCO measurement or spirometry in primary care to improve success rates for smoking cessation efforts. Therefore, they conclude that, due to the lack of quality evidence, it is not possible to establish definitive recommendations about the effectiveness of most approaches used to evaluate biomedical risk assessment as a means of helping smokers quit smoking. They emphasize a need to improve the methodological quality of future studies. Their review included two active clinical trials with similar methodology, ESPIROTAB and ESPITAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], that use spirometry results as a motivational strategy to increase smoking cessation success rates beyond the levels obtained by usual counseling, as in the study by Parkes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Nonetheless, this type of study design has been criticized because, strictly speaking, it does not provide independent evidence of the effectiveness of using spirometry, compared to no spirometry; this would require a trial in which spirometry is not used in the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The use of spirometry as a motivational tool for smoking cessation continues to be a controversial topic. Some data indicating effectiveness are encouraging, but the scarcity of evidence limits the capacity to establish definitive recommendations about its use.</p><p>For all these reasons, further studies are essential, and must use high-quality methodology with a sufficiently large sample and long-term follow-up of at least 12&#x000a0;months to establish a final outcome of prolonged smoking abstinence, confirmed by a biochemical method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypothesis and objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>An intervention based on providing structured, standardized information about the results of spirometry as part of usual clinical practice to encourage patients to quit smoking will achieve improvement of 5&#x000a0;% or more in the rate of prolonged abstinence from smoking at 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up, compared to that obtained by providing only the usual brief counseling to patients who smoke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of providing structured information about the results of spirometry testing to increase the rate of prolonged abstinence from smoking at 12&#x000a0;months after an anti-smoking intervention in primary care patients who smoke but do not have a known respiratory disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Design</title><p>The general framework of the RESET study is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and the activities to be carried out at each visit are detailed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

First, the database was cleansed by detecting and labeling outlier, missing, and inappropriate values. Next we tested the effectiveness of the randomization by evaluating the comparability and homogeneity of the study groups to ensure similar distribution of the variables of interest at baseline. Finally, the proportion of participants lost to follow-up in each group was determined and tested for any association with the study intervention. All analysis was based on intention to treat, understood as having recorded relevant data on the primary variable at the participant&#x02019;s first visit. Worst-case analysis was applied to assess potential bias due to losses to follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], which considers that the desired outcome was obtained by all participants lost to follow-up who were in the control group and by none of those lost from the intervention group. Having made this assumption, we repeated the analysis and, to determine the variability associated with the losses to follow-up, compared the &#x0201c;worst-case&#x0201d; results and the results obtained when those lost to follow-up were not taken into account.</p><p>Descriptive analysis of quantitative and qualitative variables included frequencies, central tendencies (mean or, in the case of non-normal distribution, median) with standard deviation, and minimum and maximum values. Frequencies were compared using chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate, and means using Student t test for independent samples.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the smoking cessation intervention, rates of punctual and prolonged abstinence were assessed at 12&#x000a0;months post-intervention in both groups using the chi-square test. The results were presented as relative risk (RR), relative risk reduction (RRR) and absolute risk reduction (RAR) and number needed to treat (NNT) to achieve prolonged smoking abstinence in one smoker, expressed with their 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI). To study the behavior of both groups over time, log-rank tests were used to compare the cumulated abstinence curves over the 12-month follow-up. Finally, multivariate analysis using Cox regression was applied to study the factors associated with smoking cessation success at 12&#x000a0;months. Various models were formulated that included the variable of interest (the described interventions) and as control variables the factors shown to be most significant in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]: age, sex, social class, employment status, educational level, daily and cumulated tobacco use, degree of nicotine dependence, degree of motivation to quit smoking, and stage of change.</p><p>All analysis was done using SPSS version 19.0.

The first cluster is related to the population. Participants were volunteers recruited when they visited their primary care team for any reason; therefore, they might not be representative of the population of smokers in the primary care system. In addition, those who agreed to participate could be more motivated to quit smoking than the rest of the population of smokers. In any case, the proposed randomization should ensure comparability between study groups. As patients will be recruited by a health care professional with whom they have an existing relationship, participation is expected to be high, especially considering that no drug therapies or invasive or unpleasant tests are involved. Nonetheless, a certain percentage of losses to follow-up is to be expected because this is a long-term (12-month) project. To minimize this contingency, sustained effort by all participating researchers will be essential to motivating and encouraging patients.</p><p>With respect to limitations of the study design, the most obvious is that a double-blind study is impossible; both participants and investigators will necessarily be aware of the study group assignments. The proposed intervention may be less intensive than has been described in other studies, but reflects the usual attention received by smokers and therefore can be readily incorporated into the daily clinical practice of the investigators. The content and duration of the intervention have been standardized and participating doctors and nurses will receive specific training to ensure that similar messages, attitudes, and behaviors will be applied in interactions with both groups. In the spirometry intervention group, patient collaboration and technical considerations will be key to achieving quality results. To maximize quality, the testing will be standardized by the use of high-quality pneumotachography and by training of study personnel that results in official accreditation. In addition, to reduce variability in the interpretation of results, data analysis will be centralized.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Research ethics and confidentiality</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of IDIAP (Institut Universitari d&#x02019;Investigaci&#x000f3; en Atenci&#x000f3; Prim&#x000e0;ria) Jordi Gol (registration number 4R11/037) and peer-reviewed by the same experts organization.

However, not all smokers are sufficiently motivated to give up this habit. They may be afraid of the side effects of abstinence (such as weight gain or increased stress), or think they are unable to achieve it (if they have a history of previous relapses), or may simply have no information about the harmful effects of tobacco or the benefits of quitting. In these cases, the patient might be likely to respond to a motivational strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Health problems are an important motivational factor to quit smoking and the quit smoking rates seem to be higher in smokers who fear the health complications related to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In this context, the evaluation of individual risk using biomedical tests or assessment of genetic susceptibility to cancer could help to improve abstinence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These interventions are based on the idea that informing the smoker about individual risk, based on personal data, could improve understanding of the adverse health effects of smoking and increase motivation to quit smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, an individualized focus using risk assessment tools should allow a more effective approach, primarily in smokers with the highest risk and greatest motivation to quit smoking.</p><p>This strategy is not new and has been used successfully for years in the prevention of coronary diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]; therefore, in theory it could also apply to a smoking habit. However, the authors of the <italic>Cochrane Review</italic> article that evaluated the effectiveness of informing smokers about biomedical risks as a way of helping them quit smoking concluded that few tests are available and no definitive recommendations can be established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This is a logical conclusion, taking into account the small sample size of most of the 15 studies included in the review article, their methodological heterogeneity, and the lack of benefit detected in each individual study. Only two trials observed significant effects: Parkes et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] used reinforcement with spirometry results in terms of &#x0201c;lung age&#x0201d; (RR 2.12; 95&#x000a0;%CI: 1.24-3.62) and Bovet et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] showed participants echocardiographically obtained photographs of coronary artery plaque (RR 2.77; 95&#x000a0;%CI: 1.04-7.41). The same review indicates that it is possible to improve the methodological quality of future studies by adjusting the sample size to the research objectives, improving the randomization and the process of making random, blinded assignments, using the consensus definitions of &#x0201c;smoker&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;abstinence&#x0201d;, a biochemical test to confirm smoking abstinence, and an intention-to-treat statistical approach.</p><p>The evaluation of pulmonary function in asymptomatic smokers is a controversial topic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although the use of spirometry has become generalized in our setting, its usefulness in managing COPD in the initial phases of the disease has been questioned because quitting smoking is the most important measure that can be taken to reduce morbidity and mortality; therefore, smoking cessation is an intervention that should always be applied, independently of a COPD diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although some observational studies have indicated that early diagnosis of COPD could increase smoking abstinence rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the effectiveness of spirometry as a motivational tool has not yet been demonstrated convincingly in a clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. To the contrary, some doubts have been raised and there have been suggestions that providing information about a normal result could have a &#x0201c;tranquilizing effect&#x0201d; that strengthens the bias of optimism that some smokers have about their own smoking habit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In any case, and in light of the available data, it is evident that more research is needed to determine whether feedback on spirometry data has a differential impact on smokers depending on the evidence of deteriorated pulmonary function.</p><p>In this context, the RESET is proposed as a randomized, controlled, parallel, multicenter clinical trial that will include smokers with no known history of respiratory disease, with the primary objective of evaluating whether an intervention based on proving information about spirometry as a motivational element will improve the success rates of smoking cessation interventions in primary care settings. Perhaps the results of the proposed study will contribute to clarifying some of the uncertainties that currently exist.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ARR</term><def><p>absolute risk reduction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATS/ERS</term><def><p>American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CO</term><def><p>carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eCO</term><def><p>exhaled carbon monoxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV1</term><def><p>forced expiratory volume in the first second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p>forced vital capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH</term><def><p>International Conference on Harmonisation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IDIAP</term><def><p>Primary Care Research Institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>number needed to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ppm</term><def><p>parts per million</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRR</term><def><p>relative risk reduction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FML is the principal investigator.
