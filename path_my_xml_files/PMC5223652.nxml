While this procedure has revolutionised treatment, the incidence of secondary events remains a concern. These repeat events are thought to be due, in part, to continued enhanced platelet reactivity, endothelial dysfunction and ultimately restenosis of the stented artery. In this study, we will investigate whether a once a day inorganic nitrate administration might favourably modulate platelet reactivity and endothelial function leading to a decrease in restenosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>NITRATE-OCT is a double-blind, randomised, single-centre, placebo-controlled phase II trial that will enrol 246 patients with stable angina due to have elective percutaneous coronary intervention procedure with stent implantation. Patients will be randomised to receive 6&#x02005;months of a once a day dose of either nitrate-rich beetroot juice or nitrate-deplete beetroot juice (placebo) starting up to 1&#x02005;week before their procedure. The primary outcome is reduction of in-stent late loss assessed by quantitative coronary angiography and optical coherence tomography at 6&#x02005;months. The study is powered to detect a 0.22&#x000b1;0.55&#x02005;mm reduction in late loss in the treatment group compared with the placebo group. Secondary end points include change from baseline assessment of endothelial function measured using flow-mediated dilation at 6&#x02005;months, target vessel revascularisation (TVR), restenosis rate (diameter&#x0003e;50%) and in-segment late loss at 6&#x02005;months, markers of inflammation and platelet reactivity and major adverse cardiac events (ie, myocardial infarction, death, cerebrovascular accident, TVR) at 12 and 24&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Local Ethics Committee (15/LO/0555).

Presently, timely percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation remains the most effective treatment strategy for limiting events and infarct size following an acute myocardial infarction, preserving left ventricular ejection fraction and improving clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> However, despite these advances,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref> substantial mortality<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and morbidity rates persist with respect to longer term outcome.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A major determinant of prognosis after treatment is the reocclusion of the affected arteries. A number of specific phenomena have been linked with reocclusion including persistent endothelial dysfunction, increased platelet reactivity and restenosis. Therefore, strategies that might limit or indeed correct these phenomena have clear therapeutic potential.</p><p>In the healthy cardiovascular system, tonically generated nitric oxide (NO), produced via the conventional L-arginine/NO synthesis pathway, plays an essential role in maintaining homoeostasis and in sustaining healthy cardiac function, perfusion and cardioprotection.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In patients with coronary artery disease, a generalised &#x02018;endothelial dysfunction&#x02019; which is characterised by deficient endothelium-derived bioavailable NO exists; the extent of which is correlated with severity of coronary artery disease.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The cardioprotective effects of NO relate to a number of actions including its potent vasodilator effect in the ischaemic myocardium,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> allowing for essential perfusion of injured tissue, its anti-inflammatory effects repressing leucocyte recruitment,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> its antiplatelet effects<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

In healthy volunteers and patients with cardiovascular disease dietary nitrate, in the form of beetroot juice, causes dose-dependent rises in circulating nitrite levels associated with improvement in endothelial dysfunction, and suppressed platelet reactivity assessed ex vivo.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, there have now been several studies in patients demonstrating the benefits of inorganic nitrate, administered either through the use of nitrate-rich beetroot juice or through provision of a nitrate salt dose, with respect to improvements in maximal oxygen consumption and diastolic function in heart failure<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>

A Vicorder device (Skidmore Medical Limited, Bristol, UK) will be used to simultaneously record the pulse wave from the carotid and femoral site using an oscillometric method. A small, inflatable neck pad will be placed directly over a single carotid artery and secured around the neck by a Velcro tab. A cuff will be placed around the patient's ipsilateral upper thigh. Both carotid and femoral cuffs will be inflated automatically to 65&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg and the corresponding oscillometric signal from each cuff will be digitally analysed to extract the pulse time delay. The distance between the sternal notch and the thigh cuff will be measured and used as a standard estimate for the aortic length.

There will be automated detection of the boundaries of a selected coronary vessel segment using digitised and optically magnified sections of the cine frame. If a wrong centreline is chosen because of large daughter branches, then correction is possible manually. The vessel diameter will be calculated in absolute values (mm). This will be done using the boundaries of a section of the contrast catheter and comparing the computed mean catheter diameter in pixels with the known catheter size in mm. To detect the contours of the vessel, the user will indicate the vessel by choosing two centre positions proximal and distal to the area of interest.

The following QCA parameters will be calculated: reference vessel diameter, minimal lumen diameter, per cent diameter stenosis (difference between the reference vessel diameter and minimal lumen diameter/reference vessel diameter&#x000d7;100) and late lumen loss (difference between the postprocedure and follow-up minimal lumen diameter). Binary restenosis will be defined as stenosis of 50% or greater in the target lesion or segment at the 6-month angiographic follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2j7"><title>Optical coherence tomography</title><p>OCT imaging of the previously stented segment with motorised pull back at 1&#x02005;mm/s will be undertaken in all patients at 6&#x000b1;1&#x02005;months after index PCI.

OCT images will be analysed by an independent expert in high-resolution OCT analysis. An automatic analysis with novel dedicated software will be used for quantitative assessment. The existence of malapposition will be assessed. The OCT variables recorded will be endothelial coverage: expressed as per cent of struts without coverage, neointimal thickness at 6&#x000b1;1&#x02005;months and stent malapposition defined as struts with detachment from the vessel &#x02265;110&#x02005;&#x003bc;m.

This absolute difference is calculated from a mean late loss of 1.27&#x02005;mm with an SD of the response variable of 0.550.
