world and the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in women, which is directly
related to the degree of development of some countries, mainly affecting women with low
socioeconomic status and less access to screening actions<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The incidence of this cancer is higher in the age group between 30 and 39 years and its
control is a challenge to public health because of the financial and social damage
associated with the disease, considering that, when they are sick, women occupy hospital
beds, leave the labor market and are deprived of family life<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In order to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates for this cancer, the Brazilian
Ministry of Health adopted as standard the recommendation of the World Health
Organization. It proposes the cytological examination of the cervix every three years,
after two consecutive negative annual exams in women aged between 25 and 64 years, or
who, at that moment, have initiated sexual activity, in addition to improving the
adherence to screening strategies<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>It is known that women who are at increased risk of developing this cancer are not being
reached by screening programs, due to the fact that many of these women attended the
healthcare units to undergo the examination for reasons unrelated to cancer prevention.
In this way, the lack of adherence to periodicity of the colpocytological examination is
considered the main limiting factor for detection of CC<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Among the most important factors related to non-adherence to periodicity of the
colpocytological examination are the low socioeconomic status, low education, lack of a
partner, fear of doing it and/or a positive test result for cancer and constraint;
smoking; women&#x02019;s lack of time; difficult access to the health service and lack of
knowledge about the colpocytological examination<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this way, in addition to the existing socioeconomic inequalities, there is the fact
that cervical screening is mainly opportunistic, serving women who are at that moment in
the healthcare unit, without greater efforts to reach the population considered to be at
higher risk. Most healthcare services are restricted to younger women seeking primary
healthcare, prenatal care or family planning, in which the examination is performed
aiming at treating or preventing other health problems<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In this context, the nurse, as a health professional, has a fundamental role in the
development and practice of interventions aimed at changing this reality, considering
that the focus of this profession should be the healthcare in general. Interventions
should take into account the individuals and subjectivities of each region, and must be
performed differently, considering the individuality and the way of living of each
woman<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, the telephone intervention arises as a potential tool for the integral health
care and means an expansion of the action in health, representing an advance in the
traditional nursing care, emerging as potential strategy in the holistic care<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. In telephone counseling, a standardized protocol must be used to identify the
barriers that prevent the individuals from having a good attitude in relation to their
health, and provide information to help them to address and overcome these barriers<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Given the above, there is a need to introduce new behavioral and educational
interventions that increase the adherence to colpocytological examination and aim at
women&#x02019;s empowerment. Thus, it has been questioned: What will be the effects of an
educational intervention and a behavioral intervention, by telephone, on the adherence
to colpocytological examination by women who have inappropriate periodicity? The aim of
this study is to test the effects of the behavioral and educational interventions by
telephone on the adherence of women with inappropriate periodicity to colpocytological
examination.</p><p>Such studies are important because they aim to propose and assess the use of
interventions to minimize the absenteeism rates to the regular consultations for
colpocytological examination and, thus, improve the healthcare of women; reduce the
unnecessary health system expenditures and stimulate nurses to undertake new
interventions, which are essential for success in the control of CC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This is a quasi-experimental study with pre-test and post-test design, developed in the
city of Fortaleza, at the Family Development Center (CEDEFAM), from June to December
2014.</p><p>The study population consisted of women who underwent examination for prevention of
cervical cancer at that healthcare unit, and did not show the periodicity to examination
in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Health, i.e., they did not
undergo the annual colpocytological examination or any examination in the last three
years, after two consecutive negative tests<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>. The sample selection met the following inclusion criteria: women aged between
25 and 64 years, who have initiated sexual activity, with inappropriate periodicity of
examination and who had their mobile or landline phones numbers registered in the
medical records. To classify them as &#x0201c;inappropriate periodicity&#x0201d;, the amount of previous
examinations was also assessed. </p><p>The sample size calculation was performed using the formula for comparative studies of
groups and the following values were adopted: Z&#x003b1; = 95%, Z&#x003b2; = 80%, <italic>p</italic> =
18.6%, d = 10%. Thus, by substituting the values, it was found that 239 women would be
needed for each group. However, a 10% safety percentage for possible telephone losses
was added, with 262 women for each group, totalling 524 women.</p><p>The women composing the sample were randomly allocated into two groups:</p><p>- Group 1. educational telephone intervention: an educational telephone intervention and
the scheduling of the colpocytological examination was offered to the women. The
intervention was guided by the technology created in a previous study<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref> and by the guidelines for cervical cancer control of the Ministry of Health<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>, in accordance with the principles of Motivational Interviewing (MI)<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>. During the phone call, demographic data and information on knowledge, attitude
and practice of women on the prevention of cervical cancer were also collected through
application of the KAP survey.</p><p>- Group 2. behavioral telephone intervention: a behavioral telephone intervention
(telephone reminder) and the scheduling of the colpocytological examination was offered
to the women. During the phone call, demographic data and information on knowledge,
attitude and practice of women on the prevention of cervical cancer were also collected
through application of the KAP survey.</p><p>The study design involved the random assignment of subjects to groups. By means of
randomization, or random selection for groups, all participants had an equal chance of
being included in either group. It was predicted from the beginning of the study that
the randomly assigned groups were similar, in general, in relation to the infinite
number of biological, psychological and social features<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>11</sup>
</xref>
<sup>).</sup> The random selection was performed by means of a table created by using a
random allocation software. Each number on the lists of the two groups (educational and
behavioral) was inserted into an opaque envelope, which was numbered and sealed.
Individuals unaware of the study performed these steps. </p><p>In this study, women who were part of the sample were blinded with respect to the group
to which they belonged. Besides them, two professionals were chosen - one of them
performed the behavioral telephone interventions and the other performed the educational
telephone interventions. These trained professionals were also blinded, because they
were not aware of the goals of the study and they did not know the schedule and the
existence of groups. </p><p>The educational telephone intervention was divided into two phases: the first phase
consisted of the introduction of the professional, research on the examination performed
in other healthcare services and questions about the intention to participate in the
study; if the answer was affirmative, the second phase was started. </p><p>In the second phase, information on the sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge
and attitude of women on the prevention of CC were collected. Subsequently, the
intervention started, which addressed: a brief explanation on CC and its risks, the
purpose of the colpocytological examination, the importance of the periodicity of
examination, pre-examination care and return to receive the result of the
colpocytological examination<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. </p><p>The evoke-provide-evoke model was used, supported by the MI, because it involves a
collaborative mindset, proper for interventions aiming at behavior changes. This model
seeks not only to transfer information, but also to insert the patients into the context
and enable them to make their own decision about the change<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The two phases were carried out in a single telephone call, lasting about fifteen
minutes, because this is the recommended time for intervention<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>. Finally, the examination was scheduled according to the availability of women
to attend the healthcare unit.</p><p>The behavioral intervention used in this study aimed to serve as a reminder to the
colpocytological examination. This telephone intervention was divided into two phases -
the first phase consisted of the introduction of the professional, research on the
examination performed in other healthcare services and questions about the intention to
participate in the study; if the answer was affirmative, the second phase was started. </p><p>In the second phase, information on the sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge
and attitude of women in relation to prevention of CC were collected. Subsequently, they
received a reminder for the examination without any information about it. In addition,
the examination was scheduled according to the availability of women to attend the
healthcare unit. These two phases were carried out in a single telephone call, lasting
about five minutes.</p><p>The second phase of data collection was carried out on the day of consultation, which
was scheduled to perform the colpocytological examination. The KAP survey was applied
again to women who attended the healthcare unit, in order to compare the effects of the
intervention on their knowledge and attitude in relation to the examination. Next,
colpocytological examination was performed and another day was scheduled to receive the
results of the examination (from 30 to 40 days after examination). </p><p>Data were compiled and analyzed using the <italic>Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences</italic> software, version 20.0. Continuous variables were expressed as mean
&#x000b1; Standard Deviation, with a 95% confidence interval (CI), and categorical variables as
frequencies and percentages. To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of women
regarding the colpocytological examination before and after interventions, it was used
Person&#x02019;s chi-square test and McNemar&#x02019;s test. To assess the existence of factors related
to knowledge, attitude and inappropriate practices on the examination, it was used
Person&#x02019;s chi-square test and <italic>odds ratio</italic> (OR), with a 95% confidence
interval. </p><p>In the assessment of the existence of factors related to non-performance of the
colpocytological examination, it was also used the Pearson&#x02019;s chi-square and OR. A
<italic>p</italic>-value &#x02264; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p><p>Compliance with standards for research involving humans was ensured by the Resolution
466/2012 of the National Health Council of Brazil<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>. Initially, it was requested authorization from the Coordination of CEDEFAM for
conducting this study. Next, the study was submitted to ethical approval by the Brazil
Platform, which approved it under opinion number 700.006.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>It was observed that the average age was 38.4 years, considering the minimum and maximum
ages recommended by the MOH (25-64 years). Women showed an average of 9.4 years of
study, prevailing complete high school level (32.6%). </p><p>Regarding the onset of sexual life (OSL), the average age was 17.3 years, with 11 years
as minimum age and 32 years as maximum age. Most participants reported having a partner
(53.4%), not work outside the home (52.9%) and reside near to the healthcare unit where
the examination was performed (88.7%).</p><p>When asked about the date of the last colpocytological examination, it was observed an
average of 31.7 months, ranging from 13 to 122 months.</p><p>The motives that make women not to undergo the colpocytological examination periodically
were also questioned. Many of the study participants mentioned the difficulty in
scheduling the examination in the healthcare unit as the major impediment to attend with
the appropriated periodicity (40.8%). It is noteworthy, however, the presence of factors
such as personal negligence (23.7%), forgetfulness about the period of undergoing the
examination (12.0%), lack of time (10.5%) and even the lack of interest (5.3%).</p><p>In assessing the knowledge about the colpocytological examination and attitude in
relation to its performance before the intervention, it was found that most women had
inappropriate knowledge (68.7%) and attitude (61.1%). It is emphasized that all women
were classified as &#x0201c;inappropriate practice of examination&#x0201d;.</p><p>Assessments were performed before and after each intervention to evaluate the effect of
interventions on the knowledge, attitude and practice on the adherence to examination,
as shown in the tables that follow. It is emphasized that, of the total of 524 women,
198 (37.7%) did not show up to undergo the colpocytological examination.</p><p>

</p><p>In both groups there was a prevalence of inappropriate knowledge before and after
intervention, being higher than 60.9%. However, it is observed that there was a
statistically significant increase of knowledge in the educational group
(<italic>p</italic>&#x000b2; = 0.0283) when this group was analyzed before (29.8%) and after
(39.1%) intervention, and almost 10% of women acquired appropriate knowledge about the
examination. Regarding the behavioral group, it was observed a small change in the
adequacy of knowledge in this group before (32.8%) and after (35.4%) intervention.
Nevertheless, this change leads us to believe that when examination was scheduled
through a reminder intervention, women became interested to know more about the
examination, acquiring knowledge by their own means.</p><p>

</p><p>It was also noted that there was a higher percentage of adherence to examination among
women in the behavioral group (66.8%), in comparison with the educational group (57.7%),
showing that most of the women who participated in the educational intervention did not
show up for examination (42.3%), even after they have increased their knowledge about
the importance of undergoing it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The average age found in this study corroborates a study of 772 women aged over 18
years, carried out in the city of Rio Branco, Acre, showing an average age of 36.6
years, with a higher prevalence of undergoing the colpocytological examination among
women aged between 25 and 35 years (86.4%). According to the authors of this study, the
end of child-bearing age influences in reducing the appointments for gynecological
consultations or their demand in the healthcare units, leading to decrease of prevention
practices in the age period in which the incidence and severity of cancer are
higher<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Added to the above, non-adherence to appropriate periodicity to the colpocytological
examination is related to some social factors such as be part of the younger age group,
be single and have low education or low socioeconomic status<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>There was a large time gap since the last colpocytological examination, with an average
of 31.7 months. The periodical examination is essential, since the late diagnosis of CC
can cause not only physical injury, but also emotional and psychosocial problems<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Women undergoing examination at a periodicity exceeding three years also have higher
proportion of no returning to receive the final results of examination, and they do not
show the results to a professional, featuring discontinuity of this health care<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>When asked about the reason for not undergoing examination, many women mentionated the
difficulty in scheduling the examination, carelessness, lack of time, among other. A
study of 12 women diagnosed with CC found that there are problems related to the women,
healthcare services and professionals, what makes it difficult the examination as
recommended. This study found that factors such as shame, carelessness, fear of going to
the doctor, absence of symptoms and lack of time are individual components that
interfere with the practice of examination. Moreover, since they affected the demand for
examination in the healthcare services, these reasons denote lack of knowledge about the
importance and necessity of periodical examination<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Undergoing examination at an inappropriate periodicity can be associated with
inappropriate knowledge and attitude, as observed in this study. A study of 30 women in
the state of Minas Gerais found that only 40% had appropriate knowledge about the
colpocytological examination and 83.3% did not know what was HPV or reported -
erroneously - that it was the &#x0201c;same as&#x0201d; AIDS, cancer, some kind of bacteria and so
on<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In assessing the knowledge before and after intervention, it was found that in both
groups there was a prevalence of inappropriate knowledge, exceeding 60.9%. Therefore, it
is necessary to improve the knowledge and awareness of women about prevention of
cervical cancer, and educate the population so that the demand for colpocytological
examination meets the screening goals, also reaching the most excluded women<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>Regarding the attitude towards the examination, there was a prevalence higher than 60.9%
of inappropriate attitude before and after intervention in both groups. It is emphasized
that none of the interventions proposed have improved women&#x02019;s attitude. This may be
related to the culture of seeking the healthcare services to undergo the examination
only when there are symptoms, or to check the health status, not associating the
prevention of CC as the main reason for examination. </p><p>Promoting the development of personal skills and attitudes favorable to health at all
stages is among the most import fields of health promotion, considering that they
provide opportunities for the development of the health potential. To this end, it is
essential the dissemination of information on health education, which should take place
in all collective spaces. Friendly environments, access to information, skills to live
better, just as opportunities to make healthier choices, are among the main empowerment
elements<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Regarding the adherence to examination, by comparing the groups after the intervention,
it was found a statistically significant relationship (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001)
for the two groups, showing that interventions were effective. It is worth mentioning
the greater attendance by women belonging to the behavioral group. However, it is known
that behavioral interventions appear to have more elusive effect when compared to
cognitive interventions, leading to the need to use a combination of interventions to
achieve a better efficacy<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>. Thus, the women in this study showed a higher increase in knowledge and lower
adherence rate in the educational group. Therefore, it is recommended to carry out a
further study to assess the effectiveness of adherence over time in both groups after
one year, confirming the permanent modification about the practice of colpocytological
examination.</p><p>In this way, performing telephone interventions is a resource associated with the
nursing practice, which can produce significant changes in the health of the population,
highlighting the importance of technical and clinical knowledge for the interventions by
the professional. Moreover, the use of technology for healthcare development requires
trained professionals to promote the convergence between human development and
technological knowledge, aiming at the desired goals<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Investing in prevention practices and awareness of the population is less costly than
the curative treatment of various types of diseases, especially in the public health
system, by reducing the costs of hospitalization, surgeries and treatments<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>In a case study of a chemically dependent patient, the use of MI by telephone enabled
the codependency to be reduced, and modified the observed permissive behavior. Moreover,
the authors noticed the expansion of self-perception of the patient on his personal
needs and limits with regard to chemical dependency. Thus, it is emphasized that an
intervention focused on motivational approaches and in MI represents a helping
strategy<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The educational intervention based on principles of MI was able to arouse the interest
of participants to change their demotivation in relation to self-care and caused changes
that favored the prevention of diseases, in this case, the undergoing of
colpocytological examination. It is emphasized that no person is completely unmotivated
and the motivation to change is quite malleable and formed especially within the context
of relationships. Great results are achieved when patients are interested and show an
active role, making the intervention more effective and with a lasting influence on the
patient&#x02019;s health<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>10</sup>
</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It was found, in the view of the observed changes, that the different telephone
interventions were effective in promoting the adherence of women to colpocytological
examination. For this reason, it is considered relevant the permanent healthcare
education, with actions that aim at promoting the prevention of CC and are
comprehensive, prioritizing interventions for the screening of both the asymptomatic and
symptomatic women, besides ensuring access to methods for proper diagnosis and
treatment.</p><p>It is recommended conducting future studies to assess the long-term effectiveness of the
educational and behavioral interventions on adherence to colpocytological examination,
in order to check, after a year, if women remain seeking the healthcare service to
undergo the examination within the recommended periodicity.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extracted from Doctoral Dissertation &#x0201c;Interven&#x000e7;&#x000f5;es por telefone para ades&#x000e3;o ao
