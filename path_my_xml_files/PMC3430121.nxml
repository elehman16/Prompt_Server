We assessed the effects of glycopyrronium bromide (NVA237), a once-daily, long-acting muscarinic antagonist, on exercise tolerance in patients with moderate to severe COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomized to a cross-over design of once-daily NVA237 50 &#x003bc;g or placebo for 3 weeks, with a 14-day washout. Exercise endurance, inspiratory capacity (IC) during exercise, IC and expiratory volumes from spirometry, plethysmographic lung volumes, leg discomfort and dyspnea under exercise (Borg scales), and transition dyspnea index were measured on Days 1 and 21 of treatment. The primary endpoint was endurance time during a submaximal constant-load cycle ergometry test on Day 21.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 108 patients were randomized to different treatment groups (mean age, 60.5 years; mean post-bronchodilator, forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] 57.1% predicted). Ninety-five patients completed the study. On Day 21, a 21% difference in endurance time was observed between patients treated with NVA237 and those treated with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); the effect was also significant from Day 1, with an increase of 10%. Dynamic IC at exercise isotime and trough FEV<sub>1</sub> showed significant and clinically relevant improvements from Day 1 of treatment that were maintained throughout the study. This was accompanied by inverse decreases in residual volume and functional residual capacity. NVA237 was superior to placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in decreasing leg discomfort (Borg CR10 scale) on Day 21 and exertional dyspnea on Days 1 and 21 (transition dyspnea index and Borg CR10 scale at isotime). The safety profile of NVA237 was similar to that of the placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>NVA237 50 &#x003bc;g once daily produced immediate and significant improvement in exercise tolerance from Day 1. This was accompanied by sustained reductions in lung hyperinflation (indicated by sustained and significant improvements in IC at isotime), and meaningful improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and dyspnea. Improvements in exercise endurance increased over time, suggesting that mechanisms beyond improved lung function may be involved in enhanced exercise tolerance.

Days 1 and 21, one hour after drug administration, exercise tolerance was measured by exercise endurance time during a SMET. Submaximal exercise testing was performed as described by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Task Force on Standardization of Clinical Exercise Testing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-copd-7-503">20</xref> at 80% of maximum work capacity evaluated at screening (during the incremental cycle endurance test).

Dyspnea and leg discomfort measurements were taken at the same time as IC measurements. Heart rate and blood pressure were measured directly prior to starting SMET and at the end of the preloaded exercise; heart rate and blood pressure over the corresponding time interval were then compared between treatments. All endpoints, with the exception of the Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI), were also assessed on treatment Day 1.</p><p>Quality assurance methods were put in place to ensure the quality of exercise endurance tests and data collection of data; where possible, the same spirometry equipment was used for all assessments performed by a patient during the study. Spirometers were calibrated for each study visit. All investigators received detailed training on the exercise endurance test methodology (with the training including practice runs of the exercise endurance tests). At site initiation visits, practice runs were conducted for pulmonary function and exercise tests to ensure that site staff were familiar with and competent in the tests; a limited number of staff, as designated by the investigator, evaluated all patients at all visits throughout the entire trial (where possible, the same technician performed all maneuvers for an individual patient to ensure consistency).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>The safety analysis population included all patients who received at least one dose of the study drug. Safety was assessed by recording of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) and monitoring of vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and laboratory analyses. Daily patient symptoms (respiratory symptoms, breathless feeling, sputum production, sputum color, cough, and wheeze) were assessed from screening until the last study visit in the morning and in the evening. AEs were recorded for both treatment periods for each patient. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary of Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized according to body system, severity, and preferred term for each treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>We calculated that a sample size of 80 patients should have 80% power to detect a 90-second improvement in exercise endurance between NVA237 and the placebo, under the assumption that the variability in the measurement, in terms of within-patient standard deviation, was approximately 200 seconds. A blinded, interim sample size re-estimation was performed after 24 patients completed the study, ie, when 24 patients had completed both treatment periods. Because the blinded estimate of the standard deviation was less than 200 seconds, no change was made to the planned sample size of 80 patients.

Such improvements in exercise capacity have been noted in studies examining pulmonary rehabilitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-copd-7-503">25</xref></p><p>Improvement in exercise capacity is recognized as an important goal in the management of COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-copd-7-503">5</xref> Dyspnea is known to adversely affect patient&#x02019;s health-related quality of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-copd-7-503">26</xref> Additionally, reduced exercise capacity and dyspnea are associated with increased mortality.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-copd-7-503">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-copd-7-503">28</xref></p><p>It has been suggested that the most important factor limiting exercise endurance in patients with COPD is dynamic hyperinflation,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-copd-7-503">7</xref> which typically results in decrease inspiratory capacity during exercise.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-7-503">29</xref> The immediate functional improvement in exercise endurance afforded by NVA237 (10% vs placebo on Day 1) is therefore potentially significant. Increased IC with NVA237 may have facilitated greater expansion of tidal volume, contributing to significant improvements in dyspnea and exercise endurance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-copd-7-503">14</xref> The magnitude of the effect of NVA237 on IC was the same on Day 1 and Day 21, indicating that NVA237 reduced dynamic hyperinflation after the first dose and maintained the effect over the 3-week treatment period. This reflects the full bronchodilator activity of NVA237 from the first dose onwards.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-7-503">19</xref> NVA237 produced clinically meaningful improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> versus treatment with the placebo (0.11 L increase on Day 21). The magnitude of effect observed is consistent with the results of previous studies examining the use of NVA237.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-7-503">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-7-503">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-7-503">19</xref> A comprehensive set of spirometric and body plethysmographic endpoints were investigated under resting conditions in the GLOW3 study. In addition to improvements in IC, NVA237 consistently decreased plethysmographic lung volumes, FRC, RV, and TLC, confirming that the observed effects on IC were reflective of decreased lung hyperinflation. Measuring sGAW using plethysmography can provide information regarding bronchodilator-induced changes in airway caliber, as an increase in airway diameter improves airway conductance. This measurement has been used as a sensitive method for assessing bronchodilator effects in clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-copd-7-503">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-copd-7-503">31</xref> NVA237 caused a large improvement in sGAW on Day 1, which was sustained through Day 21, confirming the time course of the changes in lung function observed using spirometry.</p><p>Breathlessness has been reported as one of the most frequent activity-limiting symptoms in patients with COPD.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-copd-7-503">32</xref> Thus, two measures of dyspnea (Borg CR10 and TDI) were included in this study. NVA237 significantly improved exertional dyspnea on Days 1 and 21 at isotime. NVA237 also resulted in statistically significant increases in TDI score that exceeded the 1-point difference considered clinically important. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-copd-7-503">22</xref> Reduction in hyperinflation with NVA237 treatment, demonstrated by an increase in IC on Days 1 and 21 in the current study, is an important factor that likely contributed to the improvement in dyspnea and exercise capacity. Exercise-limiting leg discomfort has also been frequently reported in COPD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-copd-7-503">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-copd-7-503">33</xref> NVA237 significantly improved the Borg CR10 score on Day 21 versus placebo administration. Notably, leg discomfort tended to be lower in NVA237- versus placebo-treated patients on Day 1. From a mechanistic perspective, better oxygenation of the leg muscles is expected to lead to some improvement in muscular function. However, this finding has not been consistently found in other trials with bronchodilators. For example, treatment with the short acting bronchodilator ipratropium were not associated with a significant improvement in leg discomfort score.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-copd-7-503">34</xref> In the present study, a significant improvement was observed at isotime during exercise, whereas no differences were observed at peak exercise. Given the fact, that the exercise test used is symptom-limited, this finding at peak is not surprising since it reflects the cessation of exercise by patients due to intolerable dyspnea or leg discomfort. In contrast, the observed differences in the level of leg discomfort at isotime may have been the result of improved ventilation with NVA237, leading to improved oxygenation and peripheral muscle function during a given workload, and flattening of the slope of leg discomfort as a function of endurance time.</p><p>Importantly, consistency between improved lung function and body plethysmographic measures were observed as well as improved dyspnea measures at rest and exercise in this study. This may underscore the relevance of bronchodilatory therapy for improving exercise capacity.</p><p>In terms of safety, NVA237 50 &#x003bc;g once daily was well-tolerated and showed an acceptable safety profile. Safety results are consistent with those from previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-copd-7-503">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-copd-7-503">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-copd-7-503">19</xref></p><p>Limitations of this study include short time period and that it was not coupled with another intervention, such as rehabilitation, to augment the response to therapy. Both a longer duration of the trial beyond 3 weeks of treatment and combining therapy with a pulmonary rehabilitation program may lead to further clinically meaningful effects. Additionally, cycle ergometry is more artificial than other methods such as a walking test; some patients may not be used to this type of exercise. It has been shown that stopping exercise due to leg discomfort occurs more frequently when cycling than during walking tests.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-copd-7-503">35</xref> Thus, the effects of treatment on cycling endurance may be more difficult to translate into changes for COPD patients&#x02019; everyday activities than a walking test. Nevertheless, cycling ergometry has been shown to be reliable and safe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-copd-7-503">36</xref> Furthermore, cycle ergometry offers a relatively easy and standardized method for measuring dynamic IC, in contrast to a walking test, which requires portable systems for measuring respiratory parameters throughout the exercise, thereby making obtaining reliable measures of IC more challenging.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-copd-7-503">37</xref></p><p>In conclusion, once-daily treatment with NVA237 results in significant improvement in exercise tolerance beginning with the first dose. Additionally, NVA237 reduces lung hyperinflation and offers clinically meaningful improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and breathlessness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors were assisted in preparing the manuscript by Melanie Stephens, a professional medical writer contracted to CircleScience (Macclesfield, UK), and Mark Fedele ( Novartis).
