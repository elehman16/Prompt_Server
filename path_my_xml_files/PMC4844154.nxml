The current main objective is to compare the long-term suppressive effects of looped (i.e. repeated) electrical stimulation (without environmental sound perception) with the standard stimulation pattern of a CI (with environmental sound perception).

It is a frequent symptom of hearing dysfunction, affecting about 50 million people in the United States and an estimated 70 million in the European Union [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. For some of them it can be extremely burdensome and affect daily life. Furthermore, the economic burden of tinnitus to society is substantial with an annual tinnitus related health care cost per patient of &#x020ac;1,544 on average in the Netherlands [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The exact underlying mechanism is not completely known, but it is plausible that tinnitus has a central origin that is triggered by auditory deprivation as a maladaptive homeostatic compensation mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has long been known that auditory deprivation can induce phantom sounds when subjects spend time in complete silence in a sound-proof booth [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More recently, it has been reported that continuous use of an earplug can also lead to the perception of tinnitus [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Due to plasticity, reversing auditory deprivation by electrical stimulation should suppress the tinnitus theoretically. Although intracochlear electrical stimulation seems to be a potential treatment option for tinnitus there is no cure available yet. Research in the past decade show tinnitus suppression in bilateral and unilateral deafness using Cochlear Implants (CIs) [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is not yet clear if the processing of speech, that is, the perception of environmental sounds is a requirement of these observed effects. The question arises if it is possible that similar effects on tinnitus, or even optimization of these effects may be achieved by meaningless, but highly controlled, intracochlear electrical stimulation. Previous studies, including preliminary results of this study, show short-term (i.e. for minutes) tinnitus reduction using electrical stimulation that does not encode environmental sounds [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This preliminary work [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was performed in order to find the optimal stimulation characteristics for tinnitus suppression using electrical stimulation independent of environmental sounds. These preliminary results showed a tinnitus reduction during standard clinical CI rehabilitation while the CI surgery itself had no positive or negative effect on tinnitus. Furthermore, the original tinnitus loudness restored after one week of CI deactivation. Optimal stimulation using meaningless electrical stimulation for short-term tinnitus suppression was observed to be subject-specific. In order to determine whether meaningless chronic intracochlear electrical stimulation is a viable treatment option for people with extremely burdensome tinnitus, long-term effects need to be investigated. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the long term (i.e. up to three months) effects of intracochlear electrical stimulation, that does not encode environmental sounds, on tinnitus and compare these effects with the effects obtained using standard clinical CI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study is a continuation of the previously published preliminary work. This study reports findings on the same participants used for the preliminary work [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but evaluates long-term (i.e. up to three months) effects of meaningless intracochlear electrical stimulation instead of the short term (i.e. for minutes) effects reported previously and also controls for possible placebo effects.

In the preliminary work of this study they received a cochlear implant (CI) in the deaf ear in order to suppress their unilateral tinnitus, localized in the deaf ear. Inclusion criteria for implantation were: chronic, continuous and moderate-to-severe tinnitus that was stable for at least one year. Moderate-to-severe tinnitus was diagnosed as a tinnitus loudness of at least 7.0 on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) with a range from 0 to 10, a Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] score of at least 38 and/or a Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] score of at least 42.

In the preliminary work, the short-term effects of looped (i.e. repeated) intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus were investigated after a period of standard CI rehabilitation. The standard CI rehabilitation was performed prior to the fine tuning procedure of the Tinnitus Implant (TI) in order to optimize and stabilize the dynamic range for electric hearing.</p><p>After the fine tuning procedure of the TI a sham stimulation was performed for one week to control for possible placebo effects. Here, a sub-threshold stimulation level of less than 0.5 nC per electrode was used to avoid warning signals of the processor and remote control (single-blinded procedure). Subjects were informed that the stimulation applied was sub-threshold and therefore inaudible, but that the current level was at a level at which significant tinnitus suppression was plausible. Subsequently, for each subject the four most efficient stimulation patterns during the fine tuning procedure were used on a daily basis (for details, see Arts et al. [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Subjects were asked to rank their tinnitus loudness and stimulus comfort at the end of each day. Each of the four stimulation patterns were tested for two full days to choose the single most convenient pattern, which was consequently utilized during the randomized crossover design. Here, either the processor was first programmed for three months as a standard clinical CI in order to perceive environmental sounds after which the processor was switched for three months to function as a looped pattern generator (TI) or vice versa. Finally, subjects were allowed to choose, based on their experiences, to use their processor either as a speech processor or as a pattern generator for another three-month follow-up period. At the end of the trial, it was allowed to fit the processor with both modalities, each programmed in a different program bank.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Device and software</title><p>In the preliminary work of this study subjects were implanted with a MED-EL cochlear implant system (MED-EL Corporation, Innsbruck, Austria), consisting of a CONCERTO implant and the OPUS2 processor.

Values were accurate to one decimal place.</p><p>Tinnitus pitch and loudness were acoustically measured, using headphones (Telephonics, TDH-39P), via the contralateral ear. Subjects were asked to concentrate on the predominant pitch of their tinnitus. Tinnitus pitch matching (PM) was performed, after one week of sham stimulation, prior to the crossover design and both after one and three months of standard CI and TI. Furthermore, tinnitus PM was performed after one and three months during the implant use of choice following the crossover design. Pure tones, 1/3 octave narrow band noises and warble tones within the 250&#x02013;8000 Hz range (for the center frequency in case of narrow band noises) and white noise were presented using a three-Alternative Forced Choice method.

The THI quantifies the effect of tinnitus on the patient&#x02019;s emotions and daily activities using 25 items, each answered with No (0 points), Sometimes (2 points) or Yes (4 points).

This pattern was used during TI-stimulation in the current longitudinal study. In eight out of the ten included subjects the electrical stimulation was presented on the tinnitus pitch matched electrode. In five of them the stimulation was presented at this single electrode, in one subject the stimulation was presented on the tinnitus pitch matched electrode together with the two adjacent electrodes and in the other two subjects the stimulation was presented on all the available electrodes. Furthermore, eight out of ten subjects preferred a cathodic first charge-balanced biphasic stimulation. During the crossover design it was allowed to reduce the applied current level of the looped stimulation patterns by consultation of our tertiary otologic practice in case of for example tinnitus reduction or in order to improve stimulus comfort.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0153131.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0153131.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Subject-specific stimulation during TI-use.</title><p>Charge-balanced biphasic stimulation in monopolar mode.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0153131.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0153131.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pattern</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Electrode(s)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amplitude Modulation</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Polarity (first A/C)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stimulation rate (pps/ channel)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean pulse width/ channel (&#x003bc;s)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Final mean maximum charge value/ channel (nC)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (PM elec.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Fixed</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">200</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002">*</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (PM elec.)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Random</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5000</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">85</td><td align="char" char="." rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">App. 2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 &#x00026;

There was also no significant difference between treatments found on the BDI and HUI Mark III. However, a period effect was observed for the BDI-scores that could probably bias the analysis of the treatment effect during this crossover design.</p><p>All used tinnitus outcome measures showed a statistically significant reduction at the end of the follow-up compared to baseline while no significant difference was found between baseline and after one week of sham stimulation. This treatment did not result in complete tinnitus suppression (except for 1 subject), but the reduction in tinnitus was significant. The BDI-scores and HUI Mark III utility scores at the end of the follow-up were not statistically different from baseline. Furthermore, RI could often be measured during the trial and ranged from a few seconds to more than 30 minutes. The tinnitus was most often perceived as an 1/3 octave narrow band noise. Finally, no serious adverse events that can be related to neither the standard clinical CI nor the TI were observed.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Comparison of CI and TI</title><p>There is no literature available (with the exception of two case reports, of which one anecdotally [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]) on the long-term effectiveness of intracochlear electrical stimulation independent of environmental sounds on tinnitus. The current study shows no statistically significant difference between looped intracochlear electrical stimulation and standard clinical CI in any of the analyzed outcome measures after both one month and three months of treatment in the used crossover design. Therefore, speech perception appears to be no requirement for tinnitus suppression using intracochlear electrical stimulation. However, the results on the depression scale need to be interpreted with caution since a period effect was detected that could influence a possible treatment effect. The preference in the majority of subjects of using the CI in relation to the TI during the trial (only 1 subject preferred using the TI following the crossover design) is plausibly declared by the audiological advantages using the CI compared to the TI.</p><p>No statistically significant differences in the health-related quality of life were found both during the crossover design as well as in the comparison between baseline and at the end of the follow-up. Therefore it is assumed that no response shift biased the analyses of the tinnitus outcome measures [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Response shift is the phenomenon that subjects change their internal standards when they experience changes in health.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Effectiveness of intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus suppression</title><p>It is generally known that intracochlear electrical stimulation by using standard clinical CI suppresses tinnitus in both the bilateral severe to profound deaf population as well as the SSD population [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our results are consistent with these findings. It is worth mentioning that the significant reduction in the tinnitus loudness matched via the contralateral ear is a subtle addition to the existing literature. Nevertheless, the current study shows no significant improvement of the health-related quality of life after cochlear implantation which is consistent with a previous study using the HUI Mark III after 6 months of CI use in eleven adult subjects with unilateral deafness [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, these results are not in agreement with a previous German study using the disease-specific Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire in the bilateral deaf population [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This inconsistency could probably be declared by the difference in questionnaire used or the difference in the studied population. The HUI Mark III was initially chosen since Maes and colleagues found that this utility measure was preferred in a tinnitus population, compared to the EuroQol-5D [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A hearing handicap and chronic tinnitus may be associated with emotions such as helplessness and depressive symptoms. Nevertheless, the statistically significant reduction of tinnitus after cochlear implantation did not result in a significant reduction of the depression score. This is consistent with a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and was initially expected because the absence of depression complaints was one of the criteria for subject inclusion [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Moreover, as far as the authors known this is the first study that included a sham stimulation in an attempt to control, although using a single-blinded design, for possible placebo effects.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Variation between subjects</title><p>The heterogeneity of auditory deprivation could declare the considerable variation in effectiveness between subjects. The current consensus is that tinnitus is the result of maladaptive plasticity in the central auditory pathway as a result of auditory deprivation [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is plausible that tinnitus could be reversible by restoring auditory stimulation. To be effective it is assumed to be necessary to bypass the cause of auditory deprivation which can occur at various positions along the auditory pathway. As intracochlear electrical stimulation directly stimulates the cochlear nerve and bypasses the transduction at the level of the hair cells, a more central origin of auditory deprivation is presumably outside the range of this treatment option. The suboptimal results obtained in for example subject 2 could therefore possibly be explained by a more central pathology due to the HELLP-syndrome, although no evidence was found for this argument [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This assumption is in accordance with the high effectiveness of electrical stimulation on tinnitus found in the subjects with a history of Morbus Meni&#x000e8;re (subject 3 and 7). Furthermore, both subject 2 and subject 8 were in a stressful period during the trial which could possibly have hampered the effectiveness on tinnitus suppression. This emphasizes the importance of an appropriate selection procedure.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study reported was a pilot study, and outcomes could have been victim to potential methodological limits, starting with the small sample size which is mainly the result of the significant costs related to cochlear implantation. It is therefore desirable that alternatives of the relatively expensive standard clinical CI will become under investigation. The current study could possibly contribute to investigate these alternatives.</p><p>It is also important to note in the interpretation of the results that the test for period effect in the crossover design described above has low sensitivity. Especially for small crossover trials one may fail to detect an interaction even if present.</p><p>The current study used a single-blinded placebo controlled procedure and is therefore not completely free from bias. Nevertheless, placebo controlled studies are scarce if not exceptional in intracochlear electrical stimulation for tinnitus suppression while it is expected that the tinnitus population is highly sensitive to possible placebo effects [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Here, a minimal current level was applied to avoid warning signals on both the processor and remote control. This current level was sub-threshold and assumed to be unable to influence neural structures for tinnitus suppression. The current study needs to be interpreted with caution and future studies on the effectiveness of meaningless intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus are highly recommended.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Future perspectives</title><p>In the current study, coding of environmental sounds seems to be no requirement for tinnitus suppression using intracochlear electrical stimulation. Therefore, the relatively simple electrical stimulation, without a highly sophisticated speech processing strategy, might be a viable treatment option and could possibly reduce the production costs with respect to the standard clinical CI. A relatively simple pattern generator is sufficient for this treatment option. Moreover, it might be possible that the effectiveness of intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus suppression could be further optimized using a combination of speech processing and the meaningless, but highly controlled, intracochlear electrical stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The results obtained from looped intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus suppression could possibly be further optimized in future studies. Pre-operative ultra-high field (functional) magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system could for example show more accurate information about the optimal stimulation site inside the cochlea compared to the subjective tinnitus pitch matching procedure used in the current study. Furthermore, postoperative imaging using x-rays improves the knowledge about the position of the electrode array and prevent a possible mismatch between the assigned tinnitus pitch-matched electrode based on the default frequency allocation table in the standard clinical software [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and the calculated tinnitus pitch-matched electrode based on the available frequency-position functions [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>One might wonder what the profit is of replacing the perception of their own tinnitus by a sound perception induced by the intracochlear electrical stimulation. The sound perception induced by the electrical stimulation applied was experienced as more comfortable than their own tinnitus and often became inaudible over time due to loudness adaptation or a shift in attention [<xref rid="pone.0153131.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The stimulus comfort was guaranteed by the subject-specific selection on a subjective base of the most convenient stimulation patterns. Moreover, subjects were allowed to reduce the current level of the looped stimulation during the crossover design in case of tinnitus reduction or stimulus discomfort.</p><p>Although the current study tested a great range of looped stimulation patterns, it is possible that the effectiveness and comfort could be optimized using other stimulation patterns. For example, although the optimal stimuli for tinnitus suppression appear to be subject-specific (preliminary work), we concluded that low amplitude electrical stimulation and high rate stimulation resulted in statistically more loudness adaptation compared to high amplitude electrical stimulation and low rate stimulation (unpublished data). Loudness adaptation improves stimulus comfort and therefore a combination of optimal tinnitus suppression and loudness adaptation may be preferred.</p><p>Furthermore, additional studies will give insight in the factors limiting the effectiveness of intracochlear electrical stimulation on tinnitus. In the current study it seems for example that stress hampered the effectiveness and there are possible indications that this proposed treatment option is suboptimal in case of a more central origin of the auditory deprivation. Future studies are needed for more evidence for these suggestions and in order to improve patient counselling and informed consent. It would also be interesting to investigate the effectiveness of looped intracochlear electrical stimulation in subjects with tinnitus complaints and significant residual hearing, in which a standard clinical CI would not be expected to have any audiological advantages.</p></sec><sec id="sec031"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the current placebo-controlled clinical trial a statistically significant tinnitus reduction was observed using intracochlear electrical stimulation. No statistically significant difference was found between looped intracochlear electrical stimulation (TI) and standard clinical CI. Furthermore, no significant effect of either CI or TI was found on depression and health-related quality of life. These results show that coding of environmental sounds does not appear to be a requirement for tinnitus suppression in the SSD population. Nevertheless, an adequate selection procedure seems to be essential for the effectiveness of the proposed treatment option. These results need to be interpreted with caution because of several methodological limitations and therefore future research is highly recommended.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec032"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153131.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153131.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0153131.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Original Study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0153131.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Katrien Vermeire MSc Ph.D for her contribution during the development of the test protocol and the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (Jan Wouter Brunings MD, Fons Kessels MD, MSc and Dyon Scheijen MSc) for overseeing the safety of the included subjects.
