Better fracture stability was observed in association with titanium nails on torsional and axial compression testing. However, stainless steel nails are stiffer than titanium counterparts, which may provide a rigid construct when fixing paediatric femoral shaft fractures. Complications have been observed more frequently by various researchers when titanium nails are used for fracture fixation in patients with increasing age or weight. The concept of this study was to compare the functional outcome after internal fixation with titanium elastic nail system and stainless steel elastic nail system in paediatric femoral shaft fractures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study was conducted on 34 patients admitted in the department of orthopaedics, LLRM Medical College &#x00026; SVBP Hospital, Meerut, India from January 2013 to August 2014. We included patients aged 5&#x02013;12 years with fracture of the femoral shaft, excluding compound fractures, pathological fractures and other lower limb fractures. Patients were treated by titanium (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) or stainless steel (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) elastic nail system and followed up for one year. The clinical parameters like range of motion at hip and knee joints, time to full weight bearing on the operated limb and radiological parameters like time to union were compared between two groups. A special note was made of intra- and post-operative complications. Functional outcomes were analysed according to Flynn criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Based on the Flynn criteria, 59% of patients had excellent results, 41% had satisfactory results, and no one showed poor results. There was no clinically significant difference between the two groups with respect to time to union and full weight bearing. But the incidence of puncture of the opposite cortex while inserting the nail and trying to advance it through the diaphysis during operation is greatly different. Only one such case was observed in titanium group but five in stainless steel group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Majority of paediatric femoral shaft fractures are now treated operatively by elastic stable intramedullary nails. Operative intervention results in a shorter hospital stay and has economic and social benefits over conservative treatment. The cost of stainless steel nail is one third the cost of titanium nail. However, the clinico-radiological results are not significantly different between titanium and stainless steel nails at one year follow-up as observed by our study.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pediatrics</kwd><kwd>Femoral shaft fractures</kwd><kwd>Titanium</kwd><kwd>Stainless steel</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Studies have shown equal or superior stability of titanium nails over stainless steel nails.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Titanium V alloy has lower modulus of elasticity, higher yield strength, almost equal tensile strength, and better biocompatibility and MRI compatibility as compared to 316L stainless steel.

Out of them 34 patients successfully completed one-year follow-up and were included in the analysis. Seventeen patients were managed with titanium nails (Group 1) and the same number of patients was managed with stainless steel nails (Group 2) according to randomisation table. Patients with compound fractures, pathological fractures, other lower limb fractures, or presence of any comorbid illness were excluded.</p><p>Preoperatively patients were placed in Thomas Knee splint with below knee skin traction. They were randomly assigned into Group 1 or 2 based on a randomization table. Elastic nails of standard length i.e. 440&#x000a0;mm and 2.0&#x02013;4.0&#x000a0;mm in diameters were used. The diameter of the individual nail was selected based on Flynn et&#x000a0;al's formula<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> (Diameter of nail&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Width of the narrowest point of the medullary canal on AP and lateral views&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.4&#x000a0;mm). The length of the nail was determined intraoperatively by fluoroscopy. Two nails of the same diameter were used.</p><p>The patients were placed on an orthopaedic fracture table and a reduction of the fracture by traction guided by fluoroscopy was done. Pre-angled nails which were angled at 45&#x000b0; about 2&#x000a0;cm from one end were used. An entry point was made with the help of bone awl approximately 2&#x000a0;cm above the physis on lateral side. A nail loaded onto a T handle was then inserted through the entry point into the medullary canal by rotator movements of the wrist and advanced upto fracture site. Another nail was introduced using the same technique from the medial side and advanced upto fracture site. The nails were then crossed across the already reduced fracture site one by one. It was ensured that both nails were in the canal across the fracture site by fluoroscopy. Traction was released when the nails crossed the fracture site and then they were advanced further. Medial nail was advanced till it was within 2&#x000a0;cm of proximal femoral capital physis whereas lateral nail was inserted till it was about 1&#x000a0;cm from greater trochantric physis. Nails were left protruding about 0.5&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;at the distal end for easy removal later on.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>In the postoperative period limbs were simply rested on the pillow or placed in a T-K splint based on postoperative reduction and preoperative fracture pattern. Sutures were removed on the 12th postoperative day. Patients were taught isometric straight leg raises, quadriceps and hamstrings strengthening exercises with active, active-assisted and passive knee range of motion. Non-weight bearing with axillary crutches was started immediately after operation when tolerated. Weight bearing status depends on fracture configuration after reduction but in general partial weight bearing was started at around 4 weeks and progressed to full weight bearing when bridging callus appeared and fracture line was not visible on X-rays. Patients were followed up at regular intervals of one month, three months and six months postoperatively. At each follow-up patients were assessed clinically, radiologically and the complications were noted. The nails were removed when complete healing of the fracture occurred (usually between 10 and 12 months). The final results were evaluated using the criteria of Flynn et&#x000a0;al. A typical case is presented in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Results</title><p>The average age of patients in this study was 8.6 years in Group 1 and 8.2 years in Group 2, including more males. The left side was involved in 70.59% and 82.35% of cases respectively (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref>). As for the fracture location, the middle third femoral shaft was mostly involved, accounting for 58.82% in both groups. Transverse fracture was the most common fracture type in Group 1 (52.94%) while spiral pattern the most common in Group 2 (52.94%). Most fractures were Winquist type 1 comminution (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). The mean time interval between trauma and surgery in Group 1 was 4.24 days and Group 2 was 5.35 days. Majority of the patients were immobilized in the postoperative period for about 4 weeks (64.71% and 70.59%).</p><p>There was no clinico-radiological difference in terms of time to full weight bearing and fracture site union between two groups (<xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;3</xref>). Minor complications were observed in 47.06% of patients in Group 1 and 35.29% of patients in Group 2 with no major complications (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;4</xref>). Seven patients in Group 1 and five patients in Group 2 reported pains at the site of nail insertion and both groups have three patients reported inflammatory bursa at the site of nail insertion. These problems resulted from surgical technique errors due to prominent hardware at the nail insertion site and did not produce long-term sequelae. Both pain and inflammatory bursa resolved within few weeks by giving oral antibiotics and analgesics. Range of motion at hip and knee was normal in all the patients except for one patient in Group 1, which also improved after the removal of hardware. There was no significant difference in malunion rate in both groups in sagittal as well as in coronal plane (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.00). There was one patient with minor coronal plane angulation in Group 1 which was varus with no sagittal plane deformities.</p><p>The most significant complication between two groups was puncture of the opposite cortex intraoperatively, which occurred while inserting the nail and trying to advance it through the diaphysis. It was observed in only one patient in Group 1 (5.89%) and in five patients in Group 2 (29.41%).</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Femoral shaft fractures in children have been treated conservatively in the past based on the presumption that complication if any arises will be compensated by excellent remodelling potential of the children bone. However over the recent years surgeons are becoming more and more familiar with the operative techniques and excellent results have been obtained. Therefore majority of the paediatric femoral shaft fractures are now treated operatively. Operative intervention results in shorter hospital stay and has economic and social benefits over conservative treatment.</p><p>There is no study in the past that compares titanium with stainless steel as nail material. However, few studies do compare titanium plates with stainless steel plates which show that the titanium plates led to the appearance of a small amount of periosteal callus without any histological evidence of fracture instability, thus allowing the radiological assessment of fracture union. Titanium plates also produced less bone loss during the remodelling phase and less soft-tissue reaction than stainless steel plates.</p><p>In our study the number of patients with normal range of motion at hip and knee in Group 1 was 16 (94.12%), while in Group 2 the number was 17 (100%). Similar results were obtained by the studies of Khazzam et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> and Lohiya et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> where clinical evaluation revealed full range of motion of the hip and knee in all patients at final follow-up. The average duration of progressing to full weight bearing in our study was 11.6 weeks. In the study by Lohiya et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> the mean duration of full weight bearing was 10.5 weeks. Khazzam et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> in their study recorded a mean of 8.7 weeks (range, 3&#x02013;22 weeks), for walking without assistive devices. The number of patients in Group 1 with union occurring across fracture site within 12 weeks was 14 (82.35%), While in Group 2 it was 12 (70.59%), The average duration was 11.8 weeks. El-Adl et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> in their study recorded a mean of 12 weeks for union across fracture site.</p><p>In this study, minor complications were observed in 47.06% of patients in titanium group and 35.29% of patients in stainless steel group with no major complications. There was no significant difference in malunion rate in both groups in sagittal as well as in coronal plane (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1.00). Contrary to our study, Wall et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> reported that the malunion rate was significantly higher in the titanium group (23.2%; 13/56) than in the stainless steel group (6.3%; 3/48, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.017). The risk of malunion was nearly four times higher in the titanium group than in the stainless steel group (odds ratio&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.535; 95% confidence interval, 1.208&#x02013;17.029). This difference may be due to the reason that their study was not randomized. However, similar results between two implants were seen in the study by Rios et&#x000a0;al,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> consistent with our study.</p><p>In the present study, the total outcome according to Flynn's criteria<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> was excellent in 58.82% of patients and satisfactory in 41.18% with no poor results. The difference in the puncture of the opposite cortex in two groups was significant, which might be due to the increased stiffness of stainless steel (Young's modulus&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;196&#x000a0;GPa) as compared to titanium (Young's modulus&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;115&#x000a0;GPa). Young's modulus of normal bone is 7&#x02013;25&#x000a0;GPa.</p><p>The average time range from implantation to extraction was 10&#x02013;12 months, and we did not face difficulty in any case in both groups while removing the hardware. Some limitations of the study were that we did not take into account of the length of nail left outside the distal cortex (whether it was bent or kept straight), which is an important cause of insertion site pain and skin irritation. Another major limitation was that the exact biochemical properties and composition of the titanium and&#x000a0;stainless steel implant used in the study, which differs from manufacturer to manufacturer, was also not taken into consideration.</p><p>The cost of stainless steel nail is one third the cost of titanium elastic nail system. However, the clinico-radiological results are not significantly different between the two groups at one year follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
