stretching exercises on upper crossed syndrome. [Subjects and Methods] After measuring
cervical alignment using the Global Posture System, 30 students with forward head posture
were selected and divided into two groups. The experimental group (n=15) participated in
strength and stretching exercises, three times per week for 4 weeks. The control group
(n=15) did not participate in the exercises. The exercise program comprised middle and
lower trapezius strength exercises and levator scapulae and upper trapezius stretching
exercises. The temperature of the posterior neck was then measured using digital infrared
thermographic imaging. [Results] There was a significant difference between the pretest
and posttest results in the experimental group, and a significant difference in posterior
neck temperature between the two groups. [Conclusion] This study showed that middle and
lower trapezius strength exercises and levator scapulae and upper trapezius stretching
exercises are more effective for upper crossed syndrome.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Strength exercise</kwd><kwd>Stretching exercise</kwd><kwd>Upper crossed syndrome</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>One of the most common postural problems is forward head posture (FHP)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The underlying cause of pain is poor posture and habits,
and a slightly misaligned position can limit mobility and cause tension in muscles and other
soft tissues<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Janda<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> described the problem of forward
head posture (FHP) as upper crossed syndrome and argued that the syndrome occurred when a
slouched sitting posture was sustained for a prolonged period. This poor posture weakens
deep neck flexors and scapular retractors such as the lower trapezius fibers and rhomboids
and shortens the upper trapezius, levator scapulae, pectoralis major, and pectoralis
minor<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Digital infrared thermographic imaging (DITI) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool used to
evaluate physical functions<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Regardless
of the size of the area in question, DITI provides a comprehensive thermographic image of
the area<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, detecting infrared heat from
the body and identifying possible dysfunction by displaying changes in body temperature in
painful or diseased areas with color imaging<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, DITI is widely used as an auxiliary test to
examine the effect of treatment for musculoskeletal diseases<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There are a number of previous studies on improving FHP. Kim and Lee<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study on the effect of stretching exercise to
ease shoulder and neck pain associated with musculoskeletal diseases. Yoo<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the effect of thoracic stretching
exercise and exercises for cervical and scapular posture on the thoracic kyphosis angle and
upper thoracic pain. Ahn et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> studied
the effects of stabilizing exercises using a Swiss ball on neck and shoulder pain and
mobility in adults with prolonged use of video display terminals. Yang et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a study on the effects of sling
exercise on muscle tension and pain in subjects with FHP. However, there is a lack of
research on the effects of muscle strengthening and stretching exercises on body temperature
changes.</p><p>Therefore, this study aims to identify changes in posterior neck temperature in upper
crossed syndrome patients after completion of muscle stretching and strengthening exercises,
and to provide basic data to develop an exercise program that helps prevent chronic
pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in 30 male students at K University in Busan for 4 weeks,
beginning 26 October, 2015. The study subjects had no congenital or acquired musculoskeletal
diseases, but were suspected of having upper crossed syndrome after a Global Postural System
(GPS) test. All agreed to participate in the study with full understanding of its purpose
and methods. This study was approved by the bioethics committee of the Catholic University
of Busan.</p><p>Subjects with cervical alignments more than 2.5&#x02005;cm off center were selected through a GPS
test. The subjects were randomly divided into an exercise test group and a nonexercise
control group, with 15 in each group. After evaluation of the two groups for homogeneity,
the subjects exercised three times a week for 4 weeks. The test group performed muscle
stretching and strengthening exercises. After 4 weeks of exercise, changes in body
temperature were measured by DITI.</p><p>The exercise program in this study focused on self-stretching and strengthening of
muscles<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The self-stretching exercise
engaged the rhomboids and the upper trapezius. In the self-stretching exercise, the rhomboid
was pulled laterally and the upper trapezius was pulled into cervical flexion. Each
repetition was performed for 10 seconds, with a five-second break between each repetition.
One exercise set consisted of three repetitions. The subjects performed ten sets. The muscle
strengthening exercise engaged the middle and lower trapezius.</p><p>The middle trapezius exercise was performed while in a prone position with the shoulder and
elbow joints at a 90-degree angle. The lower trapezius exercise was performed in a prone
position with the shoulder joints at a 135-degree angle while stretching both arms upward
without bending the joints. Both trapezius muscles were stretched for 10 seconds with a
five-second break between each repetition. One exercise set consisted of three repetitions,
and the subjects performed ten sets.</p><p>The Global Postural System (GPS400, Chinesport, Italy) was used for this study. The GPS400
measures cervical alignment by tracking changes in posture through body imaging<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The research methodology of Park<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> was used for lateral imaging of the
standing posture of the subjects; based on the New York State Posture Rating Chart, subjects
with more than 1&#x02005;cm deviation from a straight line drawn from the center of the external
acoustic meatus to the acromioclavicular joint were selected for the study.</p><p>A digital infrared thermographic imaging device (IRIS-XP, Medicore, Korea) was used to
measure temperature of the posterior neck. In a test room with an indoor temperature between
20&#x02013;25&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and minimal air flow, subjects waited for 20 minutes before standing about 70&#x02005;cm
from a camera for posterior neck imaging.</p><p>For data analysis, the SPSS statistical package (version 21.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was
used. To compare changes before and after exercise, a paired t-test was used, while an
independent sample t-test was used to compare changes in body temperature between the two
groups after exercise. The level of statistical significance was set to &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the study subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects (N=30)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exp G (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Con G (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1 &#x000b1; 2.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">24.3 &#x000b1; 2.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">174.2 &#x000b1; 4.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175.6 &#x000b1; 6.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.9 &#x000b1; 9.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.5 &#x000b1; 12.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">FHP (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0 &#x000b1; 0.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.8 &#x000b1; 0.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Exp G: Experimental group, Con G: Control group</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

after muscle stretching and strengthening exercises for the neck and shoulders.</p><p>Changes in body temperature appear when there are structural or functional problems in
blood vessels, regional effects such as production of inflammatory mediators, changes in
thermal conduction due to burns or skin ulcers, and other factors inducing an increase of
heat in tissues<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In previous studies, Ahn et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> stated
that thermographic imaging could be used as objective data to evaluate pain levels and
treatment progress, regardless of the cause and onset of diseases, and Kim and Jung<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that thermographic imaging could be
used as an auxiliary diagnostic tool to assess and treat pain triggers. Therefore, in this
study, infrared thermographic changes were measured to identify the effects of exercise.</p><p>According to Yoo<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, pain caused by
turtleneck syndrome can be prevented to a certain extent by easing the muscles and ligaments
of the posterior neck through stretching exercises and correction of posture. Yoo<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> identified a stretching exercise of
pushing the head with a hand as the easiest to follow. In this study, stretching exercises
for the rhomboids and upper trapezius and strengthening exercises for the middle and lower
trapezius were performed.</p><p>Kim and Lee<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that pain was eased
after completing stretching exercise of the neck and shoulders. Kim et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that pain levels in the neck and
shoulders in participants significantly reduced after 8 weeks of stretching exercises. Lee
et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that selective neck
exercise improved high-school student posture and significantly enhanced strength and
endurance of deep flexor muscles. Roddey et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that stretching showed a statistically significant
difference in people with moderate FHP. In the present study, there was a significant
difference in posterior neck temperature between the beginning and end of a 4-week
intervention.</p><p>Therefore, since posterior neck temperature dropped after stretching of the lower
trapezius, these exercises may help improve upper crossed syndrome.</p><p>This study was not able to identify pain reduction, since it involved a small number of
participants who did not exhibit pain within a short span of time. Future research should be
conducted with more participants to evaluate the effects of treatment for six months or
longer.</p><p>The study showed that posterior neck temperature in the test group increased after the
muscle stretching and strengthening exercises, and increased significantly when compared
with the control group.</p><p>In conclusion, muscle-strengthening exercises for the upper and lower trapezius and
stretching exercises for the rhomboids and upper trapezius have a positive impact on upper
crossed syndrome by increasing body temperature. Hence, the findings of this study can be
used to prevent and treat upper crossed syndrome.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Yoo</surname><given-names>WG</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of the neck retraction taping (NRT) on forward head
