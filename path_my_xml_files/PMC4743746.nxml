Cow&#x02019;s milk-based infant formulas are often used to supplement human breast milk or used exclusively in infants whose mothers are not able to provide a human milk diet. However, some infants may require infant formulas with protein sources that are not based on intact cow&#x02019;s milk.</p><p>Approximately 2%&#x02013;3% of infants are allergic or intolerant to cow&#x02019;s milk formula (CMF) and require an alternative formula.<xref rid="b1-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b3-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The manifestations of cow&#x02019;s milk protein allergy (CMPA) can include immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated symptoms, such as angioedema, urticaria, wheezing, rhinitis, vomiting, and eczema, and/or non-IgE-mediated conditions, such as pulmonary hemosiderosis, malabsorption with villous atrophy, eosinophilic proctocolitis, enterocolitis, and esophagitis.<xref rid="b4-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends extensively hydrolyzed formula (EHF) for the dietary management of infants who are allergic or intolerant to intact CMF.<xref rid="b4-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> If the infant does not tolerate an EHF, an amino acid-based infant formula (AAF) would then be recommended.<xref rid="b4-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Reactions to EHF in infants and children with CMPA have been documented,<xref rid="b5-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and it has been estimated that ~10% of children with CMPA may react to EHF.

Secondary objectives included the comparison of length and head circumference, formula tolerance, and adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multicenter clinical trial of two formula groups in parallel conducted at 17 sites throughout the United States. Subjects were healthy, full-term (&#x0003e;37 weeks gestation), exclusively formula-fed infants with birth weights ranging from 2500 to 4500 g whose caregivers had given informed consent to participate in the study. Subjects were 0&#x02013;17 days of age at enrollment. A study visit was required at 14 &#x000b1; 3 days to obtain baseline anthropometric measurements. Therefore, if a subject was enrolled at 10 days of age or younger, s/he was required to return to the study site at 14 &#x000b1; 3 days of age. Exclusion criteria were: congenital illness or malformations that affected infant feeding and/or normal growth, suspected or known allergy to cow&#x02019;s milk protein, significant prenatal and/or postnatal disease, any readmission to hospital (except for hyperbilirubinemia) prior to enrollment, receiving prescription medication (with the exception of topical antibiotics and/or treatment for thrush), or frequent use of over the counter medications except vitamin and mineral supplements.</p><p>Subjects were randomized to either a new AAF with 43% of its fat source from MCT (Test; Nestl&#x000e9; Health Science) or a commercially available AAF with 33% of its fat source from MCT (Control; Nutricia, North America). Both formulas contained all the vitamins and minerals known to be essential for the healthy growth and development of infants. A comparison of the formulas is given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cmped-10-2016-003">Table 1</xref>. The products had identical labels except for the product code number. The identity of the specific product was unknown to subjects, support staff, the statistician, and the investigator.</p><p>Upon enrollment subjects received the assigned study formula as their exclusive source of nutrition until 112 days of life. Study visits were scheduled at 14, 28, 56, 84, and 112 days of life where weight, length, and head circumference were measured. These anthropometric measurements were also compared to the standards of World Health Organization (WHO).<xref rid="b11-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> For two days prior to each study visit, caregivers kept a detailed record in English of formula intake, stool characteristics (frequency recorded per day; consistency as hard, firm, soft, or liquid; color as black, brown, green, or yellow), flatulence (none, rarely, sometimes, or often), spit-up (none, occasional, frequent), vomit (frequency), longest stretch of sleep, and mood of the infant (scale of 1&#x02013;5, with 1 being &#x0201c;happy/content&#x0201d; and 5 being &#x0201c;very irritable&#x0201d;). Adverse events (defined as any untoward occurrence, including any illnesses, signs, or symptoms occurring or worsening, and/or abnormal laboratory findings during the course of the study) were assessed throughout the study. In a subset of 38 infants (<italic>n</italic> = 18 in Test; <italic>n</italic> = 20 in Control), a blood sample was taken at 84 days of life for the analysis of serum albumin and plasma amino acids.</p><p>The first subject was enrolled in June 2012. The last subject completed the study in July 2013. The approval of institutional review board was given by Copernicus Group IRB, and for sites affiliated with medical schools/universities, their respective institutional review boards gave their approval. The study was conducted within the principle of the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were recruited from pediatrician offices and advertisements.

The PP population was defined as subjects who took study formula continuously over the whole treatment period. A break of no longer than three days was accepted to remain in the PP population. In addition, subjects with the following conditions were excluded from the PP population: hospitalization for more than three days and nonexclusive feeding of assigned formula during the first four months of the study. A nonexclusive formula diet is defined as more than one bottle of another formula per week, being off study formula feeding for &#x02265;3 consecutive days, taking 4 or more teaspoons (ie, 20 g) of complementary foods per day, and/or taking more than 3 oz of juice per day.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Population</title><p>Caregivers of 225 subjects gave informed consent for their infants to participate in the study.

A study by Harvey et al.<xref rid="b15-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> used the same formula as the Control formula for the present study, with and without the addition of synbiotics. Unfortunately, the data for the study of Harvey et al are presented not as weight gain in grams/day but as a ratio of the absolute values for the growth parameters between the two groups. As a comparison to non-AAFs, a growth study comparing a partially hydrolyzed 100% whey-based formula with or without probiotics reported daily weight gains of 30.7 g/day in the nonprobiotic group compared to 29.6 g/day in the probiotic group.<xref rid="b16-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In our study, weight gains were reported at 27.99 and 27.3 g/day for the two groups which are numerically lower than that reported in a recent growth study of a non-AAF.</p><p>The weight-for-age <italic>z</italic>-scores according to the WHO growth charts were all below zero for both groups from 14 days of age to 112 days of age, with girls in the Test group being statistically significantly smaller than the Control group at all time points, including birth and 14 days of age, before study formula had even been started. These findings indicate that overall, the subjects included in this study were small according to the WHO reference group and girls in the Test were statistically significantly smaller. When the birth weight of subjects was taken into conside ration in the statistical analysis, no differences were seen between the two groups. Although it cannot be explained why infants, particularly the girls, were smaller in the Test group from the beginning of the study, the differences between the two groups are not seen when birth weight was statistically accounted for. Therefore, differences in weight seen between groups are most likely attributed to the fact that the baby girls randomized to the Test formula were already smaller than those randomized to the Control formula at enrollment. In addition, the values were numerically (but not statistically significant) higher for the Test group for WHO weight-for-length <italic>z</italic>-scores and percentiles between the two groups. This indicates that although the Test group may have been shorter and lighter, when looking at the weights of the subjects in relation to their lengths, the proportions were similar to that of the Control group.</p><p>The dropout rate observed in this study was higher than expected (44% overall) in both groups (Test 47%, Control 40%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Most likely, these high dropout rates could be attributed to the smell and taste of AAFs as compared to standard infant formulas. Similar numbers of subjects in each group dropped out due to &#x0201c;dislike of the formula.&#x0201d; Subjects in this study were healthy infants, with no clinical indication for an AAF. Therefore, the unusual smell/taste could have prompted caregivers to withdraw their infants from the study. In comparison, the dropout rate for the study by Harvey et al.<xref rid="b15-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> was 39.1% and 39% for the amino acid formula group in the study by Borschel et al.<xref rid="b13-cmped-10-2016-003" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, comparing to the overall dropout rate observed in our study. Formula intakes were similar between the two groups, indicating comparable acceptance of the two formulas studied.</p><p>The study population was comprised of healthy infants who would not typically consume AAFs. Whether the differences in weight noted in this study would also occur in intended populations for these types of products (cow&#x02019;s milk allergy, multiple food allergies, eosinophilic esophagitis and gastrointestinal malabsorption) remains unknown. No differences in flatulence, vomit, spit-up, duration of sleep, or mood were observed in this healthy, full-term population. As the main objective of this study was growth during the first months of life when most infants have not yet received complementary foods, long-term effects of the study formula cannot be ascertained from this study. Longer term follow-up controlling for the addition of complementary feeding would be needed to determine any long-term effects of the study formula.</p><p>The main objective of this study was to compare the growth of healthy infants fed exclusively a new AAF to an already commercially available AAF. This study demonstrated that both AAFs supported growth and the new AAF could be another option for infants requiring an AAF. It also provides more objective data on growth anthropometric measurements in an infant population fed an AAF. Serum albumin and plasma amino acid levels for both groups were within normal limits, suggesting that the two formulas provide adequate protein to infants. Using two AAFs in this study made it possible to blind the study. Comparisons of growth of healthy infants fed more standard, routine, intact infant formulas could help determine whether the broader category of AAFs supports growth in the same manner as intact infant formulas. However, as these AAFs are typically used in infants with particular indications, such a study comparing it to a standard infant formula may be irrelevant. Also, such a study would be difficult to blind, as AAFs have a distinct odor and taste that is not similar to intact protein-based infant formulas. Again, further studies of the new AAF in clinically indicated populations are warranted.</p><p>In conclusion, the multicenter four-month trial of Control and Test formula showed similar mean daily weight gain well within 3 g/day of each other. Girls in the Test formula group were smaller than the Control groups, but this difference was seen at birth and baseline before study formula was consumed. When the statistical analysis was performed taking birth weight into consideration, no statistical differences were observed. This study shows that the new AAF supports growth similarly to a commercially available AAF and is another suitable option for infants who may require the use of an AAF.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cmped-10-2016-003"><p><bold>ACADEMIC EDITOR:</bold> Praveen Kumar, Editor in Chief</p></fn><fn id="fn2-cmped-10-2016-003"><p><bold>PEER REVIEW:</bold> Three peer reviewers contributed to the peer review report.
