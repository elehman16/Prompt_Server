Complications resulting from inflammation include increased intraocular pressure, posterior capsular opacification, cystoid macular edema, and decreased visual acuity. Topical steroid therapy effectively treats inflammation, but can increase intraocular pressure, inhibit wound healing, increase the likelihood of infection, or worsen an existing one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co-1-527">Heier et al 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-co-1-527">Simone and Whitacre 2001</xref>). Cataract surgeons have therefore been interested in decreasing dependence on steroid use alone, seeking alternative or complementary treatments for postoperative inflammation that are equally effective but have fewer complications than steroid therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co-1-527">O&#x02019;Brien 2005</xref>). Combination therapy of steroids with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has been shown to produce a synergistic effect on postoperative inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-co-1-527">Flach 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co-1-527">Heier et al 2000</xref>).</p><p>Topical NSAIDs reduce inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis and have been shown to be clinically effective in controlling inflammation after cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co-1-527">Flach et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-co-1-527">Flach et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co-1-527">Heier et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-co-1-527">Simone and Whitacre 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co-1-527">Flach 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co-1-527">Bodaghi et al 2005</xref>). Several clinical studies have shown that NSAIDs are as effective as steroids in the treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co-1-527">Flach et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co-1-527">Brennan et al 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-co-1-527">Simone et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co-1-527">Reddy et al 2000</xref>). The NSAIDs ketorolac 0.5% (Allergan Inc, Acular&#x000ae;, Irvine, CA, USA), diclofenac 0.1% (Novartis Ophthalmics, Voltaren Ophthalmic&#x000ae;, Duluth, GA, USA), and bromfenac 0.09% (ISTA Pharmaceuticals Inc, Xibrom&#x02122;, Irvine, CA, USA) are all available in some markets for the treatment of postoperative inflammation following cataract surgery.</p><p>Pre-operative initiation of NSAID therapy may reduce postoperative inflammation more than when treatment is initiated after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co-1-527">Roberts 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-co-1-527">Solomon et al 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co-1-527">Flach 2002</xref>). Pre-operative regimens may initiate treatment anywhere from 3 days to immediately prior to surgery; regardless, pre-operative treatment with NSAIDs followed by postoperative combination therapy with NSAIDs and steroids has become common practice for the prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation following cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co-1-527">Flach 2002</xref>).</p><p>Nepafenac 0.1% (Alcon Laboratories Inc, Nevanac&#x000ae;, Fort Worth, TX, USA) is a new ophthalmic NSAID and is the only one with a prodrug structure, making it a neutral molecule. This property, unlike the acidic nature of the other topical NSAIDs, allows nepafenac to rapidly penetrate the cornea, after which it is converted by intraocular hydrolases to its more active moiety amfenac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-co-1-527">Ke et al 2000</xref>). Nepafenac is unique, in that its bioconversion to amfenac is targeted to the iris/ciliary body and, to an even greater extent, the retina/choroid, suggesting nepafenac may have prolonged activity in the vascularized tissues of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-co-1-527">Ke et al 2000</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, a rabbit model of paracentesis-induced ocular inflammation demonstrated that nepafenac exhibited a more complete and longer lasting inhibition of iris/ciliary body prostaglandin synthesis than diclofenac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co-1-527">Gamache et al 2000</xref>). The same was true in the posterior segment of the eye, where nepafenac demonstrated superior inhibition of retina/choroid prostaglandin synthesis compared to diclofenac. Taken together, this preclinical evidence suggests that nepafenac would compare favorably to conventional NSAIDs in the prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation associated with cataract surgery.</p><p>This study was designed based on regulatory guidance to compare the effectiveness of nepafenac 0.1% to both placebo and a well-studied NSAID (ketorolac 0.5%) for the prevention and treatment of pain and inflammation following cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co-1-527">Flach et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-co-1-527">Flach et al 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co-1-527">Heier et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-co-1-527">Simone et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-co-1-527">Heier et al 2000</xref>). The primary objective of this study was to compare the effect of nepafenac 0.1% and placebo on anterior segment inflammation at Day 14. All other comparisons of nepafenac 0.1% to ketorolac 0.5% and placebo for the prevention and treatment of postoperative pain and inflammation were performed at all time points. The dosing of the study drugs (three times daily) was congruent with the approved labeling of ketorolac 0.5% in Europe and was the most effective dosing regimen of nepafenac 0.1% demonstrated in a prior clinical study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-co-1-527">Stewart 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Test, active, and control articles</title><p>Nepafenac Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.1% (nepafenac 0.1%) and nepafenac vehicle (placebo) were supplied by Alcon Laboratories, Inc.

The study was approved by the appropriate Institutional Review Boards; patients underwent a process of informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: nepafenac 0.1%, ketorolac 0.5%, or placebo. Patients instilled 1 drop 3 times daily beginning 1 day before surgery, continuing on the day of surgery, and for 21 days thereafter. Additional medication was not dispensed unless the investigator declared a patient to be a treatment failure, at which time the patient was discontinued from the study. Treatment failure was defined as a patient presenting at any postoperative visit with more than 15 cells, very dense flare, or investigator-assessed ocular pain score of grade 4 or 5 on a 6-point ordered categorical scale from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). Patients were considered cured if the sum of their aqueous cells and flare ratings was 0 (ie, absence of cells and flare) at the current and all subsequent study visits. Clinical success was defined as an aqueous cells rating of 0 (none) or 1 (1&#x02013;5 cells) and an aqueous flare rating of 0 (none) at the current and all subsequent study visits.</p><p>Postoperative examinations were conducted on Days 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28; patients were required to have received a dose of their test article within 1&#x02013;4 hours of each visit, except at Day 28 (the test article was stopped at Day 21). At the Day 7 visit, patients received dosing at the study site, after which the patients rated ocular discomfort on a 5-point scale from 0 (none) to 4 (severe).</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Eligible patients were those who were 18 years or older, in need of cataract extraction by phacoemulsification and implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens (IOL), and who met all informed consent requirements.

All 227 patients received at least one dose of study medication and were therefore included in the safety analysis. Patients who received study medication, completed cataract surgery, and had at least one follow-up visit were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which accounted for 225 of the 227 patients enrolled in the study.</p><p>Patient demographics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-co-1-527">Table 1</xref>. The mean age of the total population was 72 years, with ages ranging from 42 to 90. Forty percent of patients were male and over 96% were Caucasian. The groups were statistically equivalent with regard to age, gender, race and difficulty of cataract surgery.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-co-1-527">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the cure rates of nepafenac 0.1% and placebo at Day 14, the primary endpoint of this study. Significantly more patients treated with nepafenac 0.1% were cured compared to those treated with placebo (76.3% vs 59.2%, p = 0.0241). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-co-1-527">Figure 2</xref> shows the cure rates of all 3 treatment groups across all postoperative visits. Although the nepafenac group had a higher cure rate than the placebo group from Day 3 onward, only the Day 14 visit reached statistical significance (p = 0.0241). No significant difference in cure rates between the nepafenac and ketorolac groups was observed at any time point.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-co-1-527">Figure 3</xref>, significantly more patients achieved clinical success with nepafenac 0.1% than with placebo beginning on Day 7 and continuing through Day 28 (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The clinical success rate of nepafenac 0.1% was superior to that of ketorolac 0.5% at Day 14 (p = 0.0319). At other time points, the clinical successes of nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5% were not statistically different.</p><p>The percentage of patients with no ocular pain was significantly higher in the nepafenac 0.1% group compared to the placebo group at each time point starting with Day 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-co-1-527">Figure 4</xref>, p &#x0003c; 0.05). Furthermore, more patients treated with nepafenac 0.1% were pain-free compared to those treated with ketorolac 0.5% at Day 3 (p = 0.0366). At other time points, the percent of patients with no ocular pain was not statistically different between the nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5% groups.</p><p>At the Day 7 visit only, patients evaluated the ocular discomfort of the study medication. Mean ocular discomfort was significantly lower for nepafenac 0.1% compared to ketorolac 0.5% (p = 0.0158) but not to placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5-co-1-527">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>All 227 patients who were enrolled in the study received at least one dose of study drug and were therefore included in the safety analysis. Two serious adverse events (hospitalizations due to diabetes mellitus and a branch retinal vein occlusion) were reported, both of which were unrelated to the use of study medication. Adverse events in the overall safety population were predominantly mild or moderate in intensity, and generally did not interrupt patient continuation in the study. The most frequent treatment-related adverse event with nepafenac 0.1% was eyelid margin crusting (2.6%); no eyelid margin crusting was reported with ketorolac 0.5% or placebo. For patients treated with ketorolac 0.5% or placebo, ocular hyperemia was the most frequent adverse event (2.7% and 5.2%, respectively), whereas the nepafenac group did not experience ocular hyperemia. No clinically relevant differences were observed between the treatment groups in the overall safety population. No safety concerns were identified for intraocular pressure, visual acuity, ocular signs (corneal edema, bulbar conjunctival injection, and chemosis), or dilated fundus parameters based upon an analysis of changes from baseline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Nepafenac 0.1% is the newest topical NSAID available for the treatment of ocular pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery. It has unique properties, including rapid corneal permeability and targeted intraocular activation due to its prodrug structure.</p><p>As expected from previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-co-1-527">Stewart 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co-1-527">Lane et al 2007</xref>), nepafenac 0.1% met its primary objective in the current study by demonstrating superiority over placebo in the percentage of patients with clinical cures at Day 14. In addition, nepafenac 0.1% produced more clinical successes than placebo at every time point beginning with Day 7. This confirms that nepafenac 0.1% is effective in the prevention and treatment of ocular inflammation. Nepafenac 0.1% was also superior to placebo in the management of pain, as shown by the fact that significantly more patients treated with nepafenac 0.1% were pain-free at every time point after Day 1. By Day 14, over 90% of patients treated with nepafenac 0.1% reported no pain, suggesting that this drug is highly effective in the treatment of pain related to cataract surgery. In fact, nepafenac has shown analgesic efficacy in PRK-related ocular pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co-1-527">Colin and Paquette 2006</xref>).</p><p>Most interesting, however, is the comparison between nepafenac 0.1% and ketorolac 0.5%. Previous studies have established the effectiveness of ketorolac 0.5% for the treatment of both pain and inflammation following cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co-1-527">Flach et al 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co-1-527">Flach et al 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co-1-527">Heier et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-co-1-527">Simone et al 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-co-1-527">Solomon et al 2001</xref>). Therefore, ketorolac 0.5% was used as a benchmark against which the efficacy of nepafenac 0.1% was measured. The current study was not powered to detect the superiority of nepafenac 0.1% relative to ketorolac 0.5%. Despite this fact, nepafenac 0.1% reached statistical superiority compared to ketorolac 0.5% in both clinical success rate at Day 14 and pain assessment at Day 3. This illustrates the robust nature of the data and indicates that nepafenac 0.1% is an effective and safe drug in treating ocular inflammation.</p><p>Ocular comfort of any topical medication is important, as this factor may have implications for patient compliance. In this study, the mean ocular discomfort score of nepafenac 0.1% was statistically lower than the mean score for ketorolac 0.5%, showing that patients judged nepafenac to be more comfortable upon instillation. At least two reasons could contribute to this difference. First, there may simply be molecular differences between nepafenac and ketorolac that result in the increased ocular comfort of nepafenac. Another possible explanation is that nepafenac 0.1% is formulated as a suspension whereas ketorolac 0.5% is a solution. Because of the discomfort associated with the instillation of ketorolac 0.5%, a less concentrated form (0.4%) has been developed to reduce patient complaints of stinging and burning. In clinical trials with ketorolac 0.5%, up to 40% of patients reported stinging and burning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co-1-527">Acular package insert 2002</xref>). However, in clinical trials with ketorolac 0.4%, a similar number of patients (20%&#x02013;40%) complained of stinging and burning upon instillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-co-1-527">Acular LS package insert 2003</xref>). In the only head-to-head trial of these 2 agents in patients undergoing cataract surgery, ketorolac 0.4% significantly reduced stinging and burning compared to ketorolac 0.5% at Day 1 (20% vs 65%, p = 0.001), but not at Week 1 (50% vs 40%) or Month 1 (30% vs 40%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-co-1-527">Sandoval et al 2006</xref>).</p><p>This study demonstrates that nepafenac 0.1% is superior to placebo for the prevention and treatment of ocular pain and inflammation resulting from cataract surgery. Nepafenac also shows at least equal efficacy (for both ocular pain and inflammation measures) compared to ketorolac 0.5%. Moreover, nepafenac 0.1% is more comfortable upon instillation than ketorolac 0.5%.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Members of the Internacional C-04-65 Study Group: A Brezin, Hopital Cochin, Paris; B Cochener, CHU Morvan, Brest; P Rozot, Clinique Monticelli, Marseille; L Vissac, H&#x000f4;pital Purpan, Toulouse; FRANCE.
