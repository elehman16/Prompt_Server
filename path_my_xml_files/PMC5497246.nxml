The primary goals of OP-CR include reduction of modifiable risk factors as well as increasing functional capacity and quality of life. Outpatient CR is recommended by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology Guidelines for a number of diagnoses including myocardial infarction (MI), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In 2014, OP-CR services were approved for patients with systolic HF by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Among the numerous benefits, evidence has demonstrated that OP-CR reduces mortality by 12% to 34% <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>While the benefits of OP-CR are well documented, certain challenges remain. Outpatient-CR is underutilized with estimates of eligible patients participating ranging from 14&#x02013;31% <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> to 80.7% for patients with myocardial infarction <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Barriers to participation are numerous and include factors such as a patient's difficulty in attending OP-CR sessions <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Long-term adherence to risk factor modification and a healthier lifestyle for those participating in OP-CR is also a challenge for a significant number of patients. Conversely, it is well documented that patients who complete more OP-CR sessions have better outcomes compared to those who complete fewer sessions <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. This finding highlights the importance of continued communication and engagement with participating patients. Given the present OP-CR model struggles with certain issues including attendance and long-term compliance, consideration of a paradigm shift aimed at improving outcomes seems warranted. In fact, a recent AHA Presidential Advisory called for a reengineering of OP-CR to enhance access, adherence, and effectiveness <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The current study assesses the ability of mobile technology to improve compliance with healthy lifestyle behaviors in patients participating in OP-CR.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0030"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>The current study is a retrospective analysis on all patients enrolled in the OP-CR at the University of Iowa from July 12, 2011 through December 31, 2012 (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;237) comparing those who voluntarily enrolled (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;52) (Tx) to those who declined to enroll (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;185) (NTx) in a text-messaging program on admission to OP-CR.

All tests were repeated on the final session of OP-CR as well as at three-month follow-up. All patients were weighed on each visit with height checked on the first visit in order to determine the body mass index (BMI). All patients had lipids evaluated four to six weeks post event and as ordered throughout the OP-CR program. Patients were encouraged to complete 36 sessions. Indigent patients on a special state program were allowed only six sessions. All participants met with the registered dietitian and stress management counselor and were strongly encouraged to attend all patient education classes, offered before or after their exercise sessions, including stress management, dietary modification, medication and other treatment modalities, and pathophysiology of heart disease.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.3</label><title>Text messaging program</title><p>Text messages were sent three to five times per week and consisted of heart-healthy tips, requests for weight and BP input, minutes of exercise per day, and medication adherence.

Mobile phones are the most commonly used form of technology worldwide and have the potential to influence large populations <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In many high-income countries, the number of mobile phone subscriptions outstrips the population <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In low-income countries, mobile communication is the fastest growing sector of the communication network and the coverage, geographically, is high <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Moreover, in recent years, the world has experienced a significant expansion of internet availability and use, becoming a popular means of delivering interventions useful in health promotion as well as the treatment of non-communicable diseases <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The use of these technologies is able to influence health behaviors in real time <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> to a wide segment of the population <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>The impact of a mobile application on health outcomes must include participation in OP-CR sessions <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, physical activity, exercise capacity, cardiovascular risk factors, patient-reported health status <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and other factors. OP-CR is a mode of disease management and several studies have investigated the use of mobile technologies in disease management, but not specifically OP-CR. A meta-analysis of 59 trials investigating the use of mobile technologies to improve disease management and 26 trials that investigated the use of mobile technologies to change health behaviors found that text messaging interventions increased adherence to smoking cessation and antiretroviral therapy. All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Seventeen trials aimed to increase physical activity and/or reduce caloric intake <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Optimal treatment of chronic disease requires involvement of patients in managing their disease and their deciding whether to adhere to prescribed treatment and when to seek healthcare <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The mobile technologies are a means of providing this individualized support to patients to increase healthy behavior and improve disease management <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies to date have been reported on the use of mobile technology exclusively for patients with coronary heart disease, which generally encompass an older population. Furthermore, no research has been published to date about mobile health interventions to promote medication adherence among acutely ill patients who were recruited from a hospital setting. The potential for mobile phone use in health care is currently being defined and remains a significant opportunity for research. We are not suggesting that mobile applications replace traditional OP-CR services. Rather, the impact of a mobile application on health outcomes enhances outcomes and compliance associated with participation in traditional OP-CR <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>5</label><title>Limitations</title><p>The current study was a retrospective analysis of a cohort undergoing standard clinical care.
