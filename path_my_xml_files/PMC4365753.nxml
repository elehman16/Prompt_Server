Whether natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody shown to reduce disease activity in relapsing&#x02212;remitting multiple sclerosis, could impact ambulation performance was examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective open-label study, TIMER, was conducted in natalizumab-naive patients (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>215). The timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) and timed 100-m walk (T100MW) were assessed at baseline and at weeks 24 and 48 of natalizumab therapy, together with Expanded Disability Status Scale scores. The effects of natalizumab on T25FW performance were also examined in a retrospective analysis of natalizumab-treated patients (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>627) and placebo control patients (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>315) from the AFFIRM study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In TIMER, a significant increase from baseline in T25FW speed was seen at week 24 (<italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.0074) and in T100MW speed at weeks 24 and 48 (both <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.001).

In this respect, 70% of patients with walking difficulty state that it is the most challenging aspect of their MS <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>Accurate assessment of ambulation is essential for estimating disease burden in MS and for evaluating the efficacy of disease-modifying therapies. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), which is widely used to assess disability in MS, relies on measures or estimates of maximum walking distance (MWD) to quantify the walking component of physical disability. Ambulation can also be measured objectively with tests such as the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW) <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or the timed 100-m walk (T100MW) <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>Natalizumab (Tysabri, Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, USA) is an &#x003b1;4-integrin antagonist that interferes with the migration of immune cells into the central nervous system <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In the phase III AFFIRM trial in relapsing&#x02212;remitting MS (RRMS), natalizumab monotherapy reduced annualized relapse rates by 68% and also reduced the risk of disability progression, as measured by EDSS, by 42%&#x02013;54% over 2&#x000a0;years versus placebo <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Natalizumab has also been shown to improve disability <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and to increase the proportion of patients with no evidence of clinical or magnetic resonance imaging disease activity <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>The findings from an open-label, non-randomized, prospective study that was performed to determine whether natalizumab improves ambulatory measures in RRMS (TIMER) are reported. Changes in walking capacity were measured using the T25FW and T100MW and by asking patients to estimate their MWD, over 48&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with natalizumab.

Patients were natalizumab-naive men and women aged 18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years inclusive, with an EDSS score &#x02264;5.5 at baseline, and who were able to walk at least 100&#x000a0;m without assistive devices. Symptoms had to be stable for &#x02265;30&#x000a0;days prior to enrollment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included the onset of a relapse within 50&#x000a0;days prior to the first natalizumab infusion and the presence of walking impairment due to any cause other than MS. Patients with a history of malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus infection, organ transplantation or a clinically significant infectious disease were excluded, as were patients who had been treated with immunosuppressant medications within 6&#x000a0;months prior to screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Neurological evaluation, MWD (reported), EDSS, T25FW (completed twice) and T100MW were performed in that order (with a 5-min rest after the T25FW) at baseline, week 24 and week 48.

Natalizumab also produced clinically meaningful and consistent improvements in T25FW speeds in 13% of patients in TIMER at 48&#x000a0;weeks and in 12% of patients in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of AFFIRM at 2&#x000a0;years. These improvements in T25FW speeds in AFFIRM represented a statistically significant 78% improvement versus placebo at 2&#x000a0;years. Furthermore, the improvements in T25FW speeds in AFFIRM were associated with significant improvement in the physical components of quality of life.</p><p>Our finding that natalizumab can improve walking performance in some patients is generally consistent with previous <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses and retrospective observational studies. Natalizumab, either alone or in combination with interferon beta (IFN-beta), was shown to increase the number of T25FW responders &#x02013; defined as patients who walked faster in the majority of post-baseline evaluations than in their best baseline performance &#x02013; in the AFFIRM and SENTINEL trials <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. In that analysis, approximately 15%&#x02013;25% of natalizumab-treated patients were classified as T25FW responders, although the beneficial effects of natalizumab only reached significance in patients with higher levels of disability. In a retrospective observational study of 45 patients who began natalizumab therapy after experiencing &#x02265;1 relapse with IFN-beta or glatiramer acetate, 38% showed clinically significant improvement on the T25FW, and 23% on the T100MW, after 11&#x000a0;months of follow-up <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Natalizumab also significantly impro-ved the performance of MS patients in an alternative measure of walking ability, the 6-min walk test <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><p>A significant correlation was found between performances on the T25FW and T100MW. However, in the TIMER study, the T100MW was more sensitive than the T25FW to the effects of natalizumab; the mean increase in walking speed at week 48 was significant only for T100MW with a greater proportion of patients showing &#x02265;20% improvement in this test. Additionally, the T100MW revealed clinically meaningful improvements in walking in a greater proportion of patients with unchanged EDSS scores than the T25FW, suggesting that the T100MW may be more sensitive to improvements in walking capacity that do not result in changes in EDSS. Moreover, a greater proportion of patients with baseline EDSS scores of 4.5&#x02013;5.5 showed a clinically meaningful improvement on the T100MW than on the T25FW. These findings are similar to results obtained in an earlier study in which the T100MW was compared with T25FW in 141 MS patients and 104 healthy control patients <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Small differences were seen in variability, reliability and correlation with MWD, with the differences favoring the T100MW <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>An improvement in performance of &#x02265;20% on the T25FW has been shown to be clinically meaningful <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The fact that many patients with this level of improvement did not show a corresponding reduction in EDSS score in TIMER or AFFIRM suggests that the T25FW may be more sensitive to clinically meaningful changes in ambulatory functioning than EDSS scores alone. This has been suggested previously in progressive MS <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and indeed early changes in T25FW performance were also better than early changes in EDSS score at predicting later self-reported disease impact in patients with progressive disease <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>A limitation of TIMER is that it was an open-label study, which may limit the interpretation of the results. However, reassuringly, similar results were demonstrated in a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of data from the placebo-controlled AFFIRM trial. The TIMER and AFFIRM studies were also relatively short term, and further data are needed to determine whether the beneficial effects observed with natalizumab would be maintained over the longer term.</p><p>In summary, TIMER revealed a significant improvement in ambulation, as measured by the T25FW and the T100MW, in natalizumab-treated patients with RRMS. A significant improvement relative to placebo was also seen in natalizumab-treated patients in the pivotal AFFIRM trial. The results of TIMER suggest that the T100MW may represent a more sensitive test of walking capacity than the T25FW, whilst both tests may be able to detect clinically meaningful improvements in functioning not reflected by changes in EDSS score.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support was funded by Biogen Idec Inc.; Ryan Woodrow and Susan Denner (Infusion Communications) provided writing support, and Jackie Cannon (Infusion Communications) copyedited and styled the manuscript.
