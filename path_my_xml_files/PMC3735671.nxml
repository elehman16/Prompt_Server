During breeding through pregnancy diagnosis (&#x0223c;33 d post-breeding) ewes were fed a diet (2.04 kg/ewe daily) consisting of 47% alfalfa hay, 20% corn, 20% sugar beet pulp pellets, 8% malt barley straw, and 5% concentrated separator by product (DM basis).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-nmi-6-2013-011">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nmi-6-2013-011">18</xref> Eighty-two pregnant ewes (40 and 42 ewes in the ASe and HSe treatments groups, respectively) were identified and shipped (1,544 km; &#x0223c;14 h) to the Animal Nutrition and Physiology Center at NDSU for experiments.</p><p>Upon arrival at NDSU, ewes remained on their assigned Se treatments and were individually housed in 0.91 &#x000d7; 1.2-m pens in a temperature-controlled (12&#x000b0;C) and ventilated facility for the duration of the study. Lighting within the facility was automatically timed to mimic daylight patterns.

Supply of ME required per ewe was then adjusted by adding or subtracting 0.0198 Mcal of ME/kg of BW above or below the initial 60-kg BW target.

Female lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes had an increased thyroid weight compared to female lambs from HSe-HIGH ewes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Moreover, female lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes tended to have larger thyroids than male lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07). When thyroid weight was divided by empty body weight (g/kg), female lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes had increased mass compared to female lambs from HSe-HIGH ewes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Moreover, female lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes had larger relative thyroid mass (g/kg) than male lambs from ASe-HIGH ewes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04). In lambs from HSe-CON ewes, females had a larger (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) relative thyroid mass compared to males.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that the maternal plane of nutrition and supranutritional Se supplementation does not impact cortisol, T<sub>3</sub>, or T<sub>4</sub> concentrations immediately at birth. Due to the extremely high concentrations of cortisol at birth, no maternal dietary effects were observed. However, by 24 h, an interaction between Se and maternal nutrition was observed. Maternal undernutrition increased cortisol production in newborn lambs by more than in controls in ASe ewes. In lambs from dams fed HSe, cortisol concentrations were greater in lambs from CON-fed compared with undernourished dams. Overnutrition did not influence cortisol by 24 h in newborn lambs. After 24 h, cortisol concentrations were not influenced by maternal diet or sex of the offspring.</p><p>Observed changes in cortisol concentrations over time can most likely be explained by lamb development and maturation. Since cortisol is necessary for proper organ development, particularly lung development, high concentrations should be present at birth. However, prolonged elevated levels of cortisol have deleterious effects, and therefore a decrease in cortisol concentrations is crucial for proper growth, protection of developing tissues, and maintenance of a healthy immune system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-nmi-6-2013-011">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-nmi-6-2013-011">24</xref> After being &#x0201c;weaned&#x0201d; from teat bucket units, all lambs were introduced to more solid food. This alteration in diet may have caused the increase in cortisol from d 57 to 78.</p><p>Since thyroid hormones are also important for proper development and can be deleterious when chronically elevated, it is not surprising that the biologically relevant form of the hormone, T<sub>3</sub>, followed a similar pattern to cortisol concentrations as the lambs grew. Selenium is known to participate in the conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-nmi-6-2013-011">24</xref> through selenoprotein type 1 iodothyronine 5-deiodinase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-nmi-6-2013-011">25</xref> In this study, we observed increases in T<sub>4</sub> concentrations in lambs from HSe ewes consuming similar diets as ASe ewes during early life (d 7 to 21). Interestingly, T<sub>3</sub> concentrations were not influenced by Se supplementation. Previous studies have reported that thyroid hormone concentrations from fetuses are reduced during hypoxemic conditions associated with IUGR. DeBlasio et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-nmi-6-2013-011">26</xref> suggested that placental restriction and small body size at birth may increase activation of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> and sensitivity of soft tissue to thyroid hormones, which may contribute to the accelerated offspring growth following IUGR pregnancies. We previously reported maternal Se supplementation did not impact birth weight or placental weight; however, both RES-fed and HIGH-fed ewes had lighter lambs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nmi-6-2013-011">18</xref> Moreover, we reported that lambs from HIGH-fed ewes generally have decreased cotyledonary weight compared to RES-fed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-nmi-6-2013-011">18</xref> Concentrations of T<sub>3</sub> were unaffected, although T<sub>4</sub> concentrations differed by maternal Se supplementation, plane of nutrition, and sex of the offspring. This indicates that the conversion to T<sub>3</sub> was not affected. Moreover, compensatory growth in our lighter lambs at birth may have been due to enhanced conversion of T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub>, allowing for similar weights at 180 d of age. Females from RES-fed ewes may have been experiencing a period of compensatory growth possibly due to IUGR. Additionally, these females had the lowest birth weights, supporting this hypothesis since IUGR can be characterized by restriction in fetal growth due to an insufficient placenta, resulting in low birth weights, and altered postnatal growth.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-nmi-6-2013-011">26</xref> The pattern of growth for all males was also interesting, but unfortunately not as easy to address.</p><p>Lastly, it would have been ideal if individual feed intake of each lamb was measured. Having individual feed intake would have allowed us to more accurately conclude the mechanisms for differences observed in endocrine profiles and rate of gain. Modification of feeding behavior is highly likely, as others have reported that maternal diet can impact this.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-nmi-6-2013-011">27</xref> However, since we were managing all lambs independent of the dam throughout the experiment, it was not logistically feasible to collect that data in this current study. However, feed intake is an important measurement that should be assessed in future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, maternal nutrition during pregnancy alone impacts endocrine patterns in the offspring. Maternal Se supplementation and plane of nutrition can influence multiple parameters of lamb development. There was minimal influence of treatments on cortisol and T<sub>3</sub> production over the offspring&#x02019;s lifespan. While there were few differences in these hormone concentrations, it remains beneficial to monitor growth and development throughout life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Bret Taylor at the USDA-ARS Sheep Experiment Station for his involvement in the project and members of the Reproductive Physiology and Ruminant Nutrition laboratories for their assistance with animal care and data collection.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Funding</bold></p><p>This project was partially supported by National Research Initiative Competitive Grants (no. 2005-35206-15281) from the USDA Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service to JSC, DAR, and KAV and by a Leap Grant to KAV sponsored by National Science Foundation ADVANCE Institutional Transformation Award (HRD-0811239).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Author Contributions</bold></p><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: KAV, LPR, CJH, DAR, JSC.
