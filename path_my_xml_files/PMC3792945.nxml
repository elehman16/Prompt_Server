During the past decade, both intraocular lens (IOL) design and materials have advanced substantially,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-7-1905">1</xref> resulting in improved visual function and fewer complications. One development is that of a novel, hydrophobic acrylic polymer, which has been tested and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the form of a three-piece lens (XACT X-60/X-70; Advanced Vision Science, Goleta, CA, USA). More recently, the MX60 IOL (enVista model MX60; Bausch &#x00026; Lomb, Rochester, NY, USA) was introduced, in which both the optic and haptics are formed from the same hydrophobic acrylic polymer. In 2012, the MX60, a glistening-free lens, was approved by the FDA as a single-piece hydrophobic acrylic IOL. This paper presents the FDA clinical trial results investigating this lens.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a prospective case series evaluating primary safety and efficacy of a new IOL conducted at six sites in the US (NCT01230060). Planned enrollment was up to 125 eyes of 125 subjects. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by a governing institutional review board prior to initiation of the study at each center. The board operated in accordance with the principles and requirements described in US 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 56.</p><p>The primary safety end point of this study was the occurrence of adverse events (AEs), described in terms of statistical incidence rates. The primary effectiveness end point was the percentage of subjects achieving best-corrected distance visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or better at visit four (120&#x02013;180 days postoperatively). Although the study involved no formal secondary objectives for claims of safety or effectiveness, other effectiveness outcomes studied included rotational stability and manifest refraction stability. In addition, other variables were explored to understand fully the success of the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Adult subjects with clinically documented diagnoses of age-related cataracts amenable to treatment with standard phacoemulsification/extracapsular cataract extraction with otherwise clear ocular media were enrolled in this study. Additionally, subjects needed to have met the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-7-1905">Table 1</xref>. Only one eye of each patient was eligible for inclusion in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Lens material and design features</title><p>The MX60 lens optic and haptics are composed of a hydroxyethyl methacrylate-polyethylene glycol phenyl ether acrylate&#x02013;styrene copolymer, cross-linked with ethylene glycol dimethacrylate. This material has an ultraviolet-absorbing chromophore. Surface-energy and contact-angle measurements have demonstrated that the IOL material is a true hydrophobic polymer, with water contact-angle values comparable with those of other hydrophobic acrylic IOLs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-7-1905">2</xref></p><p>The surface hardness of the material is 11.0 MPa, which compares favorably with the 0.24, 0.68, and 0.43 found for AcrySof (Alcon Laboratories, Fort Worth, TX, USA), Acryfold (Hoya, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and Sensar (Abbott Medical Optics, Abbott Park, IL, USA) lens materials, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-opth-7-1905">3</xref> The relatively greater surface hardness and rigidity of the material results in a less compliant lens that is relatively impervious to scratching and deformation. The reduced compliance also results in a requirement for greater force in folding the lens for insertion into the injection cartridge. Of note, the rigidity of the material is highly temperature-sensitive, so a slightly warmer lens will fold more easily. The low compliance of the material carries implications for the design of suitable injection devices for this lens. The design and surface characteristics of the cartridge and plunger must take into account the characteristics of the lens material. The enVista MX60 IOL has been validated with the INJ100 injector (Bausch &#x00026; Lomb), which has the same cartridge-tip dimensions as the Monarch D cartridge (Alcon Laboratories). As with all IOLs, the material characteristics and design of the injector result in a range of appropriate incision sizes. The optimal incision size will also depend on the surgical technique (eg, a smaller incision with a wound-assist technique).</p><p>The biconvex lens optic has a body diameter of 6.0 mm and an overall length (diameter) of 12.5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-7-1905">Figure 1A</xref>). The MX60 IOL has aberration-free aspheric optics and modified C-loop haptics. The optic and haptics are lathed and milled from a single button made from the proprietary soft hydrophobic acrylic polymer. Lens power is uniform from center to edge, with enhanced contrast sensitivity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-opth-7-1905">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-7-1905">6</xref> It has a sharp 360&#x000b0; square posterior edge, which is intended to minimize posterior capsule opacification (PCO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-7-1905">Figure 1B</xref>).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-opth-7-1905">7</xref> The haptics contain fenestrations to prevent transfer of stresses from the haptic to the optic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study procedures</title><p>Eligible subjects who provided written informed consent underwent a preoperative visit (up to 60 days before surgery), the operative visit (day 0), and four postoperative visits (visit one, 1&#x02013;2 days postoperatively; visit two, 7&#x02013;14 days; visit three, 30&#x02013;60 days; and visit four, 120&#x02013;180 days). The preoperative visit included determinations of keratometry, axial length, pupil diameter, target postoperative refraction, and IOL power. On the day of surgery, eligibility was reconfirmed and subjects were randomized (1:1:1:1) to have the lens implanted in one of four axis positions (45&#x000b0;, 90&#x000b0;, 135&#x000b0;, or 180&#x000b0;) to evaluate subsequent rotational stability. Study lenses were available in powers ranging from 16.5 D to 24.0 D in 0.5 D increments. The estimated A-constant for the IOL Master (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA, USA) was 119.1, with an anterior chamber depth of 5.38 mm.</p><p>Postoperative assessments included evaluation of BCVA, manifest refraction, rotational stability of the lens, optic tilt and decentration, IOL glistenings grade, evaluation of PCO (EPCO) score, and monitoring for AEs. Details on selected measurements are described as follows.</p><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>AEs were recorded, rated as to severity and relationship to the device, and compared with FDA historical control values, as per an FDA draft guidance document<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-1905">8</xref> (FDA historical controls).</p></sec><sec><title>Rotational stability</title><p>Rotational stability was assessed by an independent third party using the method described by Wolffsohn and Buckhurst,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-7-1905">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-7-1905">10</xref> with digitally captured images. A line is drawn connecting the IOL orientation marks to document the alignment of these markings.

The density of opacification is graded on a scale of 0 to 4 (0 = none, 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, 4 = severe). The individual EPCO score is calculated by multiplying the opacification grade by the fraction of capsule area involved behind the IOL optic.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluation of glistenings</title><p>Glistenings, which are fluid-filled microvacuoles that form within the IOL optic when in an aqueous environment,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-1905">13</xref> were evaluated via retroillumination slit-lamp examination using a photographic grading scale. The grading scale was, in order of severity, none, trace, mild, moderate, severe, and very severe.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods and analyses</title><p>The analysis cohorts included the safety, best-case, and consistent sets. All subjects comprised the safety set. The best-case set, as defined by the International Organization for Standardization 11979-1,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-opth-7-1905">14</xref> consisted of those subjects with no major protocol violations, preoperative ocular pathology, macular degeneration at any time, or previous refractive surgery. The main effectiveness outcomes were derived from the best-case set. The consistent set was comprised of subjects with no major protocol violations who had data at every follow-up visit.</p><p>As the primary safety end point, AEs were described as incidence rates. As the primary effectiveness variable, Snellen values for BCVA were summarized categorically at each visit. The proportion of eyes with a BCVA of 20/40 or better at visit four (with 95% confidence intervals) was compared with FDA historical controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-1905">8</xref> using an exact binomial test. Manifest refraction, lens rotation, decentration, tilt, PCO, and glistenings were captured as categorical variables and tabulated at specific visits. Where statistical tests for significance were performed, a significance level of 0.05 was adopted. All tests were two-sided unless otherwise specified.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographics</title><p>Demographic data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-7-1905">Table 2</xref>.

The second subject, who was also the only patient (0.8%) observed as having a persistent AE of cystoid macular edema, achieved a BCVA of 20/20 at visit four. The study met the primary safety end point, as the rate of FDA-defined cumulative and persistent AEs through visit four were statistically at or below FDA historical controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.884 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.455, respectively).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-opth-7-1905">8</xref> Other ocular AEs were of the type and frequency generally observed in patients who have had cataract surgery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-opth-7-1905">Table 3</xref>).

The mean tilt and decentration values closely agree with expectations based on results in peer-reviewed literature for small-incision cataract surgery with in-the-bag IOL placement and capsulorhexis completely overlying the optic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-opth-7-1905">16</xref> Rotational stability for the MX60 IOL was demonstrated, with 100% of subjects exhibiting &#x02264;5&#x000b0; of rotation, exceeding the ANSI standard for toric IOLs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-opth-7-1905">15</xref> In a study investigating the AcrySof IQ Toric IOL (model SA60TT; Alcon Laboratories), approximately 90% of eyes achieved rotation of &#x02264;5&#x000b0; at 120&#x02013;180 days postprocedure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-7-1905">17</xref> The MX60 also demonstrated excellent refractive stability over time. This IOL is designed to maximize the haptic contact angle under compression, preventing ovalization and/or striae of the capsular bag. This achieves better refractive stability, centration, and rotational stability, and ensures that each lens power across the range behaves similarly under compression. These data provide a promising basis on which to develop a toric lens of this material and general design.</p><p>The low EPCO score of 0.03 and the excellent outcomes reported during this study may be attributed to the IOL design. The MX60 features step-vaulted haptics that translate the optic posteriorly for direct contact with the capsular bag, in addition to a sharp 360&#x000b0; square barrier edge to inhibit lens epithelial cell migration. The limited duration of this study may be a factor in long-term assessment of the incidence of PCO.</p><p>Although the evaluation of glistenings was not included as an end point in this study, this phenomenon was evaluated. A meta-analysis of published literature on glistenings describes them in association with hydrophobic acrylic IOLs, but the hydrophobic acrylic IOLs on the market are not manufactured from the same material and by the same manufacturing process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-1905">13</xref> In the study reported here, no glistenings of any grade were reported by any subject at any visit. This is consistent with results from a prospective study investigating the XACT (X60; Advanced Vision Science) IOL, a three-piece lens made of the same material as the MX60. In this study, 172 eyes of 142 patients were examined at least once between 1 month and 6 months; 123 eyes of 101 patients were examined at least once between 6 months and 2 years. With this material, no glistenings were detected at any time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-7-1905">18</xref></p><p>The results of this current study stand in contrast to investigations involving other hydrophobic acrylic IOLs, which report that glistenings appear to increase in severity with time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-opth-7-1905">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-opth-7-1905">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-7-1905">21</xref> The MX60 lens itself is packaged in physiologic saline to eliminate fluid exchange with the aqueous humor. Prehydration of the MX60 lens to equilibrium water content ensures that it remains glistening-free.
