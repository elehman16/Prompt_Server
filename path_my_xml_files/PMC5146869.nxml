However, inappropriate infusion or poor drainage both can lead to significantly increased renal pelvic pressure, resulting in renal damage at various degrees, liquid reflux or extravasation, infection spread, urosepsis, or infectious shock. Patients undergo surgeries for complicated stones with pyonephrosis are more liable to worsening infection and urosepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. We designed a patented system with suctioning ability to facilitate minimally invasive PCNL (MPCNL). This patented system was found to be safe and highly efficient in managing renal stones in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, we did not know the success and complication rates of our MPCNLs in treating renal calculus complicated by pyonephrosis by one surgery. In this study, we performed one-stage MPCNLs using a self-designed and patented suctioning lithotripsy sheath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] (thereafter referred to as the patent sheath, see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) in treating renal and upper ureteral calculi complicated by pyonephrosis in 91 cases to clear stone by one surgery, avoided two stage surgeries including first-stage percutaneous nephrostomy and second-stage stone lithotripsy. We thus reported the outcome as below.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Patented suctioning lithotripsy sheath</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12894_2016_184_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Patients in the observation group underwent patented sheath assisted MPCNL. Patients in the control group were treated using traditional MPCNL without the assistance of the patented sheath but peel-away sheath. Patients in both groups were administered antibiotic pre and post surgery. The patient was first placed in a lithotomy position. A 5&#x000a0;F ureteral catheter was then inserted retrogradely into the renal pelvis through cystoscopy or ureteroscopy, and continuous infusion of saline was used to produce artificial hydronephrosis. After this, a Foley catheter was inserted; the patient was then changed to the prone position. Ultrasonography-guided percutaneous punctures were made with an 18-gauge coaxial needle into the targeted calyx. The puncture point was in the 11th intercostal space or the 12 th subcostal margin, between the posterior axillary line and scapula line. The puncture was judged successful if there was urine overflow or if it touched a stone. Zebra guidewire was inserted and fixed. The puncture needle was then taken out. After a 0.5&#x02013;0.7&#x000a0;cm skin incision, the dilation of the percutaneous tract was performed serially over the guidewire with a fascial dilator from 8&#x000a0;F to 16&#x000a0;F. A 16&#x000a0;F patented sheath was then placed at the percutaneous access port and was connected to a vacuum aspiration machine. The pressure was maintained at 0.01&#x02013;0.02&#x000a0;MPa. Subsequently, a small diameter nephroscope was inserted through the sheath. Initially, pus or purulent bolts were sucked out using the vacuum suctioning device (See Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). A holmium laser was then used to break the stones, and a vacuum suctioning device was used to clear gravel through the patented sheath until complete clearance. We then inspected renal pelvis and each renal calyx carefully. After finding that all stones were cleared, we indwelled a 6&#x000a0;F ureteral stent and a 16&#x000a0;F nephrostomy tube which will be removed 4&#x02013;5 days after surgery. Occurrence of renal pelvic perforation was investigated at the end of the procedure via nephrostogram.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Endoscopic view of renal calculus complicated by pyonephrosis</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12894_2016_184_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Upper ureter or renal stones often were treated with MPCNL and most patients can achieve the purpose of cure. Due to the pressure limit of renal parenchymal reflux is 30&#x000a0;mmHg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], when the MPCNL is performed under high pressure perfusion it is easy to cause the intrapelvic pressure over 30&#x000a0;mmHg, and the operation manipulation, the integrity of the pelvic wall epithelium could be injured and thereafter leads to direct exposure of venous and lymphatic system followed by renal parenchyma reflux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; When the stones and infection occur at the same time, tissue edema and congestion are more likely to cause pelvic fluid absorption. A large amount of short-term liquid absorption can cause the perfusion fluid syndrome, and when the bacteria and its toxin reflux into the blood, complications like bacteremia, sepsis, or postoperative fever occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. MPCNL surgery complication is related to the amount of liquid absorption. It is a positive correlation between the integrity of the epithelial cells, renal pelvic pressure, and the operation time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Performing MPCNL through irrigation can cause stones shift. When the collection system is connected to the renal abscess pus, due to the blurring of vision, it is not easy to find the pelvic outlet so the surgeon is often forced to abandon stone lithotripsy in which circumstance usually a percutaneous nephrostomy is performed as a first-stage surgery. In the current study, incidence rate of surgical complications in the control group was 51.6%% with 14 cases needing two staged operation. Therefore, how to improve success rate of surgery and reduce postoperative complications for calculus pyonephrosis is always a challenge in the field of Urology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>According to a previous report, when the intra-pelvic pressure is below 20&#x000a0;mmHg, it is feasible to use the EMS LithoClast master for one-phase PCNL of the relatively symptomatically stable patients with calculous pyonephrosis. Nevertheless, this surgical procedure has always carried high risks and its advantages and disadvantages should be validated by further studies of larger sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Patented sheath connected during surgery remains 0.01&#x02013;0.02&#x000a0;MPa negative pressure suction to keep renal pelvis in a negative pressure state, so that the discharge of perfusion fluid and pus went smoothly, avoided lavage, bacteria, toxins reflux and spread to surrounding tissues, reduced fever infection complications after surgery. In the current study, only 10 patients in the observation group were found to have temperature&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;38.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, significantly lower than those in the control group; Negative pressure adsorption can remove the effect of blood clots and floc, the vision can be more clear. With negative pressure &#x0201c;adsorption&#x0201d; effect on the gravel, small stones and pus hidden in the calyces can be automatically removed by suction. Due to a big discharge cavity of the sheath which is not easy to be blocked, there is no need of lithotomy forceps or stone basket, without the need for repeated importing a ureteroscope to flush, either. We are thus able to improve the efficacy of lithotripsy and stone clearance, shorten operation time, and reduce the operation complications such as bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this study, all patients in the observation group were successfully treated with the MPCNL by one surgery with a stone clearance rate of 96.7%. There were no adjacent organ injury and major bleeding, compared with the control group, with significant difference. With improved success rate of surgery and reduced rate of complication, the hospitalization time was shortened and the cost of hospitalization was reduced. Of course, surgeons may have been more aggressive using the patented sheath and less aggressive with the peel-away sheath due to the aims of this study, therefore getting higher stone-free rates in patients in the observation arm. Other limitation of this study is that we did not measure intrarenal pelvic pressure for every patient during the surgery, even though we have had previous research data revealing that the patented sheath could reduce intrarenal pressure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, through analysis and comparison the observation group was better than the control group reflected by multiple clinical indexes. Managing calculus pyonephrosis using patented sheath assisted MPCNL is safe, economic with fewer complications.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BUN</term><def><p>Blood urea nitrogen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVA</term><def><p>Costovertebral angle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVU</term><def><p>Intravenous urography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KUB</term><def><p>Kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPa</term><def><p>Megapascal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MPCNL</term><def><p>Minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PaCO2</term><def><p>Partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCNL</term><def><p>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Scr</term><def><p>Serum creatinine (Scr)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WBC</term><def><p>White blood cell</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>Major Scientific Fund from Science and Technology Department of Jiangxi Province to L.M.S.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>All the data supporting our findings is contained within the manuscript, any missing details will be shared upon request.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>DX, ML, and XD were involved in analysis and interpretation of data, and drafting the report; JH, LS, DX, MH, ZP, TL, CD, LY, SL, SG and JZ were involved in data acquisition; LS, JH, DX, and ML were involved in conception and design; All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="FPar4"><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dr. Leming Song is the owner of the patent.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Consent for publication</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from every patient for publication of this research report and any accompanying images.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p>The study was performed with the approval of ethics committee at the Affiliated Ganzhou City People&#x02019;s Hospital of Nanchang University, China, in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration.
