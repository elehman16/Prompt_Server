An anti-microbial agent, i.e. moxifloxacin has been incorporated into the bone graft to control infection and facilitate healing during and after periodontal therapy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>By purposive sampling, 15 patients with at least two contralateral vertical defect sites were selected. The selected sites in each individual were divided randomly into test and control sites according to split-mouth design. Test site received moxifloxacin-hydroxyapatite composite graft and control site received hydroxyapatite-placebo gel composite graft. Probing depth (PD) and Clinical attachment level (CAL) were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Bone probing depth (BPD) and hard tissue parameters such as amount of defect fill, percentage of defect fill, and changes in alveolar crest were assessed at baseline, 6, and 12 months. Changes in subgingival microflora were also assessed by culturing the subgingival plaque samples at baseline and at 3-month follow-up. The clinical, radiographic, and microbiological data obtained were subjected to statistical analysis using descriptive statistics, paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, and contingency test.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>On intragroup comparison at test and control sites, there was a significant improvement in all clinical and radiographic parameters. However, on intergroup comparison of the same, there was no statistically significant difference between test and control sites at any interval. Although test sites showed slightly higher amount of bone fill, it was not statistically significant. There was a significant reduction in the counts of <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> at both sites from baseline to 3 months.

This is based on the concept of local drug delivery which was pioneered by Goodson <italic>et al</italic>. with the aim of achieving a high concentration of an antibiotic directly at the site of periodontal infection to inhibit the target pathogens, with minimal side effects and lesser reliance on patient's compliance for taking medication.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Antibiotics that have been studied extensively in periodontal treatment include tetracyclines (minocyclines and doxycycline), pencillins (amoxicillin and augmentin), macrolides (azithromycin), lincomycin derivative (clindamycin), and nitroimidazole (metronidazole). However, due to the problems of bacterial resistance, alternatives for the currently used antibiotics are needed. Moxifloxacin is one such alternative antibiotic.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Moxifloxacin is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial activity against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. It exerts an excellent antibacterial activity against a wide range of putative periodontal pathogens. It also penetrates well into soft tissues and is effective against intracellular periodontal pathogens.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, moxifloxacin-containing biodegradable gel has been delivered to the intrabony defect site by mixing it with synthetic hydroxyapatite bone graft, forming a moxifloxacin-hydroxyapatite composite graft, and it is evaluated for efficacy in the regeneration of intrabony defects. To the best of authors&#x02019; knowledge, there has been no study that has used moxifloxacin along with bone grafts. In addition, this is the first study that used biodegradable gel as the vehicle of drug delivery directly into the defect site by mixing with bone graft.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>A total of thirty sites from 15 systemically healthy patients with chronic periodontitis were selected based on the following inclusion criteria.

The defects in the control site were filled with hydroxyapatite-placebo gel composite graft prepared in the same way with placebo gel.</p><p>At all the sites, the same proportion of graft and gel were mixed, i.e. for every 0.1 g of bone graft, 0.1 ml of gel was mixed. Small increments of graft-gel mixture were added into the defect and condensed properly until the defect was completely filled. Flaps were repositioned and secured in place using (3-0) black-braided silk. Sling and interrupted sutures were placed to obtain the primary closure.

This method was employed in an attempt to (1) suppress the periodontal pathogens in the intrabony defect, (2) prevent their recolonization, and (3) preclude any possible infection of the grafted area.</p><p>Moxifloxacin was selected for this present study because of its excellent antibacterial efficacy. It exerts a bactericidal effect by specifically inhibiting adenosine triphosphate-dependent topoisomerase IV and topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase). It exhibits antibacterial activity against a wide range of putative periodontal pathogens, including <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>, <italic>Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella</italic> spp., <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum, Actinomyces</italic> spp., <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic> spp., <italic>Campylobacter rectus</italic>, and <italic>A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic>. It penetrates well into soft tissues and is effective against intracellular periodontal pathogens. It shows an excellent bioavailability and tolerability, a long half-life, and a good tissue penetration.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Moxifloxacin was used at 0.4% concentration in this study because Flemmig <italic>et al</italic>. in their study proved that 0.4% moxifloxacin gel was most effective as a local drug delivery agent. Furthermore, in the same study, it was reported that this particular concentration (4000 mg/L) exceeded the MICs for putative periodontal pathogens by a factor of 10<sup>2</sup>&#x02212;10<sup>6</sup>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Biodegradable gel was used in the present study as a vehicle to carry and retain the moxifloxacin and hydroxyapatite at the treated site, to release drug in slow and sustained manner, to function as a system preventing particle scatter, and to facilitate graft retention. Gels were formulated in a clean environment and dispensed in transparent glass containers with air-tight caps and were sterilized under gamma irradiation (10 kilo gray). In the present study, in all the sites, same proportion of graft and gel were mixed, i.e., for every 0.1 g of bone graft, 0.1 ml of gel was mixed.</p><p>With reference to PD and CAL, there was no statistical difference observed between test and control sites at any of the time intervals in the present study. However, within the test and control sites, the reduction in PD and gain in CAL were significant between the various time intervals.</p><p>The results of the present study are in accordance with the following studies. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>. in their study evaluated the regenerative outcomes of bone graft with and without local doxycycline and reported that both the groups showed a significant reduction in PD and gain in CAL from baseline to 6 months, but there was no statistically significant difference between both groups.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Kaur and Sikri in their study reported that mean reduction in PD and gain in CAL were greater in test group (doxycycline-loaded allograft) than in control group (allograft alone) at the end of 24 weeks, but the difference was statistically nonsignificant.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Stavropoulos <italic>et al</italic>. in their study reported that at the end of 1 year, there was a reduction in mean PD and gain in clinical attachment when gentamicin was used along with Bio-Osss, but it was not significant.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Contrary to the present study results, Pepelassi <italic>et al</italic>. reported in their study that sites treated with the tricalcium phosphate, Plaster of Paris, and doxycycline composite graft had a significant reduction in PDs and gain in clinical attachment when compared to the surgically debrided control sites at the end of 6 months.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, surgical re-entry was not considered to avoid the second surgical procedure which may depend on patient acceptability and cause ethical concerns. Thus, clinical and radiographic methods were employed in this study.</p><p>There was a significant improvement in the amount and PDF at 6 and 12 months at both the sites. Although the improvement was slightly more in test sites at 6 and 12 months as compared to control sites, it was not statistically significant.</p><p>The results of the present study are in accordance with the following studies. Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the regenerative outcomes of bone graft with or without local doxycycline in noncontained infrabony periodontal defects. Radiographic defect fill was 18% in control and 20.7% in test at the end of 6 months.

Although the grafted groups showed a greater bone fill, there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In a study by Stavropoulos <italic>et al</italic>., it was revealed that the radiographic bone level gain in sites treated with guided tissue regeneration (GTR) and Bio-Osss impregnated with gentamicin (4.7 mm) was superior to those treated with GTR alone (3.1 mm) or GTR along with Bio-Osss (2.8 mm), but the difference was not significant.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>In contrast to the present study, Kaur and Sikri in their study evaluated clinically and radiographically the regenerative potential of doxycycline-loaded allograft with that of allograft alone in the treatment of human periodontal infrabony defects and reported that both the groups exhibited a highly significant linear bone fill at the end of 12 and 24 weeks. Intergroup comparison showed a statistically significant gain in bone fill in test group (doxycycline + allograft) as compared to control group (allograft alone).</p><p>In the present study, there was a significant reduction in the counts of Aa and Pg in both the sites from baseline to 3-month follow up. On intergroup comparison, there was a significant reduction in the counts of Aa and Pg at test sites compared to control sites at 3-month postoperative follow-up period. This is because moxifloxacin is effective against many putative periodontal pathogens including Aa and Pg, which has been proved in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Flemmig <italic>et al</italic>. reported in their study that there was a reduction in the counts of Pg from baseline to 6 weeks when 0.4% moxifloxacin gel was used as a local drug delivery agent in adjunct to SRP.</p><p>Thus, within the limitations of the present study, test sites showed a significant reduction in the counts of Aa and Pg compared to the control sites 3 months postoperatively. Regarding clinical and radiographic parameters, both the test and control sites showed a significant improvement from baseline to consecutive follow-ups, but there was no significant difference between both groups at any time interval. Even though test sites showed slightly higher bone fill, it was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The moxifloxacin incorporated in the bone graft brought a significant reduction in microbial counts at test sites, but it could not bring similar significant improvements in clinical and radiographic parameters.</p><p>Further studies with larger sample size are required to confirm the beneficial effects of mixing different antibiotics with bone grafts in various methods and proportions to enhance treatment outcomes.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>We express our sincere thanks to the Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Resource, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, for providing research grant to our study (Ref no. 3/2/2012/PG-thesis-HRD-25, dated 29-8-2013).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nowzari</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>London</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Slots</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The importance of periodontal pathogens in guided periodontal tissue regeneration and guided bone regeneration</article-title><source>Compend Contin Educ Dent</source><year>1995</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>1042</fpage><lpage>58</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8603308</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Zimmerli</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Lew</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><name><surname>Waldvogel</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pathogenesis of foreign body infection.
