The study was conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines after the protocol was approved by the relevant independent ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Each subject participated in two treatment periods. Eligible subjects were allocated to one of two sequences in accordance with the randomization schedule, which was generated by GlaxoSmithKline using validated internal software. In the first treatment period, each subject received either 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;mg dutasteride softgel capsule or 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;mg dutasteride softgel capsules orally under fasting conditions and received the alternate treatment in the second treatment period after a washout of 28 days. Participants remained in the clinical unit until completion of all assessments at 24&#x02009;h post-dose in each treatment period and returned to the unit for the collection of remaining PK samples at 36, 48, and 72&#x02009;h. Upon completion of the second treatment period, or early withdrawal, subjects returned to the clinical unit within 10&#x02013;14 days for a follow-up visit and were also contacted via telephone for a second follow-up visit within 50&#x02013;54 days.</p><p>Dutasteride soft gelatin capsules at strengths of 0.5&#x02009;mg and 0.1&#x02009;mg were manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions, Beinheim, France for GlaxoSmithKline.</p></sec><sec id="s0009"><title>Pharmacokinetic assessment</title><p>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were collected up to 72&#x02009;h post-dose in each treatment period. Blood samples were collected into a 2&#x02009;mL clot activator tube and left at room temperature for at least 20&#x02009;min, but no more than 40&#x02009;min to permit clot formation. Samples were centrifuged at 2500&#x02013;3000&#x02009;rpm (&#x0223c;650&#x02013;1450&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;g) for 10&#x02013;15&#x02009;min to achieve a clear serum layer. Serum was transferred to a secondary, labeled container and stored at &#x02212;20&#x02009;&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>Concentrations of dutasteride in serum were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) under the direction of Bioanalytical Science and Toxicokinetics, GlaxoSmithKline. Briefly, the analytical system consisted of a Leap Technologies autosampler (Carrboro, NC), a Thermo Scientific, BETASIL Silica-100 analytical column (Waltham, MA), and an API-4000 mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Canada). Dutasteride was extracted from serum after the addition of an isotopically labeled internal standard ([<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>C<sub>6</sub>]-dutasteride). Extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS using a TurboIonSpray interface and multiple reaction monitoring. Computer systems used to acquire and quantify data included Analyst software (version 1.4; Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex, Canada) and Study Management System 2000 (version 2.3; GlaxoSmithKline). Dutasteride was extracted from serum samples using a validated liquid&#x02013;liquid extraction using hexane/methyl tert-butyl ether/methylene chloride. Using a 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;l aliquot, the lower and upper limits of quantification for dutasteride in serum were 25.0&#x02009;pg/mL and 25&#x02009;000&#x02009;pg/mL, respectively. The standard curves for dutasteride were linear over their respective concentration ranges.</p><p>In the validation, the inter-assay accuracy (percent bias) ranged from &#x02212;5.2% to 1.2% for dutasteride. The intra-assay precision and accuracy values for dutasteride were 6.7% and 8.9%, respectively. The quality control (QC) samples were prepared at four different analyte concentrations and analyzed with each batch of sample against separately prepared calibration standards. For the analysis to be acceptable, no more than one-third of the total QC results were to deviate from the nominal concentration by more than 15%, and at least 50% of the results from each QC concentration should be within 15% of nominal.</p><p>Along with all the required validation experiments as outlined in regulatory guidelines, validation experiments also tested the assay selectivity in the presence of caffeine, acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid, chlorpheniramine maleate, ibuprofen, naproxen, pseudoephedrine, salicylic acid, ethinyl estradiol, levonorgenstrel, and norethindrone. None of these possible co-administered drugs had any effect on the quantification of dutasteride in serum. The applicable analytical runs met all pre-defined run acceptance criteria.</p><p>Dutasteride serum concentration-time data were analyzed by non-compartmental methods using WinNonlin 6.3 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). All calculations were based on actual sampling times. The primary dutasteride PK parameters were maximum concentration (<italic>C</italic>max) and area under the serum concentration-time curve to the last quantifiable concentration [AUC(0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic>)]. Time to maximum concentration (<italic>t</italic>max) was a secondary parameter.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Adverse event (AE) information volunteered by the subject, obtained from investigator questioning, or detected by other means was collected from the start of study treatment until the last follow-up contact. Vital signs and 12-lead ECG were recorded at screening, pre-dose, 3&#x02009;h and 24&#x02009;h post-dose in each treatment period, and at follow-up. Clinical laboratory tests were done at screening and on Day &#x02212;1 of each treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s0011"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The study was designed to test the bioequivalence of 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.1&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsules (Test) relative to 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsule (Reference). The null hypothesis was that the true ratio of the geometric mean of the Test to the geometric mean of the Reference, &#x000b5;(Test)/&#x000b5;(Reference), for each primary PK end-point, was either less than or equal to 0.80 or greater than or equal to 1.25. The alternate hypothesis was that the true ratio of the Test geometric mean to the Reference geometric mean was greater than 0.80 and less than 1.25.

This was equivalent to requiring that the 90% confidence interval for the true ratio of Test to Reference geometric means fell entirely within the range of 0.80&#x02013;1.25.</p><p>The sample size was estimated on the basis of the largest within-subject coefficient of variance (CVw) for AUC(0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>C</italic>max observed in previous studies (24.8%), which translates to a standard deviation of 0.2442 on the natural log scale. On this basis, assuming that the actual ratio of geometric means would not differ from unity, a sample size of 28 statistically evaluable subjects would ensure 90% power to demonstrate bioequivalence. This calculation assumed a true ratio of 1.00 and that the CVw from the current study was not larger than that used in the sample size calculation. To ensure that 28 subjects completed dosing and critical assessments for both treatment periods, &#x0223c;36 subjects were to be enrolled.</p><p>Following log<sub>e</sub>-transformation, AUC(0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic>) and <italic>C</italic>max of dutasteride were analysed separately using a mixed effects model with fixed effect terms for sequence, period, and treatment.

The point estimates and their associated 90% confidence intervals were then back-transformed to provide point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the ratios, Test:Reference. <italic>T</italic>max of dutasteride was analyzed separately using a non-parametric procedure to compute point estimates and associated 90% confidence intervals for the median differences, Test&#x02013;Reference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0012"><title>Results</title><sec id="s0013"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 36 subjects were enrolled in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The results show that five 0.1&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsules are bioequivalent to one 0.5&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsule, suggesting that the two dose strengths can be interchanged. The mean concentration vs time profiles for each treatment were nearly identical. Both peak and total exposures were very similar, as evidenced by the geometric mean ratios being close to unity. The 90% confidence intervals for both peak and total exposure were well within the 0.80&#x02013;1.25 regulatory threshold for bioequivalence. These results were expected, as both formulations are soft gelatin capsules containing dutasteride dissolved in a mixture of mono-di-glycerides of caprylic/capric acid<sup><xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>, and are very similar except for the size and strength of the capsules. Both capsule strengths have similar <italic>in vitro</italic> dissolution profiles (data on file at GlaxoSmithKline).</p><p>Consistent with previously reported data<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>, single dose administration of dutasteride was relatively well tolerated in the healthy male subjects participating in this study. A similar tolerability profile was observed for both formulations. Any observed differences in frequencies of individual AEs following administration of each formulation are likely chance findings due to the relatively small number of subjects participating in the study, rather than actual differences in the tolerability of the two formulations.</p><p>The small sample size and single dose design of this study prevent definitive conclusions being made regarding the pharmacokinetics and safety of dutasuteride capsules in the AGA patient population. However, dutasteride at a dose of 0.5&#x02009;mg daily has been approved for more than 10 years for the treatment of BPH and considerable clinical trials and post-marketing experience is available<sup><xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup><sup>,</sup><sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. In large, well-controlled clinical trials in patients with BPH, dutasteride had a tolerability profile comparable with that of placebo, with the exception of a small increase in the incidence of impotence and decreased libido during the first year of therapy<sup><xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Dutasteride was also well tolerated in placebo-controlled clinical trials in men with AGA, and no new safety concerns were raised<sup><xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s0017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Bioequivalence was demonstrated for one 0.5&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsule and five 0.1&#x02009;mg dutasteride capsules following single dose administration to healthy male subjects. Both treatments were generally well tolerated in healthy male subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank study volunteers for their participation and the staff at GlaxoSmithKline Medicines Research Unit, Australia for support in conducting the study.
