The estimated lifetime risk for inguinal hernia is 27% for men and 3% for women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Annual morbidity rates in various countries vary from 100 to 300 per 100,000 citizens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. There were no written surgical guidelines for hernia treatment until 2009, when the European Hernia Society (EHS) published its recommendations based on analysis of the literature and the results of clinical trials. In the EHS guidelines, mesh-based techniques&#x02014;the Lichtenstein technique in particular&#x02014;and endoscopic methods are recommended for treatment of symptomatic primary inguinal hernia in adult men (strength of recommendation IA). In a departure from this firm opinion presented by the EHS, the Shouldice method has been acknowledged to be acceptable as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Schumpelick emphasized the effectiveness of the Shouldice technique during his presentation at the 2011 EHS Congress in Ghent. Some questions can be asked considering these facts: Is the Shouldice technique the only nonmesh method that ensures good clinical results? Are any other tissue-based techniques effective in inguinal hernia repair if performed correctly?</p><p>The synthetic prostheses most often used in the inguinal area can create new clinical problems, such as foreign body sensation in the groin, discomfort, and abdominal wall stiffness, which may affect the everyday functioning of the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Surgical-site infections, often with clinical symptoms delayed for many years, are more frequent after hernia treatment using mesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Migration of the mesh from the primary site of implantation in the abdominal cavity is one of the most dangerous complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Intense chronic inflammatory process typically associated with foreign body reactions around the mesh prosthesis may produce meshoma or plugoma tumors, the treatment of which becomes a new surgical challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, procreation and sexual function are reportly seriously affected after surgical hernia treatment with mesh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, we are still far from accomplishing everything in the hernia surgical field, and complications remain the major clinical problem.</p><p>The observed complication rates and postoperative dysfunction have influenced many investigators to look for new hernia repair techniques or to modify old ones. An example of such efforts is the Desarda method, which was presented in 2001 and became a new surgical option for tissue-based groin hernia repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because the results of our prospective study involving the technique were promising, as were the results presented by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], we performed a multicenter randomized double-blind clinical trial to compare the standard mesh-based Lichtenstein technique with the tissue-based Desarda technique.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The patients were recruited in Poland from two clinical departments (the Department of General, and Endocrine Surgery and the Department of General, Gastrointestinal, and Cancer Surgery, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Nicolaus Copernicus University of Torun) and one community surgical ward (General Surgery Ward, Community Hospital, Lodz). The local research and ethics committee approved the study protocol.</p><p>A total of 208 adult male Caucasian patients with primary inguinal hernias were randomly allocated intraoperatively to undergo one of the two repairs: Desarda tissue-based repair (D) or the classic Lichtenstein mesh repair (L). Patients with bilateral hernias were also included, but only one side was operated on. The final inclusion criterion was the assessment of the condition of the external oblique aponeurosis, with exclusion of patients with an aponeurosis that was divided, tiny, and/or weak. Patients with recurrent or strangulated hernias or mental disorders, those participating in other clinical trials, and those assessed on the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scale at &#x0003e;3 were also excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included a history of a forced hernia reduction with subsequent hospitalization, a history of infection, or the presence of any scar in the inguinal area.</p><p>The participants were given detailed information on the trial and surgery. They each agreed to not be informed about the technique used until 2&#x000a0;years following the date of surgery, and each participant signed an informed consent form. The protocol details were discussed with the study team, and the surgical procedures were practiced to achieve standardization. Enrollment of eligible patients began on January 2005 and took place until June 2006. Patients were followed for a minimum of 3&#x000a0;years. The trial ended on June 30, 2009. More than 30% of eligible patients declined to give consent to be randomized (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Finally, 208 patients were blindly and randomly allocated to undergo one of the two open hernia repairs: Desarda or Lichtenstein procedure. The patient characteristics recorded were age, co-morbidities (Charlson Co-morbidity Index, ASA), and employment status (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Trial flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="268_2012_1508_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline health status characteristics, by operative method</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Characteristic</th><th align="left">Desarda (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;105)</th><th align="left">Lichtenstein (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;103)</th><th align="left"><italic>p</italic>*</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Age (years): mean (SD)</td><td char="(" align="char">50.2 (17.5)</td><td char="(" align="char">54.1 (15.3)</td><td char="." align="char">0.094**</td></tr><tr><td align="left">CCI: median, range</td><td char="(" align="char">1 (0&#x02013;4)</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (0&#x02013;3)</td><td char="." align="char">0.405***</td></tr><tr><td align="left">ASA score: median (range)</td><td char="(" align="char">1 (1&#x02013;3)</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1&#x02013;3)</td><td char="." align="char">0.484***</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4">Co-morbidities (no.)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Hypertension</td><td char="(" align="char">12 (11.4%)</td><td char="(" align="char">20 (19.4%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.127</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Heart infarct</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="(" align="char">4 (3.8%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.443****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Ischemic heart disease</td><td char="(" align="char">9 (8.6%)</td><td char="(" align="char">12 (11.6%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.498</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Diabetes</td><td char="(" align="char">6 (5.7%)</td><td char="(" align="char">8 (7.8%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.592</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Cerebral circulation insufficiency</td><td char="(" align="char">8 (7.6%)</td><td char="(" align="char">11 (10.7%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.479</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Hepatitis C</td><td char="(" align="char">1 (0.9%)</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="." align="char">1.000****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;COPD</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="(" align="char">0</td><td char="." align="char">0.498****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Peptic ulcer</td><td char="(" align="char">4 (3.8%)</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.683****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Chronic renal disease</td><td char="(" align="char">0</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.244****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td char="(" align="char">4 (3.8%)</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.683****</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Smoking</td><td char="(" align="char">28 (26.6%)</td><td char="(" align="char">23 (22.3%)</td><td char="." align="char">0.521****</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="4">Employment (no.)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Student</td><td char="(" align="char">7 (7.6%)</td><td char="(" align="char">9 (8.7%)</td><td char="." align="char" rowspan="5">0.412</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Nonphysical</td><td char="(" align="char">34 (32.4%)</td><td char="(" align="char">31 (30.1%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Light physical</td><td char="(" align="char">27 (25.7%)</td><td char="(" align="char">33 (32.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;Heavy physical</td><td char="(" align="char">2 (1.9%)</td><td char="(" align="char">4 (3.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x000a0;None or retired</td><td char="(" align="char">35 (33.3%)</td><td char="(" align="char">26 (25.2%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>CCI</italic> Charlson Co-morbidity Index, <italic>ASA</italic> American Society of Anesthesiologists, <italic>COPD</italic> chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, <italic>BMI</italic> body mass index</p><p>*&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test, except: **&#x000a0;Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test; ***&#x000a0;Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test; ****&#x000a0;Fisher&#x02019;s exact test</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatment</title><p>Using a standard protocol, all patients were given sedative premedication (7.5&#x000a0;mg midazolam) and one shot of antimicrobial prophylaxis (1.0&#x000a0;g cephazoline IV 30&#x000a0;min before surgery). In accordance with the patient&#x02019;s preference or the anesthetist&#x02019;s opinion, all operations were carried out under local (20.9 vs. 18.4% in D and L groups, respectively), regional (64.8 vs. 63.1%), or general (14.3 vs. 18.4%) anesthesia. The operations were performed by staff surgeons and surgeons in training, with equal proportions in both groups.</p><p>Randomization was achieved using computer-generated allotments that were disclosed to the surgeon via sealed envelope. Stratified randomization was used to ensure that an equal proportion of junior and senior surgeons performed the operations in both groups. The type of anesthesia was monitored during the study, but no intervention was necessary to ensure equal proportions in groups. The envelope was not opened until after the dissection and assessment of the external oblique aponeurosis had been performed because the condition of the aponeurosis was the final inclusion criterion.</p><p>The Lichtenstein tension-free mesh repair was performed as described by Amid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An 8&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;cm polypropylene mesh (Prolene; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) was trimmed to a foot-like shape to fit the inguinal floor. The mesh was sutured to the ligament of Poupart using a nonabsorbable continuous 2/0 suture (Prolene; Ethicon) and secured cranially using an absorbable 2/0 suture (Maxon; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA). The Desarda repair was performed as it was originally described in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and presented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. Continuous nonabsorbable suture (2/0 Prolene; Ethicon) was used to secure the aponeurotic strip to the inguinal ligament laterally, and the strip was secured to the internal oblique muscle medially with interrupted, absorbable sutures (2/0 Maxon; Covidien). Particular attention was paid to identify and preserve the nerves of the inguinal area; whenever this was not possible, the nerves were excised. All intraoperative variables were recorded and compared. After the inguinal canal had been opened, the hernias were described using the Gilbert-modified Robbins&#x02013;Rutkow classification system as follows: type 1, indirect hernia with normal internal ring; type 2, indirect hernia with internal ring enlarged but &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;cm; type 3, indirect hernia with internal ring enlarged &#x0003e;4&#x000a0;cm; type 4, direct hernia with destroyed posterior wall of the inguinal canal; type 5, direct hernia with defect next to the pubic tubercle; type 6, pantaloon hernia; type 7, femoral hernia. For both techniques, the skin was closed with continuous nonabsorbable suture. Patients were encouraged to resume normal activities as soon as possible.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Desarda&#x02019;s method.

The appointments on day 7 were performed during the patients&#x02019; visits to outpatient surgical departments; and the follow-up appointments after day 7 were performed in the departments&#x02019; examination rooms. Both the patients and controlling investigators were blinded to the hernia surgery method used. The investigator who was performing the follow-up physical examinations and patient assessments was a surgeon in each department who did not perform the surgeries in this study. The data were collected in computer protocols of Sharepoint Portal Server System (Microsoft, Edmond, WA, USA) after it was adapted to perform in clinical trials by the authors.</p><p>Recurrences and other complications were recorded. Pain was measured using a visual analog scale (VAS), which ranged from 0 (no pain) to 100 (maximum, unbearable pain). Additionally, pain was recorded with the use of the Sheffield scale: 0, no pain; 1, no pain at rest but it appears during movement; 2, temporary pain at rest and moderate during movement; 3, constant pain at rest and severe during movements. Return to normal activity was described as the patient&#x02019;s ability to perform elementary activities [i.e., dressing, walking, bathing (basic activity)]; usual activities at home [i.e., preparing food, cleaning house (home activity)]; and returning to all previously performed activities (work activity).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the Desarda repair is as effective as the standard Lichtenstein procedure, allowing successful hernia repair without mesh.

Excluding seroma formation, the frequency of complications was similar for the two groups.</p><p>Currently, the results of hernia treatment, even those that have taken into account the EHS guidelines, vary from moderate to excellent. The mean recurrence rate for the standard Lichtenstein procedure is about 1% in hernia-specialized centers but can be much higher in community hospitals (about 4%), and the reported rate even reaches 18% in some articles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The data published so far for other mesh techniques vary: 0 to 4.2% recurrences for Prolene Hernia System (PHS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], 0 to 4% for Rutkow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], 1.6 to 19.0% for the Transabdominal Pre-Peritoneal inguinal hernia repair (TAPP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The summarized frequency of postoperative complications reported in the available literature is between 15 and 28% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. When active postoperative monitoring is applied, the frequency can even reach 50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The most frequently reported complications were hematoma, seroma, surgical-site infection, chronic pain, and recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Death and major worsening of the treated patients&#x02019; quality of life were rare but also reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These data suggest the need for further investigation of the clinical problem.</p><p>An intense global effort to improve the results of inguinal hernia treatment is ongoing. Commercially available lightweight polypropylene meshes, composed meshes, and many biologic prostheses are being tested. The scientific work of optimizing hernia surgery and lowering the number of complications is still in progress. We are of the opinion that tissue-based techniques are not out of the realm of consideration in this field.</p><p>The Desarda technique for inguinal hernia repair is a new tissue-based method. Despite the objections presented by some authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], application of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis in the form of an undetached strip (which makes the posterior wall of the inguinal canal stronger) has been established as a new concept in tissue-based hernia repair. The technique is original, new, and different from the historical methods using the external oblique aponeurosis, proposed initially by McArthur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Andrews or Zimmermann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In our opinion, this newly proposed repair method satisfies the principles of &#x0201c;no tension&#x0201d; presented by Lichtenstein. The aponeurotic strip is displaced from the anterior to the posterior wall of the inguinal canal without additional tension at the posterior wall. The concept of an undetached, movable aponeurotic strip that &#x0201c;physiologically&#x0201d; enforces the posterior wall of the inguinal canal is original and interesting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. When considering the Desarda technique as &#x0201c;dynamic enforcement&#x0201d; of the inguinal canal&#x02019;s posterior wall, the Lichtenstein method can be called &#x0201c;prosthetic enforcement.&#x0201d; The author of the first method hypothesizes that a naturally displaced and movable aponeurotic strip is far more &#x0201c;physiological&#x0201d; than the scar tissue produced around a synthetic prosthesis for creating a mechanism against reherniation.</p><p>What can be postulated against this technique is that the originally unhealthy tissue is used for the repair. There is evidence supporting the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their inhibitors (tissue inhibitor of MMPs, or TIMPs) in abdominal wall connective tissue degeneration leading to hernia formation. The coincidence of hernia and aortal aneurysm and other diseases in which the etiopathology originates from connective tissue is well known. Hernia formation and recurrence is associated with altered collagen metabolism manifested by a decreased type I:III collagen ratio. The Shouldice technique, which is still recommended and accepted worldwide, is tissue-based as well. To date, there has been no comparison study on the aponeurotic tissue and the transversalis fascia. The properties of inguinal connective tissue are being generalized mainly from studies on the transversalis fascia. It should be noted that the genetic and biochemical changes are found in only 20 to 30% of patients with hernias. Assuming that there are about 15 to 20% of recurrences after some tissue-based techniques, 80% of patients survive without recurrence for the remainder of their lives. It might be postulated that there is a population of hernia patients&#x02014;actually, most of the patients&#x02014;in whom tissue-based techniques could be used safely. The future challenge in herniology is finding a method to identify this population before surgery.</p><p>In our study, there were no statistically significant differences between the patients enrolled and randomized to the Desarda and Lichtenstein groups. The recurrence rate was the same in both groups. In one case in the Desarda group, the recurrence was obviously the result of a technical error. The aponeurotic strip created was too long, resulting in a large newly formed deep inguinal ring and reherniation. In the second case of recurrence, weakening of the entire posterior wall was found during reoperation, but no typical reherniation was seen. In the Lichtenstein group, the recurrences were typical. This additionally supports the idea that surgical technique is crucial for a good final result.</p><p>Although chronic pain has been defined as lasting &#x0003e;3&#x000a0;months by the International Association for the Study of Pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], we defined chronic pain as pain lasting &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months due to the use of synthetic materials for the hernia repair and taking into account the fact that the inflammatory response to foreign material may last longer. This approach has been used by many other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and is recommended in the latest publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. At the early postoperative time points (7 and 30&#x000a0;days), the pain was slightly higher in the Desarda group; but the difference never reached significance. After the VAS scale was transferred to a descriptive scale (Verbal Rating Scale, VRS) no differences at any the follow-up time points, including at 6&#x000a0;months, were observed. We excluded data from the early postoperative days because of the many protocol deviations observed, different anaesthesia applied, and multiple medications taken by the participants. In another recent publication of our study results on early postoperative pain after the Desarda and Lichtenstein operations, no significant differences were found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The percentage of other early and late complications was comparable. The higher ratio of seromas after use of the Lichtenstein method can be explained by the influence of the synthetic mesh on surrounding tissues. This is consistent with other studies and the known influence of polypropylene on tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Foreign body sensation and abdominal wall stiffness were expressed by 12 to 16% of the Desarda group patients and 17 to 22% of the Lichtenstein group patients at different time points, and the results are within the range (4.5&#x02013;43.8%) reported by other authors for mesh techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Surprisingly, these mesh-related sensations were experienced similarly by patients from both groups and did not change even after the participants were informed of the technique used after 2&#x000a0;years of follow-up.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a randomized clinical trial comparing the Desarda and Lichtenstein techniques. Previously, Mitura and Romanczuk have published the results of a 6-month follow-up study of the Desarda and Lichtenstein approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They observed no recurrence, and pain after 6&#x000a0;months was comparable in the two groups (VAS scores were 8 vs. 11 in the Desarda and Lichtenstein groups, respectively; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.691). Situma et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] presented their short-term results of Desarda versus modified Bassini inguinal hernia repair, concluding that there was no difference between these two techniques in regard to pain and return to normal activity. Other results, published by Desarda and his group, were based on a comparison of his technique and the Lichtenstein technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. They reported no recurrence among the 269 Desarda group patients and 1.97% recurrence among the 225 mesh group patients; 6.49% of patients from the mesh group and no patients in the Desarda group reported chronic pain at 1&#x000a0;year after surgery. In our opinion, despite some methodologic inadequacies in the presented articles, the Desarda method merits more attention and further investigation by other authors.</p><p>Paradoxically, in the modern world the cost of the medical treatment becomes the real issue. The cost of inguinal hernia treatment, a tiny fraction of all health expenses, is not insignificant, however, especially in developing countries in Asia or Africa. One indisputable advantage of Desarda technique is its low cost. That is why many published articles recently demonstrated an interest in the technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The cost of the Desarda operation is low because a synthetic prosthesis is not needed. The price of composite meshes or even heavy polypropylene meshes, as well as their accessibility, could be important issues in developing countries. We confirmed that even the inguinoscrotal hernias (Rutkow types 3, 4, and 6), which are frequently seen in African and Asian countries, can be successfully treated with the Desarda technique.</p><p>Economic issues are not the only considerations. The use of synthetic material is still controversial in young patients. The effect of polyproplylene placement or other synthetic mesh inside human organism for a lifetime is still unknown. Also, data are appearing about sexual impairment after mesh implantation; and as a result, many surgeons try to avoid mesh prostheses for hernia treatment in young patients. Also, the Desarda method, a tissue-based technique, can be used in a contaminated surgical field, usually seen during operations for strangulated hernias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our random controlled trial confirmed that the results of inguinal hernia treatment with the Desarda technique are similar to the results after standard Lichtenstein operations over a 3-year time period. Based on these results, the technique has the potential to enlarge the number of tissue-based methods available to treat groin hernias. The most evident indications for use of the Desarda technique include use in young patients, in contaminated surgical fields, in the presence of financial constraints, or if a patient disagrees with the use of mesh.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by grant from the Nicolaus Copernicus University of Torun, Collegium Medicum in Bydgoszcz, Poland (grant 19/2006) and the Foundation for Clinical Surgery in Bydgoszcz, Poland.
