It is associated with a myriad of postoperative complications, which lead to delayed recovery and prolonged hospitalizations. Untreated severe pain causes stimulation of the sympathetic component of the autonomic nervous system resulting in increased release of catecholamines. This stress response (increased heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) has many negative effects including postoperative ileus and cardiac ischemia in susceptible individuals.</p><p>Pain is known to contribute to improper postoperative coughing and deep breathing exercises, which predispose patients to pulmonary complications. Similarly, the presence of postoperative pain is a factor in delayed mobility, as patients with pain are often more reluctant to get out of bed. One of the more serious complications of delayed mobility after surgery is the development of deep vein thrombosis. Postoperative pain has been shown to be ameliorated effectively by epidural opioid administration. The drug of choice is one which alleviates postoperative pain with the fewest unwanted side effects. Morphine and clonidine are commonly used adjuvants to epidural local anesthetics. No study has been conducted to compare analgesic efficacy, hemodynamic changes, and side effects between epidural clonidine and morphine combined with local anesthetic in adult patients.</p><p>Hence, we will compare the analgesic efficacy of a combination of the following groups of two drugs used in patients undergoing major abdominal surgeries.</p><p>

The subjects were randomly allocated to Group A (Group M) and Group B (Group C). The aforementioned groups received epidural morphine plus bupivacaine and epidural clonidine plus bupivacaine, respectively. Morphine used was preservative free including phenol, formaldehyde, chlorobutanol, sodium biphosphate, and sodium bisulfite.</p><p>The study was approved by ethical committee of B J Medical College, Civil Hospital Ahmedabad. Written informed consents had been taken before surgeries. All patients were given general anesthesia after doing adequate investigations preoperatively. In the operating room, gazettes according to minimum monitoring standards were applied, and baseline vitals were noted. Premedication in form of injection glycopyrrolate 0.004 mg/kg intravenous (IV), injection ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg, and injection fentanyl (2 mcg/kg) IV were administered and IV fluid was started as well. Epidural catheter was inserted after taking all aseptic precautions. Then test dose with 3 ml bupivacaine (0.5%) was given. After confirmation of the placement of the catheter in the epidural space, the catheter was fixed.</p><p>

</p><p>Drugs given after negative aspiration test and post dose vitals were recorded.</p><p>Postoperatively in the recovery room, various parameters were monitored for first 2 h at intervals of 30 min and later on in the ward at 4, 8, 12, 16 24 hourly intervals after giving 1<sup>st</sup> dose. Subsequent doses were given 8 hourly or when visual analog scale (VAS) &#x0003e;5 for total 24 h. Rescue analgesia in the form of injection diclofenac 1 mg/kg IV was given. Epidural catheter was removed after 48 h under all aseptic and antiseptic precautions, patency and intact tip of the catheter was checked. Different parameters like pain by VAS, Sedation by Ramsay scale, Heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, urine output and side effects like nausea, vomiting, retention of urine, pruritus, lower extremity motor block, and respiratory distress were observed.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation and number and percentages.

Morphine and clonidine are commonly used adjuvants to epidural local anesthetics.</p><p>Comparison between morphine and clonidine has been studied in two randomized controlled trials in children, which have shown contradictory results.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The disparity in the results may be explained due to varying doses. Moreover, one of the studies was focused on comparing the side effects.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Based on MedLine database search and literature review searches, no study has been conducted to compare analgesic efficacy, hemodynamic changes, and side effects between epidural clonidine and morphine combined with local anesthetic in adult patients.</p><p>Pain can greatly impede the return of normal pulmonary function, promote immobility and subsequently lead to the development of deep vein thrombosis, alteration in the stress response to surgery, increased catecholamine release, increased oxygen demand and cardiac work, Increased catabolic response to surgical trauma, impaired immune mechanisms, and delayed wound healing. Hence, its relief undoubtedly decreases morbidity and mortality.</p><p>Epidural Morphine is a potent opiate analgesic drug that provides better and long lasting pain relief postoperatively. In our study, epidural morphine 0.1 mg/kg + Bupivacaine (0.125%) are given at 8 h interval.</p><p>Clonidine is a centrally acting, selective partial &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub> adrenergic agonist and reduces central epinephrine release. Epidural Clonidine has been shown to have anesthetic sparing effects and analgesic property.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>A total number of 60 patients, aged between 18 and 60 years are selected. Of these, the mean age in Group-M (receiving epidural Morphine) was 51.17 &#x000b1; 11.75 years and in Group-C (receiving epidural Clonidine) was 46.23 &#x000b1; 16.64 years. Both groups were comparable with respect to age and gender distribution.</p><p>In this study, Epidural morphine 0.1 mg/kg + 0.125% bupivacaine diluted in 10 ml of normal saline used because it was found an optimal dose in regards to efficacy and side effects by Lanz <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In Group C, Epidural Clonidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg + 0.125% bupivacaine diluted in 10 ml of normal saline as previous study by Jyothi <italic>et al</italic>. showed epidural clonidine 150 mcg with bupivacaine provides a rapid, excellent, and longer duration of analgesia when compared to epidural bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Lund and Mogensen found that no patients in their study group receiving epidural morphine developed any clinically important change in heart rate.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In this study, preoperative pulse was comparable in both the groups. Heart rate varied from 63.27 &#x000b1; 6.23 to 93.10 &#x000b1; 8.15 in Clonidine group and from 73.63 &#x000b1; 4.65 to 84.03 &#x000b1; 10.5 in Morphine group. Within 1 h of epidural dose postoperatively, there is significant decrease in pulse rate from baseline in both groups, more so in the clonidine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) which is comparable to the studies conducted by Rockemann <italic>et al</italic>. and Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine decreases heart rate by direct cardiac as well as central mechanisms.

There is no statistically significant difference in MAP in baseline values. But after epidural dose, a significant difference exists in MAP, which is lower in the clonidine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In group clonidine, the maximum fall in mean arterial blood pressure (73 mm Hg) as compared to the baseline value (94.56 mm Hg) was 15% which occurred at 1 h after epidural injection. It shows in our study that clonidine causes decrease in mean arterial blood pressure similar to observation by Lund and Mogensen, Rockemann <italic>et al</italic>. (1995), Bonnet <italic>et al</italic>. (1989), and Glynn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>No significant respiratory depression has been noticed in either of the two groups. A limitation of our study is that we used respiratory rate alone to assess respiratory depression which may not be the sole indicator of respiratory depression.</p><p>No significant difference was found in VAS between morphine and clonidine groups at rest and up to 2 h in both groups. However, there was significantly higher pain score in the clonidine group during cough and mobilization (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) as well as after 2 h of epidural dose compare to group morphine. This is due to hydrophilic feature of morphine, which ensures that the drug remains at target site for a prolonged period and this delayed absorption explains its intense analgesia.</p><p>Thus, quality of analgesia has been proven to be better with Morphine group in our study, which is contrary to study by Jain <italic>et al</italic>. and Glynn <italic>et al</italic>. which shows no difference in VAS score between clonidine and morphine group during coughing and mobilization.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In a study conducted by Jain <italic>et al</italic>., no significant difference was found in duration of analgesia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the mean duration of analgesia was 8.35 &#x000b1; 0.42 h in group morphine and 7.45 &#x000b1; 0.44 h in group clonidine.

(2003), it was found that systemic Opioids cause more profound sedation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In this study, sedation score was recorded according to the Ramsay Scale. The sedation appeared approximately 45&#x02013;60 min after epidural injection in both the groups. All patients of clonidine group showed sedation score between 2 and 4 and remained sedated for a longer period (7.1 [0.8] h) when compared with those in group morphine (3.8 [0.7] h; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) which is comparable to result of the study by Singh <italic>et al</italic>. (2011) though this study differs from the above mentioned studies in using Ramsay sedation scale.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The sedation seen after epidural administration of clonidine likely reflects systemic absorption and vascular redistribution to higher centers. Locus coeruleus is associated with regulation of sleep and wakefulness and is inhibited by alpha-2 agonists. The sedative effects evoked by alpha-2 agonist most likely reflect inhibition of this nucleus.</p><p>In this study, in group morphine, 10 patients complained of nausea, vomiting who were treated with injection ondansetron and six patients complained of pruritus, itching which was treated with antihistamines. Nausea and vomiting are thought to be the result of central stimulation of the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
