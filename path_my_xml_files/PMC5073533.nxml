<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Such fractures are strongly associated with decreased bone mineral density, increased age, prior fragility fracture, cognitive impairment, other health problems, undernutrition, frailty, poor physical functioning, vision problems and weight loss.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Mortality is high with 14&#x02013;58% dying within the following 12&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A review of the long-term disability associated with proximal femoral fracture found that 29% did not regain their level of functioning after 1&#x02005;year in terms of restrictions of activities of daily living.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Many who were living independently before their fracture lose their independence afterwards, which imposes a large cost burden on society amounting to about &#x000a3;2.3 billion a year in the UK.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has issued guidelines for the management of hip fracture.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> As well as prompt surgical treatment and the management of associated medical needs, the guidelines recommend a programme of multidisciplinary rehabilitation. Such rehabilitation starts while in hospital during postoperative recovery, continues in the community following hospital discharge and has the potential to maximise recovery, enhance quality of life and maintain independence. While individual components of such programmes show promise, there is insufficient evidence of overall effectiveness or cost-effectiveness of an overall care pathway.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10&#x02013;12</xref></p><p>The first phase of this research project developed a new community-based rehabilitation intervention<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> within the Medical Research Council's (MRC) framework for complex intervention development.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The aim of the second phase of the present study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention and its acceptability through focus groups with therapists, patients and carers; and to conduct a concurrent economic evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Study objectives</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To assess the feasibility of a future definitive RCT by assessing eligibility, recruitment and retention rates, exploring the willingness of patient participants to be randomised and the willingness of patients and carers to complete process and outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the acceptability of the rehabilitation programme among patients, carers and clinicians, and to identify any adverse events.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To produce means and SDs of the quantitative measures, so that effect sizes can be calculated for planning the future RCT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore the methodological issues for conducting an economic evaluation alongside a future RCT, and report exploratory economic analyses.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>Phase II comprised the second stage of the MRC framework<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and consisted of a randomised feasibility study, including focus groups of the multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams, hip fracture patients and their carers.

They were followed up for 3&#x02005;months. The following data were collected: the number admitted with proximal femoral fracture; the number who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the randomised feasibility study; the number of deaths, serious complications and readmissions. Participants to the feasibility study were recruited on the orthopaedic wards while recovering from surgical treatment for proximal femoral fracture. We also recruited carers who were relatives or friends who provided help with activities of daily living for most days of the week.

Randomisation was by dynamic allocation<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> to protect against subversion while ensuring that the trial maintained good balance to the allocation ratio of 1:1 within each stratification variable and across the trial. Participants were stratified by: (1) hospital and (2) gender. Stratification by hospital was necessary as each hospital has differing usual care pathways and, due to the geography of the area, different therapy teams delivered the intervention in different areas.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study interventions</title><p>An &#x02018;enhanced&#x02019; rehabilitation intervention to improve patients' self-efficacy and increase the amount and quality of patients' practice of physical exercise and activities of daily living was compared with usual rehabilitation care.

Six additional therapy sessions were delivered postdischarge by physiotherapists and technical instructors in the patient's place of residence or outpatients' department if required, with the timescale of delivery being decided by the therapist according to patient's individual needs. Session content was tailored to the individual and led by goals set by the patient in their initial intervention session, using the information workbook and supported by the therapist's clinical expertise of what was realistic and achievable for the patient. Patients and therapists reviewed and amended goals throughout the 3-month intervention period. The theory underpinning how the individual components interact to achieve desirable outcomes is discussed in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Usual care was variable, consisting of multidisciplinary rehabilitation delivered by the acute hospital, community hospital and community services depending on patients' individual needs at different times during their recovery and on the availability and accessibility of services in different areas. Care pathways in this area did not include the provision of rehabilitation information leaflets on discharge from the acute hospital and any goal-setting activities were therapist-led.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012422.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012422supp1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012422.supp2</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012422supp2.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Outcomes were collected in a variety of ways.

June 2014 and March 2015, 593 patients with proximal femoral fracture were screened for eligibility, of which 266 (45%) were eligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422F1">figure 1</xref>). The main reason for ineligibility was lack of mental capacity (49%). Out of those eligible, 193 (73%) were invited to participate and 62 (23% of the eligible population) agreed to participate. The main reason for non-participation was the perceived burden of the study. The majority of patients had two visits from researchers before they were recruited, and many requested a second visit to discuss the study after they had been discharged. From the recruited participants, 41 carers were identified, with 31 agreeing to participate (76%). The mean age of the intervention group was 2.9&#x02005;years older than the control group, but the age of study participants ranged from 66 to 99&#x02005;years (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422TB2">table 2</xref>). The proportions in the two groups were similar according to gender, living status, type of property, type of fracture, type of surgery and admitting hospital. After the hospital admission, there was a small discrepancy between those discharged directly to their place of usual residence (34% in the intervention group; 53% in the control group) and those sent to a community hospital for rehabilitation (52% in the intervention group; 22% in the control group). The baseline scores of the outcome measures and physical function tests were similar between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422TB3">table 3</xref>). However, the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living score was 2.4 points higher in the control group.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012422F1" orientation="portrait"

rid="SM5">supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422TB2">table 2</xref>). Four patients could not be contacted at follow-up, which gives a patient retention rate of 79%. Six of the carers withdrew during the study and seven were lost to follow-up. Eighteen completed the follow-up questionnaire, giving a carer retention rate of 44%. Nine adverse events were reported (three in intervention, six in control). Six of these were deemed as serious, including two readmissions (3%), one in the control and one in the intervention group, and one death (2%) in the control group, but none were related to the study (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422TB1">table 1</xref>).

Cohen's d effect sizes have been calculated for each of the outcome measures. The main outcome measure the BADL, and most secondary outcomes had small effect sizes in favour of the intervention group. However, the NEADL showed a medium effect size, with a Cohen's d of 0.63, but a wide 95% CI (&#x02212;0.01 to 1.26), also in favour of the intervention group. One of the physical function tests, the 50-foot walk test, was completed in a shorter time in the control group with a medium effect size (Cohen's d of 0.40), but again a wide 95% CI (&#x02212;0.41 to 1.20). This seemed to be related to one outlier and so a sensitivity analysis was completed with this participant removed. This changed the effect size to 0.02 (95% CI of &#x02212;0.80 to 0.84). General self-efficacy and self-efficacy for exercise had the lowest rate of completion at follow-up; with patients expressing confusion to researchers conducting the interviews about how to complete these measures (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">supplementary file 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012422TB3">table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012422TB4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Outcome measures including raw scores and effect size</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Follow-up<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcome measure</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>Mean (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group<break/>Mean (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean difference between groups at follow-up (95% CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scale range</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Effect size (95% CI)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Secondary outcome measures</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.2 (14.9)<break/>n=17</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.0 (12.2)<break/>n=20</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;4.2 (&#x02212;13.2&#x000a0;to 4.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16&#x02013;64</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.31 (&#x02212;0.96&#x000a0;to 0.35)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Self-Efficacy for Exercise Scale (SEE)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.9 (21.7)<break/>n=18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.2 (17.8)<break/>n=18</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.3 (&#x02212;5.2&#x000a0;to 21.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x02013;80</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42 (&#x02212;0.25&#x000a0;to 1.08)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Visual Analogue Score-fear of falling (VAS-FOF)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8 (2.9)<break/>n=24</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.0 (2.5)<break/>n=23</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.2 (&#x02212;1.4&#x000a0;to 1.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0&#x02013;10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.07 (&#x02212;0.50&#x000a0;to 0.64)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" rowspan="1">Physical function tests</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Eight-Foot Get-Up-and-Go Test</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.6 (6.1)<break/>n=15</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.9 (6.0)<break/>n=12</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.6 (&#x02212;5.4&#x000a0;to 4.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unlimited</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.12 (&#x02212;0.64&#x000a0;to 0.88)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>&#x02003;Fifty-Foot Walk Test</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>19.3 (6.7)</bold><break/><bold>n=12</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>31.5 (42.3)</bold><break/><bold>n=12</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>12.2 (&#x02212;13.5&#x000a0;to 37.8)</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Unlimited</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>0.40 (&#x02212;0.41&#x000a0;to 1.20)</bold></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Thirty-second Sit To Stand</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.0 (3.6)<break/>n=11</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.1 (3.9)<break/>n=10</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02212;0.9 (&#x02212;4.3&#x000a0;to 2.5)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unlimited</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.24 (&#x02212;0.62&#x000a0;to 1.10)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Bold typeface denotes medium effect size.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>At 3-month follow-up, 49 sets of data were available for analysis.

GPs were the health professional the participants were most likely to see, with practice nurses their second highest accessed healthcare professional. During the 3&#x02005;months prior to baseline costs to primary care services were minimal, with the costs of secondary (hospital) services accounting for the majority of total service costs (98%). During the 3-month prior to follow-up, the control and intervention groups accessed primary care services and social care services, predominantly. There were high levels of polypharmacy in the economic sample, on average, taking more than five medicines at the time of completing the CSRI questionnaire.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Service use costs were mainly accrued by secondary (hospital) services (96%), as patients underwent surgery and required time in hospital to recover. Fifty-one per cent (n=22) of the sample reported longer than average inpatient stays postsurgery. At follow-up, the intervention group reported an average length of stay of 15.2&#x02005;days, and the control group 10.5&#x02005;days in an inpatient orthopaedic trauma ward, compared with the NHS average length of stay of 14.3&#x02005;days. Also at follow-up, the intervention group reported an average length of stay at a rehabilitation inpatient ward of 12.1&#x02005;days, and the control group 18.8&#x02005;days, compared with the NHS average of 11.6&#x02005;days. Longer inpatient stays were reported by 67% (n=14) of the intervention group and 36% (n=8) of the control group.

Because of the geographical spread of participants and clinical commitments of therapists in Gwynedd and Anglesey, it was not possible to conduct focus groups in this area, but a control group participant was able to attend a focus group in central region and one physiotherapist and two technical instructors participated in individual telephone interviews. The study was acceptable to patients, carers and therapists and the intervention was viewed positively. The most useful component according to participants was the extra sessions that they received. The goal-setting diary and workbook were seen as useful supporting documents by the majority of intervention group participants. Other findings were that in the context of variable usual rehabilitation care, which led to uncertainty among patients and carers about what to expect, the role of the therapist was extremely important in managing patients' expectations. Lack of information, particularly in the usual care group, led to unrealistic expectations in patients, with anger and frustration at their perceived lack of progress, which was addressed to some degree by the study intervention documents. An important part of the therapist's role was to reassure patients that they were progressing normally, and to give patients confidence that they could perform their physical activities safely and to counteract the fear of falling. This was particularly important to patients at the beginning of their rehabilitation, but therapists, particularly fully qualified physiotherapists, often overlooked its importance. Technical instructors appeared to be more aware of their role in psychological support of the patient, in addition to physical rehabilitation. Patients valued individualised care and support, which included the recognition of patients' unique rehabilitation needs, tailoring of care to suit these needs, and personalised goal-setting as a motivational tool. These activities were well supported by the workbook and the goal-setting diary and therapists commented that these supporting documents may be of particular use to those with cognitive impairment. Regular home visits with intervention therapists provided consistency and allowed a relationship to build between patient and rehabilitation therapist, which was important for patient engagement.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012422TB6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;6</label><caption><p>Focus group participant details</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Participant type</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Attendees</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and carers in the control group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">East</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient, F, 69 years, 14&#x02005;months postdischarge, discharged directly home and Carer, M<break/>Patient, F, 80 years, 14&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home and Carer, M<break/>Patient, M, 67 years, 7&#x02005;months postdischarge, discharged directly home<break/>(n=5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and carers in the control group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Central</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient, F, 67 years, 11&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home<break/>Patient, M, 67 years, 12&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home and Carer, F<break/>Patient, F, 83 years, 6&#x02005;months postfracture, inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge home<break/>Patient, F, 75 years, 12&#x02005;months postfracture, inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge home<break/>(n=5)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and carers in the intervention group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">East</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient, F, 86 years, 5&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home<break/>Patient, F, 86 years, 8&#x02005;months postfracture, inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge home<break/>Patient, F, 69 years, 14&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home<break/>(n=3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient and carers in the intervention group</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Central</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Patient, F, 70 years, 7&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home<break/>Patient, M, 81 years, 6&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home and Carer, F<break/>Patient, M, 74 years, 5&#x02005;months postfracture, discharged directly home and Carer, F<break/>Patient, F, 80 years, 7&#x02005;months postfracture, inpatient rehabilitation prior to discharge home and Carer, M<break/>(n=7)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthcare professionals</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">East</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Clinical specialist physiotherapist, two orthopaedic physiotherapists, physiotherapy technical instructor<break/>(n=4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthcare professionals</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Central</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Orthopaedic acute physiotherapist, rotational physiotherapist, physiotherapy technical instructor<break/>(n=3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Healthcare professionals</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">West</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">One-to-one phone interviews were conducted with an acute orthopaedic physiotherapist and two technical instructors</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s6"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Summary of main findings</title><p>Participants recruited to the cohort and feasibility study were similar in terms of gender, type of hip fracture and type of surgery, but the feasibility study participants were younger and less likely to die or be readmitted to hospital during the 3-month follow-up period. A mean AMTS score of 9.1 also indicates low levels of cognitive impairment. Recruitment and retention rates were acceptable, although the recruitment process was challenging due to the need to approach patients soon after surgery following a traumatic injury. The majority of patients required multiple visits prior to consent. The trial methods were feasible in terms of randomisation and outcome measure collection. The new rehabilitation intervention was acceptable to patients and clinicians. The intervention group showed a moderate improvement in their ability to perform activities of daily living as well as small improvements in self-efficacy and mental health. Paradoxically, the control group showed a moderate improvement in the 50-foot walk test, but this was shown to be down to an outlier. The NEADL was more responsive than the BADL and the most responsive measure of self-efficacy was the FES-I.</p><p>The economic evaluation found that the intervention cost &#x000a3;231 per person to deliver. There was a small relative improvement in QALY in the intervention group, albeit with a wide CI. There was an equal drop in ICECAP-O capability indices in both groups. Service use costs were greater in the intervention group, due to longer inpatient stays unrelated to the rehabilitation intervention.</p><p>The focus group findings were that in the context of variable usual rehabilitation care, the role of the therapist was extremely important in managing patients' needs and expectations. This was especially so at the beginning of rehabilitation, for giving permission about what physical activity was safe to do. Regular home visits allowed a relationship to build between patient and rehabilitation therapist, which was important for patient engagement. Patients valued the use of tailored care and personal goal setting as a motivational tool. These activities were well supported by the workbook and the goal-setting diary.</p></sec><sec id="s6b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>For reasons of patient confidentiality, the cohort used anonymised data, so it was not possible to match participants in the cohort with those in the feasibility study. The numbers suggest that the feasibility study identified 81% of those in the cohort. It is not known how the 19% who were not identified in the feasibility study differed, nor is it known why they were identified in the cohort but not in the feasibility study.</p><p>This was a single-centre feasibility study conducted in one local health board at its three acute hospital sites in North Wales. It was able to assess the feasibility of trial methods in terms of recruitment, randomisation and outcome measurement. The NHS REC did not permit us to recruit participants who lacked mental capacity, which has implications for the generalisability of our findings in this important group. A process evaluation was performed as part of the feasibility study and will be reported separately.</p><p>We were also able to assess different outcome measures, to determine which would be the most suitable for a larger definitive RCT. As a younger, healthier subpopulation of the cohort was recruited to the feasibility study, baseline scores for the BADL were high, causing a ceiling effect in this measure. The NEADL was more responsive than the BADL for measuring the ability to perform activities of daily living in this population. The self-efficacy scales for falls and for exercise were more responsive than the general self-efficacy scale, but researchers reported that many participants struggled to understand the exercise self-efficacy scale, so the falls self-efficacy scale (FES-I) seems the most appropriate measure of self-efficacy for the main definitive RCT. The most appropriate health economic outcome measure was EQ-5D. The physical function test with a medium effect size, &#x02018;50-foot walk&#x02019; test, showed better function in the control than the intervention group. There were several possible explanations for this anomalous result. An outlier was identified which contributed to the apparent difference and in addition, physical function tests were performed on average 3&#x02005;weeks later in the control group, so participants had longer to recover from surgery. Because of the nature of the 50-foot walk test, no adjustment could be made for patients' function at baseline. The only physical function test to have this adjustment was grip strength and here the difference between the groups at follow-up was reduced by including the baseline score as a covariate. It was also only possible to include results for participants who were able to complete the test without using any adaptations such as the use of a walking aid. While the use of cost-utility or cost-effectiveness analyses have been recommended by NICE (2011) as needed in the area of proximal femoral fracture, they were not appropriate for use in this feasibility study as it was not powered to demonstrate effectiveness. However, the cost-consequence analysis used is championed as a method particularly relevant to economic evaluations alongside public health interventions.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;41</xref></p><p>While the content of intervention and usual care sessions may have contained similar exercise activities, care pathways in this area did not use patient-led goal-setting or provide written information on what to expect during recovery. In addition, the provision of usual care sessions was variable, while the intervention offered continuity and a definite number of sessions. These were major components of the intervention, which were only available to participants randomised to that group. While it is possible that other participants may have viewed information materials if they were used in group sessions, the one-to-one aspect of the delivery minimised the possibility of intervention contamination.</p></sec><sec id="s6c"><title>Comparison with previous literature</title><p>Although there have been other studies of rehabilitation interventions that combined the promotion of physical exercise and practice of activities of daily living with psychological interventions designed to tackle self-efficacy and fear of falling,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> there have been none set in the UK NHS. While we observed fewer deaths and readmissions in the feasibility study population compared with our cohort population, the recruitment of younger, healthier patients to a physical activity or exercise intervention study was not surprising and has been reported previously.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The overall recruitment rate of eligible patients was 23% and the main reason for non-recruitment was perceived study burden.

<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The intervention applied in this feasibility trial used personalised goal setting and diaries to provide a record of progress during rehabilitation, using a similar ethos to two earlier studies<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> of patient-centred approaches to rehabilitation. One found that an integrated care pathway with a focus on motivation for rehabilitation and early ambulation was less costly and more effective than the usual care pathway.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The other found that an accelerated rehabilitation intervention was more cost-effective than usual care.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Goal setting and supporting patient's self-efficacy was seen to be important in helping patients engage with their rehabilitation. Another study on patient empowerment<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> also found that empowered patients were more likely to benefit from their rehabilitation and return to previous living.</p></sec><sec id="s6d"><title>Implications for future practice and research</title><p>This intervention should be tested in a definitive phase III RCT. It would be advantageous to include those who lack mental capacity as this would improve generalisability of trial results and increase the pool of potential participants. Although we were not able to test the feasibility of recruiting these patients, feedback from healthcare professionals highlighted the potential benefit of the intervention to those lacking capacity. Owing to the observed ceiling effect in the BADL in our recruited population, the primary outcome measure should be the NEADL for effectiveness and EQ-5D for the economic evaluation. The FES-I should be used to measure self-efficacy. The adjusted mean difference in NEADL between groups in this feasibility study was three, which is considered a clinically significant change. Others have suggested that the minimum clinically significant difference is 2.4 and so this has been used within the sample size calculation for a future study.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Based on a t-test with &#x003b1; of 5% and 90% power to detect a difference of 2.4 (SD=5.86), 254 participants would be required to complete the trial over both treatment groups. When considering the 79% retention rate, a full trial of similar design would need to recruit 322 participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>While recruitment was challenging, we achieved acceptable recruitment and retention rate. Screening methods successfully identified 81% of patients with hip fracture, but the feasibility study recruited a younger sample with fewer complications compared with the anonymised cohort. The intervention was acceptable to patients, carers and healthcare professionals, and the intervention was viewed positively. The trial methods were feasible, including the collection of costs and outcome data for a future economic evaluation. Baseline scores in the intervention and control groups of the feasibility study were similar, but there was imbalance in the NEADL, which had a medium effect size while most outcome measures had a small effect size in favour of the intervention. Owing to the ceiling effect observed in the BADL and the greater responsiveness of the NEADL, this should be the primary outcome measure of a future definitive RCT.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The FEMuR team would like to thank all participants who took part in the study.
