In the first sub-study, gastric pH was measured in 203 participants. In the second sub-study, mucosal permeability, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and anti-LPS antibodies, and serum soluble tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 (sTNFR55) concentrations were measured in 87 participants. Up to three stool samples were also analysed microbiologically for detection of asymptomatic intestinal infection. Gastric histology was subsequently analysed in a third subset (n = 37) to assist in interpretation of the pH data.

In multivariate analysis, HIV infection (OR 4.1; 95%CI 2.2-7.8; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) was associated with hypochlorhydria, but taking anti-retroviral treatment (OR 0.16; 0.04-0.67; <italic>P </italic>= 0.01) and allocation to micronutrient supplementation (OR 0.53; 0.28-0.99; <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05) were protective. Hypochlorhydria was associated with increased risk of salmonellosis. Mild (grade 1) gastric atrophy was found in 5 participants, irrespective of <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>or HIV status. Intestinal permeability, LPS concentrations in serum, anti-LPS IgG, and sTNFR55 concentrations did not differ significantly between micronutrient and placebo groups.

Diarrhoeal disease is a major contributor to infectious disease morbidity and mortality in developing countries especially in children and in AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Malnutrition has long been associated with increased susceptibility to, and worse outcomes from, infectious disease. In terms of diarrhoeal disease micronutrients may be critical for robust host defence. In particular, deficiency of vitamin A is associated with increased mortality in children and the benefit of vitamin A supplementation is probably at least partly attributable to reduced mortality from diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. There is convincing evidence that zinc supplementation improves outcomes in children with diarrhoea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and most trials suggest that it reduces diarrhoea incidence when given prophylactically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In HIV infection there is mixed evidence that micronutrient supplementation reduces morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and some evidence suggests that selenium supplementation can raise CD4 counts in AIDS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the mechanisms by which micronutrients reduce the impact of diarrhoeal disease are entirely unknown. Evidence that nutrition directly controls cell-mediated immunity has been largely discredited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and there is no evidence that nutritional interventions have an impact on humoral immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In view of the fact that vitamin A deficiency is associated with breaches of epithelial barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and zinc deficiency is associated with disorders of Paneth and other intestinal epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we hypothesised that micronutrient affects barrier function in the gut.</p><p>Bacterial translocation from the gut plays a major role in infection, disease progression and mortality in cirrhosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], in hepatitis C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and in systemic sepsis syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Kupffer cells in the liver constitute the largest compartment of macrophages in the body, presumably there in order to deal with translocation, and there are physico-chemical barriers to penetration and translocation which include gastric acid, the mucus layer, and the integrity of the epithelial layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Gastrointestinal barrier function therefore represents the sum of several factors, and can only loosely be defined. At least one component of this barrier, gastric acid (both in terms of resting pH and pentagastrin-stimulated acid output) has been known for many years to be impaired in AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>It has been known for many years that HIV infection leads to a severe T cell depletion in the intestinal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Recent data indicate that, at least in the SIV model, this T cell population never recovers completely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and it has been proposed that the enteropathy observed in HIV infection leads to bacterial translocation, driving HIV disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We and others, however, have shown that HIV-related enteropathy is largely associated with the later stages of HIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It seems likely that any intervention which could ameliorate or reverse impaired barrier function in HIV infected patients might reduce the systemic immune activation. This immune activation is reflected in elevated circulating cytokines such as interferon -&#x003b3; and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1; (TNF) which behave as predictors of mortality in Zambian adults with AIDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. As part of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of a daily multiple micronutrient supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], we studied several facets of intestinal immunity and here we report our analysis of gastric pH, intestinal permeability, LPS and TNF concentrations in serum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were studied during the course of a cluster-randomised, placebo-controlled trial of daily micronutrients supplementation in a community in Lusaka, Zambia. The trial showed no evidence of benefit on diarrhoea incidence or CD4 count, but severe episodes of diarrhoea and mortality in HIV infection did appear to be reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In summary, 500 adults with or without HIV infection living in one section of Misisi, Lusaka, were recruited and cluster-randomised by household. The multiple micronutrient (MM) supplement was designed to provide at least the recommended nutrient intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] of 15 nutrients (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), and participants were crossed over to the opposite treatment allocation after 2 years. The data were collected at a time when highly active anti-retroviral treatment (HAART) was being introduced into Zambia so some participants had been taking HAART for varying periods of up to 15 months. Ethical approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Committees of the University of Zambia and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

Two sub-studies were carried out on different groups of participants identified at random during the course of the main trial: (i) measurement of gastric pH (n = 203) in participants who had been taking MM or placebo for between 4 and 19 months (median 9 months, IQR 7-15 months); (ii) studies of intestinal permeability (using four sugars), translocation (using LPS and anti-LPS antibodies) and immune activation (using TNF receptor (TNFR) p55) in 86 participants. The gastric pH and translocation sub-studies were carried out at different times for logistic reasons (i.e. workload), the pH study after the cross-over and the translocation study before the cross-over, so although permeability, LPS and TNF were assayed in the same individuals on the same day, no before/after cross-over comparisons within the same individual are available. The allocation of participants to the sub-studies was largely at random, but the translocation study did include 18 participants who elected to undergo the permeability testing rather than the endoscopy. As the treatment allocation was carefully randomised and fully double-blind, we anticipated that this would have no influence on the results of the comparisons within each sub-study. Stool samples (up to 3) were collected from each participant for analysis of carriage of salmonellae and shigellae using standard techniques.</p><sec><title>Gastric pH measurements</title><p>To collect gastric acid, endoscopy was carried out in fasting participants under sedation with midazolam. Aspirates were collected by attaching a 10 ml syringe to the biopsy port of a Pentax FG29W gastroscope which had been carefully flushed with clean water and then air prior to introduction. No aspiration was carried out until the tip of the scope was in the pool of intra-gastric fluid. Gastric pH was measured in aspirates of intra-gastric fluid using Macherey-Nagel pH test strips which are accurate to pH changes of 0.5 (D-52348, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) to avoid contamination of pH probes.</p></sec><sec><title>Permeability: four sugar absorption/secretion testing</title><p>The four sugar test solution used contained 0.5 g xylose, 1 g rhamnose, 5 g lactulose and 0.2 g 3-O-methyl D-glucose (Sigma chemicals, Poole, Dorset, UK) in 100 ml distilled water to constitute an approximately isosmolar solution. After collecting a pre-test sample to exclude prior ingestion of test sugars, participants drank this solution at time 0, and then urine samples were collected for exactly 5 hours and preserved with merthiolate (approximately 0.04% final concentration). Urine samples were frozen at -80&#x000b0;C for transport and analysed by thin layer chromatography as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Xylose recovery, Rhamnose: 3-O-methyl D-Glucose (R:G) ratio, and Lactulose: Rhamnose (L:R) ratio were analysed.</p></sec><sec><title>Lipopolysaccharide concentrations in serum</title><p>Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and anti-lipopolysaccharide antibodies (IgG and IgM) were measured as markers of bacterial translocation. LPS concentrations in serum were measured using the Pyrochrome-LAL kit (Associates of Cape Cod Inc, East Falmouth, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and optimised for incubation time which was determined to be 60 minutes. Endotoxin core antibodies (EndoCAb) IgM and IgG were measured by ELISA as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In brief, polystyrene microplates were pre-coated with an equimolar mixture of incomplete-core rough-mutant endotoxins from each of four species of Gram-negative bacteria, complexed with polymyxin B. An eight-point standard curve was constructed using doubling dilutions of a pooled serum calibrated in EndoCAb median units, where 100 (%) was the median value for IgG or IgM in 1,000 healthy Scottish adults. Test and control samples were diluted 1:200 with dilution buffer and 100 &#x003bc;L of each sample added in triplicate to the plate and incubated for 1 h at 37C. After washing three times with wash buffer (Dulbecco phosphate buffered saline containing 0.1% [v/v] Tween 20), 100 &#x003bc;L of a diluted alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat antihuman IgG or IgM antibody was added to each well. After incubation for 1 h at 37C the plates were washed three times with wash buffer then once with distilled water and blotted dry. Substrate (100 &#x003bc;L per well), comprising 1 mg/ml disodium p-nitrophenylphosphate dissolved in 1 M diethanolamine buffer with 0.5 mM magnesium chloride, was added and the plate incubated at room temperature in the dark for 20-30 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 &#x003bc;L per well of 2 M sodium hydroxide and read at 405 nm.</p></sec><sec><title>Tumour necrosis factor receptor p55 concentrations</title><p>In order to look for correlation between LPS or anti-LPS antibodies and macrophage activation, we measured TNFR (p55) in the same sera which were assayed for LPS and anti-LPS.

We found that hypochlorhydria in fasted adults was associated with HIV infection irrespective of stage, reversed by anti-retroviral therapy and, when adjusted for HIV status in multivariate analysis, reduced by micronutrient supplementation. Although a large body of work has defined hypochlorhydria in terms of gastric acid secretion rate, in this study we only examined gastric pH in one fasting aspirate obtained by endoscopy. While our single fasting sample is almost certainly not as sensitive in detecting hypochlorhydria as measurement of acid secretion rate would be, it is relevant to infectious disease as a snapshot of gastric pH represents the chemical barrier encountered by a pathogen on ingestion. Impaired gastric pH was associated with asymptomatic colonisation by two potentially pathogenic bacterial species, confirming the relevance of this way of analysing gastric pH for this situation.</p><p>We found little evidence that micronutrient supplementation reduced markers of intestinal permeability or bacterial translocation, except for a reduction in anti-LPS IgM concentrations in serum which just reached statistical significance. Interestingly, the anti-LPS IgM was clearly correlated with TNF pathway activation, implying that translocation is indeed a determinant of systemic immune activation in the mixed HIV/tropical enteropathy present in this population. Although anti-LPS IgM was reduced in the MM group, TNFR was not, and it may be that a larger reduction in translocation is required before an effect on TNF pathway activation is detectable. We previously noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] that our intervention had only modest effect on blood measures of vitamin A and zinc, even though the erythrocyte folate response was good, and we speculate that higher doses of micronutrients may have an enhanced effect.</p><p>We do not yet have an explanation for our findings that HIV infection is associated with hypochlorhydria. We had speculated prior to this study that hypochlorhydria would be attributable to malnutrition (low BMI) but this was not the case. Other workers have previously reported changes in parietal cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] but we found minimal evidence of gastric atrophy and we propose that it is due to a specific effect of HIV itself, or perhaps through cytokine secretion, on the parietal cell. We have previously shown that HIV infection is associated with reduced peptic ulceration in Zambian adults co-infected with <italic>Helicobacter pylori </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which may well be explained by the hypochlorhydria we report here, but the cellular and molecular nature of the interaction between HIV and <italic>H. pylori </italic>needs further work. Unlike increased permeability, hypochlorhydria seems to occur at any stage of HIV disease.</p><p>In addition to the effect of hypochlorhydria on intestinal infection reported here, and an effect on bacterial overgrowth previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], it might be expected to lead to impaired nutrient absorption, especially iron which is preferentially absorbed in the Fe<sup>2+ </sup>form. Gastric acid converts Fe<sup>3+ </sup>to Fe<sup>2+</sup>. Iron deficiency in children has been reversed by <italic>H. pylori </italic>eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], although in another study there was no difference in fractional absorption of iron from a test meal in hypochlorhydric children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. The impact of HIV-related hypochlorhydria on iron metabolism remains to be established.</p><p>Recent data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] have given fresh support to the hypothesis that in HIV infection increased intestinal permeability is responsible for bacterial translocation and systemic immune activation. Although we found a significant correlation between anti-LPS IgM (a marker of bacterial translocation) and TNFRp55, we found no correlation between permeability and translocation markers. One possible explanation for this is that background tropical enteropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] allows translocation in the absence of HIV, perhaps by mechanisms other than paracellular permeability. The median LPS concentration in serum in the HIV negative participants in our current study (51 pg/ml) was similar to that found in chronic HIV infection in the American study and much higher than the HIV seronegative participants in that study (approximately 30 pg/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Alternatively, it may be that lactulose permeation is not an appropriate measure of permeability for assessing risk of bacterial translocation, as it reflects a much smaller pore size than would be required to permit translocation of bacteria or even LPS. Lactulose is an imperfect marker of small intestinal 'leakiness' but in the absence of non-invasive alternatives it has been widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. There are no widely used markers of colonic 'leakiness', which is a major weakness when it comes to understanding translocation. A third explanation is that bacterial translocation due to increased intestinal permeability is mainly a feature of advanced HIV infection. In a previous study of intestinal permeability we found that permeability was only elevated in HIV infected adults with low CD4 counts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Only one of the participants we assessed here had a CD4 count below 200 cells/&#x003bc;L. Previous studies, with few exceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], mostly show that HIV enteropathy is associated with late-stage disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. There are few data from populations where tropical enteropathy is present, but our previous data from Zambia and older data from Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] support the idea that there is little difference in permeability between early HIV and tropical enteropathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>The study was designed by PK and IRS.
