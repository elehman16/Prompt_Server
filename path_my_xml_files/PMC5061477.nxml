Three categories of herbs are distinguished in Cherokee medicine, namely, food herbs, medicinal herbs, and poison herbs [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The food herbs are mild in action and are expected to have very low toxicity. One of such food herbs is the plant <italic>Theobroma cacao</italic>. The species <italic>T. cacao</italic> belongs to the class <italic>Equisetopsida</italic> and family <italic>Malvaceae</italic>. Cocoa is a major nutraceutical in Ghana and most parts of Africa. As a food herb, it is used by most indigenous people either in a raw state using the bean or the pod, as dark chocolate, and as a beverage in a powdered form obtained from the cocoa bean. Research works are currently directed at gathering plant materials from the rain forests and other places for their potential medicinal values [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Cocoa contains water-soluble polyphenols (also called flavanols), which include catechins, epicatechin, procyanidins, anthocyanins, and leukoanthocyanins [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The quantitative analysis of unsweetened natural cocoa powder (UNCP) has also been well researched and proven that even flavanol contents are not likely to change during different manufacturing processes [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Several polyphenols such as 14 N-phenylpropenoyl-L-amino acids, N-[4&#x02019;-hydroxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-tryptophan, and N-[4&#x02019;-hydroxy-3&#x02019;-methoxy-(E)-cinnamoyl]-L-tyrosine have also been identified [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Pharmacologically, cocoa is known to exert antioxidant [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], anti-inflammatory [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], antimalarial, and anti-asthmatic properties [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Studies have also shown that UNCP could protect the liver, kidney, and heart against chemical injury in animals [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The antioxidant properties of these flavanols are ascribed partly to their structural characteristics, and it represents the molecular basis for their radical-scavenging property [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In spite of cocoa&#x02019;s antimalarial activity, its ability to increase nitric oxide (NO) production [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], white blood cell (WBC), and platelet counts (PLT) without changing hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (HGB) levels could be of immense importance in malaria-infected individuals [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Artemether-lumefantrine (A-L) is a preferred artemisinin-based antimalarial in Ghana. Studies have shown that artemether can induce changes in hematological profiles in rats, which may aggravate anemia in malaria patients [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Besides, A-L has been found to reduce red blood cell count (RBC), HGB, and packed cell volume (PCV) in patients under treatment [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Though the WHO-recommended artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) [<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] has impressive parasiticidal properties both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, there have been issues of treatment failures, resistance, and increasing cases of toxic effects [<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Some countries have, therefore, considered increasing the dose of A-L used in the management of malaria to arrest the issue of resistance [<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, increase in dose implies that there will be increased side effects, adverse reactions, and other toxic effects [<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A-L administration has been found to reduce NO levels. On the contrary, other studies have also shown that A-L increases NO levels as a compensatory mechanism in cases of reduced NO levels [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>UNCP, prepared after removal of the cocoa butter from powdered cocoa beans, is taken several times on a daily basis as a beverage by patients while on treatment with A-L, a common practice in Ghana. Hematological parameters are one of the vital indices monitored during malaria treatment.</p><p>It is against this background that this study was conducted to investigate the effect of UNCP on the hematological parameters and NO levels during high-dose (HD) A-L administration.</p><p>The result of this study would serve as one of the scientific premises for discovering the beneficial effect of UNCP during its simultaneous consumption with A-L during malaria treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of UNCP Solution</title><p>The UNCP is a non-alkalized cocoa from Hords Company Ltd.

Erythrocyte counts reflect the total number of RBC per unit volume of circulating blood whereas HGB determinations indicate the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood, and HCT determinations show the proportion of blood that is made up of cellular elements and the proportion that is plasma [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This study imitated the normal duration of Coartem used in Ghana (i.e. 3 days). UNCP at a dose of 75 mg/kg has also been used in previous studies as HD UNCP [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>From the results, A-L administration decreased the levels of WBC count, lymphocyte count, HGB, RBC count, and PLT, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">h</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">l</xref>, respectively, in the NCG (Coartem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Normally, these reduced indices imply bone marrow depression, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, systemic lupus, or severe hemorrhage. The results concurred with similar results documented by the previous researchers that ACTs are known to cause embryonic erythrocyte depletion and delay erythroid differentiation [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The characteristic peroxide lactone structure of the artemether is indispensable for its antimalarial property, thus the splitting of this endoperoxide bridge by heme iron species in the guinea pigs may have resulted in the release of reactive oxygen that induced oxidative stress and caused the decreases that were observed with A-L administration. UNCP restored the decreased levels of HCT, HGB, and RBC, as observed in the A-L control group. Though not studied in this research, this might have been due to the antioxidant activity of UNCP, which is able to mop up the free radicals produced by the artemether moiety. The increased levels with UNCP (particularly with HCT levels) may be observed in dehydrated states as cocoa has been reported to possess diuretic effects. This was also confirmed in the general observations made, especially in the UNCP-treated groups as a general increase in diuresis and water consumption. The changes in body weight remained as an insignificant reduction. The decreased levels of WBC and lymphocyte count with A-L administration observed from the results concur with the previous work by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] who also reported similar results, and that derivatives of artemisinin exhibited potent immunosuppressive activity by decreasing WBC and lymphocytes. However, UNCP restored the decreased levels of WBC (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and lymphocyte (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) count as observed with A-L administration alone. The increase in WBC of the experimental guinea pigs meant that the administration of cocoa could boost the immune system, since these cells are important in protecting and fighting infections. This supports and explains the earlier observations that cocoa promotes superlative health by strengthening the immune system and prevents many viral diseases [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>UNCP restored the decreased PLT as observed in A-L [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1l</xref>]. The decreased PLT levels may be indicative of the presence of liver disease caused by the hepatotoxic effect of the HD A-L. Normally, PLT diminishes due to PLT trapping leading to enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). Splenomegaly due to artemether has been known since decades [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The mean corpuscular values (MCV and MCH), obtained from the RBC count, HCT, and HGB, are usually useful in elucidating and classifying anemia morphologically; they represent an estimation of the alterations in size and HGB content of individual RBC [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Results of this study showed that there were no significant differences in MCV and MCH during UNCP intake following A-L administration, and this may be due to the absorption of iron from cocoa (non-heme iron source), which is not high, since the absorption of non-heme iron is less efficient as compared to heme iron sources [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Besides, the polyphenols contained in UNCP are known to decrease the absorption of non-heme iron [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The effect on the RBC notwithstanding HGB levels was not significantly affected. Perhaps, a more prolonged intake of cocoa could have had an effect that may be worth further investigating.</p><p>The differential leukocyte counts reflect the systemic status of an animal in relation to its response and adjustment to injurious agents, stress, and/or deprivation; the indices are of value in confirming or eliminating a tentative diagnosis, in making a prognosis and guiding therapy [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. It could further provide information on the severity of an injurious agent, the virulence of an infecting organism, the susceptibility of a host, and the nature, severity, and duration of a disease process [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. From the results, the administration of A-L and UNCP did not have any influence on neutrophil count, monocyte count, eosinophil count, and basophil count, as seen with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">f</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">g</xref>. This observation may be due to the resiliency of the bone marrow which is able to resist the effects of some chemical agents and also the short-term administration of both A-L and UNCP. The inconsistency in basophil numbers as observed in the results following the administration of A-L followed by UNCP, and even sometimes, their total absence in blood of rodents (guinea pigs) is a normal occurrence. The increase in lymphocyte observed with UNCP administration may also be due to the fact that lymphocytes can also originate from sites other than the bone marrow such as the thymus [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The UNCP and A-L combination increased the levels of NO as compared to the other groups [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. These no increase in the animals that received both UNCP and A-L could be attributed to the flavonoid content of the unsweetened natural cocoa [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Flavonoid-rich chocolate and cocoa drinks have been found to increase NO levels. Other studies have shown that A-L increases the level of oxidants such as superoxides (O<sup>2&#x02212;</sup>) and peroxides (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), leading to oxidative stress. This further leads to a reduction in NO levels, since superoxides and peroxides are considered as NO scavengers [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The rise in NO observed in the A-L administered group could be as a result of a compensatory mechanism trying to restore the NO level, which is in line with other findings [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The high increase in NO levels observed in the cocoa and A-L combinations, especially in the animals receiving 300 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg of UNCP, may be indicative of enhanced protective effects of UNCP at these dose levels. This is extremely important in view of the effect of A-L on hematology as observed by other researchers [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Other studies have also revealed that the highest antihypertensive effect (due to NO vasodilator effects) of an orally administered flavonol-rich cocoa powder to spontaneously hypertensive rats was at a dose of 300 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. From our calculations, optimum effect of UNCP in preventing potential A-L induced hematotoxicity lies between 300 and 900 mg/kg. This corresponds to between 2 teaspoonful and 6 teaspoonful of UNCP daily [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is evident from the above that a daily dose of 300, 900, and 1500 mg/kg corresponds to 4.54 g, 13.42 g, and 22.70 g UNCP daily, respectively.</p><p>The normal recommended use of UNCP in Ghana as a beverage is 1-2 teaspoonful 3 times daily (i.e., 5 g - 15.0 g daily). The phytochemical components of UNCP are likely to play a major role, and since UNCP is a non-alkalized powder, it is likely to have a greater percentage of total polyphenols, increased epicatechin and proanthocyanidins, as compared to alkalized cocoa powder. Though comparatively this was not part of this study, other studies have proved these differences in phytochemical composition [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>This study contributes much to the hematoprotective potential of UNCP during HD A-L administration, since in the pathogenesis of malarial infection, hematological values are also paramount. It is important to determine the mechanism of this activity and the quantitative components of UNCP in further studies. Besides, it would be more expedient to conduct further studies in malarious guinea pigs much more, as UNCP has been found to possess antimalarial activity [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, this study may have a beneficial impact on therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>UNCP restored some hematological disorders induced by A-L in guinea pigs by causing a significant increase in lymphocyte and PLT levels at a dose of 1500 mg/kg that was otherwise decreased by the administration of HD A-L.
