We hypothesized that sleep quality would be poor even in patients with clinically stable COPD, that concomitant medical and psychiatric conditions would be associated with poor sleep quality which would, in turn, be associated with worse HRQoL, and that poor sleep quality at study enrollment would be associated with having more frequent exacerbations, possibly due to the associated burden of concomitant disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Sample and design</title><p>Details of the parent study are described elsewhere.<xref rid="b14-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Briefly, patients were aged &#x02265;40 years, had moderate to severe COPD assessed by spirometry, and were considered to be at increased risk of having an exacerbation over the one-year course of the trial.

There are a number of medical and psychiatric comorbidities often associated with COPD contributing to poor sleep quality. Indices of HRQoL and DSQoL were worse in those with poor sleep (PSQI &#x0003e;5) than in those with good sleep (PSQI &#x02264;5). Patients with good sleep quality had a greater time to first exacerbation compared with those with poor sleep quality. In the ensuing discussion, we consider these findings in light of the currently available literature.</p><sec><title>Sleep quality in COPD</title><p>To our knowledge, this is one of the largest, well-characterized COPD cohorts with data on sleep quality. Our findings are consistent with those of others demonstrating a high prevalence of sleep disturbances in COPD.<xref rid="b3-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In spite of a high prevalence of poor sleep quality, only 21% of patients reported daytime dysfunction due to sleepiness. This may seem surprising given the prevalence of poor sleep scores, low sleep durations, and prolonged sleep latencies. Possibly, participants under-reported the extent to which they had poor daytime function due to nocturnal sleep problems. Alternatively, the items in the PSQI may be inadequate to capture daytime dysfunction in this population, as participants may be homebound, anxious, and/or depressed. These factors could reduce social activities or impair a participant&#x02019;s ability to measure daytime function. Scharf et al also reported a low incidence of daytime sleepiness in spite of a high incidence of poor sleep quality.<xref rid="b6-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> They speculated that COPD patients may be &#x0201c;hyper-alert&#x0201d; because of heightened sympathetic activity, medication effects, and/or anxiety. Future studies should use objective testing to determine if patients with stable COPD have neurocognitive deficits commonly associated with chronic sleep deprivation, or are indeed &#x0201c;hyper-alert&#x0201d;.</p><p>Indices of airflow obstruction were not significantly different between good and poor sleepers. While this may seem surprising, patients were preselected to have airflow obstruction as measured on spirometry.<xref rid="b14-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Kwon et al<xref rid="b10-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> reported that hyperinflation was associated with worse sleep efficiency in patients with concomitant COPD and obstructive sleep apnea. In the present study, lung volumes were not measured and we cannot determine if hyperinflation was a physiologic factor associated with worse sleep quality.</p><p>Certain comorbid conditions were associated with poor sleep quality, including certain types of cardiovascular disease (although the category as a whole was not associated with sleep quality), as were gastrointestinal, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and all categories of psychiatric disease. This is not surprising, as these categories of disease are associated with physical or psychologic discomfort and are known to lead to insomnia.</p><p>It is likely that the medications associated with worse sleep quality are markers for underlying comorbidities including depression, anxiety, and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, which may worsen sleep quality. The issue of sleep quality and medications in COPD has been extensively considered.<xref rid="b7-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Subjects receiving opioids had worse sleep, pointing to the need to assess pain as a source of sleep difficulties in this population. On the other hand, opioids are associated with sleep disordered breathing, which could have affected sleep.<xref rid="b22-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Use of hypnotics was associated with worse sleep quality. We cannot determine from the data whether this is a drug effect or whether administration of the drug is a marker for the insomnia associated with a major medical or psychiatric condition. Finally, we did not find that use of oxygen was associated with different sleep quality. This may seem surprising because correction of nocturnal hypoxia would be thought to improve sleep quality. However, while the beneficial effects of nocturnal oxygen on mortality are well established, the effects of nocturnal oxygen on sleep quality have not been extensively studied, and polysomnographic studies of sleep quality with and without oxygen in patients with nocturnal desaturation have yielded conflicting results.<xref rid="b23-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Approximately 20% of our patients reported a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. However, similar to previous findings,<xref rid="b6-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> these patients did not report worse sleep quality. One would have expected that patients with sleep apnea would have demonstrated worse sleep quality. However, patients with sleep apnea were not admitted to this study unless they were on treatment and stable. We did not routinely perform polysomnography, and cannot estimate the true incidence of sleep-disordered breathing in our subjects. Recent studies indicate that sleep disordered breathing may be more prevalent in COPD than previously estimated and may be more prevalent that estimated here.<xref rid="b25-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Sleep quality and exacerbations</title><p>Good sleep quality at baseline was associated with an increased time to first exacerbation, and decreased exacerbation rate. No difference in mortality was seen between good and poor sleepers. However, the number of deaths was relatively small, and it is possible that there was not sufficient power to detect a difference in mortality. After adjustment for major concomitant medical conditions that themselves could be associated with worsening symptoms, there were no significant differences in time to first exacerbation or exacerbation rate between good and poor sleepers. Similarly, major mental health conditions such as depression<xref rid="b27-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> can predict worse clinical course.</p><p>It is also possible that poor sleep quality reflects underlying pathophysiologic responses to COPD that would make it more likely that participants will undergo exacerbations or even die. These include secretion of higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, greater chronic burden of airway pathogens, and undiagnosed sleep disordered breathing. Better sleep quality itself might have a beneficial effect on patients with COPD. Sleep deprivation is known to be a risk factor for a number of adverse health outcomes, including glucose intolerance, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease,<xref rid="b28-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and can lead to worsening airflow obstruction in COPD,<xref rid="b29-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> possibly potentiating the tendency for exacerbations.</p><p>Finally, respiratory infection is one of the most important causes of exacerbation in COPD. Latent pulmonary aspiration during sleep is a cause of respiratory infection in the elderly. In the &#x0201c;poor sleepers&#x0201d;, the use of antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics, anti-seizure medications, and opioids were significantly more frequent than in the &#x0201c;good sleepers&#x0201d;. These medicines may impair laryngeal and cough function during sleep, predisposing to respiratory infections.</p></sec><sec><title>Sleep quality and quality of life</title><p>As previously shown,<xref rid="b4-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> sleep quality was worse with worsening HRQoL and DSQoL. This present study confirms these previous reports using a larger sample of moderate to severely ill patients. Similar to these findings, the PSQI was a predictor of asthma-related quality of life.<xref rid="b30-copd-10-389" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Hence, it appears that in patients with obstructive lung disease, sleep quality should be taken into account when interpreting HRQoL and DSQoL.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Sleep quality was assessed by self-report without objective validation. It is possible that estimates of sleep time may be inaccurate in a relatively inactive population where daytime dozing may not be included in sleep time estimates and may influence night-time sleep quality. Future studies should consider objective assessments of sleep quality as well as daytime cognitive function in COPD patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with moderate to severe COPD report a high prevalence of disturbed sleep and poor sleep quality. There is an association between sleep quality and quality of life. Finally, poor sleep quality was associated with COPD exacerbations in that poor sleepers had a lower time to first exacerbation.
