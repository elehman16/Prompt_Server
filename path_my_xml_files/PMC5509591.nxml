lingual strength and articulator function in stroke patients with dysarthria. [Subjects
and Methods] 16 stroke patients with dysarthria were randomly assigned into two groups:
the experimental group (n=8) or the control group (n=8). Both groups received the
conventional rehabilitation therapy at 30&#x02005;min/day, 5 times for week, and during 4 weeks,
and the experimental group received an additional 30&#x02005;min of LST using the Iowa Oral
Performance Instrument (IOPI). The Maximum Isometric Tongue Pressures (MIPs) was used to
assess the lingual strength and the Alternating-Motion Rate (AMR) and Sequential-Motion
Rate (SMR) were used to measure the articulator function. [Results] After the
intervention, the experimental group showed a significant improvement in MIPs and AMR
(/t&#x00259;/) than the control group. [Conclusion] Findings of this study suggest that LST
provides positive effects on lingual strength and articulator function, and thus can be
used as an interventional method in stroke patients with dysarthria.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dysarthria</kwd><kwd>Articulator function</kwd><kwd>Lingual strength training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dysarthria following stroke has been reported to occur in 20&#x02013;30% of cases<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stroke patients with dysarthria generally
experience difficulty in articulating or performing appropriate gestures<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Production of articulation is a complex and
precise process that is accomplished by sophisticated control and proper integration of
about 70&#x02013;80 palatal and facial muscles, including the respiratory system, pharynx, larynx,
and articulator<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It reduces their
relationships with family members and likely results in a decrease of quality of life<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Intervention methods for improvement of articulator function include interactions such as
orofacial exercise, articulator relaxation, and tongue strengthening. Among the behavioral
approach of speech disorder treatment, non-articulation oromotor training reported an
improvement of articulator function through previous studies<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lingual exercise is effective in improving the oromotor function by increasing the strength
and range of motion of tongue; this improvement is also important in articulation
production<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, it has been
reported to have positive effects on patients with dysarthria due to its positive effect on
pronunciation clearness<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous
studies, tongue was an important articulator and was closely related to the production of
articulation and accuracy of pronunciation<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Lingual strength training (LST) has been reported to improve not only articulator function,
but also to improve oromotor movement of stroke patients. Robbins et al. reported an
increase in tongue strength and improved oromotor function in stroke patients through LST
using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to the meta-analysis of Adams et al., although IOPI may be a reliable method to
measure the strength and endurance of the tongue, its effect on neurological groups, such as
stroke, was poor<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, previous
studies on LST using IOPI have mostly focused on swallowing function, and studies related to
LST articulator function using IOPI are very limited in the literature.</p><p>Therefore, to demonstrated the effect of LST for improvement of dysarthria, this study
investigated the effect of LST on lingual strength and articulator function of stroke
patients with dysarthria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 16 patients with dysarthria receiving rehabilitation therapy at a hospital in
Seoul were recruited. The criteria for selection were as follows: (1) the onset period of
stroke was more than 3 months, (2) the diagnosis of paralytic dysfunction was given by a
rehabilitation medicine doctor, (3) the MMSE score was 24 or more, and (4) maximum isometric
tongue pressures (MIPs) using IOPI were less than 40 kPa. The exclusion criteria were: (1)
difficult to evaluate using IOPI and (2) pain during lingual strength exercise. All
participants were informed of the contents and procedure of the experiment. This study was
approved by the Gachon University Institutional Review Board (1044396-201606-HR-046-01).</p><p>Sixteen stroke patients were randomly assigned to two groups: the experimental group (n=8)
and the control group (n=8). Both groups received conventional rehabilitation therapy for
30&#x02005;min a day, five times a week, for a period of four weeks, and the experimental group
received an additional 30&#x02005;min of LST using IOPI. Conventional rehabilitation therapy has
received physical and occupational therapy.</p><p>LST was performed in the experimental group in the following manner<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. LST was performed 30 times in the anterior portion of the
tongue based on the target value set in IOPI. Training was repeated 10 times, with 10
seconds of rest in between each repetition. Regarding the position of the bulb during LST,
the evaluator fixed the bulb directly to the alveolar ridge of the hard palate so that it
could be in contact with the tongue tip by for about 10&#x02005;mm. Then, the bulb was pressed
against the hard palate for 2 seconds with the maximum pressure of the tongue.</p><p>IOPI was used to measure MIPs in the two groups, and the alternating motion rate (AMR) and
sequential motion rate (SMR) were measured to evaluate the articulation function. All
measurements were performed by an occupational therapist with six years of clinical
experience.</p><p>IOPI was used to measure MIPs of subjects. IOPI consists of the tongue bulb, connecting
tube, data output jack, and input terminal. MIPs were measured three times in a row, and the
average value was recorded. The intra-rater reliability of IOPI was 0.76&#x02013;0.99, suggesting
high reliability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>AMR and SMR were performed to evaluate the articulator function. The syllable task (/p&#x00259;/,
/t&#x00259;/, /c&#x00259;/) is described to perform AMR. The experiments were performed by repeating one
syllable of /p&#x00259;/, /t&#x00259;/, and /c&#x00259;/ for 5 seconds quickly and accurately to measure the number
of single syllables. The mean score of the syllable was calculated for 5 seconds, and the
mean value was calculated 3-times<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>SMR measured the number of sequential syllables by alternately repeating /p&#x00259; t&#x00259; c&#x00259;/ for
exactly 5 seconds at the highest possible speed. For test standardization, the mean value
was calculated by taking three measurements<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An analysis of collected data was performed using SPSS 22.0. In this study, the normality
of variables was tested using Shapiro-Wilk test and all data did not assume the normality.
Thus, we used non-parametric statistical methods to analyze our data. Mann-Whitney U test
and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were used to analyze the general characteristics of subjects.
Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare within the group. Mann-Whitney U test was used
to compare the differences in MIPs, AMR, and SMR between groups. The statistical
significance level was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of the two groups showed no significant difference (p&#x0003e;0.05)

function in stroke patients with dysarthria. After the intervention, there was a
significantly higher MIPs in the experimental group than in the control group. These results
demonstrate that LST also improves the tongue strength in stroke patients with dysarthria,
as well as swallowing patients<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> and
healthy elderly<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; it also has an effect
on articulator function.</p><p>In SMR (/p&#x00259; t&#x00259; c&#x00259;/) measuring the articulator function after the intervention, the
experimental group showed a significant improvement before and after the intervention, but
no significant change was observed in the control group. There was no significant difference
betwe en the two groups in SMR (/p&#x00259; t&#x00259; c&#x00259;/), but in AMR (/t&#x00259;/), the experimental group
showed a significantly larger improvement than the control group.</p><p>In this study, the reason that the experimental group showed a significant improvement in
/t&#x00259;/ than the control group is that /t&#x00259;/ requires more tongue control than /p&#x00259;/ and /c&#x00259;/. In
other words, /t&#x00259;/&#x02014;as compared with /p&#x00259;/ and /c&#x00259;/&#x02014;is an alveolar fricative sound, requiring
greater strength and coordination of the anterior portion of the tongue<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is suggested that the training effect of
LST performed in the experimental group is larger than that of /p&#x00259;/ and /c&#x00259;/.</p><p>Palmer and Enderb reported that strengthening related to the speech mechanism was effective
for the articulation function<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
Mchenry et al. suggested that the articulator should be promoted first to improve the speech
function in stroke patients<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study
has demonstrated that LST, an additional non-speech oromotor exercise, can lead to a
particular improvement in /t&#x00259;/.</p><p>LST is a treatment method that trains its own tongue strength through monitoring of IOPI.
In this case, the effect of biofeedback seems to be more effective than conventional
exercise. Feedback is an important part of the learning process because it provides
information about the differences between the goal and the progress, promoting a more active
attitude toward learning<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
LST performed in this study will be clinically relevant as a remedial approach to strengthen
muscles associated with articulation of stroke patients with dysarthria.</p><p>There are a few limitations to consider. First, sample size was small. Second, the
evaluation used in this study was done only with clinical tools. Finally, we did not measure
the long-term effects after training.</p><p>In conclusion, this study aimed to investigate the effect of LST on tongue strength and
articulator function of stroke patients with dysarthria. The present study suggests that LST
using IOPI can be used as effective intervention methods for tongue strength and
articulation ability of stroke patients with dysarthria.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Sellars</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Langhorne</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Speech and language therapy for dysarthria due to
