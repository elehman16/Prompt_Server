A practically applicable method of evaluating sympathetic tone or responsiveness would be of clinical utility.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation induces clinically relevant changes in haemodynamic variables.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] In addition, studies showing the effect of i-gel, laryngeal mask airway (LMA) and endotracheal tube (ET) insertion on PI versus conventional haemodynamic stress responses are lacking. Also, based on internet research; one study correlate between PI and conventional haemodynamic parameters (heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure [DBP]) during insertion of different airway devices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in PI correlate with non-invasive haemodynamic criteria (HR, SBP, DBP) following i-gel, LMA and ET insertion and to compare its reliability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After local research committee approval and informed patient consent, 60 patients scheduled for elective body surface surgery under general anaesthesia in supine position in our University Hospitals were included in the study. This study is a prospective, randomised, controlled comparative trial. Patients included were ASA Class I or II, Age 21-60 years, BMI less than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Patients with pre-existing cardiovascular, pulmonary or metabolic diseases or anticipated difficult intubation were excluded. Power analysis was based on the detectable difference between the means of HR amongst the LMA and ET=13 beat/min.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] With Standard deviation 10; considering alpha (z&#x003b1;) error (<italic>P</italic>=0.05; therefore, 95% confidence desired (two-tailed test); z&#x003b1; =1.96) and beta (z) error (20% beta error, therefore, 80% power desired (one-tailed test); z&#x003b2; =0.84).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Therefore, the calculated sample was 18 patients/group. By adding 10% of that number to compensate for the dropouts, the final number/groups was about 20 patients/group. Therefore, the total sample size number was 60 patients; randomly allocated to the study groups: ET, LMA and i-gel group (20 patients in each group) using an online research randomiser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">http://www.randomizer.org</ext-link>) into three groups (20 patients each). The patient's age, gender, ASA status, duration and type of surgery were recorded.</p><p>Midazolam 2 mg, Metoclopramide 10 mg was given by intravenous route, 3 min before induction of anaesthesia, The whole technique and anaesthetic procedures were performed by the same researcher anaesthesiologist (Atef HM).</p><p>Electrocardiographic HR and non-invasive oscillometric arterial blood pressure (NIBP) were measured using an S/5 anaesthesia monitor (Datex-Ohmeda, Finland). The PI was monitored using a Masimo Radical SET (Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA). For Masimo Radical SET, the PI upper and lower limits reported by the manufacturer were 0.02-20.00%. The oximeter probe used to monitor the PI was attached to the middle fingertip of the hand contralateral to the site of BP monitoring and was wrapped in a towel to minimise heat loss and contamination by ambient light. Baseline readings of the oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>), arterial blood pressure (ABP), HR were recorded. Pre-oxygenation with 100% oxygen for at least 3 min was carried out. Anaesthesia was induced with intravenous fentanyl 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and propofol 2.5 mg/kg. Rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was administered for mechanical ventilation via the i-gel, LMA and ET. Tracheal intubation or insertion of an airway device was attempted after complete suppression of the TOF as guided by the neuromuscular monitor. In the ET group, intubation of the trachea was attempted with a cuffed tracheal tube (internal diameter 7.5 mm for women and 8.5 mm for men) using direct laryngoscopy. The LMA (Henley-on-Thames, UK) or i-gel (Intersurgical Ltd, Wokingham, Berkshire, UK) was inserted according the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] In the LMA group, the size of LMA was determined by the attending anaesthetist based on the patient's body weight and the manufacturer's recommendation. In the case of i-gel, Gastric tube was inserted through the gastric channel (Size 12 gastric tube for i-gel size #5, gastric tube size 10 for i-gel size #4 and gastric tube size 8 for i-gel #3). If it is not possible to ventilate the lungs, the following airway manoeuver was performed: Chin lift, jaw thrust, head extension, or flexion on the neck. The position was also allowed to be adjusted by gently pushing or pulling the device. After any manoeuver, the adequacy of ventilation was re-assessed. In such cases, the patients were excluded. Patients&#x02019; lungs were mechanically ventilated and minute volume was set to maintain end-tidal CO2 at 30-35 mm Hg. Fluid administration was standardised to 10 mL/kg/h of Ringer's lactate solution, and the ambient temperature was maintained at 25&#x000b0;C-26&#x000b0;C. Throughout the procedure, Isoflurane maintained adequate level of anaesthesia at 1-1.5 of the minimal alveolar concentration, air/oxygen mixture in 50%:50% volume ratios or 100% oxygen. HR, NIBP and PI were measured before induction of anaesthesia and before and after insertion of the airway device every minute for 5 min before starting the surgery. Positive HR, SBP, DBP and PI responses to device insertion were prospectively defined from previous reports as a HR increase of &#x02265;10 bpm, a SBP and DBP increase of &#x02265;15 mm Hg, and a PI decrease &#x02265;10% after the insertion of the devices.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values and negative predictive value were determined for SBP, DBP and PI variables based on HR as the gold standard.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To evaluate the PI as a non-invasive monitor of haemodynamic responses in comparison to HR and blood pressure following insertion of ET, LMA and i-gel.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>To compare the haemodynamic responses to i-gel and LMA insertion with endotracheal intubation using PI.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis was performed using the program SPSS version 15 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) for windows.

The pulsating signal is indexed against the non-pulsating signal and expressed as ratio, it is commonly referred to as the &#x0201c;PI&#x0201d; = AC &#x000d7; 100/DC%. In general terms, PI reflects the peripheral vasomotor tone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Low PI suggests peripheral vasoconstriction (or severe hypovolaemia) and high PI suggests vasodilation. PI is sensitive to several things such as temperature of the finger, exogenous vasoactive drugs, sympathetic nervous system tone (pain, anxiety, and so on) and stroke volume.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Although there are several confounders influencing peripheral perfusion, determination of a decrease in PI &#x02264;10% as a threshold for stress response seems to be reasonable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Several studies investigated the effects of low peripheral perfusion caused by hypothermia, vasoconstriction or sympathetic nerve activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, variation in PI is associated with potentially numerous causes, especially a small variation of 10% as observed in this study. In this context, Landsverk and colleagues investigated variations in plethysmographic waveform amplitude in deeply sedated and mechanically ventilated patients. They observed slow and large spontaneous oscillations in skin microcirculation per laser doppler flowmetry related to the sympathetic nervous system and presumed that this mechanism determined the large variability of pulse oximetry photoplethysmographic waveform signal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]</p><p>The main finding in the present study was that percent PI response criterion achieved 100% sensitivity in detecting the stress response to insertion of ET, LMA and i-gel during propofol fentanyl isoflurane anaesthesia in adult patients. On the other hand, SBP and DBP achieved sensitivity (44.4%, 55.6%) in detecting haemodynamic stress responses in this population.</p><p>PI, HR, SBP and DBP values in the i-gel group were significantly lower than that of ET and LMA recorded for 5 min after the airway instrumentation. Moreover, LMA evoked less PI reduction compared to endotracheal intubation.</p><p>In the i-gel group; HR, SBP, DBP showed no significant response while PI detected 40% change earlier time when compared to the conventional haemodynamic parameters. Although the PI did better in detecting stress response than did changes in HR and blood pressure, the study was not large enough to show a notable difference. The study was powered to examine the change in HR postinsertion of the airway device, not to demonstrate a statistical difference from PI monitoring. It would be important to know if the PI is truly better than HR and blood pressure for indicating haemodynamic stress response before it could be considered a standard of care. Although many investigators have documented a relationship between detrimental circulatory responses with direct laryngoscopy and intubation, there are no reports of changes in the PI during these procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>]</p><p>Intraocular pressure and haemodynamic responses to insertion of the i-gel, LMA or ET were investigated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The main finding was that insertion of the i-gel did not increase IOP, whereas insertion of the LMA or tracheal intubation did. Another finding was that the pressor responses to insertion of the i-gel were significantly less than LMA or tracheal intubation.</p><p>The efficacy of PI as an indicator for intravascular injection of epinephrine-containing epidural test dose in propofol-anaesthetised adults was investigated by Hany A. Mowafi <italic>et al</italic>. PI has been used to reflect an evident response with 100% sensitivity and specificity to epinephrine-containing epidural test dose.

However, these studies measured BP invasively via arterial catheters, a practice that was not justified in our patients. The use of intermittent and non-invasive measurement of BP may have decreased its reliability to detect haemodynamic changes, because the temporary SBP increases may be easily missed between cycles.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Failure to demonstrate high efficacy of the SBP and DBP criteria as markers for confirming stress response during propofol fentanyl isoflurane anaesthesia represents a limitation of these conventional haemodynamic responses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, Galvin and colleagues found that PI increased with successful sympatholysis of peripheral and neuroaxial block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Another main finding in our study was that the pressor responses (HR, SBP and DBP) to i-gel insertion were found to be significantly less than that with LMA and ETT airway instrumentation.</p><p>Based on the literature, we anticipated that the insertion of a LMA and i-gel would elicit a much smaller haemodynamic and catecholamine response than tracheal intubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p><p>Lack of laryngoscopy during insertion of LMA or i-gel is a major reason.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>]</p><p>PI can provide information about the relative balance between nociception and antinociception.
