However, paper-based data collection has considerable challenges of data management and requires additional time for double data entry, cleaning, and analysis [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In several cases, a conventional central data management comprising Web applications for data capture and central databases provides a suitable solution, but these are often limited by lack of reach and widespread applicability [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For example, since such tools are made available in an internal secured network, data capture can only be conducted from personal computers within this network. Moreover, data collection from subjects often takes place in rooms where a designated personal computer is not accessible. More importantly, most studies relying on computer-based data capture tools are not required to submit captured data in real time during collection.</p><p>In the past decade, certain mobile device&#x02013;based tools such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and mobile phones [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have been used to collect and manage data. Such tools show great performance and qualities including high-quality data, more effective training to the staff, user friendliness, and cost effectiveness. More importantly, in recent decades, access to the Internet using wireless and mobile communication technologies has tremendously increased and has been adapted for use in field research settings, particularly in medical research, because of the ease of transferring data in real time and convenience owing to the portability of mobile devices. Low- and middle-income countries such as China and India lack the infrastructure to accommodate adequate fixed-line Internet access in rural areas, and cellular networks allow access to telecommunications in such regions with limited Internet access [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. China has the largest and fastest growing mobile Internet population, with 668 million people using the Internet (89% via mobile phones) as of June 2015 [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which supports effective implementation of studies using mobile devices in China.</p><p>Nevertheless, mobile technology has been barely used to support implementation of pharmaceutical randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Compared with traditional computer-based clinical trial management systems, mobile device&#x02013;based methods for clinical trial reporting have distinct features that can ensure data transfer and exchange, telemonitoring, and project management in real time.</p><p>From 2014 to 2015, we conducted a multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, parallel-controlled trial with the aim of comparing the efficacy of monotherapy with two types of medications in high-sodium-intake patients with mild to moderate hypertension (<italic>T</italic> elmisartan 40 mg/day and <italic>H</italic> ydrochlorothiazide [HCTZ] 25 mg/day <italic>A</italic> ntihypertensive <italic>T</italic> reatment study or the THAT study). During implementation of the THAT study, we developed an innovative, mobile device&#x02013;based electronic data capture (mEDC) system to support data capture, monitoring, and project management. In addition, we performed a designated qualitative evaluation based on experiences of various types of users to determine whether mEDC can effectively facilitate data collection, project implementation and management, and real-time telemonitoring.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and Features of mEDC</title><p>Eligible participants for the THAT study included adults aged &#x02265;18 years with mild to moderate hypertension not using antihypertensive or blood pressure (BP)&#x02013;altering medications for at least one week. Overall, 1333 participants were recruited at clinics from 14 rural county hospitals, randomly divided into the telmisartan and HCTZ treatment groups, and followed up on the 15th, 30th, and 60th day after enrollment. Dummy telmisartan and dummy HCTZ were used to ensure double blinding. The primary outcomes included BP decrease, BP control rates, fasting blood glucose (FBG), hypokalemia, and adverse events (AEs).</p><p>The mEDC system was developed to help users (doctors, clinical research associates [CRAs], project managers [PMs], and data managers [DMs]) in data collection, telemonitoring, and project management. The mEDC, consisting of two primary components (an app installed in mobile phones and a server-based clinical trial database) was designed in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the International Conference on Harmonization Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We prospectively wrote design specifications to describe structure of the mEDC, and a vendor independently developed this app following our specifications. We also developed a test plan based on these specifications to justify validation of the mEDC system. In order to ensure regulatory compliance, we referred to three additional guidelines focusing on EDC systems for RCTs while designing mEDC: Good Clinical Data Management Practices proposed by the Society for Clinical Data Management (SCDM) [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Guidance for Industry Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations represented by the Food and Drug Administration [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and Guidance for Industry Part 11 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations on Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures (21 CFR 11) [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Before implementing the primary study, we invited two independent research staff to validate the mEDC system. They entered a batch of data (approximately 50 simulated patients) into the system to test not only the clinical database validation, including data entry screen testing, data checking routines (eg, range and format), testing of data verification functions, and data transferring (remote data entry) but also trial-specific validation of variables such as name, label, type, and randomization of subjects [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> summarizes the major supportive functions and features of mEDC.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Functions and features of mobile device&#x02013;based electronic data capture (mEDC) and relevant requirements as per electronic data capture (EDC) guidelines.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="728" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="28" span="1"/><col width="10" span="1"/><col width="230" span="1"/><col width="400" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">No.</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1">Functions and features of mEDC<sup>a,b</sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Requirements per EDC<sup>a,c</sup> guidelines and comments</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Site equipment and administration</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Logistic management</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Should be maintained either onsite or be remotely accessible through electronic files (IV-B: SOP<sup>d</sup> [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>])</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Role allocation</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Access must be limited to authorized individuals (IV-D-1: Limited access [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>])</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Patient recruitment and data collection</bold></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><break/></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Screening</td><td rowspan="6" colspan="1">These 6 parts follow &#x0201c;Guidance for Industry Computerized Systems Used in Clinical Investigations&#x0201d;

Delivery of all site-specific materials such as study medicines, tubes for biological samples, and other materials, both to and from each site, was confirmed by the doctors, and the materials were photographed for record. The PMs remotely checked these photographs, which were required to be uploaded in the mEDC app, and sites would initiate the process after receiving confirmation from PMs. The study protocol and standard operating procedures (SOPs) were stored in the cellphones, allowing convenient access of these instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Recruitment and Visits</title><p>Once patients signed informed consent forms, doctors collected necessary information using mEDC, following which the server immediately returned the results to verify whether or not the patients met the inclusion criteria. After baseline information had been collected, unique and structured randomization codes were allocated to all patients. Simultaneously, mEDC allocated study medicines and test tubes bearing the same codes as assigned to the patients. Each patient was assigned a specific time slot for site visits. mEDC helped doctors to arrange visits through 2 automatic pop-up options: sending a standard short message and calling the patient immediately. Patients who had opted to receive a short message received a message with the name of the doctor indicating when he or she should visit the doctor, if breakfast and medicines should be taken, and if the leftover medicine should be brought along. Patients who had difficulty in receiving or reading messages were contacted over telephone on their primary or alternate contact numbers that had been collected at the first visit. During visits, all data transactions between mEDC at the site and the central study server were automatically stamped with identification regarding who provided the information, when it was provided, from where, and how.</p></sec><sec><title>Centralized Randomization</title><p>THAT study was a double-blinded study with stratified block randomization. Each box of study medicines that contained a genuine medicine and the other dummy medicine was allocated a specific code according to the randomization list in advance. The randomization list was generated previously with gender and systolic blood pressure (SBP &#x02265;160 mmHg) as stratified variables and a random block size of 4. A range of medicine boxes with sequential codes of randomization were delivered to each site. Site names and the matched codes list were uploaded to the mEDC server so that doctors could identify the specific medicines according to the code returned by mEDC during randomization. Biological sample tubes and other study materials with the same codes were delivered to the same site. This guaranteed that a patient had received study medicines and materials with their unique code. Doctors could trigger an unblinding procedure for patients in emergency via mEDC during follow-ups.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality Control for Key Procedures</title><p>BP measurement was the primary outcome of the THAT study. Doctors received strict training and were provided with uniform digital sphygmomanometers. In practice, the entire procedure was automatically controlled by mEDC. Before measurements, mEDC required doctors to click photographs to record the posture of patients at the time of measurement. During measurements, it instructed doctors to measure BP for 3 times at 2-min intervals.</p><p>Another key point for quality control was the consistence of medicine codes, that is, the codes that mEDC allocated to patients had to be the same as the codes that were on the medication boxes. Doctors were required to click photographs to record the codes on the medication boxes, and CRAs checked to ensure this consistency.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient Referral</title><p>At the end of the visit, doctors instructed patients to collect a blood or urine sample, and a message would pop-up on the mobile phone of the nurses responsible for blood or urine sample collection as follows: &#x0201c;Patient xxx with code yyy will arrive for sample collection. Please make sure to use the tubes with the same code.&#x0201d; A similar message would be sent to the study medication distributors to support study medication distribution. The entire process was designed to ensure consistency of patients&#x02019; codes across all procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Remote Validation of Data</title><p>Similar to traditional computer-based EDC systems, most variables in the THAT study were checked for missing values, range of variable values, outliers, and irrationalities during data entry. However, in contrast to the traditional EDC systems, data entry and validation in the mEDC was performed at the time point of patients&#x02019; site visit rather than at a later time point. In addition, by relying on camera technique, mEDC could ask doctors to provide evidence by clicking photographs for key information. Photographic evidence was collected for consistency of patient identification on different materials at all 4 visits, BP measurements, and other procedures. For example, doctors were required to not only enter BP measurements but also to click a photograph for interfaces of digital sphygmomanometers and upload them on the server. The consistency between these recordings would be remotely checked by a CRA. In addition, CRAs remotely supervised the recruiting progress, data validity, missing data, and risk of loss to follow-up through mEDC and in a timely manner. Logistical checking could also be done based on the database temporarily downloaded from the server. We did not develop Web-end to track modification for each variable but used a specially designed database to record any modifications. The mEDC DM provided frequent reports on modifications by running a program based on the database.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Storage and Management</title><p>Owing to the need for tracking patients during referral and sending follow-up reminders, certain private data such as names and telephone numbers were recorded in mEDC. During data or project management, personal information of participants was shielded from DMs and CRAs, and the deidentified data could only be transferred to researchers and statisticians for data analysis. No hardcopy CRFs were used in the THAT study. Once submitted, collected data was then transferred to the server (located in Beijing) without any information stored in mobile phones.

The THAT study was successfully completed under management of mEDC, suggesting that data collection and management using mEDC was technologically feasible using a mobile phone in this study. The positive feedback of the users confirmed the feasibility of mEDC, which also establishes substantial confidence about the utilization of mEDC in future pharmaceutical clinical trials.</p><p>The significant and specific features of mEDC are data collection, monitoring, and project management in real time. Although computer-based trials proposed that they could recruit patients and collect data in real time by using Internet [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], in most cases, doctors were more likely to rely on transferring data by means of paper-to-computer when they captured clinical data, particularly in trials wherein data sources involved health records. mEDC made the aforementioned process more straightforward owing to portability of mobile phones and was more beneficial in entering data directly in real time. Under such situations, PMs can remotely monitor the progress of the project in real time. Theoretically, mEDC can reduce the time required for data capture because doctors use mobile phones to collect information directly instead of recording such information in paper-based CRFs in the first place. Although we did not compare the effectiveness between these two approaches, evidence available from several previous studies suggests that using mobile phones for data collection, instead of with pen-and-paper, eliminated data recording and entry errors, had similar interrater reliability, and took an equal amount of time per interview but with no second entry [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The design for quality control and data validation through mEDC was unprecedented in this time of computer-based clinical trials, particularly for validation of the primary outcome (BP measurement), which could assure that the BP of every patient was accurately measured. The photographic evidence of patients&#x02019; seated posture and reminders for 2-min intervals between every two measurements could control doctors to follow the SOP of BP measurement, whereas the screenshots of the digital sphygmomanometer after each BP measurement could help CRAs check the consistency between BP values and screenshots, which can be difficult to achieve in computer-based trials. This type of design can help CRAs remotely conduct site monitoring, reduce extremely inaccurate information, improve data quality, and reduce the workload of DMs at the time of data cleaning. At the same time, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref> shows that among three average BP measurements recorded at baseline, the first BP measurement was higher than the other two, the second one was moderate, whereas the third one was the lowest; however, the latter two measurements exhibit a stable trend, which is in concordance with findings from a previous study [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This, in a way, validates the reliability of data transferred using mEDC.</p><p>From the perspective of doctors, mEDC could be used correctly and smoothly in county hospitals because the user-friendly operation system and succinct screen could help them complete a high-quality clinical trial through a built-in automated procedure of the mobile phone, regardless of prior clinical trial experience. Time consumption analysis and qualitative interviews also indicated that mEDC was easy to operate, and it did not impose any additional workload on doctors. This portable data capture tool not only benefitted doctors but also benefitted CRAs with convenience of data validation.</p><p>With regard to security, like SHA-512, which guarantees safety of data transfer [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], HTTPS assured secure connection of the mobile phone with the server and prevented it from being attacked by hackers. The central server could encrypt all transmissions and restrict each individual to appropriate access to data and operations on data.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had certain limitations. The biggest concern was the signal shielding and stability of the cellular network. Although mobile network is more popular than fix-line Internet in China [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], the signal could probably be impacted due to shielding by the environment, such as in indoor areas of certain buildings with reinforcement concrete frames. The THAT study was a phase IV clinical trial, which is relatively simpler than phase I-III clinical trials; thus, the mEDC algorithm would probably need to be designed in a more complex fashion if it is to be utilized in other phases of a clinical trial. Moreover, whether available mobile phones can process algorithms that are more complicated remains unknown. The current version of mEDC was not perfect because of limited design time. For example, queries had not been designed in mEDC; therefore, any track changes were not shown on the screen of the mobile phone. Although the track changes could be recorded in the server, doctors could not identify which data were modified; this resulted in some inconveniences. BP measurements were to be manually filled in mEDC but could not be automatically transferred via Bluetooth. Furthermore, doctors were not authorized to record electronic signatures during IRB operations but rather had to record photographs of the informed consent form pages with signatures for data retention. Nonetheless, this limitation will be addressed and fixed in an upcoming updated version of this app.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The mobile device-based data capture and project management system, mEDC, could help doctors complete a phase IV pharmaceutical clinical trial and was feasible for management of this trial. Moreover, doctors expressed their willingness to use this tool for study implementation. The validity, reliability, real-time feature, and user friendliness of mEDC are beneficial not only for doctors without clinical trial experience but also for CRAs and PMs. Taken together, there is a possibility for mEDC to be used in other pharmaceutical clinical trials in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the investigators from the following 14 county-level hospitals
