In the present study, effects of angiotensin II (Ang II) on sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase) expression and development of sheep embryos was evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The abattoir-derived Cumulus Oocyte Complexes (COC) were randomly allocated into three experimental groups; group I) <italic>in vitro</italic> Maturation (IVM) of oocytes in the presence of Ang II followed by <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF)/<italic>in vitro</italic> Culture (IVC) (IVM group), group II) IVM/IVF of oocytes followed by IVC wherein the embryos were exposed to Ang II on day 4 of IVC (D4 group), and group III) IVM/IVF and IVC of oocytes without any angiotensin (Control). The blastocyst and hatching rates were recorded on days 6 to 8. Day 8 embryos were immunostained with primary and secondary antibodies against Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Addition of Ang II during IVM and IVC significantly increased the hatching rate of blastocysts on day 8 compared to the control. The trophectoderm and total blastocyst cells&#x02019; numbers were significantly increased by addition of Ang II to the IVM and IVC media, though the expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits were positively influenced by the addition of Ang II on day 4 (D4 group).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In conclusion, it seems Ang II through positive effects on embryos, expressed as the greater hatching rate and blastocyst cell number, could increase the sheep embryo developmental rate. These improvements might be partly related to the greater expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits when Ang II was added during IVC.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Angiotensin II</kwd><kwd>Development</kwd><kwd>Embryo</kwd><kwd>Expression</kwd><kwd>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase</kwd><kwd>Sheep</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many studies have reported the presence of members of the Rennin-Angiotensin System (RAS) in the ovary, such as prorenin, angiotensinogen, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Angiotensin II (Ang II) and Ang II receptors (AT1 and AT2), suggesting the involvement of the RAS in ovarian physiology <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. Angiotensin II, an active octapeptide of the RAS, was present in high concentrations in mammalian ovaries, suggesting that it has a role in ovarian function. Concentrations of Ang II increased in human and bovine follicular fluid at the time of ovulation and after exposure to Luteinizing Hormone (LH) or human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. There is also evidence that Ang II has a direct role in ovarian steroidogenesis, follicular atresia, oocyte maturation and ovulation. Furthermore, hCG-induced oocyte maturation was inhibited by a concomitant addition of saralasin (an Ang II antagonist) <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Several genes were identified as being directly or indirectly regulated by Ang II including Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B, activator protein (AP)-1, cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and cell cycle regulators (retinoblastoma susceptibility protein and p53) <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>The research on mechanisms directing blastocyst formation has demonstrated that (a) Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase has a polarized distribution confined to the trophectoderm basolateral membrane regions just before the onset of cavitation, (b) expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase subunit genes are up-regulated during the morula to blastocyst transition, (c) treatment with ouabain (a potent and specific inhibitor of the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase) affects cavitation and blastocyst formation in a number of mammalian species, and (d) Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase regulates the formation and function of trophectoderm tight junctions <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase subunits are characterized by multiple isoforms so that in mammalian cells there are four and three different isoforms of &#x003b1; (&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>, &#x003b1;<sub>3</sub>, and &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>) and &#x003b2; (&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>, &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>, and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>) subunits, respectively. The &#x003b1;-subunit is responsible for the catalytic and transport properties of the enzyme and contains the binding sites for the cations and ATP <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The &#x003b2;-subunit is essential for the normal activity of the enzyme, and it appears to be involved in the occlusion of K<sup>+</sup> and the modulation of the K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> affinity of the enzyme. In addition, in vertebrate cells, the &#x003b2;-subunit may act as a chaperone, stabilizing the correct folding of the &#x003b1;-polypeptide to facilitate its delivery to the plasma membrane. A third protein, termed the &#x003b3;-subunit, has also been identified in purified preparations of the enzyme <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>According to the presence of high concentration of Ang II in the follicular fluid at the time of ovulation and the significant role of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase during blastocyst formation and regarding to embryonic genome activation at the 8 to 16-cell stage <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, especially up-regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase gene at this time <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, it was hypothesized that the addition of Ang II to the IVM and IVC media may play a significant role in sheep oocyte and embryo developmental competence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by Avicenna Research Institute, the Bioethics Committee.

Therefore, considering the increased concentration of Ang II at the time of ovulation in follicular fluid and with regard to bovine embryonic genome activation at the 8 to 16-cell stage <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, especially up-regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase gene at this time <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, it could be inferred that addition of Ang II to the IVM and IVC media may play a significant role in sheep oocyte and embryo developmental competence.</p><p>In the present study, the addition of Ang II to the IVM medium (IVM group) significantly increased the rate of blastocyst on day 6 of culture which was indicative of higher speed of embryo development compared to the control. Though, this persuasion effect was gradually eliminated as such no difference was observed on day 8 of culture. Furthermore, media supplementation with Ang II (in both IVM and D4 groups) significantly increased the hatching rate of blastocysts on day 8.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that Ang II has significantly increased the expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits in the number of cultured cells such as rat vascular smooth muscle <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, astrocyte <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, proximal tubules of pig kidney <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and canine kidney distal tubules <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. It has been shown that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase has a fundamental role in regulating trophectoderm tight junction formation and function <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Inhibition of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase by ouabain is associated with the failure to constitute an efficient trophectoderm tight junctional seal that is required for expansion of the blastocyst cavity and hatching <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. On the other hand, blastocyst expansion only occurs when the tight junction permeability seal is fully formed to restrict the leakage of fluid via paracellular routes, thus ensuring the expansion of the cavity as fluid accumulates <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Therefore, considering the inductive role of Ang II in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase expression <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, it might be hypothesized that at least in fresh oocytes, Ang II could exert its inductive effect during morula to blastocyst and blastocyst to hatched blastocyst transition which in turn led to the greater day 6 blastocyst rate in IVM group as well as greater hatching rate in IVM and D4 groups compared to the control.</p><p>Apart from the inductive role of Ang II in expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase and the subsequent embryo development, this question that whether this compound can exert its effect via other pathway (s) remains to be elucidated. The crucial role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) as one of the important regulators of mammalian hatching process has been indicated in many species <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The COX-2 can modulate hatching process via regulation of zonalytic proteases which rather exclusively occur in Trophectodermal Projections (TEPs) at the abembryonic pole of the blastocyst <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. In hamster, the expression of COX-2 mRNA and its protein has been observed in 8-cell through hatched blastocyst stages <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. It has also been indicated that Ang II can induce expression of several pro-inflammatory genes, including COX-2 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. From above, it is hypothesized that greater hatching rate in Ang II supplemented groups might be induced by COX-2 pathway.</p><p>In between, the positive effect of AngII on expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits was only evident when media supplementation was done during IVC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). One possibility for low influence of Ang II supplementation during IVM on Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase subunits expression might be related to the time interval between Ang II supplementation (during IVM) and time of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> expression assessment (blastocyst stage on day 8). An increase in Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase genes expression during morula to blastocyst transition and hatching process <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> may bring up the point that the addition of Ang II on day 4 of IVC has a greater effect on Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase subunits expression compared to IVM supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>It has been indicated that the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit is required to support early development to the morula (16&#x02013;32 cells) stage of mouse embryos <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Other studies have demonstrated that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit gene products display a very dramatic up-regulation just before blastocyst formation, suggesting that up-regulation of this gene is required for cavitation and hatching process to occur. Based on what stated about, it could be inferred that the up-regulation of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit should have a positive effect on blastocyst and hatched blastocyst formation in Ang II treated groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunit, its mRNAs were present throughout preimplantation development and displayed a much more gradual increase as the embryo progressed to the blastocyst stage <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. In our study, despite the lower expression of &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> subunit compared to &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunit, it seems it may have a role in blastocyst and hatched blastocyst formation in embryos exposed to Ang II during IVC. Therefore, one explanation for the greater hatching rate in IVM and D4 groups might be related to the greater expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> subunits compared to the controls.</p><p>In the present study, TE and total cell numbers were significantly increased by the addition of Ang II to IVM and IVC media. In mouse, embryo cell numbers significantly decreased when embryos were treated with ouabain as a Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase inhibitor <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>. It has been shown that Ang II by induction of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/ATPase expression may probably reduce cell apoptosis which in turn can increase the total cell number <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Greater ICM/Total ratio in the control compared to Ang II supplemented groups was related to the lower number of TE cells in the former group that superficially raises the ICM/Total ratio in the control compared to the treated groups. On the other hand, greater TE numbers in treated groups provide the better conditions for appropriate placentation and embryo implantation compared to the control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As shown, addition of Ang II to the IVM and/or day 4 of IVC media significantly increased the hatching rates in derived blastocysts.
