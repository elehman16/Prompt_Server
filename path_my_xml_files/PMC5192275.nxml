IBS affects adult age groups evenly but is more common in women[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. According to the European Food Safety Authority, IBS volunteers can be recruited as an appropriate group for studying bowel discomfort symptoms that also affect the general population[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], allowing the results to be extrapolated to a wider potential market.</p><p>A host&#x02019;s gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota can contribute to IBS etiology and symptomology through changes in bacterial abundance and fermentation products, lower diversity, and instability over time, which are associated with increased epithelial permeability, aberrations in immunity and brain-gut interactions, and altered GI neuromuscular function[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, manipulation of the GI microbiota with probiotics is a putative therapeutic option for IBS [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Probiotics, defined as &#x0201c;live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host&#x0201d;[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], have shown efficacy in selected randomized clinical trials in relieving IBS symptoms and are generally well tolerated[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, the quality of several probiotic intervention studies has been limited due to inadequate sample sizes and intervention periods, poor trial design, and undefined or unstable probiotic products[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moreover, each strain or combination of strains and each dose requires a separate clinical trial to show efficacy [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Our aim was to perform a high-quality, randomized, triple-blind, and placebo-controlled dose-response clinical trial of 3 statistically adequately sized parallel groups. The supplement that we examined is a well-characterized and stable probiotic strain, mechanistic studies of which have reported putative efficacy in alleviating visceral pain. <italic>Lactobacillus acidophilus</italic> NCFM increases the visceral pain threshold in a rat model by 44% through the opioid pathway[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and upregulates &#x003bc;-opioid receptor (MOR) in humans[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Participant-reported severity of functional bowel symptoms, however, has merely been evaluated for a high-concentration combination of <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM and <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic> Bi-07[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which is significantly less effective in increasing MOR expression than <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM alone[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Therefore, assessment of the clinical effects of <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM as a single-strain supplement for functional bowel symptoms, including visceral pain, was essential. Two doses, 10<sup>9</sup> and 10<sup>10</sup> colony-forming units (CFU), were selected as clinically adequate and applicable for use in consumer products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study volunteers</title><p>This trial was performed at 2 private clinics in Helsinki and Turku, Finland, from October 2012 to November 2014. Newspaper and radio advertisements, followed by prescreening phone calls, were used to invite potential eligible volunteers to screening visits that were held by gastroenterologists who were experienced in functional bowel disorders, including IBS. The recruited volunteers were adults (18-65 years) who were diagnosed with IBS according to Rome III criteria[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Volunteers who suffered from severe IBS symptoms were excluded due to the use of medications (strong pain medication, diarrhea medication, and laxatives) that might have confounded the primary outcome measure. Other inclusion criteria were sufficient general health and orientation for participation in the study, adequate Finnish language skills for being interviewed and completing questionnaires, high likelihood of compliance with and completion of the study, and a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 35.</p><p>Volunteers were excluded if they had participated in a clinical trial with an investigational product (IP) or drug within 3 mo prior to the screening, were likely to be noncompliant with the protocol or judged to be unsuitable for study participation by the investigator for any reason, were planning major changes in lifestyle (<italic>e.g</italic>., diet, dieting, exercise level, travel), had a history of drug or alcohol abuse, were pregnant or breastfeeding, were diagnosed with or suspected of having organic GI disease (<italic>e.g</italic>., colitis, Crohn&#x02019;s disease, celiac disease, bowel surgery, recurrent diverticulitis), or had severely impaired general health, including cancer and cancer therapy. Lactose-intolerant volunteers were allowed to enter the trial if they followed a non lactose diet. Any previous allergic reaction to any substance in the study product was also considered an exclusion criterion.</p><p>Medications that could affect the outcomes, including anticholinergic medications, antibiotics (including use during the 3 mo prior to the start of the study), pain medications that contained opiates or morphine, weight loss medication, misoprostol, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, antacids with magnesium or aluminum, diarrhea medication, medication that accelerates the emptying of the stomach, sulfasalazine, laxatives, cholestyramine, cytostatics, biological medications, oral steroids (3 mo prior to and during the study), and probiotic products, excluded subjects from participation in the trial. Iron supplements, antidepressants, fiber supplements, statins, thyroxine, coxibs, acid medication, inhaled steroids, and other non excluding medications that did not affect outcome measures in the clinician&#x02019;s opinion were allowed during the trial if they had been consumed for at least 30 d at the same dose.</p><p>During the screening visit, thorough demographic data were collected, including lifestyle habits, diet, medical history, and family history of GI disturbances. Screening safety blood tests included a basic blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), celiac test, lactase gene test, and thyroid-stimulating hormone for constipated IBS volunteers. The test results complied with the inclusion and exclusion criteria and were clinically within normal-range values according to the recruiting gastroenterologists.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The trial was a randomized, triple-blind (volunteers, investigators, and statisticians blinded), placebo-controlled, dose-response intervention to determine the efficacy of a probiotic supplement in reducing IBS Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS)[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The trial comprised an 8-wk run-in period, a 12-wk intervention phase, and a 4-wk washout period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Outcome measures were assessed using questionnaires, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded through phone calls. Volunteers who withdrew were not replaced.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study outline. Volunteers were selected for screening visits by a prescreen for compliance over the phone. Eligible volunteers entered an 8-wk run-in period without any investigational product (IP) consumption and were thereafter randomized to receive low- or high-dose active IP or a placebo IP for 12 wk. The intervention period was followed by a 4-wk washout period without any IP consumption. Preceding each time point (weeks 0, 4, 12, and 16), volunteers recorded their stool consistency during each defecation event for 7 d. At each time point, questionnaires [Irritable Bowel Syndrome Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS); IBS-related Quality of Life (IBS-QoL); Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score (HADS)] were filled out. All volunteers were contacted by phone prior to each sampling time point to inquire about adverse events (AEs) and to remind of the sampling procedures.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="WJG-22-10631-g001"/></fig><p>The primary outcome was the change in IBS-SSS from baseline at the end of the run-in period to after 12 wk of treatment[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IBS-SSS is a composite score of abdominal pain, number of days with abdominal pain, bloating/distension, satisfaction with bowel habits, and IBS-related quality of life (QoL). Each measure is rated from 0 to 100, with total scores ranging from 0 to 500. Based on previous trials[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], a 15% change in the IBS-SSS was determined to be clinically significant in measuring efficacy. QoL was evaluated with a thorough 34-item IBS-related QoL questionnaire (IBS-QoL), analyzed as a total score and as subscales on dysphoria, interference with activity, body image, health-related worries, food avoidance, social reactions, sexuality, and relationships[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Psychological comorbidities were evaluated with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>IBS-SSS, IBS-QoL, and HADS data were collected at the end of the run-in, after 4 and 12 wk of treatment, and after the 4-wk washout. Weekly bowel movement frequency and consistency were recorded prior to each outcome assessment time point with an in-house questionnaire, based on the Bristol Stool Form Scale[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For analysis, stool consistencies were grouped into constipation (Bristol Scale 1 or 2), diarrhea (Bristol Scale 6 or 7), and normal (Bristol Scale 3, 4, or 5). Overall satisfaction with the treatment with regard to IBS symptoms was measured with a dichotomous adequate relief (AR) question[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The volunteers were instructed to compare AR from IBS symptoms during the past week to their symptom severity prior to consuming IPs. Volunteers who reported AR for at least half of the intervention weeks were considered to be responders. AR data were collected throughout the 12-wk intervention.</p><p>Prior to each visit (end of run-in, week 4, week 12, and end of washout), research nurses contacted the volunteers by phone to inquire about AEs and remind them of the sampling time point procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Study treatment</title><p>The IPs were administered orally in 1 daily capsule that contained 10<sup>9</sup> (low dose) or 10<sup>10</sup> (high dose) CFU of <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM (ATCC 700396), with microcrystalline cellulose as the excipient or microcrystalline cellulose as placebo. All treatments were supplied by Danisco USA (Madison, Wisconsin, United States). The formulations of all 3 treatments were similar in smell, taste, and appearance. The IPs were stored at -20 &#x000b0;C until they were distributed to the clinics, where they were refrigerated below 6 &#x000b0;C. Volunteers were allowed to store the IPs refrigerated or at room temperature. The CFU counts were checked in the active and placebo products during and after the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory measures</title><p>Screening safety tests were performed by certified clinical laboratories of the private clinics Mehil&#x000e4;inen T&#x000f6;&#x000f6;l&#x000f6; (Helsinki, Finland) and Mehil&#x000e4;inen Turku (Turku, Finland).</p></sec><sec><title>Compliance testing</title><p>Volunteers received 84 capsules and were instructed to return the container after the 84-d treatment period. Leftover capsules were counted to estimate compliance.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study was conducted according to the 2008 Sixth Revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, the EMA Note for Guidance on Good Clinical Practice (CPMP/ICH/135/95 - in operation 17.01.97), and laws and regulations for clinical research in Finland. Written informed consent was obtained from each volunteer before any study-specific procedures. The trial was registered at Clinicaltrials.gov under the identifier NCT01728610.</p></sec><sec><title>Data quality assurance</title><p>Case report forms were 100% monitored and double-entered independently into a database that was created with SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Queries were raised in cases of illegible, missing, or inconsistent data. All discrepancies were resolved before the database was locked. Data management and statistics were performed by 4Pharma Ltd.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p><bold>Determination of sample size:</bold> The primary analysis variable was the change in IBS-SSS from baseline to week 12. Baseline levels were estimated to be approximately 250 (halfway on the 0-500 scale). A difference of 15% - <italic>i.e</italic>., 37.5 points - was used in the sample size calculation[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Using 80% power and a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05, the sample size was calculated to be 104 for each group. Taking into account a discontinuation rate of 20%, approximately 390 patients were needed for randomization. The sample sizes were calculated using NQuery Advisor, version 7.0.</p><p><bold>Analysis sets:</bold> The intent-to-treat dataset (ITT) included all randomized volunteers who received at least 1 dose of the IP and had at least 1 post baseline efficacy measurement available. The per protocol dataset (PP) was a subset of the ITT dataset, excluding volunteers and measurements for a given volunteer with major protocol violation(s) or concomitant medication use that was expected to alter the primary outcome. Volunteer classification into the ITT and PP populations was detailed after locking the database and completed before the study was unmasked. In addition, post hoc analyses of volunteers with IBS-SSS pain score VAS &#x0003e; 35/100 were performed.</p><p><bold>Randomization:</bold> Volunteers were randomized at the end of the 8-wk run-in phase, because the long run-in period created risk of a high dropout rate. Randomization was performed with Research Randomizer[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], applying non repeating numbers in blocks of 6. Volunteers, investigators, statisticians, and monitors were blinded until the database was locked and the Statistical Analyses Plan was completed. The clinics were supplied with sealed, volunteer-specific envelopes for revealing the randomization code, if required by the investigators. None of the envelopes was opened during the trial.</p><p><bold>Analysis of efficacy:</bold> Descriptive statistics for all variables were computed, and the disposition of volunteers was summarized by treatment. The primary efficacy variable (change in IBS-SSS from baseline) was analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of covariance (RM ANCOVA) model. The differences (low dose <italic>vs</italic> placebo and high dose <italic>vs</italic> placebo) in changes from baseline in IBS symptom score at 12 wk and their 95%CI were estimated with the RM ANCOVA model. Explorative comparisons were performed for high dose <italic>vs</italic> low dose and combined active group <italic>vs</italic> placebo and for within-group changes from baseline.</p><p>The individual domains of the IBS-SSS were analyzed with a similar RM ANCOVA model that was applied for IBS-SSSs. A logistic regression model was used to compare treatment groups against placebo for AR responder status. Changes in HADS and IBS-QOL scores from baseline were analyzed using an RM ANCOVA model. The stool consistencies (Bristol Stool Form) and defecation frequencies were summarized descriptively. Simple <italic>t</italic>-test was used in the post hoc analyses of subgroups (<italic>e.g</italic>., pain score VAS &#x0003e; 35/100).</p><p>All statistical analyses and volunteer data listings were performed at 4Pharma Ltd using SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States).</p><p><bold>Safety analyses:</bold> All randomized volunteers who received the study treatment were included in the safety analysis. AEs were counted by volunteer, event, type, treatment, severity, and causality. Each symptom of an AE or serious adverse event (SAE) case was recorded separately.</p><p>The statistical methods were reviewed by statistician Teppo Huttunen, 4Pharma Ltd.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Altogether, 618 volunteers were prescreened by telephone interview for compliance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and thereafter, the eligibility of 529 potential volunteers was confirmed by gastroenterologists. A total of 471 volunteers entered the trial, of whom 391 were randomized after the 8-wk run-in phase, with 340 (87%) completing the trial (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

The <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM strain is well characterized[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and has been commercially available as a probiotic for several decades. It has been associated with the alleviation of the perception of visceral pain as a 2-strain blend with <italic>B</italic>. <italic>lactis</italic> Bi-07 in volunteers with bloating and among colonoscopy patients[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a mechanistic study, however, <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM, as a single-strain supplement, was more effective than the combination in enhancing human colonic MOR expression and activity, although both treatments relieved bowel symptoms, albeit insignificantly[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p><italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM has been shown to elevate the visceral pain threshold in a rat model by 44% through the MOR-mediated pathway with an efficacy that is comparable with that of 1 mg/kg subcutaneous morphine[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Thus, there was tremendous interest in determining the efficacy of <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM as a single-strain supplement in mitigating functional bowel symptoms.</p><p>The volunteer recruitment was successful, and the trial completion rate and IP compliance were high. All 391 randomized volunteers fulfilled the Rome III criteria for IBS, with an even distribution of IBS subtypes and demographics between groups. Blood tests were performed at the screening visit (basic blood count and CRP) to rule out inflammatory causes of the bowel symptoms. Most volunteers (57%) had undergone a colonoscopy in the past due to chronic GI symptoms to rule out organic or inflammatory causes, but endoscopy was not performed during the screening.</p><p>Based on a crossover trial that raised concerns over the inadequate length of a 1-mo run-in period[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], all volunteers refrained from using any commercial or trial-related probiotics over an 8-wk run-in period to reduce any putative carryover effects. A total of 83% of randomized volunteers had a history of consuming commercial probiotics. The intervention period was designed to last for 12 wk to follow up on the efficacy and AEs for a sufficient period of time[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and to limit the placebo effect toward the end of the trial. Altogether, we recruited an adequate number of reliably diagnosed, extensively examined volunteers who were not using any concomitant medications or supplements that could have affected outcomes. The treatment was a well-characterized probiotic strain that was supplemented in 2 common doses for an adequately long intervention period.</p><p>However, in this trial, based on a composite score of IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS), <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM was not superior to placebo. No significant differences in the secondary outcomes were observed between groups, and none of the outcomes showed a dose-response effect. Nevertheless, in post hoc analyses of a subgroup that presented with moderate to severe abdominal pain at baseline (IBS-SSS pain score on VAS &#x0003e; 35/100 at baseline; active groups combined <italic>vs</italic> placebo), the level of abdominal pain declined in the active groups at week 12. These data are consistent with previous mechanistic findings of greater MOR expression and activity during <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM treatment in humans and rats[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and earlier recovery from colonoscopy-associated pain[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>IBS is associated with significant placebo effects, in part due to the subjective nature of the outcome measures (Shah and Pimentel, 2014). Our trial had an 8-wk run-in period during which volunteers did not consume any product (including placebo); thus, there was no pre-randomization selection for high placebo responders. The study products were administered daily, which should be beneficial for minimizing a placebo effect. However, the high frequency of contact by research nurses might have heightened the placebo response, although their attention and care were targeted originally toward evaluating safety adequately and ensuring high compliance with the protocol.</p><p>Our principal challenge was the significant placebo effect, which was comparable with the efficacy of the active treatments. A decrease of &#x0003e; 50 in IBS-SSS indicates clinical improvement of symptoms[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present trial, the IBS-SSS decreased from 44.0 to 50.8 in the 3 different treatment groups suggesting a borderline clinically significant effect. Similarly, IBS-QoL scores corresponded to moderate symptom severity at baseline <italic>vs</italic> mild symptom severity by the end of treatment in all groups[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Also, with the AR questionnaire, the placebo was as effective as the active treatment. Volunteers had had difficulty comprehending whether the weekly AR question should be referenced to the base-line period, as intended, or to the previous calendar week. Thus some participants compared consecutive intervention weeks rather than treatment to baseline in the AR questionnaire.</p><p>HADS was applied to subgroup participants by psychological comorbidity which has previously been associated with characteristics of intestinal microbiota[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Statistically significant reductions in HADS were observed in the active treatment groups. However, these changes were small and likely of no clinical relevance; further, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was low, and for all treatment groups HADS averages throughout the study were at normal levels[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. No subgroup analyses were implemented. Nevertheless, the changes in HADS indicate a target for future study in a more appropriate population.</p><p>Changes in stool consistency are not unexpected for an IBS population[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and none of the treatments appeared to cause undesirable alterations in stool form. Defecation frequencies were close to normal limits, suggesting that diarrhea and constipation in IBS volunteers are subjective phenomena that are related to defecation events, rather than a result of hard stool and slow transit or loose stool and accelerated transit. Thus recruitment of all IBS symptom subtypes is justifiable.</p><p>Selecting volunteers from only 1 IBS symptom subgroup or setting a threshold for baseline symptom severity as applied by Sisson and colleagues[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] can reduce variation in the response to treatment. However, our objective was to recruit IBS volunteers as a representation of the general population[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], which would have been distorted by selecting subgroups or IBS patients with more severe symptoms. In addition, because the etiology of IBS is multifactorial and, to a large extent, unknown and because symptom subgroups tend to vary over time in each volunteer[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], selecting between symptom subgroups is challenging. Moreover, excluding volunteers whom consume diarrhea medication, laxatives, and opiate- or morphine-containing pain medications was necessary, because these agents influence the outcome, but it also effectively excluded volunteers with severe IBS symptoms.</p><p>Another shortcoming in assessing the efficacy of bowel symptoms was the infrequent and retrospective evaluation of IBS symptoms[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The symptom questionnaires were administered 4 times in total and only twice during the 12-wk intervention period. More frequent assessments were initially considered to be a risk for noncompliance due to the laboriousness of answering so many questionnaires. Moreover, although the IBS-SSS questionnaire inquires about symptom severity over the past 10 d, the volunteers&#x02019; symptoms, everyday events, and mood when they complete the questionnaires are likely to bias the answers, resulting in potentially irrelevant variations in scores. Because volunteers were not severely symptomatic (mean IBS-SSS at baseline corresponded to moderate for all treatment groups), inquiring about symptom frequency instead of severity might have been more sensitive in measuring efficacy[<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>AEs were evenly distributed between groups. The slightly higher number of volunteer discontinuations due to AEs in the active high-dose group was not treatment-related. Digestive symptoms were the chief manifestation of the inclusion criteria of the study population; thus, GI discomfort, recorded as a possibly treatment-related AE, might have also been part of their normal symptomology.</p><p><italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM can be consumed safely by adult IBS volunteers over a 3-mo period but is ineffective against IBS symptoms in general compared to placebo. However, <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> NCFM treatment alleviated abdominal pain in IBS volunteers with at least moderately severe visceral pain. More frequent - preferably daily - assessment of bowel symptoms with a user-friendly application is recommended for future trials in this area. Moreover, enquiring individual symptoms rather than a composite score sum may be more applicable. Among the recruited IBS participants with moderate symptom severity at baseline bowel movement frequency appeared normal regardless of stool consistency and anxiety and depression levels were not clinically notable.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The IBS-SSS questionnaire (Francis et al[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], 1997) was back-translated into Finnish by the medical translation company Anita Paajanen-Mannila Oy and kindly provided for use in this study by Oy Verman Ab and Kajsa Kajander.
