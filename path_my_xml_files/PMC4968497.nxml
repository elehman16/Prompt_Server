usefulness of canoe game-based virtual reality training for stroke patients. [Subjects and
Methods] Ten stroke patients were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG; n=5) or
a control group (CG; n=5). Patients in both groups participated in a conventional
rehabilitation program, but those in the EG additionally participated in a 30-min canoe
game-based virtual reality training program 3 days a week for 4 weeks. Therapeutic
efficacy was assessed based on trunk postural stability, balance, and upper limb motor
function. In addition, the usefulness of canoe game-based virtual reality training was
assessed in the EG and therapist group (TG; n=20), which consisted of physical and
occupational therapists, by using the System Usability Scale (SUS). [Results] Improvements
in trunk postural stability, balance, and upper limb motor function were observed in the
EG and CG, but were greater in the EG. The mean SUS scores in the EG and TG were 71 &#x000b1; 5.2
and 74.2 &#x000b1; 4.8, respectively. [Conclusion] Canoe game-based virtual reality training is an
acceptable and effective intervention for improving trunk postural stability, balance, and
upper limb motor function in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Virtual reality exposure therapy</kwd><kwd>Postural balance</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation systems are computer-based processes that provide
three-dimensional and direct sensorial feedback to which a person can respond, resulting in
real-time interaction with the environment and enhanced enjoyment during exercise<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. VR environments are common in treatment,
training, and rehabilitation, and are widely used to increase the outcome of stroke
rehabilitation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. As VR programs are
often more interesting and enjoyable than traditional therapy tasks, they provide motivation
and encouragement for subjects to participate<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hence, the frequency of their use in clinical settings is
increasing. VR rehabilitation training using a motion-controlled video game has been widely
used as an intervention for motor improvement in stroke patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies reported that game programs using a
motion-controlled video game are effective for motor improvement of the upper limbs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> and

extremities during daily functional activities<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have reported that trunk stability is related to
balance and limb function improvement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The findings of these studies provide strong evidence for the importance of early assessment
and management of trunk control after stroke<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, studies on game-based VR training for trunk stability are
lacking. Recently, the need for VR training that utilizes game software has emerged.
Canoeing is a paddle sport that requires coordination between trunk control and upper limb
function, and demands a good sitting balance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Paddle sports are effective for improving postural and trunk
stability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As most of the interventions that use motion-controlled video games have been applied only
to patients with chronic diseases, cases of patients requiring intensive rehabilitation are
lacking. Moreover, some reports have indicated that participation of the elderly in such
rehabilitation program might be hindered by lowered interest and commitment if the program
is difficult to use or its realism is low<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The application of VR training based on a
motion-controlled video game in clinical settings requires a systematic investigation of its
usefulness, including its acceptability, ease of use, and learnability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Studies to evaluate the usefulness of the intervention
must be conducted with prototype VR rehabilitation systems to maximize its potential<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hence, the primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a canoe game-based
VR training program for trunk postural control, balance, and upper limb motor function after
stroke. Its secondary aim was to evaluate the usability of the approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>All individuals who had a stroke and were admitted to the rehabilitation ward as inpatients
at a university hospital in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea, were eligible after meeting the
following inclusion criteria: (1) non-cerebellar stroke within the previous 6 months; (2)
ability to understand and follow simple verbal instructions; (3) Mini-Mental State
Examination score of &#x02265;21<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>; (4) minimum
Berg Balance Scale score of 15 (the minimum level deemed safe for balance intervention
participation)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; and (5) ability to walk
10&#x02005;m independently, with or without an assistance device. The exclusion criteria were as
follows: (1) psychiatric disorder or dementia, (2) apraxia or hemi-neglect, (3) epilepsy or
pacemaker use (as per Nintendo Wii safety guidelines), (4) severe pain in the hemiplegic
shoulder, and (5) a participation rate of &#x0003c;80%. Ten subjects were enrolled in the trial.

rehabilitation center participated in the System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire at the
end of the intervention session. All protocols and procedures were approved by the
institutional review board of Sahmyook University, and all the participants signed a
statement of informed consent.</p><p>This study was an unpowered pilot and usability study designed as an assessor-blinded,
randomized, controlled trial. Over a 2-month period (June 2014 to July 2014), 53 patients
participated in post-stroke rehabilitation. Thirty-nine patients were ineligible based on
the inclusion criteria, and 2 refused participation in the trial. Finally, 14 participants
were enrolled in the trial and assessed in the pretest. After the pretest, the participants
were randomly allocated to the experimental group (EG, n=7) or control group (CG, n=7). The
randomization process was performed by using computer-generated numbers produced by a basic
random number generator<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. Two
participants in the EG and two in the CG dropped out because of early discharge and a
participation rate of &#x0003c;80%. Thus, 5 participants in the experimental and control groups,

EG: Experimental group; CG:
Control group; MMSE-K: Mini Mental State Examination-Korea version</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>. The patients in the experimental and control groups participated in the same
conventional rehabilitation program that consisted of physical therapy, occupational
therapy, and functional electrical stimulation (FES). Physical therapy was conducted for
gait training and lower limb strengthening, based on the neuro-developmental treatment (NDT)
concept, for 30&#x02005;min twice a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks. Occupational therapy was also
administered for 30&#x02005;min twice a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks, to improve performance in
activities of daily living. FES was applied simultaneously to both the upper and lower limbs
for 15&#x02005;min a day, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks.</p><p>The EG additionally participated in the canoe game-based VR training program. The canoeing
game in the Nintendo Wii Sports Resort package was used as a VR training program. To create
realistic effects (e.g., swaying from side to side), a canoe was made by attaching a chair
to a springboard (width, 45&#x02005;cm; diameter, 150&#x02005;cm; height, 20&#x02005;cm). The participants paddled
by grasping the motion controller, which was inserted in a canoe paddle accessory,
alternating between hands while sitting on the springboard. The grip gloves were provided to
the participants who had difficulty grasping the motion controller. The participants
controlled the paddling according to the direction of the movement of the virtual character
that was shown on the LCD screen. They also adjusted their trunk to maintain balance on the
springboard during paddling. For safety, the program was conducted with the participants
wearing a belt around the waist.</p><p>The intervention program consisted of 3 session modes. The first session, conducted for
5&#x02005;min, was a free-practice mode for familiarization and warm-up. The second session,
conducted for 10&#x02005;min, was a timed-run mode, designed to achieve a personal record of the
distance travelled in a limited time period. The third session, conducted for 15&#x02005;min, was a
competition mode designed to improve motivation through competition with the caregiver or
therapist. The canoe game-based VR training programs were conducted for 30&#x02005;min a day, 3 days
a week, for 4 weeks. The posttest and SUS evaluations were conducted 1 day after the end of
the intervention period. All assessments were performed by two physical therapists who were
blinded to the treatment allocations.</p><p>Outcome was determined by using measures of trunk postural stability, balance ability, and
upper limb motor function. To assess and compare trunk postural stability between before and
after the intervention, the Trunk Impairment Scale (TIS) and functional reach test (FRT)
were used. To compare balance ability before and after the intervention, the Berg Balance
Scale (BBS) and timed up-and-go (TUG) tests were used. The Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) was
used to assess motor function of the upper limbs. The SUS measures the usefulness of
interface technologies after intervention. Levels of agreement with 10 statements were
scored by using a 5-point Likert scale anchored with &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;strongly
agree.&#x0201d; The SUS yielded percentage scores, which were calculated as described by Brooke<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SUS provides a point estimate of
percentage of usefulness. Scores of &#x0003e;70 are acceptable, and highly useful products score
&#x0003e;90. Scores of &#x0003e;50 indicate unacceptably low levels of usefulness<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed by using SPSS version 19.0. The Shapiro-Wilk test was
used to confirm that all outcome variables were normally distributed. The paired t-test was
used to compare dependent variables within the groups, and the independent t-test and
&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> analysis were used to compare dependent variables between the groups.
Descriptive statistical analysis was used to analyze data on usefulness. In addition, the
Mann-Whitney U test was conducted for between-group comparison of outcomes that indicate
usefulness. A statistical significance level of 0.05 was used in all the measurements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>No significant differences in general characteristics and dependent variables were observed
between the experimental and control groups. Regarding trunk postural stability after
completing the 4-week intervention program, the TIS score significantly improved in the EG
but not in the CG. The FRT result showed significant improvement both in the experimental
and control groups. When the two groups were compared, the changes in the TIS and FRT scores
were statistically greater in the EG than in the CG. In balance ability, the BBS score
showed significant improvement both in the experimental and control groups. The TUG times
significantly improved in the EG but not in the CG. When the two groups were compared, the
changes in the BBS and TUG scores were statistically greater in the EG than in the CG. In
upper limb motor function, the FMA score showed significant improvement both in the
experimental and control groups. When the two groups were compared, the changes in the FMA

stability, balance ability, and upper limb motor function. The effectiveness of the canoe
game-based VR training program can be determined based on improvements in trunk postural
stability, balance ability, and upper limb motor function. The changes in trunk postural
stability were evaluated by using TIS and FRT scores, and the EG showed significantly
greater improvements than the CG. Unlike VR balance training performed in the standing
position, the present study was performed by using the canoeing game in the sitting
position. In addition, the participants were asked to maintain their balance in the sitting
position in the chair attached to the springboard during canoe game-based VR training. The
participants maintained balance by using the trunk muscles while paddling on the board,
wavering from side to side. The effort to maintain balance seemed to have contributed to the
increase in trunk stability through an interactive process.</p><p>Balance training in the standing position is effective in improving the balance and gait
ability of stroke patients. However, postural control skills acquired during dynamic balance
training are not suitable for maintaining static postural stability<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cho et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that game-based VR balance training using a balance board
for 6 weeks improved dynamic balance ability assessed by using the BBS and TUG test scores
but did not improve static balance ability. Furthermore, Cuthbert et al.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that balance training using only
body positioning and weight shifting on the balance board in the standing position did not
improve dynamic balance ability as much as static balance ability. In fact, stroke patients
minimized their movements when controlling their posture in the standing position and made
less effort to maintain their center of mass<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results indicate that improvements in static and dynamic
balance abilities might depend on the balance training method used and suggest the need for
a training method that can improve both static and dynamic balance abilities. Balance
training in the sitting position is easy on weight shifting and weight-control ability<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. As in previous studies, improvement in
trunk stability contributed to improvement in balance ability in the present study. The
changes in balance ability were evaluated by using BBS and TUG test scores, and the EG
showed significantly greater improvement than the CG.</p><p>The changes in upper limb motor function were evaluated by using the FMA, and the EG showed
significantly greater improvement than the CG. Most of the previous studies that used
Nintendo games were conducted with chronic stroke patients because the study designs
required partial movement of the upper limbs. However, Kwon et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that a VR training program combined with
conventional therapy can be expected to produce greater improvement in upper limb motor
function and activities of daily living (ADL) in the acute stages of stroke. Furthermore, Da
Silva Cameirao et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
game-based VR rehabilitation improved upper limb motor function in the early stages of
stroke and led to the restoration of function faster than that in the CG during the
experimental period.</p><p>In this study, the participants paddled by using bilateral movements in which assistance of
the non-affected upper limb was used to induce movement of the affected upper limb.
Initially, the study participants complained of pain caused by overuse of the non-affected
upper limb or difficulty using the affected upper limb. However, as they adapted to the game
and became immersed in the activity, the frequency of the use of affected upper limb
increased. Conventional training leads to poor engagement and lack of interest by
participants due to the repetitive nature of the exercises, whereas VR training is
interesting and motivates participants to improve their concentration and increase their
time of participation in training. Interactive VR training provides immediate visual
feedback on performance, providing participants a more active and enjoyable experience in
the training program. However, Horlings et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that VR training that fails to provide realistic
environments can lower participants&#x02019; immersion.</p><p>The canoeing game, used as an intervention method in this study, not only provides a
realistic simulation of paddling a canoe but includes a free-practice mode for
familiarization and warm-up, as well as timed-run and competition modes for recording
individual accomplishments. The program components and system environment enhance the
participants&#x02019; interest and participation and increase their immersion. As a result, the EG
had better trunk postural stability, balance ability, and upper limb motor function than the
CG.</p><p>The application of new rehabilitation interventions in clinical setting demands primary
systematic investigation regarding the acceptability, ease of use, learnability, and
confidence to maximize their potential. Assessment of usefulness is required in both the
participants and testers. The SUS scores in this study were &#x0003e;70% in both the experimental
and therapist groups. No significant differences between the two groups were observed. These
results suggest that the canoe game-based VR training program is an acceptable and useful
approach for subacute inpatient stroke rehabilitation. The results of this study indicate
that an additional canoe-game based VR training program is feasible and effective for
improving trunk postural stability, balance ability, and upper limb motor function in
subacute stroke patients.</p><p>However, the study had several limitations. First, it was a pilot study with a small sample
size. Therefore, its results are difficult to generalize to stroke patients. For meaningful
analysis of SUS, data based on at least 12 people are required<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the future, a randomized controlled trial with an
adequate sample size should be conducted. Second, the effect of canoe game-based VR training
on the static balance ability of the stroke patients in the standing position was not
assessed. In order to fully understand the effects of VR physical therapy in stroke
patients, further studies that include methods performed by blinded assessors are clearly
needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cuthbert</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>Staniszewski</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Hays</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Virtual reality-based therapy for the treatment of balance
