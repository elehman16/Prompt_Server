We evaluated the effect of adding nalbuphine hydrochloride to levobupivacaine for supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade. The primary end-points were the onset and duration of sensory and motor blocks and duration of analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Seventy-eight patients (aged 25&#x02013;45 years) posted for ambulatory forearm and hand surgery under supraclavicular brachial plexus block were divided into two equal groups (Groups LN and LC) in a randomized, double-blind fashion. In Group LN (<italic>n</italic> = 39), 30 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine + 10 mg (diluted in 2 ml 0.9% saline) nalbuphine hydrochloride, and in Group LC (<italic>n</italic> = 39), 30 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine + 2 ml normal saline (0.9%) were administered in supraclavicular block. Sensory and motor block onset times and block durations, time to first analgesic use, total analgesic need, postoperative visual analog scale (VAS), hemodynamics, and side effects were recorded for each patient.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Although with similar demographic profile and block (sensory and motor) onset time, sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use were significantly longer and the total need for rescue analgesics was lower in Group LN (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) than Group LC. Postoperative VAS value at 24 h was significantly lower in Group LN (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Intraoperative hemodynamics was comparable between two groups, and no any appreciable side effect was noted throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>It can be concluded that adding nalbuphine hydrochloride to supraclavicular brachial plexus block increases the sensory and motor block duration and time to first analgesic use, and decreases total analgesic use with no side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Levobupivacaine</kwd><kwd>nalbuphine hydrochloride</kwd><kwd>supraclavicular brachial plexus block</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Pain frequently hampers the implementation of ambulatory surgery in spite of so many analgesic drugs and regimens.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Postoperative pain has a negative impact on patient's early mobilization and discharge as well as it causes unanticipated hospital admission, particularly in a day care setting.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Upper limb surgeries below mid arm are mostly performed under peripheral blocks such as the brachial plexus block. Peripheral nerve blocks provide intraoperative anesthesia as well as it extends analgesia in the postoperative period without major systemic side effects by minimizing stress response and using minimal analgesic drugs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Levobupivacaine, the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine, is a comparatively newer local anesthetic agent acting on voltage-dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels, introduced into clinical practice, and it also possesses less cardiac and neural toxicities. Levobupivacaine has been shown to be safe and effective for epidural and spinal anesthesia[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and blockade of the brachial plexus.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Local anesthetics alone for supraclavicular brachial plexus block provide good operative conditions but have a shorter duration of postoperative analgesia. Hence, various adjuvants such as opioids,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] clonidine,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] neostigmine, dexamethasone,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] midazolam,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and magnesium[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have been added to local anesthetics in brachial plexus block to achieve quick, dense, and prolonged block; however, the results are either inconclusive or associated with side effects.</p><p>Nalbuphine, derivative of 14-hydroxymorphine, is an agonist-antagonist opioid acting on &#x000b5; (mu) receptors as antagonist and &#x003ba; (kappa) receptors as agonist with an analgesic potency equal to morphine and its antagonistic potency is approximately &#x000bc;<sup>th</sup> of that of naloxone.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Unlike morphine, it exhibits a ceiling effect on respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Nalbuphine has the potential to maintain or even enhance &#x000b5;-opioid-based analgesia while simultaneously mitigating the &#x000b5;-opioid side effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Nalbuphine has the onset of action between 2 and 3 min, duration of action of 3&#x02013;6 h with cardiovascular stability, and minimal side effects in the dose of 0.2&#x02013;0.4 mg/kg.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Because of its safety profile, nalbuphine can be used for pain management in children with burns, neoplastic or hematological diseases.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Freedom from controlled drug act regulations and improved analgesia with nalbuphine render it more satisfactory for day care surgery than other commonly used opioids.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Despite its known benefits for pain control, nalbuphine has never been studied extensively for its effects as an adjuvant to anesthetics during brachial plexus blocks.</p><p>Our current study was designed to test the hypothesis that nalbuphine when added as an adjuvant to levobupivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block enhanced the onset, duration of sensory and motor blocks, duration of analgesia, and quality of block for the patients undergoing ambulatory forearm and hand surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee, written informed consent was taken. Totally, 78 adult patients were randomly allocated to two equal groups (<italic>n</italic> = 39 in each group) using computer-generated random number list. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II aged between 25 and 45 years of both sexes undergoing ambulatory elective orthopedic surgeries of forearm and hand under supraclavicular brachial plexus block were enrolled in the study. Patients in Group LN received 30 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine + 10 mg (diluted in 2 ml 0.9% saline) nalbuphine hydrochloride for supraclavicular block. Group LC received 30 ml 0.5% levobupivacaine + 2 ml normal saline (0.9%) for the same block.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Patient refusal, any known hypersensitivity or contraindication to levobupivacaine, nalbuphine hydrochloride, pregnancy, lactating mothers, hepatic, renal or cardiopulmonary abnormality, alcoholism, diabetes, long-term analgesic therapy, bleeding diathesis, and local skin site infections were excluded from the study. Patients having a history of significant neurological, psychiatric, or neuromuscular disorders were also excluded.</p><p>In preoperative assessment, the patients were enquired about any history of drug allergy, previous operations, or prolonged drug treatment. General examination, systemic examinations, and assessment of the airway were done. Preoperative fasting of minimum 6 h was ensured before the operation. All patients received premedication of tablet diazepam 10 mg orally the night before surgery as per preanesthetic check-up direction to allay anxiety, apprehension, and for sound sleep. The patients also received tablet ranitidine 150 mg in the previous night and the morning of operation with sips of water.</p><p>All patients were clinically examined in the preoperative period and routine investigations were checked, and at the same time, whole procedure was explained. Ten centimeters visual analog scale (VAS) (0 &#x02013; no pain and 10 &#x02013; worst pain imaginable) was also explained during preoperative visit. On entering the patient in the operating room, standard intraoperative monitors such as electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, and noninvasive blood pressure were attached and baseline parameter was recorded. Philips IntelliVue MP20 monitor was used for this purpose. Intravenous infusion of Ringer's lactate was started and oxygen was given at 2 L/min via nasal prong. All patients received injection midazolam 0.04 mg/kg before the procedure.</p><p>After proper explanation of technique, positioning interscalene groove was indentified, where a mark was made approximately 1.5&#x02013;2.0 cm posterior to the mid-clavicle point. The stimulation frequency was set at 1 Hz, and the intensity of the stimulating current was initially set to deliver 2 mA and was then gradually decreased. The 22-gauge 5 cm, insulated, Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> A needle was used. The position of the needle was considered to be acceptable when an output current &#x0003c;0.5 mA still elicited a slight distal motor response in forearm and hand. On negative aspiration for blood, a total volume of 32 ml solution was injected slowly as per allotment of the group and drug. The anesthesiologist performing supraclavicular block was unaware of the constituent of the drug and allotment of the group, and similarly, resident doctors keeping records of different parameters were also unaware of group allotment. Thus, blinding was properly maintained.</p><p>Sensory and motor blockades were assessed every 2 min after the completion of injection till 30 min and then every 30 min after the end of surgery till first 10 h, thereafter hourly until the block had completely worn off. Sensory blockade of each nerve was assessed by pinprick. Onset time of motor blockade was defined as the time interval between the end of local anesthetic injection and paresis in all the nerve distributions.</p><p>The duration of sensory block was defined as the time interval between the onset of sensory block and the first postoperative pain. The duration of motor block was defined as the time interval between the onset of motor block and complete recovery of motor functions. After 30 min, if the block was considered to be adequate, surgery commenced. Injection diclofenac sodium (rescue analgesic) 75 mg was given intramuscularly when VAS &#x02265;3 cm. The number of injection diclofenac sodium given to each patient during first 24 h of the postoperative period was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>After a crossover pilot study of ten patients, we estimated the first rescue analgesic requirement time in each group was 510 min. The sample size was estimated using first rescue analgesic requirement between two groups as the main primary variable. The average duration in each group was 510 min and to detect a difference of 10% (i.e., 51 min), at the <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 level, with a probability of detecting a difference of 80% (1&#x02212;beta = 0.80). On the basis of previous study assuming within group standard deviation of 90 min, we need to study at least 36 patients per group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the groups are equal with probability (power) 0.80. We had taken 39 patients in each group for this prospective study. Raw data were entered into Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analyzed using standard statistical software SPSS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Tiwari <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] found that the use of intrathecal nalbuphine and its increased concentration caused a proportional earlier onset of sensory and motor blocks, but it was statistically insignificant.

All the three patients managed with slow intravenous metoclopramide 10 mg. Sedation though was higher in nalbuphine group, it was quite arousable and did not cause any respiratory depression. Similarly, pruritus was higher in nalbuphine group, but it was self-limiting.

Shivering, urinary retention, and hypotension were probably due to spinal anesthesia-related complications. Again, Ahluwalia <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] found that only nausea and vomiting (5 vs. 2) was associated with intrathecal nalbuphine group while compared with tramadol in the same route. Mukherjee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] administered nalbuphine intrathecally (placebo, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mg) for orthopedic surgery and found that few side effects such as pruritus, nausea vomiting, respiratory depression, and bradycardia were exclusively associated with the highest dose of nalbuphine and hypotension was evident in all the groups which was probably due to spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Levobupivacaine dose was chosen as per recommendation in the textbook.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] We had also followed the drug dose used by our previous researchers.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Even we had taken slightly lesser amount of drug to be on a safer side. Ambi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] had taken 36 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine for perivascular and perineural ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block and here we have taken 30 ml of 0.5% levobupivacaine. Chatrath <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in their studies, used 10 mg nalbuphine in the lumbar epidural route safely without any appreciable complication. Again, the blood concentration of anesthetic drugs after various routes of administration reveals that drug concentration is the highest after intercostal nerve blockade, followed in order of decreasing concentration by injection into caudal epidural space, lumbar epidural space, brachial plexus, and subcutaneous tissue.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Thus, any drug used in brachial plexus blockade is associated with a lower risk of absorption and side effects than administered epidurally. Hence, we had chosen 10 mg nalbuphine for the use in brachial plexus block. While writing this discussion, we have found the reference of much higher dose (20 mg) of nalbuphine used for brachial plexus block for the patients undergoing elective forearm and hand surgery.</p><p>Several hypothesized mechanisms of action have been suggested to explain the analgesic effect of nalbuphine. Nalbuphine is a synthetic mixed &#x003ba;-agonist-&#x000b5;-antagonist opioid with a moderate analgesic effect when compared to morphine. Apart from &#x000b5;-opioid-based spinal and supraspinal analgesia, inhibition of neuronal serotonin uptake leads to augmentation of the spinal inhibitory pathways for pain.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Stimulation of opiate receptors on neurons of the central nervous system leads to an inhibition of intracellular adenylyl cyclase, an opening of potassium channels, and closing the calcium channels. This leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential and inhibition of action potential transmission of ascending pain pathways.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>However, the great drawback of our study was that we had not taken any standardized dose of nalbuphine due to nonavailability of proper pharmaceutical reference relating to dose equivalence with other well-known opioids. A control group was included in our study, but it was little unethical to withhold any adjuvant in these patients for prolongation of postoperative analgesia, particularly when being posted for ambulatory surgery.</p><p>Finally, we do conclude that, during day care forearm and hand surgery, addition of 10 mg nalbuphine hydrochloride to levobupivacaine 0.50% solution in supraclavicular brachial plexus block prolongs the duration of sensory and motor blockades, reduces the requirement of rescue analgesic in postoperative period but does not hasten the onset time of sensory and motor blockades without any appreciable side effect.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of
