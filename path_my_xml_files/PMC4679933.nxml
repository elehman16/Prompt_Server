There is no licensed vaccine or treatment for EVD, and the case fatality rate is around 70%.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The epidemic has declined since its peak, however disease incidence remains low.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As a result, it may be challenging to run the phase III vaccine trials necessary to assess the efficacy of candidate vaccines that are currently in development, and hence apply for licensure. As well as existing study designs being proposed, such as individually randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and stepped wedge trials,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> the declining incidence of EVD has led to development of novel vaccine trial designs<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> to account for the limited number of cases in West Africa.</p><p>Some areas have continued transmission, however, and thus remain potential candidate locations for a large-scale Ebola vaccine trial.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> For example, trials have been proposed in Guinea, where For&#x000e9;cariah prefecture has seen continuing transmission since October 2014. Conventional statistical power analysis or sample size estimation using fixed assumptions on incidence rates is inappropriate when incidence rates change during the course of an epidemic. Here we use a combination of epidemic modelling and statistical analysis to examine the chance of success of such trials. Specifically, we estimate the power of an RCT to detect vaccine efficacy in the coming months under a range of different scenarios.

More precisely, we simulated 200&#x02005;000 epidemic trajectories without a vaccine trial from 7 June 2015 until 1 May 2016. This corresponds to 40 stochastic simulations of 5000 samples from the posterior distribution of the parameters and model states inferred on 7 June 2015. We restricted the forecast to those parameter sets for which more than 25% of the 40 simulated epidemics go extinct before 1 May 2016, that is, assuming that elimination of EVD will be achieved within 10&#x02005;months. We kept 3542 (71%) of the 5000 parameter sets.

Excluding early cases in vaccinated and control arms maintains the false-positive rate below 5%, does not bias vaccine efficacy downward and maintains moderate power. In all cases, there is high probability that the epidemic goes extinct before vaccine efficacy can be accurately measured. These results are generalisable to other vaccine efficacies and start dates.</p><p>In practice, it may be difficult to find the appropriate exclusion period, where the period over which immunity is developed is unknown. Reducing both the protection delay and exclusion period from 2 to 1&#x02005;week leads only to a slightly earlier and higher peak in power due to greater sample sizes and number of cases included in the analysis. In addition, shorter delay increases herd immunity effect, leads to faster extinction of the epidemic and thus reduces the adjusted power at later time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009346F4">figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009346F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Effect of start date on trial success.

The effect of delaying the start of the trial by 1&#x02005;month halves the chance of success. Gradual enrolment of participants drastically reduces the power to detect efficacy compared with immediate rollout. The example shown is 1 July start date although other start dates show the same pattern, with greatly reduced power. This occurs because there is a high probability of extinction before enough participants are recruited.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we modelled the implementation of an individually randomised control vaccine trial in For&#x000e9;cariah prefecture, Guinea using an extended version of a previously published dynamic transmission model for EVD. We showed that if an RCT were to start later this year in For&#x000e9;cariah prefecture it would have a very limited chance of detecting any vaccine efficacy, because the epidemic is likely to go extinct before enough cases have occurred in participants. In addition, in realistic rollout scenarios of 10&#x02005;000 participants per month, the chance that the epidemic persists until enough participants are recruited and the trial is able to detect efficacy is very low, for example, below 2% for a trial beginning on 1 July 2015 with a 70% efficacious vaccine. We note that this adjusted power is probably an overestimate since our model operates at the population level and does not account for clustering effect at small scales.</p><p>We also demonstrated that exclusion of early cases in the group definition for the vaccine arm of a trial (ie, individuals vaccinated but not yet protected) inflates the power but also the false-positive rate due to the declining risk of infection over time. Ideally, the group definition for a primary analysis in a declining epidemic should consider excluding early cases in the control and intervention arms to maximise the power to detect vaccine efficacy while keeping the false-positive rate below 5%. Alternatively, more advanced statistical analyses accounting for time-varying risk of infection should be considered to circumvent the necessity of excluding early control cases.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This important bias must be accounted for in protocols of infectious disease vaccine trials.</p><p>Overall, our analysis is an example of how real-time mathematical models can be used to design trials more efficiently during an epidemic, and assess feasibility of planned trials, although models are infrequently utilised to this end. More realistic models accounting for network structure could be even more precise given that the majority of transmission events may be seen in clusters formed at confined space (eg, hospital or household) and also at a small spatial scale.
