damage indicators post application of two complex training programs for back squats.
[Subjects and Methods] Seven military athletes were the subjects of this study. The study
had a quasi-experimental cross-over intra-subject design. Two complex training protocols
were applied, and the variables to be measured were cortisol, metabolic creatine kinase,
and total creatine kinase. For the statistical analysis, Student&#x02019;s t-test was used.
[Results] Twenty-four hours post effort, a significant decrease in cortisol level was
shown for both protocols; however, the metabolic creatine kinase and total creatine kinase
levels showed a significant increase. [Conclusion] Both protocols lowered the indicator of
main muscular damage in the blood supply (cortisol). This proved that the work weight did
not generate significant muscular damage in the 24-hour post-exercise period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Complex training</kwd><kwd>Muscular damage indicators</kwd><kwd>Post-activation potentiation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Currently, training methods help to increase sports performance, but they also generate

The
foregoing is further evidenced when applying training protocols in subjects with a low
training level; these subjects, higher muscular damage is produced when applying the same
training load<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, in addition to evaluating the improvement in their
physical capabilities, it is also necessary to analyze blood muscular damage and fatigue
indexes, since it seems that most of the training methods used produced metabolic
alterations increasing muscular damage post effort.</p><p>Testing general fatigue, local fatigue, and/or organic alterations through blood indicators
such as creatin kinase and/or cortisol is an essential element of sports training<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several of the studies consulted for this
study focused on the analysis of muscular damage indicators with protocols of constant
resistance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> or intermittent sprint training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Unfortunately, there is
little evidence regarding protocols of complex training in power zones (from 0.6 m/s to 0.9
m/s for the vertical speed of the bar)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, modern training methods are being used to achieve post-activation potentiation
(PAP) in athletes, and complex training protocols have had a leading role in several
studies<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. These training methods correspond to a wide spectrum of protocols
varying the intensity during training sessions, but there are no studies on complex training
protocols in power zones measuring the variations of blood muscular damage indicators post
effort. Working in power zones would allow athletes to activate the central nervous system
and the muscles involved, generating post-activation potentiation and a later increase in
the sports performance in athletes<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Currently, the dynamics of blood muscular damage indicators in relation to complex training
are unclear. However, investigation of the muscular damage that could potentially occur in
muscles involved in back squats is a viable means of determining appropriate methodologies
for sports training.</p><p>The main focus of this study was to determine the variations in blood indicators of
muscular damage after the application of two complex training protocols for squats with
military athletes. The second aim of this study was to determine the acute effect of two
complex training protocols for back squats on time taken in 30-m sprints.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Developing interventions with elite athletes is a privilege only a few researchers have
experienced, but it entails some methodological issues. It is known that elite athletes
represent a very small sample; fortunately, there are experimental designs that provide a
solution for reduced and specific samples. Using the same subjects for the control and
experimental conditions is one of the most common strategies that enables researchers to
increase the number of participants in investigations on humans. Seven male athletes
participated in this study. They were subjected to two protocols of complex training with
back squats. Specific blood muscular damage indexes were evaluated, before and after the
application of the complex training protocols, for every subject. A quasi-experimental
crossover intra-subject design with pre-test and post-test evaluations was used for
application of the protocols.</p><p>Before beginning of the study, the weight, size, and skinfolds of each subject were
measured. The subjects were required to restrain from ingesting caffeine, drugs, or any
substance that could increase their metabolism during the course of the experiment. After
the preliminary assessment of blood muscular damage indexes (baseline), the group of seven
athletes was subdivided into two. During the first experimental session, <italic>subgroup
1</italic> received an intervention consisting of Protocol 1 (P1) and <italic>subgroup
2</italic> received an intervention consisting of Protocol 2 (P2); in the second
experimental session, <italic>subgroup 1</italic> received an intervention consisting P2 and
<italic>subgroup 2</italic> received an intervention consisting P1. Analyses of blood
indexes for muscular damage were carried out 24 hours after the application of the complex
training protocols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental design of complex training for back squats</p><p>RM: repetition maximum; [La]: concentrations of lactate</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1487-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>Seven male military athletes from the Chilean Navy (age, 25.0 &#x000b1; 2.6&#x02005;years; weight, 67.1 &#x000b1;

Each athlete and their coach was informed about the aim of the study and the
possible risks of the experiment, and they all signed an informed consent form before the
application of the protocols. The consent form and the study were approved by the Human
Research Ethics Committee of the Universidad de Granada, Spain (registration no. 933).</p><p>For sample characterization, weight and height were measured with a Health o
meter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Professional scale and stadiometer. Skinfolds were measured with a
F.A.G.A.<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> caliper. Using the methods Durnin &#x00026; Womersley<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the skinfolds of the biceps, triceps,
subscapularis, and supraspinatus were measured to determine the fat percentage.</p><p><italic>Standard warm-up:</italic> For evaluation of one repetition maximum (1 RM), the
control series, and the complex training protocols, the standard warm-up consisted of a
10-minute jog. During the first 5 minutes, subject performed a low-intensity run, and during
the subsequent 5 minutes, they added some ballistic movements to the lower limbs (hip
adductions, abductions, flexion and extension, and knee and ankle flexion and
extension).</p><p><italic>Blood tests</italic>: Before any blood analyses were carried out, there was a
48-hour washout period. Every single analysis was performed under fasting conditions. To
quantify variations in the blood indexes of muscular damage, three measurements were used,
with the first being the baseline. After this, the group of seven subjects was divided into
two random groups (<italic>subgroup 1, n=4; subgroup 2, n=3</italic>). Subgroup 1 received
the intervention consisting of P1, while subgroup 2 received the intervention consisting of
P2; 24 hours after the application of these protocols, the blood analysis was performed
again. On the second day of application of the protocols, subgroup 1 received the
intervention consisting of P2, while subgroup 2 received the intervention consisting of P1;
24 hours after the application of these protocols, the third blood analysis was performed
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The muscular damage indicators measured before and after application of the two complex
training programs were cortisol, metabolic creatine kinase (CK-MB), and creatine kinase
total (CK-Total). The blood analysis for CK-MB and CK-Total ware performed by enzymatic
method. For cortisol, a Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay was used. Every
measurement and analysis was carried out at the Naval Hospital of the Chilean Navy.</p><p><italic>Complex training</italic>: Prior to application of the complex training protocols,
the baseline values for maximum strength of the lower limbs were assessed through
performance of squats and speed during a 30-m sprint. For evaluation of 1RM during Squats, a
Chronojump Linear Encoder<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and the Chronojump software, Version
1.4.6.0<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, were used. The 1RM evaluation was performed indirectly through the
formula proposed by S&#x000e1;nchez-Medina et al<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Twenty-four hours after the assessment of 1RM, a control set was
performed that consisted of 4 sets of 1RM 60% squats for the purpose of verifying the
vertical speed of the bar for every athlete Bautista et al<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, 30-m sprints were evaluated using a Chronojump Photo
Cell<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and the Chronojump software, Version 1.4.6.0<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Sequence of 30-m sprint in the experimental protocol R1: first 30-m sprint; R2: second 30-m sprint; R3: third 30-m sprint; <inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1487-i001.jpg"/>, photocell.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1487-g002"/></fig>).</p><p>The study included two protocols of complex training. The first was defined as P1 and
consisted of 4 sets of 5 repetitions at 1RM 30% + 4 repetitions at 1RM 60% + 3 30-m sprints
separated by 120 seconds. The second protocol was defined as P2 and consisted of 4 sets of 4
repetitions at 1RM 60% + 5 repetitions at 1RM 30% + 3 30-m sprints separated by 120 seconds
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_003" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1487-g003"/></fig>). For the statistical analysis, the best time of the three sprints per set was used
(t&#x02005;min).</p><p>Data were analyzed as follows and in this order: the cortisol, CK-MB, and CK-Total levels
and minimum time required for the 30-m were subjected to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test
of normality for both P1 and P2. To compare the behavior of the blood indicators of muscular
damage before and after the application of the complex training protocols, Student&#x02019;s t-test
was applied. The baseline values were compared with those P1 and those P2 using Student&#x02019;s
t-test. The magnitude of the effect for this analysis was calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s d test
with the following effect scale: insignificant (d&#x0003c;0.2), small (d=0.2 up to 0.6), moderate
(d=0.6 to 1.2), large (d=1.2 to 2.0), and very large (d&#x0003e;2.0).</p><p>In order to determine the differences between the control set and the four experimental
sets of the complex training protocols, <italic>repeated measures ANOVA</italic> was used.
The extent of the effect for this analysis was calculated using the partial eta-squared
test. The level of significance for statistical analysis was p<italic>&#x0003c;</italic>0.05.
Analysis of the data was carried out using the GraphPad InStat software, Version 3.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Cortisol concentrations showed a significant decrease 24 hours after application of both

significant decrease in the concentrations of cortisol 24 hours after application of both
protocols of complex Training (P1, p=0.03; P2, p=0.02). Similarly, the blood levels of CK-MB
and CK-Total showed significant increases with both protocols. In most of the literature
consulted, the protocols used evidenced increases in the concentrations of CK<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> and cortisol post effort<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>,
muscular fatigue as shown by electromyography<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, muscular damage post effort<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and significant increases in the insulin-like growth factor I and
IGF binding protein 3 (p&#x0003c;0.05)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Regarding the second aim of the study, despite the fact that the levels of CK-MB and
CK-Total increased considerably post effort, the results of ANOVA revealed a positive acute
effect on t&#x02005;min for the 30-m sprint when applying complex training, both for P1
(p&#x0003c;0.0001) and P2 (p&#x0003c;0.0002). Such effect was attributed to the PAP of the muscles
involved in sprinting; this is supported by some studies that have shown significant
differences in sprint times and/or velocities<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In conclusion, when applying either of the two complex training protocols, the blood levels
of CK-MB and CK-Total increased considerably, though this did not affect the improvements in
performance, as the results showed improvement in the 30-m test; the reductions in 30-m
sprint time in the control set and the 4 experimental sets for P1 and P2 were attributed to
PAP of the musculature involved in sprinting. In terms of cortisol levels, the levels
dropped significantly 24 hours after application of both protocols; this decrease confirmed
that the subjects were in an anabolic phase 24 hours post effort. Therefore, application of
P1 and/or P2 seems to be a valid way of developing explosive strength in the lower limbs
without producing negative alterations in athletes.</p><p>From a practical point of view, applying a protocol of complex training with four sets of
back squats with 5 repetitions at 1RM 30% + 4 repetitions at 1RM 60% or four sets of 4
repetitions at 1RM 60% + 5 repetitions at 1RM 30% appears to be a good measure to achieve an
increase in the levels of explosive strength, since training with this load generates PAP in
the musculature involved in sprinting. Also, 24 hours post effort, subjects did not showed
alterations of cortisol (major blood index for muscular damage), which indicates to coaches
that complex training does not cause overtraining syndrome in athletes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Aboodarda</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mokhtar</surname><given-names>AH</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Muscle strength and damage following two modes of variable
