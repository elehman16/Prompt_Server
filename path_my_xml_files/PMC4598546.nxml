There were 28 females and 2 male patients. The average age was 36.6 years (range 21-45 years). The dominant/non dominant extremity was recorded. The clinical diagnosis was further confirmed by ultrasonography. X-Rays of the wrist joint were done to exclude any underlying bony pathology. Patients with no prior history of any treatment for de Quervain's tenosynovitis (operative or nonoperative) for at least 3 months were included in the study. A written, informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all patients. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee.</p><p>Patients who had a history of cervical spondylosis with or without radiating pain, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, fractures of upper extremity or any other chronic condition like rheumatoid arthritis were excluded from study.</p><p>The patients included in the study were randomly divided in two groups, one group (<italic>n</italic> = 15) received US Th. and the other group (<italic>n</italic> = 15) received LLLT.</p><p>A high resolution real time sonography of the wrist was performed using ultrasound machine (HDI 5000, SONO CT, Philips Electronics Hong Kong Limited, Wanchai, Hong Kong). A high frequency (5&#x02013;12 MHz) linear phased array probe with a broadband facility was used for ultrasonographic assessment of the patients by a radiologist. The other outcome measures were done by a physiotherapist.</p><p>A standard mercury Sphygmomanometer was used for measuring grip strength<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> (Elite, India).</p><p>A class 3 B (IEC 825) solid state Ga &#x02013; As-Al infrared laser (Endolaser 476, Enraf Nonius, Holland) with a pencil probe (wavelength 830 nm, power 30&#x02013;40 mw, beam diameter 4 mm, 1 mm at 10 mm from the probe, angle of divergence 2.5&#x000b0;) was used for treatment. The laser probe and the part to be treated were cleaned with 70% alcohol to remove any oil and dirt from the skin surface for better penetration. Protective goggles were worn by patients and therapist.</p><p>A 3 MHz ultrasonic generator (Medilap, Delhi, India) was used for ultrasonic therapy. An aquasonic gel was used as a coupling medium.</p><p>The following outcome measures were used namely Finkelstein's test, tenderness over radial styloid (Ritchie's tenderness scale), grip strength, pain as assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and ultrasonographic assessment of change in thickness of APL and EPB tendon sheaths. All the outcome measures were done before commencement and after the end of seven sessions of therapy. The clinical diagnosis was done by the orthopedician, ultrasonographic assessment by the radiologist and the remaining outcome measures and application of therapy were done by the physiotherapist. Finkelstein's test which involves grasping the patient's thumb and quickly moving the hand ulnarward<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> was performed. Tenderness elicited over the tip of the radial styloid process was taken as a positive test.<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Tenderness on pressure over the radial styloid was graded by Ritchie's tenderness scale.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The grades were Grade I - Tolerable pain, Grade II - Patient winces on pressure and Grade III - Patient winces and withdraws hand.</p><p>Grip strength<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> was measured by a standard mercury sphygmomanometer with the arm cuff inflated to 30 mm Hg. The elbow and arm were supported on a table and the elbow flexed to 90&#x000b0;. The cuff was then pressed in the cylindrical grasp. The elevation of the mercury column was recorded 3 times. The average of three readings was taken. Clinically, the improvement was assessed subjectively by the patient, using a 11-point VAS<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> (0 = no pain, 10 = severe pain). The clinical tests were repeated before reducing the dosage of laser/ultrasound therapy if improvement was observed.</p><p>Ultrasonographic assessment was done to measure combined thickness of the APL and EPB sheaths. The patients were examined in sitting position with both forearms placed in mid-prone position in the patient's lap/thigh. The scans were optimized by selecting the superficial musculoskeletal settings for the system. Abundant jelly was placed over the radial side of the wrist and both transverse and longitudinal scanning was performed. The scanned area extended from few centimeters proximal to the radial styloid up to the insertion of the tendons of the first compartment (distal end of the proximal phalanx). The transverse scans were obtained for the measurement of the tendon sheath at the level of the radial styloid. The probe was placed perpendicular to the styloid process without applying any pressure. The scan was done, and findings/measurement recorded for both the sides (symptomatic and asymptomatic). The anteroposterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML) dimensions taken bilaterally, by placing the electronic calipers at the maximum AP and ML dimensions of the tendon sheath, before the commencement and after the treatment. The radiologist was blinded to the patient allocation, mode of intervention and clinical evaluation of the patients. The physiotherapist was blinded to the ultrasonographic measurements taken before and after treatment. The patients were given US Th./LLLT for a total of 7 exposures on alternate days by the standard exposure procedures.</p><p>The LLLT was applied twice per session. Once the probe was held stationery, in contact with skin (at radial styloid) and the second time in scanning mode (along tendon sheath approximately an inch long) (exposure time for 1 min 40 s, energy in joules: 3 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, continuous 100%, spot size on skin (with diameter): 2.5 cm (area = 4.910 cm<sup>2</sup>).<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The area to be treated was divided into a grid of 1 cm squares, and optimum anti-inflammatory dosage of 3 J/cm<sup>2</sup> continuous output of 100% was used. The dose was reduced to 2 J/cm<sup>2</sup> when VAS reduced by 50% approximately. Testing of optical output was performed regularly before and after the end of treatment.</p><p>For ultrasonic therapy, the pulsed mode was used to expose the area over the radial styloid, (1:1 pulse ratio; 5 ms on and 5 ms off). A space averaged intensity of 0.8 W/cm<sup>2</sup>] (depth of lesion 0.5 cm approximately) for a period of 3 min was delivered.</p><p>Neither oral or injectable steroids nor non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs were administered to any of these patients.

The <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence for the efficacy of US Th. is known.<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Further research is indicated to achieve the results <italic>in vivo</italic> too.</p><p>Pulsed US Th. was used in the present study as it is preferred for soft tissue repair. The frequency of 3 MHz was used as the target tissue was superficial. A low intensity of 0.8 W/cm<sup>2</sup> with pulse ratio of 1:1 was used as the area exposed was bony. The area treated was very small 2 cm approximately in diameter and treated for 3 min. A study conducted by Saunders<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> compares US Th. versus LLLT in the treatment of supraspinatus tendinosis. Measurements were taken before and after treatment for muscle weakness secondary to pain (Pain analog scale), disability, and tenderness. The treatments were given for 3 weeks. They found that LLLT is the treatment of choice in supraspinatus tendinosis. Ultrasound also improved symptoms but was not significantly different from the controls who received advice only. In our study, both LLLT and US Th. showed an improvement in de Quervains tenosynovitis. The US Th. group showed marginally better improvement as compared to LLLT with the respective dosages used.</p><p>The various parameters showing improvement are probably due to a reduction in the diameter of the tendon sheaths resulting in greater ease of motion and hence decrease in pain. US Th. and laser both have resulted in improvement in tendon sheath diameters and tenderness (Ritchie's tenderness scale) causing improvements in grip strength and VAS. This implies a reduction in inflammation and promotion of healing. The subjects who do not show any improvement may have had a thickened retinaculum. During the ultrasonographic evaluation, the thickening in the extensor retinaculum was observed in seventeen patients. This fact has not been commented on in any of the earlier ultrasonographic studies<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> on de Quervains tenosynovitis though surgically it has been observed. This finding may have clinical implications as regards choice of treatment and prognosis. It also implies that the retinaculum thickness should also be measured. Further studies with more patients and long term followup would be desirable. The response to treatment and its relationship to a thickened retinaculum need further study.</p><p>The medial part of the tendon is the deepest, and the laser effects may have been diminished due to attenuation in the tissue, which may be the probable explanation for the lesser response seen in the case of LLLT. Furthermore, the mode of delivery, that is, scanning rather than skin contact was used for the second application. This may have reduced the actual dosage received at the target tissue. The better results in US Th. may be because of major areas of the tendon receiving therapy being exposed for maximum period of the treatment time, thus receiving optimum dosage required. No other studies have used this dosage to the best of our knowledge.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>One of the limitations of the current study was that sample size is small. Further study with differential ultrasonographic measurements of the extensor retinaculum and tendon sheath thickness in de Quervains tenosynovitis and its relation to the response to treatment should be conducted. Another limitation of the current study is that the followup is small (14 days). Hence larger randomized control trials with a longer followup is required.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahuja</surname><given-names>NK</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>KC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fritz de Quervain, MD (1868-1940): Stenosing tendovaginitis at the radial styloid process</article-title><source>J Hand Surg Am</source><year>2004</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>1164</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15576233</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharma</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Thukral</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhargava</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of low level lasers in de Quervains tenosynovitis.
