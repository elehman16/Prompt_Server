During the 8-week treatment period, all patients received S-amlodipine 2.5 mg/d for the first 4 weeks, followed by S-amlodipine 5 mg/d for the second 4 weeks. For efficacy assessments, ambulatory and office blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed during the baseline, fourth-week, and eighth-week visits. For safety assessments, all adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings were recorded. This study is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT03038451). Of 43 patients evaluated at the screening visit, 33 were enrolled. In the treatment-naive arm, significant reductions in both office and ambulatory systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were observed with S-amlodipine 2.5 mg/d and additional significant reductions were achieved with dose titration (S-amlodipine 5 mg/d). At the end of the study, the rate of the treatment-naive patients with BP under control (SBP/DBP &#x0003c;140/90 mm Hg) was 53% with S-amlodipine 2.5 mg and increased to 78% with S-amlodipine 5 mg. For the noninferiority evaluation, S-amlodipine 2.5 and 5 mg/d treatments were generally noninferior to both office and ambulatory BP levels achieved with the medications that the patients received before participating in the study. Five nonserious adverse events likely to be associated with the study drug were observed. No serious adverse event was encountered. Consequently, S-amlodipine can be suggested as an effective and safe treatment option for patients with hypertension.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>S-amlodipine</kwd><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1074248418769054"><funding-source id="funding1-1074248418769054"><institution-wrap><institution>Neutec R&#x00026;D Industry and Trade Company (Turkey)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1074248418769054"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypertension is the leading cause of preventable premature deaths worldwide and is associated with an economic burden of billion dollars per year.

According to the patient&#x02019;s self-report, the patient visited a hospital&#x02019;s emergency 3 days ago with the complaint of high BP after having measured his/her BP at a pharmacy and obtaining an SBP of approximately 170 mm Hg and was given sublingual tablet without hospitalization and prescribed ramipril 5 mg/d in addition to the daily treatment by the physician of the emergency department. The patient was evaluated as uncontrolled hypertension. Accordingly, the patient was prescribed a new treatment and was excluded from the study. All events were reported to the ethics committee and the Turkish Medicine and Medical Device Agency. No other significant safety issue was determined during the baseline and final visits. There was no problem neither in ambulatory (nighttime, daytime, and mean) and office pulse rates nor in body temperature measured over the study course.</p><table-wrap id="table5-1074248418769054" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 5.</label><caption><p>Hematological and Biochemical Test Results of the Patients Completing the Study.<sup>a,b</sup>

They reduce entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into the vascular smooth muscle and myocardial cells and accordingly impair excitation&#x02013;contraction relationship by lowering cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level; consequently, vasodilatation occurs and peripheral resistance decreases.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Antihypertensive mechanism of action of amlodipine depends on direct spasmolytic effect on the vascular smooth muscle. The definite mechanism of action of amlodipine in relieving angina pectoris is unclear; however, amlodipine reduces total ischemic load in 2 ways. First, amlodipine reduces total peripheral resistance that the heart is exposed to (afterload) by dilating peripheral arterioles. As the heart beat rate remains stable, decreased cardiac load reduces myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirement. Second, dilatation of the main coronary arteries and the arterioles both in normal and ischemic regions enhances myocardial oxygen supply in patients with coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal&#x02019;s or variant angina).<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>

</p><p>A single dose of S-amlodipine 2.5 mg is recommended as the starting dose in the treatment of hypertension, and the dose can be titrated to maximum 5 mg/d depending on the patient&#x02019;s response.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In the present study, which was performed to evaluate efficacy and safety of S-amlodipine at a daily dose of 2.5 (low) and 5 mg (high) on BP control in adult hypertensive patients, significant reductions were observed both in SBP and DBP levels in the treatment-naive patients after 4 weeks of treatment with S-amlodipine 2.5 mg/d. Afterward, the patients received S-amlodipine 5 mg/d between the fourth and eighth weeks; the reductions in office and ambulatory BPs at the eighth week with respect to the baseline was found to be significant. Additional significant reductions were achieved in office and ambulatory BPs with dose titration (difference between eighth week and fourth week). Considering overall study outcomes within this context, it was concluded that S-amlodipine is an effective therapeutic option at the doses of 2.5 and 5 mg in the treatment of hypertensive patients.</p><p>In the study by Chen et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> low-dose (2.5 mg/d) or high-dose (5 mg/d) S-amlodipine was randomly administered to the patients with mild or moderate hypertension for 8 weeks. In the low-dose group (n = 263), 24-hour ambulatory SBP/DBP value decreased from 131.5 &#x000b1; 15.0/82.1 &#x000b1; 10.7 mm Hg at the baseline to 126.0 &#x000b1; 13.5/78.5 &#x000b1; 9.5 mm Hg at the eighth week. These values were 133.6 &#x000b1; 13.7/83.1 &#x000b1; 9.9 mm Hg at the baseline and 125.0 &#x000b1; 12.0/78.2 &#x000b1; 8.9 mm Hg at the eighth week in the high-dose group (n = 260). Similar trends were also observed for daytime and nighttime ambulatory and clinical BP levels. Adverse events were found to be similar between the low-dose and high-dose groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>
</p><p>In the present study, noninferiority analysis performed in the antihypertensive monotherapy group revealed that office and ambulatory BPs achieved with S-amlodipine 2.5 mg and S-amlodipine 5 mg were generally noninferior to the drugs that the patients had received before participating in the study. Moreover, S-amlodipine 5 mg showed superiority in some parameters. Nevertheless, the number of patients was considered relatively low for arriving at a definite conclusion. Our findings, however, can be considered as preliminary outcomes for further comparative studies.</p><p>In the present study, in the patients completing the study (n = 28), hematological and biochemical parameters revealed no significant change from baseline to 8 weeks of treatment, except for the hematocrit levels. The reason for the significant change for hematocrit levels could be attributed to the small sample size, and there was no safety concern due to laboratory test results; nevertheless, safety of S-amlodipine should be evaluated in future larger studies. In this study, a total of 5 adverse events (uncontrolled hypertension, headache, pretibial edema [n = 2], and redness and sensation of warmth in the neck and over the clavicle) likely to be associated with the study drug were encountered over the study course. No serious adverse event was observed in the study. Leg edema is a side effect encountered with the use of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and may require dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Nevertheless, it has been reported that leg edema is less prevalent with S-amlodipine compared with racemic amlodipine.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-1074248418769054" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> In the present study, pretibial edema was determined in 2 patients (one at a dose of 2.5 mg/d and one at a dose of 5 mg/d).</p><p>The main limitation of the present study might be the relatively low number of patients; however, the results reached a power of 80% for the primary end point (the change in SBP from the baseline [day 1] to fourth week [day 28]) and for almost all objectives in the treatment-naive arm. It was indicated that the number of treatment-naive patients was sufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of S-amlodipine. On the other hand, as we mentioned above, the noninferiority analysis can be considered as a pilot evaluation for further comparative studies. Moreover, in the present study, high BP control rates were achieved by S-amlodipine 2.5 and 5 mg/d; this might be due to the low baseline BP levels of the study population comprising mostly patients with stage I hypertension. In addition, almost all of the studies with S-amlodipine were conducted on Far Eastern and Asian populations. Accordingly, it can be said that the present study is valuable in terms of evaluating and demonstrating the efficacy and safety of S-amlodipine in a different population. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that the promising results of the present single-center study were obtained in a small and highly selected population, and the patients were followed up for a short treatment period of 4 to 8 weeks. Therefore, for the results to be generalized to the universe of patients with hypertension, the efficacy and safety of S-amlodipine should be confirmed in more compelling and definitive controlled multicenter, long-term follow-up studies in a more diverse broadly representative population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-1074248418769054"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, a significant reduction in BP level was observed with S-amlodipine 2.5 mg/d and significant reductions both in office and ambulatory BPs were achieved with dose titration (5 mg/d).
