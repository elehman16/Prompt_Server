A total of 304 type 2 diabetic patients with CAD, mean age = 63.3 years (range, 36&#x02013;80 years), were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either glipizide (30 mg daily) or metformin (1.5 g daily) for 3 years.

Since cardiovascular disease is the major complication of type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular mortality accounts for the majority of diabetic patient deaths, there has been growing interest in developing strategies for blood glucose control in type 2 diabetic patients to reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Among various oral glucose-lowering medications, metformin and sulfonylureas have been the mainstay treatments for type 2 diabetes. Several studies have examined the effects of these medications on cardiovascular risk among diabetic patients; the results, however, are inconsistent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In an early, large-scale, randomized trial, an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed in diabetic patients treated with sulfonylurea (tolbutamide) or biguanide (phenformin) medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Some other studies suggest that these two classes of medications might differentially affect cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). For example, in the open-label UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), it was found that diabetic patients with metformin treatment had a reduced risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications as well as all-cause mortality compared with those treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. However, the combined treatment of metformin and sulfonylurea led to an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Taken together, how these two major hypoglycemic agents may affect cardiovascular risk and mortality among diabetic patients remains unclear.</p><p>Therefore, we performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the effects of the two major classes of blood glucose&#x02013;lowering agents, sulfonylurea (glipizide) and metformin, on the cardiovascular events and mortality in 304 Chinese type 2 diabetic patients who had a history of coronary artery disease (CAD).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>The Study on the Prognosis and Effect of Antidiabetic Drugs on Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with Coronary Artery Disease (SPREAD-DIMCAD) was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the different effects of glipizide and metformin on the major cardiovascular events and mortality among type 2 diabetic patients with a history of CAD. The patients were recruited from 15 clinical centers in China. The study was approved by the institutional review board of Ruijin Hospital, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. The study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The targeted participants in the current study were patients with both type 2 diabetes and CAD. The eligibility criteria included the following: <italic>1</italic>) diagnosed as CAD by either having a history of acute myocardial infarction diagnosed by a representative set of electrocardiograms, cardiac enzyme values, and typical symptoms or by angiographically identified stenosis of &#x0003e;50% of lumen diameter in at least one major epicardial coronary artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>); <italic>2</italic>) diagnosed as type 2 diabetic according to the 1999 World Health Organization criteria (fasting plasma glucose &#x02265;7 mmol/L and/or 2-h oral glucose tolerance test &#x02265;11.1 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and fasting plasma glucose &#x0003c;15 mmol/L); and <italic>3</italic>) no more than 80 years of age (both men and women). The exclusion criteria included the following: <italic>1</italic>) severe liver dysfunction, including serum alanine aminotransferase concentration &#x0003e;2.5 times above the upper limit of normal range and abnormal renal function (serum creatinine &#x0003e;132 &#x003bc;mol/L); <italic>2</italic>) severe dysfunction of the heart (New York Heart Association class &#x0003e;phase III); <italic>3</italic>) psychiatric disease, severe infection, severe anemia, or neutropenia; <italic>4</italic>) other severe organic heart diseases, including, but not limited to, congenital heart disease, rheumatic heart disease, and hypertrophic or dilated cardiomyopathy; <italic>5</italic>) pregnant or lactating; <italic>6</italic>) allergic to study drugs; <italic>7</italic>) using insulin therapy for type 2 diabetes and could not be changed to oral glucose-lowering drugs; and <italic>8</italic>) recent drug or alcohol abuse.</p><p>The primary study end points were the composite of recurrent cardiovascular events, including nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke or arterial revascularization by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or by coronary artery bypass graft, death from a cardiovascular cause, and death from any cause. The end points were obtained and confirmed by the medical records and death certificates that were kept in each center. The secondary cardiovascular end points included new or worsening angina, new or worsening heart failure, new critical cardiac arrhythmia, and new peripheral vascular events. Other adverse events, including hypoglycemia (severe hypoglycemia in which the subject required assistance and/or a plasma glucose level &#x0003c;56 mg/dL [3.1 mmol/L] was recorded as a hypoglycemic attack and would be reported in this manuscript) and microvascular complications, were also monitored.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Randomization and study medication</title><p>After a 2-week run-in period, the eligible study participants were required to withdraw from all antidiabetic agents and were randomly assigned in double-blind to receive either glipizide plus metformin placebo or metformin plus glipizide placebo for 3 years. The baseline metabolic values were obtained immediately after the withdrawal of previous antidiabetic therapy. The randomization codes were generated by the study&#x02019;s biostatistician at Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. Study sites did not have access to the codes.</p><p>For both groups, the targeted glycated hemoglobin level was &#x0003c;7.0%, the fasting blood glucose concentration was &#x0003c;7 mmol/L, and the postload 2-h blood glucose concentration was &#x0003c;10 mmol/L. The study drugs and the matched placebo were prepared in indistinguishable tablets. For the glipizide group, the initial dose was 15 mg daily (5 mg per one pill, three times daily) and titrated to 30 mg (10 mg per two pills, three times daily) within 3 months, if not to target. The mean daily dose of glipizide was 28.3 &#x000b1; 3.9 mg. For the metformin group, the initial dose was 0.75 g daily (0.25 g per one pill, three times daily), and titrated to 1.5 g (0.5 g per two pills, three times daily) within 3 months, if not to target. The mean daily dose of metformin was 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.2 g. After 3 months, insulin was added for patients with the maximum dose of study drug administration in either group who did not achieve targeted glucose control level (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc12-0719/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link>). Lifestyle intervention and other treatments for CAD and modifiable cardiovascular risk factors were identical in both groups through all research centers according to the recommendation of the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol In Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>The study drug administration was 3 years for each participant. The follow-up for primary end points began at randomization and continued until the end of the study. The original protocol invited all participants to continue with the follow-up of primary outcomes until the end of the whole study (last subject finished the study drug administration) after the initial 3-year study drug administration. In the postdrug follow-up period, the primary end points were obtained and no attempts were made to maintain their previous therapies. During study drug administration, information on adherence and tolerability of study drugs, concomitant medication, adverse events, and occurrence of study outcomes were collected, and physical examination, vital signs, and plasma glucose concentrations were obtained. Glycated hemoglobin levels were measured at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months (extra results might be required according to the investigator&#x02019;s judgment), and lipid concentration, biochemical safety laboratory analysis, electrocardiograms, and echocardiographic results were obtained.</p><p>Ruijin Hospital served as the coordinating center. There was no central laboratory for biochemical analysis for the study.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This study was designed in accordance with a predetermined statistical analysis plan. Given a constant rate of events of 10% per year, a sample size of 150 patients in each of the two study groups would provide an 85% power at a type 1 error rate of 0.05 to detect a 30% reduction in the relative risk of the composite primary outcomes during the follow-up. This analysis was designed to test the primary hypothesis that glipizide and metformin would have a different effect on the recurrence of composite cardiovascular events. The follow-up for primary end points began at randomization and continued until the end of the study (last subject finished the study drug administration) after the initial 3-year study drug administration.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Data were expressed as means and SDs or as medians with IQRs when specified. Logarithmic transformation was used for variables that were not normally distributed. Within-group comparisons were performed with paired-sample Student <italic>t</italic> tests to evaluate the differences from baseline in each group. A Student <italic>t</italic> test (for data that were normally distributed) or a Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test (not normally distributed) and an ANCOVA analysis with a model that included the baseline value of the dependent variable as a covariate were also used for comparison between groups. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to analyze the differences in categorical variables. The primary end point of this trial was time to recurrent events. Multiple event analysis was performed with the use of the proportional means regression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). A multivariate proportional means regression model was used to control for the duration of diabetes, duration of CAD, age, sex, and smoking history at baseline. For all analyses, glipizide use was treated as the reference group.

After a median of 5.0 years of follow-up, treatment with metformin showed a significant reduction of the recurrence of composite cardiovascular events compared with glipizide, which indicated a protective effect of metformin on cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Such a protective effect of metformin may also be present in a later stage of type 2 diabetes during insulin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>Cardiovascular disease is the most common complication and the leading cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Sulfonylureas and metformin have been the cornerstone of drug therapy for type 2 diabetes, either alone or in combination, for a quarter of a century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Experimental studies have shown different effects of these two kinds of antidiabetic drugs on cardiovascular disease besides their glucose-lowering effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). However, studies comparing these two classes of medications on cardiovascular risk in humans generated highly inconsistent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Several reasons may account for the discrepancies among these studies. First, most of the previous studies are retrospective and observational in design. The patients included in different studies varied in the severity of diabetes and cardiovascular disorders as well as other characteristics, such as BMI and glucose levels, which might influence drug choice. Second, the uses of cardiovascular medications were not well controlled in some studies and might also contribute to the diverse associations with cardiovascular events. Moreover, few previous studies directly compared the effects of sulfonylureas and metformin on cardiovascular events, and the evidence from randomized clinical trials is sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Our study was the first to compare the effects of sulfonylureas (glipizide) and metformin on the recurrence of major cardiovascular events in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. We found that, compared with glipizide, metformin showed a significant reduction in composite cardiovascular end points. Furthermore, since the primary outcome occurring within 1 year (nine patients in the glipizide group and eight patients in the metformin group) seems unlikely to have been caused by the effects of glipizide or metformin treatment, we performed a stratified analysis and only looked at the events after 1 year (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.31&#x02013;0.72]; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), showing a better effect of metformin on the primary outcome. Several lines of evidence may explain the different effects of sulfonylureas and metformin on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Sulfonylureas can increase pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell insulin release by inhibiting the ATP-sensitive potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel through binding to &#x003b2;-cell sulfonylurea receptor 1. While binding to sulfonylurea receptor 2 on cardiac myocytes, sulfonylureas inhibit cardiac K<sub>ATP</sub> channels and reduce the protective effects of myocardial preconditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). On the other hand, metformin reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis and increases insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and fat tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Recent evidence shows that metformin has antiatherogenic effects through the reduction of inflammatory markers, vascular adhesion molecules, and coagulation parameters, as well as the reduction of endothelial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In addition, sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, whereas metformin is associated with weight loss. Weight gain may negate the beneficial effects of sulfonylureas on glucose and increase mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Moreover, in our present study, statin use was significantly lower in the metformin group as compared with the glipizide group (59.5 vs. 73.7%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.013) at the end of the study. However, no significant difference was found in the lipid levels between the two groups after treatment, even with a tendency of slightly higher triglyceride levels during the first part (18 months) in the metformin group. These findings further strengthened the beneficial long-term effects of metformin, which might be associated with the antiatherosclerotic properties beyond glucose lowering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>The prospective, randomized, and controlled design of our study minimizes the potential bias and confounding. However, several limitations need to be considered. First, we used glipizide to represent the sulfonylureas because it is one of the most commonly used sulfonylureas in China. However, various sulfonylureas may differ in their effects on glucose control and cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Second, the secondary end points and adverse events were recorded only during the 3-year period of study drug administration, which might decrease the power of analysis. Third, we did not have a washout period in the current study due to safety concerns. Moreover, although the training of a lifestyle approach was implemented to reduce the risk for cardiovascular outcome in both groups and through all research centers according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III recommendation, we did not monitor and record the change of diet and exercise during the study. However, the double-blind, randomized study design and the intent-to-treat approach might minimize these limitations. Therefore, we would be cautious in interpreting the findings.</p><p>In summary, metformin therapy for 3 years substantially reduced major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients compared with glipizide, one of the commonly used sulfonylureas. Our results, taken in conjunction with recent research, indicated a potential benefit of metformin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
