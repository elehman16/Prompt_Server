The severity and clinical manifestations depend on host-related environmental factors. One of the decisive factors is the immune-inflammatory reaction manifested by host defense mechanism.</p><p>Among the inflammatory mediators, eicosanoids comprise a group of biochemical substances that are derived principally from the metabolism of arachidonic acid. They include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, thromboxanes, etc. These mediators have a significant role in regulation of inflammation by increasing vasodilatation, vascular permeability, and edema.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>There is increasing interest in how these host responses, particularly pathways of destruction can be modulated or blocked to alter the progression of periodontal diseases. The ability of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) to block cyclooxygenase pathway and reduce the prostaglandin synthesis led to series of studies demonstrating inhibition of periodontal disease progression.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Although relatively low-dose systemic NSAIDS have been successfully used in periodontics, it is not without side-effects. The major among these was gastrointestinal tract irritation. It is therefore desirable to formulate an agent that will deliver an effective dose of NSAID into periodontal tissues with minimum side-effects and maximum local effects.</p><p>This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of a novel indigenously designed flurbiprofen controlled release biodegradable gel system in the management of periodontal diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Source of data</title><p>This single-center, randomized, controlled, investigator blind, clinical study was conducted at the department of periodontics, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Manipal, India.</p><p>The 51 patients with localized periodontal pockets were selected from the outpatient section of the department. Informed consent was obtained from the patients and the ethical committee of the institute approved this clinical trial. These patients were scrutinized for the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Selection criteria</title><p>The systemically healthy patients with isolated localized periodontal pocket measuring &#x02265;5 mm and presence of bleeding on probing were selected for the study. The patients with history of scaling and root planing (SRP) for 12 months prior to baseline were excluded from the study. The medically compromised patients, pregnant or lactating mothers, and patients with history of antibiotic or anti-inflammatory therapy in last 6 months were excluded from the study. All the current smokers and the patients who have quit smoking in less than 1 year from baseline were not included in the study.</p><p>After scrutinizing, 17 patients were excluded from the study and two patients refused to participate in the study due to personal reason. To get uniformity in sample, the sample size at the baseline, two more patients were excluded to have a sample size of 30 patients.</p><p>These patients were randomly divided into three groups using the block randomization method. The first group of the patients received the placement of the gel only (GO). The second group received SRP at the baseline followed by gel placement (GOP), whereas the third group received the oral prophylaxis with placebo gel placement (OPP).</p><p>The SRP in all the subjects was performed by a single professional until the root surface was considered smooth and clean by the operator. The calibrated examiner for recording all the data in the study groups was completely blinded of the different groups in the study.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are released by infiltrate cells like neutrophils and recordent cells like fibroblasts, osteoclasts. These MMPs play an important role in degradation of the extracellular matrix and resorption of alveolar bone. Synthetic MMP-inhibitors and other HMT are being studied in clinical trials.

The outcome of this study is very important in developing flurbiprofen controlled release gel as an effective adjunct in the management of periodontal inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study reveal that even though gel alone improved the gingival inflammatory status, enhanced effect of the gel and oral prophylaxis are more evident. The effect of gel thus increases the results obtained by oral prophylaxis.
