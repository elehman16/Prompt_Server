Although FOLFIRINOX has become a standard regimen for advanced PC, its use is limited to patients in good medical condition because of its severe toxicity [<xref rid="MDV603C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel is another treatment option for patients in fair condition [<xref rid="MDV603C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Some patients still receive gemcitabine monotherapy as first-line treatment.</p><p>Even with intensive chemotherapy regimens such as FOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel, the median progression-free survival (PFS) is &#x0223c;6 months. Furthermore, a considerable number of patients cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy after first-line chemotherapy. Although a combination of oxaliplatin, leucovorin (LV), and fluorouracil (OFF) prolonged survival when compared with fluorouracil plus LV (FF) after gemcitabine failure (CONKO-003 trial) [<xref rid="MDV603C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], there are various unmet needs that should be addressed in a second-line setting for advanced PC.</p><p>In Japan, S-1 (Taiho Pharmaceutical, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), an oral fluoropyrimidine that inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, has been demonstrated to be non-inferior to gemcitabine as first-line chemotherapy for advanced PC [<xref rid="MDV603C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In gemcitabine-refractory patients, a previous phase II study reported that S-1 was moderately effective, with a response rate (RR) of 15%, a median PFS of 2.0 months, and a median overall survival (OS) of 4.5 months [<xref rid="MDV603C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, although oxaliplatin and irinotecan can be key drugs, neither S-1 plus oxaliplatin nor S-1 plus irinotecan provided a survival benefit over S-1 monotherapy in patients with gemcitabine-refractory PC [<xref rid="MDV603C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="MDV603C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Because S-1 monotherapy is less toxic than these doublet regimens, it is widely used in gemcitabine-refractory patients as the practical standard care in Japan.</p><p>LV is known to enhance the efficacy of fluorouracil in metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) [<xref rid="MDV603C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In preclinical studies, combined treatment with LV and S-1 was suggested to enhance therapeutic efficacy [<xref rid="MDV603C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A randomized phase II study suggested that adding to LV to capecitabine might not increase efficacy because of increased intolerable toxicities [<xref rid="MDV603C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Given the time-dependent antitumor effects and toxicities of fluoropyrimidine plus LV, various schedules of S-1 plus LV (SL) were studied in metastatic CRC, and a 2-week schedule (1 week on, 1 week off) was designated as the optimal schedule, maintaining high antitumor efficacy with manageable toxicity [<xref rid="MDV603C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="MDV603C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

All adverse events were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). CT or MRI was carried out every 4 weeks during the first 16 weeks and every 6 weeks thereafter until disease progression. Response was assessed by the attending physicians and confirmed by the IRC according to RECIST version 1.1. If there was any discordance between an investigator and the IRC, the date of disease progression as evaluated by the IRC was used to calculate PFS.

Secondary end points were OS, RR, disease control rate (DCR), duration of response, time to treatment failure (TTF), time to progression (TTP), dose intensity, and adverse events (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv603/-/DC1">supplementary Appendix SA4, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="mdv603_s2g"><title>statistical analysis</title><p>The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was expected to be 0.67, corresponding to a median PFS of 3.0 months in the SL group and 2.0 months in the S-1 group. These estimates were based on the results of a previous study [<xref rid="MDV603C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To detect such an improvement in the HR with &#x02265;80% power and a one-sided significance level of 0.10, a total of 110 events of progressive disease confirmed by the IRC in the full analysis set (FAS) were required. Given a 10% loss of events due to discordance in the PFS assessment between the IRC and the investigators and a 5% dropout rate from the FAS for various reasons, the sample size was set at 140 patients. Time-to-event variables, such as PFS, OS, TTF, and TTP, were analyzed with the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and the HR for these end points was calculated with a Cox proportional-hazards model. Primary comparisons of PFS between the treatment groups were made with the stratified log-rank test adjusted for allocation factors. The secondary end points of OS, TTF, and TTP were analyzed with the use of log-rank tests. RR and DCR were compared with the use of Fisher's exact test. Interaction tests between treatment effect and patient characteristics were done for PFS and OS.</p><p>The FAS was based on all eligible patients, and the safety analysis set was defined as the patients who received the study treatment at least once.

The main reasons for dose reduction of S-1 and treatment interruption were gastrointestinal toxicities in both groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="mdv603_s4"><title>discussion</title><p>The significantly better PFS and DCR in the SL group than in the S-1 group suggest that the antitumor activity of S-1 is enhanced by LV in advanced PC. Several clinical studies have shown that adding LV to S-1 enhances antitumor efficacy [<xref rid="MDV603C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MDV603C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These results together with the present study provide robust evidence for the enhancement of S-1 activity by LV.</p><p>Several regimens of second-line chemotherapy, including OFF and FF plus MM-398, have obtained a median OS of &#x0223c;6 months [<xref rid="MDV603C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="MDV603C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A recent comprehensive analysis of second-line chemotherapy for advanced PC reported that the median OS was 6.0 months in patients who received chemotherapy when compared with only 2.8 months in those who received best supportive care (<italic>P</italic> = 0.013) [<xref rid="MDV603C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the GEST study, more than 70% of the patients in the gemcitabine monotherapy group received S-1 monotherapy or S-1-based regimens as second-line chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDV603C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the median OS after gemcitabine failure was &#x0223c;6.0 months. Development of S-1-based regimens seemed especially attractive in this setting, and we therefore directly estimated the benefits of LV added to S-1 when compared with S-1 monotherapy.</p><p>Because PC is not a chemotherapy-sensitive tumor, especially in patients receiving second-line treatment, disease control is considered clinically relevant at present. The main objective of this randomized phase II trial was to estimate the increment in effectiveness obtained by adding LV to S-1, and thereby facilitate planning of a subsequent phase III trial with the primary end point of OS. We designated PFS as the primary end point of our trial, and OS, RR, and DCR were secondary end points. As expected, PFS and DCR were significantly better in the SL group than in the S-1 group.</p><p>No difference in OS was observed between the two treatment groups, and several reasons may account for this. First, subsequent treatment might have biased the comparison of OS. The regimens used for subsequent treatment differed substantially between the groups, although the proportions of patients who received subsequent chemotherapy were similar. Secondly, there were non-negligible differences in patient backgrounds such as prior pancreatic resection and the serum albumin level between the treatment groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="MDV603TB1">1</xref>) due to small sample size; and there were some interactions between the patients' background characteristics and the response to treatment in terms of both PFS and OS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv603/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S2A and B, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). In particular, both prior pancreatic resection and the serum albumin level were prognostic factors for OS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv603/-/DC1">supplementary Figure S3A and B, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). In fact, multivariate analysis of OS adjusting not only for stratification factors, but also for patient background characteristics resulted in a lower HR (0.71; 95% CI, 0.47&#x02013;1.07; <italic>P</italic> = 0.099) than that of the primary analysis (0.82; 95% CI, 0.54&#x02013;1.22; <italic>P</italic> = 0.463). It is speculated that the efficacy of SL, especially in terms of OS, might be underestimated because of some bias related to background characteristics and subsequent treatment. Pancreatic resection and the albumin level should thus be considered as eligibility criteria, stratification factors, or both in future phase III trials.</p><p>Treatments were well tolerated, and high RDI (&#x0003e;90%) was maintained in both treatment arms. However, gastrointestinal toxicities were slightly more severe in the SL group. PC is generally associated with malnutrition and sometimes cachexia, especially later in the clinical course of the disease. Cachexia induces sarcopenia, which increases adverse effects of chemotherapy [<xref rid="MDV603C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Serum albumin levels have been reported to be an index of sarcopenia [<xref rid="MDV603C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In fact, the incidences of some adverse effects (e.g. anemia, diarrhea, nausea, and malaise) in our study were higher in patients with low albumin levels than in those with normal albumin levels, especially in the SL group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/annonc/mdv603/-/DC1">supplementary Table S3, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online</ext-link>). Patient selection for second-line chemotherapy for advanced PC is considered very important, especially when a toxic regimen is used.</p><p>As for second-line treatment after gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, the use of FOLFIRINOX seems to be limited by its severe toxicity. Regimens with relatively mild chemotherapy and a low risk of severe toxicity (e.g. OFF) are most likely suitable for the second-line chemotherapy of PC. In this respect, SL is considered a promising option for second-line treatment after gemcitabine-based regimens in patients with advanced PC.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. First, since it was not placebo-controlled, a bias in PFS evaluation cannot be ruled out. To minimize this bias, disease progression in the treatment arms was confirmed by an IRC under blinded conditions. Secondly, the sample size was small, as discussed above. Thirdly, the primary end point was not OS but PFS. Initially, PFS was not expected to be largely affected by patient background characteristics, and post-progression survival was likely to be short in this setting. Therefore, we thought that PFS would be more suitable than OS to evaluate the benefit of adding LV. However, imbalances in the patients' backgrounds appeared to affect both PFS and OS. Furthermore, differences in subsequent chemotherapy influenced post-progression survival. Although the discrepancy between PFS and OS makes it rather difficult to interpret our results, multivariate analysis of OS suggests a survival benefit of SL.</p><p>In conclusion, LV was shown to have an additive effect with S-1 on PFS and DCR and was associated with tolerable toxicity as second-line chemotherapy for patients with gemcitabine-refractory advanced PC. A phase III study to evaluate the survival benefits of SL when compared with S-1 is ongoing in Japan and Korea (JapicCTI-132172).</p></sec>
