Although, there are very few high-quality studies demonstrating the efficacy of sodium hyaluronate injection for rotator cuff disease, this study was performed to examine the effect of ultrasound-guided subacromial sodium hyaluronate injection in patients with impingement syndrome without rotator cuff complete tear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial involved 48 patients with subacromial impingement syndrome without a complete tear of rotator cuff. Eight patients were excluded because of protocol violation. The reasons were violation of the selection criteria and refused injection. We included patients between 30 and 80 years old who had shoulder pain, a positive Neer and Hawkins sign, and a positive ultrasonographic diagnosis of rotator cuff pathology without a complete tear, who did not respond to conservative treatments or rehabilitation for at least 6 months and signed the informed consent form. We excluded patients who (1) had any rheumatic disease, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, full-thickness rotator cuff tears, fractures, diabetes mellitus, infections, or tumors, (2) had hypersensitivity to hyaluronate, (3) had participated in any other study within 6 months, (4) had received a subacromial injection within 8 weeks, (5) were pregnant or planned to become pregnant, (6) were at risk of complications of intra-articular injections such as patients who received anti-coagulant drugs. Forty patients randomly allocated in 2 groups: Hyaluronate injection (case group) and normal saline injection (placebo group). According to demographic data gender and age, there were no significant differences between two groups. The test drug was Fermathron&#x02122;, 20 mg/2 ml of sodium hyaluronate. The placebo was 0.9% normal saline solution, at 2 mL/syringe. Both groups received 3 weekly injections in a same protocol.</p><p>All patients screened for complete tear of rotator cuff with ultrasonography and all injections were performed under ultrasonography guidance. Ultrasonography with a high-frequency (7-15 MHz) linear-array probe was performed by one radiologist with a SIEMENS G60 (SIEMENS G 60s, MODEL: 7474922 made in Japan march 2006) device.</p><p>Sonographer stood behind the patient, scanning over its shoulder. The long head of biceps tendon was examined within the intertubercular groove, in both the transverse and longitudinal planes, with the patient's arm in a neutral position and the elbow flexed to 90&#x000b0;. The presence of fluid around the tendon was noted, and a search for fluid in the subdeltoid bursa was made. With the shoulder externally rotated, the subscapularis tendon was brought into view and examined in both planes. Then, the patient was asked to rotate the shoulder internally. This movement was achieved either by placing the forearm behind the back with the palm facing posteriorly or by placing the palm on the upper buttock. The supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendons were evaluated in this position in both the transverse and longitudinal planes.</p><p>The examination was completed by requesting the patient to place a hand on the contralateral shoulder. This position allowed further assessment of the infraspinatus tendon if required. With ultrasound, the normal tendon was an echoic structure, whereas the cartilage and fluids were hypoechoic. Tendinitis was diagnosed when the tendon lost its echogenicity and became diffusely hypoechoic.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Dynamic evaluation of abduction was performed by observing the supraspinatus tendon and bursa longitudinally as they retract deep to the coracoacromial ligament. Bunching of tissue or buckling of the ligament correlated with impingement.</p><p>If ultrasonographic evidence of full-thickness supraspinatus tendon tear was seen, patient excluded from our study. These features included non-visualization of the distal supraspinatus tendon and dipping of the deltoid muscle or abnormal anechoic disruption of the supraspinatus tendon, which extended from the articular to the bursa surface. The diagnosis of a partial rotator cuff tear was made when the hypoechoic or bursal herniation did not cross the full width of the tendon.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Ultrasound guided injection was done from a lateral approach. We used 21 gage needle for injection of 2cc Fermathron&#x02122;. As long as the needle was kept in the same axial plane as the probe, it followed accurately until reached the superficial surface of the supraspinatus tendon. A preliminary injection in this location confirmed the correct positioning in the bursa as evident by rapid flow of injected material away from the needle tip. After insurance firm placement within the bursa, injection was completed.</p><p>The pain score (100 mm visual analog score [VAS]) was evaluated blindly by the different physiatrists before the first injection and 1 week after each injection. The constant score[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] of shoulder also was evaluated blindly before the first injection and 12 week after last injection. A constant score of 80 points or more or an improvement in the constant score by 10 points or more was considered satisfactory.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical package version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test or Repeated Measure ANOVA test, and Chi-square test were used to assess the differences between stages, as appropriate.

Although, the literature covering visco supplementation for knee osteoarthritis has been conflicting and has a known publication bias,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] meta-analyses suggest an improvement in pain compared with placebo.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In patients who have failed conservative treatment, there is evidence that visco supplementation is beneficial for the treatment of knee pain caused by osteoarthritis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The clinical effects of sodium hyaluronate on pain associated with osteoarthritis of the knee are probably mediated by several factors. <italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies indicate that sodium hyaluronate can enhance prostaglandin synthesis and prevent its release from the cell matrix. Regarding inflammation, sodium hyaluronate suppresses the production and activity of pro-inflammatory mediators and proteases as well as altering the function of certain immune cells. Histological evidence shows that sodium hyaluronate prevents the degradation of cartilage and may promote its regeneration.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Chou <italic>et al</italic>. performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of sodium hyaluronate (ARTZ Dispo) treatment in 51 patients with rotator cuff lesions without complete tears. They had injections of 25 mg/wk. of sodium hyaluronate into the subacromial bursa for 5 consecutive weeks in case group and 2.5 ml of normal saline with the same injection protocol for control group.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] We performed the study with patients and all the injections were performed ultrasound guided. Additionally, instead of 5 injections, we treated our patients with 3 injections of sodium hyaluronate. The results were the same.</p><p>A recent study assessed the hypothesis that injection of high-molecular weight hyaluronate in the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome is effective and sodium hyaluronate, compared with corticosteroid injection in the shoulder joint. They found that subacromial hyaluronate injection to treat impingement syndrome produces similar pain and functional improvement to corticosteroid at a short-term follow-up.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The probable mechanism of action of sodium hyaluronate is an autocrine stimulation of its own synthesis in a positive feedback manner in synoviocytes that has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the case group had significantly better constant scores than the placebo group at the 12<sup>th</sup> week after the last injection and improvement of VAS scores each week after the injections. It shows that although the injection of normal saline solution into the subacromial bursa may relieve the symptoms of impingement syndrome but the results are not constant. Furthermore, we know that signs and symptoms of rotator cuff disease may relieve gradually if extrinsic and intrinsic factors are stabilized by resting or modification of activity.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] It may be the cause of some degree of improvement after placebo injection. Another theory is removing inflammatory mediators by normal saline. Sodium hyaluronate may have inhibitory effect on the function of inflammatory cells and it may account for the deactivation of pain receptors.</p><p>In summary, Sodium hyaluronate may contribute to healing and pain reduction in rotator cuff disease. Further studies are required to find the exact mechanisms of action of this drug.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>It has been registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.
