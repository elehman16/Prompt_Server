We compared combined MVA and adjuvanted gp140 to sequential MVA/gp140 after DNA priming. We expected Env-specific CD4+ T-cells after DNA and MVA priming, and Env-binding antibodies in 100% individuals after boosting with gp140 and that combined vaccines would not compromise safety and might augment immunogenicity. Forty volunteers were primed three times with DNA plasmids encoding (CN54) env and (ZM96) gag-pol-nef at 0, 4 and 8&#x02009;weeks then boosted with MVA-C (CN54 env and gag-pol-nef) and glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant&#x02014;aqueous formulation (GLA-AF) adjuvanted CN54gp140. They were randomised to receive them in combination at the same visit at 16 and 20&#x02009;weeks (accelerated) or sequentially with MVA-C at 16, 20, and GLA-AF/gp140 at 24 and 28&#x02009;weeks (standard). All vaccinations were intramuscular. Primary outcomes included &#x02265;grade 3 safety events and the titer of CN54gp140-specific binding IgG. Other outcomes included neutralization, binding antibody specificity and T-cell responses. Two participants experienced asymptomatic &#x02265;grade 3 transaminitis leading to discontinuation of vaccinations, and three had grade 3 solicited local or systemic reactions. A total of 100% made anti-CN54gp140 IgG and combining vaccines did not significantly alter the response; geometric mean titer 6424 (accelerated) and 6578 (standard); neutralization of MW965.2 Tier 1 pseudovirus was superior in the standard group (82 versus 45% responders, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). T-cell ELISpot responses were CD4+ and Env-dominant; 85 and 82% responding in the accelerated and standard groups, respectively. Vaccine-induced IgG responses targeted multiple regions within gp120 with the V3 region most immunodominant and no differences between groups detected. Combining MVA and gp140 vaccines did not result in increased adverse events and did not significantly impact upon the titer of Env-specific binding antibodies, which were seen in 100% individuals. The approach did however affect other immune responses; neutralizing antibody responses, seen only to Tier 1 pseudoviruses, were poorer when the vaccines were combined and while T-cell responses were seen in &#x0003e;80% individuals in both groups and similarly CD4 and Env dominant, their breadth/polyfunctionality tended to be lower when the vaccines were combined, suggesting attenuation of immunogenicity and cautioning against this accelerated regimen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV vaccine</kwd><kwd>phase I trial</kwd><kwd>DNA</kwd><kwd>MVA</kwd><kwd>envelope protein</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">Medical Research Council<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100000265</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">98242</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Wellcome Trust<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100004440</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn03">National Institutes of Health<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000002</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn03">HHSN27201100016C</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="10466"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In an era of antiretroviral medication for the treatment and prevention of HIV, concerns around access, toxicity, and escalating cost suggest that a vaccine for HIV is still likely to be the most effective and sustainable way of reducing new infections (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Of the five HIV efficacy vaccine trials to date, there has only been only one to demonstrate significant, if modest efficacy; the RV144 &#x0201c;Thai&#x0201d; trial (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This study with 16,402 subjects randomized to four immunizations with ALVAC given twice and then twice more with AIDSVAX B/E adjuvanted with ALUM, reported 31.2% protection (95% CI 1&#x02013;51) against acquisition, without impacting HIV viral load or CD4+ T cell count (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Subsequent immunological analyzes reported an inverse correlation between the levels of circulating polyclonal non-neutralizing antibodies and risk of infection, which has been associated with Fc receptor-mediated antibody effector functions (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The results stimulated interest in prime-boost pox and protein combination vaccine approaches and the role of non-neutralizing antibodies.</p><p>Heterologous prime boost regimens employing DNA, viral vectors, and/or recombinant proteins have generated robust cellular and humoral responses maximizing breadth and potency while limiting the attenuating effects of vector specific immunity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). DNA vaccines have been shown to prime cellular and humoral immune responses, upon boosting with recombinant vectors (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The EuroVacc trials demonstrated that DNA prime, NYVAC boost increased the frequency, magnitude, and breadth of HIV-specific T-cell ELISpot responses (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and that three DNA priming immunizations were more immunogenic than two (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). A recent clinical trial comparing different prime boost regimens showed no benefit of DNA priming for Env-specific antibody responses but evidence of an improvement in T-cell responses, although overall immunogenicity was lower than seen previously in response to the same DNA and MVA vaccines (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>In this study, the UK HIV Vaccine Consortium built upon these prior data showing enhanced immunogenicity of DNA prime, pox vector boost, and the protection seen in RV144 by protein boosting, to produce homologous DNA, MVA, and gp140 immunogens. We have made DNA plasmids and an MVA expressing matched HIV-1 subtype C (CN54)-derived inserts, and adjuvanted trimeric glycoprotein with a view for use in Sub-Saharan Africa. We believe this strategy is ideally suited to inducing Env-dominant CD4+ T-cell responses, favoring the development of high titer Env-specific antibody responses. The same trimeric recombinant CN54gp140 protein has already been administered to 469 individuals in a variety of trial settings (with and without DNA priming, or adjuvant and via different routes), showing excellent safety and induction of vaccine specific antibodies (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). When given systemically with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant&#x02014;aqueous formulation (GLA-AF) after priming with heterologous DNA and MVA, high titer systemic binding antibodies were seen to the protein (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Prompted by the results of the RV144 trial, but with long-term feasibility in mind, we have explicitly assessed the impact of combining pox (MVA-C) and GLA-AF adjuvanted CN54gp140 protein after priming with DNA. We compared the safety and immunogenicity of two regimens using identical vaccines; given sequentially in one regimen (standard) and with the pox and protein combined in the other (accelerated). We shortened the regimens relative to our previous studies and RV144 by reducing the intervals between vaccinations, with 4&#x02009;weeks between each of three DNA immunizations, 8&#x02009;weeks between prime and first boost, and 4&#x02009;weeks between subsequent boosts. We administered vaccinations intramuscularly (IM) for logistical ease and with a view to eventual roll out in resource limited settings.</p><p>The DNA and MVA-C were produced by UK HVC and based closely on those used previously (EV02 Eudract 2004-001802-28 and EV03 Eudract 2006-006141-13), with matched CN54/ZM96 subtype C-derived <italic>gag pol nef</italic> and <italic>env</italic> inserts. We anticipated Env-dominated CD4+ T-cell responses and modest Env-specific antibody responses after DNA and MVA, with the development of high titer binding and neutralizing antibody responses after boosting with adjuvanted CN54gp140 protein (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Based on our previous studies, we expected that the immunogens would prove more potent B-cell immunogens than the ALVAC/AIDSVAX/ALUM used in RV144 and that the combined MVA/CN54p140/GLA might augment immunogenicity, offering the potential for a short regimen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design and Conduct</title><p>This was a Phase I randomized open-label trial conducted at two UK centers: Imperial College London and Surrey Clinical Research Centre.

Briefly, the slides were pre-incubated with T20 blocking buffer (Thermo Fisher) for 10&#x02009;min. Plasma samples were then added at a dilution of 1:100 in T20 blocking buffer and incubated for 2&#x02009;h at room temperature with gentle shaking before washing five times with 2.5&#x02009;ml TBS-Tween (0.5% Tween). The secondary mouse anti-human-IgG Dylight649 (JPT) was then incubated at room temperature for 1&#x02009;h at a dilution of 1:5,000 in T20 blocking buffer. After five washings with 2.5&#x02009;ml TBS-Tween, and five washes with double distilled de-ionized water, the slides were left to dry under a laminar flow hood. Samples from all timepoints from one individual were processed simultaneously. Slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000A scanner and processed using GenepixPro 6.0 software at 650 and 532&#x02009;nm to generate a Tiff image file. The array lay out was then added using the .gal file JPT_2758_V04.gal provided by JPT. Accuracy of the array alignment was controlled and individual features were adjusted or excluded manually when needed. After this QA/QC step, .gpr files were generated and processed further into .dat files using R-program and the R-script &#x0201c;MakeDat_V05r_stat.R&#x0201d; to generate one fluorescent intensity (FI) value for the peptide-specific IgG response from the triplicates. Individual IgG responses were mapped using the R-script &#x0201c;MapAlign_BG_V11.R&#x0201d; after subtraction of FI values from baseline plasma. The array included the immunogen sequence CN54gp140 and nine other sequences from acute phase primary HIV isolates of subtypes A, C, B, CRF01_AE, and CRF02_AG to maximize coverage of global HIV diversity (Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>., in preparation).</p></sec><sec id="S2-9"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>All clinical and routine laboratory data were included in the safety analyses. Data sets included (i) modified intention to treat; all participants who were randomized and received at least one vaccination and (ii) per protocol (PP), all participants who completed vaccinations with no major protocol deviations. The primary safety outcome was expressed as a proportion of participants with 95% confidence interval, and groups were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. The primary immunological outcome was the magnitude of serum CN54gp140-specific IgG 4&#x02009;weeks after the final vaccination and we assumed a 100% response rate in the standard (reference) arm. The sample size was calculated on the basis of the binding antibody responses distributions described in the RV144 trial. In this trial, the reciprocal GMT of binding antibodies to subtype E gp120 was ~1:15,000 (log10: 4.18) and for subtype B gp120 was ~1:30,000 (log10:4.5). On the basis of previous trials, we assumed that everyone would respond to the CN54gp140 and that the titer of subtype C-specific binding antibody responses would be in the same range and at least 1:15,000 in the standard group and that a four-fold increase in the magnitude of would be immunologically relevant. This translates to an absolute difference of 0.6 on the log10 scale. In the absence of raw data from the Rv144 trial, we have assumed a standard deviation of 0.58 on the log 10 scale in the distribution of the antibody responses (corresponding to a SD of ~33,400 in titer). Assuming this variation, 20 participants per group allowed for the detection of an absolute increase in titer of 0.60 with 90% power and 5% alpha. Comparison of the groups was made using the geometric mean (GM) ratios of the titer with their 95% CI and equality was assumed if these ratios included 1. Skewed data was log transformed for normality and then comparisons made using parametric tests. Secondary outcomes were compared by the response frequency per group, using chi-square tests if frequencies were adequate or the Fisher&#x02019;s exact 2-tailed test for small numbers. Comparison of the magnitude of T-cell ELISpot responses was made using the non-parametric Wilcoxon two-sample test. No corrections were made for multiple testing. For the flow cytometric analysis, responses are described relative to each mock-stimulated control. Two-by-two contingency tables were generated to compare the peptide stimulated versus the mock control for each cytokine and T-cell subset. One-sided Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were then applied to each table to resolve whether the percentage of cytokines generated following peptide stimulation was greater than that compared following stimulation with mock antigen. Bonferroni corrections were applied to account for multiple testing.

Two of these were &#x02265;grade 3 laboratory adverse events that resulted in discontinuation of vaccinations. Both occurred in males aged 20&#x02009;years in the standard group. The first occurred after the first DNA; the 7-day blood test revealed asymptomatic transaminitis (AST 375: Grade 3, ALT 109: Grade 2), which was confirmed 6&#x02009;days later. Other blood tests, a viral screen, and ultrasound scan were normal. Apart from an episode of tonsillitis between screening and enrollment, treated with penicillin V, there were no other risk factors. The levels spontaneously returned to normal during the following week, but due to the temporal nature, a relationship could not be excluded and so vaccinations were discontinued. The second case occurred after administration of the second MVA-C. In between the immunization visit and the safety review, the participant reported an episode of vomiting after drinking around 12&#x02013;14 units of alcohol, and strenuous exercise. The 7-day blood test revealed a transaminitis (AST 530: Grade 4, ALT 184: Grade 2). He was not able to return for 28&#x02009;days at which time both were within the normal range. investigations including an ultrasound scan and blood tests for causes of viral and non-viral hepatitides were normal. Although it was felt that the more likely cause of the transaminitis was a combination of unusually high alcohol intake and strenuous exercise, there was a temporal relationship with vaccination and so vaccinations were discontinued. There were five others &#x02265;grade 3 adverse events reported by three participants on diary cards during the 7&#x02009;days after vaccination: severe malaise in a female accompanied by a headache 2&#x02009;days after the first MVA-C/CN54gp140 GLA-AF, severe malaise in a male 5&#x02009;days after the first CN54gp140 GLA-AF, and a severe/extreme lumpy swelling in a female 6&#x02009;days after receipt of the first MVA-C and then again 3 and 6&#x02009;days after the second MVA-C reported by the same participant.</p><p>There was one serious adverse event during the study; a female randomized to the accelerated group was referred to hospital by her GP with pain and suspected appendicitis 2&#x02009;days after receiving her first combined MVA-C and CN54gp140 vaccination.

We expected strong Env-specific CD4+ T-cells after DNA and MVA and Env-specific binding antibodies in everyone after adjuvanted gp140 and the study was powered to detect a four-fold difference in the magnitude of this response between groups. As expected, 100% individuals made strong CN54gp140-specific antibody irrespective of regimen, but combining the vaccines had no detectable impact on the magnitude or specificity of the antibody response as assessed by the recognition of linear peptides. This pattern was characterized by strong recognition of V3 with notably little recognition within gp41&#x02014;in spite of its presence in the DNA and gp140 vaccines. The immunogens also induced recognition of linear epitopes within C2 and C4, but their significance, if any, is unknown. Despite these binding antibody responses, neutralizing antibody responses were disappointing and only seen to Tier 1A pseudoviruses, similar to our previous experiences using this adjuvanted protein (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Interestingly, however, the frequency and titer of the responses was inferior when vaccines were combined to two Tier 1A pseudoviruses. There was no difference in the overall frequency or specificity of T-cell ELISpot responses which were seen in &#x0003e;80% individuals irrespective of group and tended to be CD4+ and specific for Env peptide pools. While the great majority of IFN&#x003b3; ELISpot responses were seen to Env peptide pools in both groups, recognition of Gag, Nef and Pol peptides was less frequent in the accelerated group suggesting that combining the vaccines might have led to further polarization of immune responses. Cytokine responses were relatively modest, but also less frequent or less polyfunctional in both CD4+ and CD8+ compartments when the MVA and CN54gp140 were combined. There was no significant impact of combining the vaccines upon tolerability. Although two participants experienced events that resulted in discontinuation of immunizations, these followed different immunogens (DNA-C, MVA-C) and there were alternative explanations for the asymptomatic elevation in transaminases in each case. The great majority of adverse events were mild in line with our previous experience using the same adjuvanted protein in different settings (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p>Even though we controlled for variables such as site and gender, the study has limitations; overall statistical power was compromised by the fact that we did not have 40 in the final analyses as planned. Nevertheless, there was clear evidence that combining MVA and gp140 led to attenuation of certain T-cell and B-cell immune responses. Both regimens were shorter overall than used in previous studies using similar homologous (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) or heterologous DNA and MVA (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and it remains possible that the time between DNA prime and MVA boost (8&#x02009;weeks) might have been too short to allow for the optimal maturation of immune responses. The use of a common and semi-quantitative assay for the measurement of CN54gp140-specific IgG antibody allows for direct comparison across our different trials. The median CN54gp140- specific binding antibody response seen here (12.8&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) exceeds that seen in the Mucovac 2 trial (UK HVC_001) after three doses of CN54gp140/GLA-AF IM in the absence of DNA priming (4.2&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), but is lower than seen in the TaMoVac 01 trial (UK HVC_00 2) after boosting twice with GLA-AF adjuvanted CN54gp140 30&#x02013;71&#x02009;weeks after priming with DNA and MVA (17.8&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/ml) (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). This supports the value of DNA/MVA priming and suggests that the long gap between prime and boost could be important. Sallusto and colleagues propose a minimum gap of 12&#x02009;weeks and note that if boosting is too frequent, responding cells might be preferentially driven to terminal differentiation resulting in attenuation of immunity (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>Our decision to use immunogens expressing matched subtype C inserts was driven by our commitment to a vaccine for use in Sub-Saharan Africa as well a belief that this approach would ellicit high titer binding antibodies and so favor functional/neutralizing antibodies. In addition to the logistical advantages offered by fewer vaccinations, we were interested in combining the pox and protein in light of the results of the RV144 trial which included combined canarypox and alum adjuvanted gp120 and was the first ever trial of an HIV vaccine to show (modest) efficacy. In UK HVC_003 overall, immunogenicity was somewhat disappointing and it remains possible that the combined MVA and adjuvanted gp140 protein may have overwhelmed the pool of antigen-specific/innate immune cells, as offered as one explanation of the attenuation in responses sometimes seen when certain pediatric vaccines are combined (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and which might be particularly associated with MVA at it has been shown to be highly immunogenic and to preferentially deplete antigen presenting cells (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Immunogenicity may have been further compromised in the accelerated group as a result antigenic competition (even though the vaccines were administered into opposite arms) as has been suggested to occur in response to response to certain combinations of conjugated vaccines (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and observed more recently in an HIV vaccine trial in South Africa (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The choice of adjuvant was partly practical as we had access to GLA-AF through the UK HVC and had already used it with the same gp140 protein (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In our hands, the GLA-AF (MPLA) adjuvant has previously been shown to be potent for antibodies at equivalent (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;&#x000b5;g) and lower (3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g) doses (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) (in the absence of DNA/MVA), and we had every reason to suspect that priming would further enhance these responses. We expected the immunogens to be at least as immunogenic as those used in RV144 in both groups and, based on our previous experiences with DNA and MVA, predicted that they would be more potent for T-cells.</p><p>In light of these findings, we remain cautious about the accelerated regimen, and feel that the combined MVA-C and adjuvanted GLA-AF warrants further evaluation in a regimen with a longer gap between priming and boost. We believe this trial provides further support for exploring the clinical efficacy of a priming regimen including DNA, with at gap of least 12&#x02009;weeks prior to boosting. The precise contribution of adjuvanted protein (if any) is yet to be defined. While Churchyard and colleagues reported no clear benefit of DNA priming on Env-specific antibody responses, T-cell responses appeared augmented by the priming although overall immunogenicity in the trial was lower than seen previously using the same vaccines in a different population (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In light of our previous experience with a variety of immunogens, we remain committed to the inclusion of DNA as we believe balanced immune responses highly desirable. We await data from a direct comparison of the specificity of antibody responses from trials using different heterologous prime boost regimens (including RV144 and Tamovac 01) with this one to inform our selection of immunogens to take forward. Non-neutralizing IgG antibody responses targeting V2 have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of HIV using a variety of different approaches, although we did not see much response to linear peptides within this region (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>) suggesting perhaps that they are associated with the subtype E gp120 protein. We did however see strong recognition of the V3 loop in both groups and this has been described as characteristic of the responses seen during natural infection (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and also in other vaccine trials including RV144-when the response correlated with reduced risk of HIV acquisition in a subset of individuals (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). In conclusion, the vaccines were potent irrespective of regimen, but immunogenicity was lower than anticipated, and we cannot exclude the possibility that this was due to the relatively short regimens. Our data suggest that combining MVA and CN54gp140/GLA-AF in this relatively short regimen had no significant impact on safety and also no impact on the magnitude of CN54gp140-specific systemic antibody responses and the strategy may have attenuated immunogenicity as reported previously (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SM, JW, RS, SJ, JG, DL, RW, and ME oversaw and/or designed the study/immunogens.
