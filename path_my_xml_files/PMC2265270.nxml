The Hall Technique is a simplified method of managing carious primary molars using preformed metal crowns (PMCs) cemented with no local anaesthesia, caries removal or tooth preparation. This study compared the acceptability of the Hall Technique for children, their carers, and dentists, and clinical outcomes for the technique, with conventional restorations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>General dental practice based, split mouth, randomized controlled trial (132 children, aged 3&#x02013;10). General dental practitioners (GDPs, n = 17) in Tayside, Scotland (dmft 2.7) placed conventional (Control) restorations in carious primary molars, and Hall Technique PMCs on the contralateral molar (matched clinically and radiographically). Dentists ranked the degree of discomfort they felt the child experienced for each procedure; then children, their carers and dentists stated which technique they preferred. The teeth were followed up clinically and radiographically.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>128 conventional restorations were placed on 132 control teeth, and 128 PMCs on 132 intervention teeth. Using a 5 point scale, 118 Hall PMCs (89%) were rated as no apparent discomfort up to mild, not significant; for Control restorations the figure was 103 (78%). Significant, unacceptable discomfort was recorded for two Hall PMCs (1.5%) and six Control restorations (4.5%). 77% of children, 83% of carers and 81% of dentists who expressed a preference, preferred the Hall technique, and this was significant (Chi square, p &#x0003c; 0.0001). There were 124 children (94% of the initial sample) with a minimum follow-up of 23 months. The Hall PMCs outperformed the Control restorations:</p><p>a) 'Major' failures (signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpal disease): 19 Control restorations (15%); three Hall PMCs (2%) (P &#x0003c; 0.000);</p><p>b) 'Minor' failures (loss of restoration, caries progression): 57 Control restorations (46%); six Hall PMCs (5%) (P &#x0003c; 0.000)</p><p>c) Pain: 13 Control restorations (11%); two Hall PMCs (2%) (P = 0.003).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Hall Technique was preferred to conventional restorations by the majority of children, carers and GDPs. After two years, Hall PMCs showed more favourable outcomes for pulpal health and restoration longevity than conventional restorations. The Hall Technique appears to offer an effective treatment option for carious primary molar teeth.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN47267892 &#x02013; A randomized controlled trial in primary care of a novel method of using preformed metal crowns to manage decay in primary molar teeth: the Hall technique.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The high level of dental caries in the Scottish child population, with 55% of 5 year old children having visible decay into dentine and 16% having experienced dental extractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], imposes a considerable burden on children, their carers, and the dental team looking after them. Many children have to accept toothache as a part of normal daily life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Current guidelines recommend combined preventive and restorative management of carious primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], yet in Scotland in 1989 only 18% of cavities in 5 year olds had been restored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and in 2003 this had fallen to 9% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Alongside the extensive untreated caries, there has been intense debate in the UK on whether restorative care provided in general dental practice is an effective way of managing children with dental caries in primary teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. There is evidence that restorations for primary teeth can be effective in terms of longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], but very little of this evidence is derived from the Primary Care setting, where the vast majority of child dental care in the UK takes place. In addition, there is no clear evidence that restorative management of dental caries is associated with a reduction in pain and sepsis experienced by children, although there is a suggestion this may be so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. There is also no evidence from the Primary Care setting in the UK supporting one particular restorative technique for primary teeth over another.</p><p>Despite preformed metal crowns (PMCs) being recommended as the optimum restoration for managing primary molar teeth where caries involves two or more surfaces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and evidence for their effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], they are not widely used in Scotland, making up only 0.4% of all restorations provided for children in 2001/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Investigations into the views of Primary Care dentists in the UK have shown that although there is an apparent appreciation of the research and recommendations supporting their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], PMCs are not viewed as a realistic treatment option for carious primary molars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. One study of 93 general dental practitioners (GDPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] found that only 3% used PMCs routinely and 82% never used them. Amongst the barriers to their use reported by dentists, are perceived difficulties with children's ability to accept invasive treatment. There is some evidence supporting this view, with comparisons of children's perception of cavity preparation using rotary instruments against hand instruments showing less discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and lower physiological and behavioural indicators of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] when rotary instruments were not used. In addition, a randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], found that hand excavation without local anaesthesia (LA) gave the least discomfort, and conventional cavity preparation with LA, the most. Furthermore, children requiring additional treatment found the experience of LA even less acceptable at subsequent appointments.</p><p>It is against this background of low levels of restorative treatment provision in Primary Care, and uncertainty as to the effectiveness of that treatment even if it is provided, that a novel, simplified method of using PMCs, the Hall Technique, has been investigated. This method uses PMCs, which are filled with glass-ionomer cement, and simply pushed onto the tooth with no caries removal, local anaesthesia or tooth preparation (shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Recently published audit data from Dr Hall's practice records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] has indicated that the technique (from now on referred to as the Hall Technique) might have similar survival rates to other, more conventional, restorative options currently being used in Primary Care. In addition, avoiding the use of LA and rotary instruments for tooth preparation and caries removal might mean that the technique is less demanding of both children and their dental team, and a pilot trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] indicated that it was a technique which children and dentists found acceptable.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical photographs of a Hall PMC being fitted: a) carious primary molar tooth 74 (LLD) to be fitted with a Hall PMC; b) PMC being tried over occlusal surface of tooth to guage size (guaze providing airway protection).

In order to increase the generalisability of the results, and following the recommendations of the Mant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and Clarke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] reports, the clinical trial was run entirely in general dental practice, as this is where the vast majority of child dental care in the UK is provided.</p><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The study had two main aims:</p><p>1. to compare the clinical effectiveness of the Hall Technique with conventional methods of managing carious primary molars; and</p><p>2. to compare the acceptability of the Hall Technique to children, their carers, and dentists with conventional restorative methods for carious primary molars.</p><p>The null hypotheses tested in this paper are that after two years, for restorations placed by GDPs when managing caries in primary molars in this increased caries risk population:</p><p>&#x02022; there is no difference in the incidence of signs and symptoms of pulpal disease between teeth restored with Control restorations and those with PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique;</p><p>&#x02022; there is no difference in longevity of restorations between Control restorations and PMCs fitted using the Hall Technique; and</p><p>&#x02022; children, their carers and GDPs have no preference between the Hall Technique and the conventional restorative care provided by their GDPs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and ethical approval</title><p>The study was a randomized controlled clinical trial, with a split mouth design set in general dental practice in Tayside, Scotland (2000 regional dmft 2.47, d<sub>3 </sub>1.71, mt 0.54, ft 0.22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]). Approval from the Tayside Committee on Medical Research Ethics (Ref 108/00) was obtained. Written and verbal consent from parents and, where appropriate, the children, was obtained, following a minimum 24 hours "cooling off" period between their being given information, and consent being obtained.</p><p>The GDPs recruited children who had caries affecting pairs of primary molar teeth, which were matched for tooth type, arch and extent of caries. Computer generated randomisation for sequence and side were held centrally, and accessed by telephone to a distant co-ordinator prior to treatment. The tooth on one side was restored using the Hall Technique and the contralateral tooth with the restorative technique the GDP would normally use. Data relating to the two treatments were recorded at the treatment appointment and follow up data at yearly intervals.</p></sec><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>A systematic review of 10 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], comparing the performance of PMCs with amalgam restorations gave a mean failure ratio of 0.32 in favour of the PMCs. Using this data, a two tailed test (&#x003b1; = 0.05), and a power of 80%, it was calculated that a clinical trial would require 58 participants to demonstrate a clinically significant difference in treatment outcomes of 50%. Allowing for loss of participants over a two year period, the target sample size was 120, with a maximum of 200 patients. Sequential analysis was to be undertaken when 90 patients had returned for one year follow-up. If this indicated a significantly increased failure rate for the intervention, recruitment would cease before the maximum of 200 patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Dentists</title><p>All 143 GDPs in Tayside, Scotland were invited by letter to participate in the study. From the 41 replies expressing an interest (29% positive response rate), 17 GDPs were selected to obtain a spread of dental practices throughout the region. The GDPs attended a training session at Dundee Dental Hospital, with discussion on the study protocol, training in standardised bitewing radiography techniques using size 0 (22 &#x000d7; 35 mm) films (ULTRASPEED films, Eastman, Kodak, Hertfordshire, UK), Rinn holders (Dentsply, XCP film holding system; Rinn Corp, Elgin, Illinois, USA), and instruction in the Hall Technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Each dentist was asked to recruit 10 patients to the study who had caries affecting pairs of primary molar teeth, which were matched for tooth type, dental arch and extent of caries. Inclusion criteria required children to be 4&#x02013;9 years of age, with no significant health problem, and presenting for routine dental care to their GDP. Patients had bitewing radiographs taken before entry to the study and then at annual recall visits.

The protocol for the provision of the control restoration (Control restoration) followed currently accepted practice, requiring complete removal of caries from the periphery of the cavity, and as far as possible from the base of the cavity without causing pulpal exposure. Local anaesthesia was to be administered if the GDP would usually use it in that clinical situation, and the cavity restored with the material the GDP would normally choose.</p><p>The protocol for provision of the Hall Technique PMC (Hall PMC) was as follows:</p><p>&#x02022; obvious food or debris were removed from the cavity but no caries removed;</p><p>&#x02022; the child was positioned upright in the dental chair to reduce the chance of accidental swallowing or aspiration of a loose PMC. Additional airway protection could be gained by use of a gauze swab behind the tooth or by securing the PMC with a strip of elastoplast;</p><p>&#x02022; the correct size of PMC for the tooth was selected i.e. covering all cusps and giving the feeling of "spring-back" when placed up to, but not through, the contact points. If the contacts were very tight, orthodontic separator elastics could be used and the Hall PMC fitted at a subsequent appointment;</p><p>&#x02022; the tooth was rinsed and dried, and the PMC dried;</p><p>&#x02022; the PMC was filled with glass ionomer luting cement. If the cavity was large, some glass ionomer could be placed in the base of the cavity before cementing the crown;</p><p>&#x02022; the PMC was placed evenly over the tooth and the child instructed to bite down firmly until the crown was pushed down over the tooth;</p><p>&#x02022; if the child was unable or unwilling to bite down on the PMC, finger pressure was used to seat the crown;</p><p>&#x02022; extruded cement was removed, and the child asked to keep biting on the Hall PMC until the cement has set; and</p><p>&#x02022; once cement had set, excess cement is removed, floss was used to clear the aproximal contacts, and post-fitting instructions were given.</p><p>Immediately following each treatment, the GDPs were asked to record the following information on a form:</p><p>- any difficulties encountered with either treatment;</p><p>- whether caries removal for the control tooth was complete or incomplete (and if incomplete, why);</p><p>- the material used for cavity restoration in the control tooth;</p><p>- the GDPs subjective assessment of the discomfort level experienced by the child during each procedure, using a five point scale (descriptors listed in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>);</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Dentists' estimation of discomfort experienced by child (n = 132 children).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1472-6831-7-18-4"/></fig><p>- the distance, measured in millimetres at the incisors, that the Hall crown caused the occlusal vertical dimension (OVD) to be increased by;</p><p>- whether the restorations were carried out at the same or separate treatment appointments; and</p><p>- the time taken for explanation, and the duration of each treatment.</p><p>Following recruitment and consent, if either restoration could not be placed, then the patient continued to be included in the trial and monitored as per protocol (following the principle of "intention-to-treat"). On completion of both treatments (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), the GDP asked and recorded which treatment option the child, their parent/carer (if present), and they had preferred.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Lower arch with Hall PMC on tooth 85 (LRE) and Control restoration (mesio-occlusal composite) in tooth 75 (LLE).

The evidence that restorative care of primary teeth can be effective has, in many cases, been obtained from clinical trials run in Secondary Care or specialist practice settings, and it may be unrealistic to expect these findings to be generalisable to the general dental practice setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To support the generalisability of the outcomes from this clinical trial, the setting was general dental practice, where the vast majority of children's dentistry in the UK is carried out. Clinical trials can be run successfully in Primary Care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], although the difficulties of doing so are widely acknowledged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, the very high two year patient follow-up of 94% and the commitment in data gathering shown by the GDPs involved in this study are evidence of the possibilities of Primary Care based research.</p><p>In this trial, the study co-ordinator (NI) was also a GDP at the time of patient recruitment, and this seemed to aid recruitment through motivation of other GDPs in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The wide variation in patient recruitment by individual GDPs, with only four of the 18 GDPs meeting or exceeding their recruitment targets, mirrors the finding of the pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Whether this was because, as is often the case with a new technique, it suited some GDPs clinical practice more than others, or whether this was related to barriers in the general practice environment to participating in research, is uncertain.</p></sec><sec><title>Preference for the restorative techniques</title><p>Children can find restorative care of carious primary molars difficult to accept. It is encouraging, therefore, that in 128 cases (97%) it was possible to fit a PMC using the Hall Technique, although in 15% of cases the Hall PMC was judged not to be fully seated. There was only one patient where it was not possible to fit a Hall PMC because of the child's inability to accept treatment, and this child also declined the Control restoration. All four teeth where no Hall PMC could be fitted were maxillary first primary molars, and 17 of the 18 cases where the PMC fit was judged radiographically as unsatisfactory were also first primary molars. Dentists using the technique report that mesial migration of second primary molars following loss of the distal marginal ridge of first primary molars can make seating a Hall PMC on these teeth problematic. Orthodontic separators can ease the fitting of a Hall PMC in such situations, although their use requires a second appointment several days later to remove the separator before fitting the Hall PMC. However, separators were only used by a minority of dentists in the study (seven out of 18 GDPs) and in only 17 (13%) of cases. The use of separators was independent of any expressed preference for either restorative technique by child or GDP, and was spread through all tooth types and both arches. Only one GDP used separators routinely (six out of seven enrolled cases). Of the other six GDPs who placed separators, five used them in a minority of the cases where they fitted Hall PMCs. This would suggest that most GDPs chose separators only when they anticipated difficulty in fitting the Hall PMC. It is of interest that in the audit of 978 Hall PMCs fitted by Dr Hall over a 10 year period, orthodontic separators were never used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Most children (98%) were also able to accept Control restorations (although for one of these children, no restoration was placed as the dentist decided to simply observe the carious lesion). No Control restoration was provided for an additional three children as they were unable to accept conventional dental treatment, although two of these did accept a Hall PMC. In 29 cases (22%), caries removal was only partial before placement of the restoration. Where a reason was given for not completely removing caries, in the majority of cases (17 out of 29) this was related to a lack of patient cooperation or the child becoming distressed. In only three out of 29 cases was caries left behind to avoid a pulpal exposure. This suggests that for conventional restorative treatment, the child's ability to cope with the procedure may be the most significant factor affecting the dentists' clinical judgement as whether to remove or leave caries before restoring the tooth.</p><p>The time taken for each restoration to be placed was also similar, at around 12 minutes, with the longer explanation time for the Hall PMC offsetting the shorter treatment time when compared with Control restorations. It should be noted, though, that for 13% of the Hall PMCs, orthodontic separators were used, which necessitated an additional visit. All the GDPs were experienced in placing Control restorations, and it is possible that with increasing experience of the Hall PMCs, their treatment time could reduce, as might their use of separators.</p><p>There was a clear difference in the dentists' subjective assessment of the level of discomfort experienced by the child with both techniques. Hall PMCs were assessed as causing "no discomfort" to "mild, not significant" in 89% of cases, while for Control restorations the figure was lower, at 78% of cases. Although the dentists did not receive any specific training in assessing the level of discomfort experienced by children, they were, for each child, directly comparing the two procedures in the same child, and in 64% of the cases both procedures were completed at the same appointment. There is perhaps some confidence in the validity of dentists judging the children's perception of treatment. Holmes and Girdler recently looked at the ability of dentists to identify anxious children subjectively. They compared this judgement against the Venham and State-Trait scores of the children's anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and reported that dentists were able to correctly identify the vast majority of children with both low and high dental anxiety. Anecdotal evidence from the GDPs was that when discomfort was observed with Hall PMCs, it was often related to the taste of the excess glass ionomer cement extruded from the margins of the crown as the Hall PMC was seated. In addition, the preferences for each procedure that the parents, children and dentists expressed, of which a component is likely to be discomfort, supports the dentists' observations of discomfort levels experienced by the child.</p><p>Preferences for either technique were expressed by 88% of children, 91% of GDPs but only 76% of carers. The reduced figure for carers was due to them not always being present in the surgery when treatment was carried out. Where a preference was expressed, this was for the Hall Technique in the majority of cases, with 77% of children, 83% of carers and 81% of GDPs favouring the Hall Technique over Control restorations.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of fitting Hall crowns on the occlusal vertical dimension</title><p>As the Hall Technique involves no occlusal reduction before fitting the Hall PMC, the procedure is inevitably associated with a premature contact following cementation, and an increase in OVD. As would be anticipated, Hall PMCs on second primary molars caused slightly more of an increase than Hall PMCs on first primary molars. However, for all the 129 cases where data were available, GDPs recorded that an even occlusal contact had re-established at the one year recall. In the experience of Dr Hall, and the authors, the occlusion equilibrates quite rapidly, usually in a matter of weeks. Although it would have been ideal to have the dentists seeing the children two weeks after the crowns were fitted to assess the occlusion, it was not possible within this study design. Trying to construct an ideal trial design within the limits of the general dental practice setting is one of the challenges that faces Primary Care based dental research.</p><p>In this study, no child re-attended their dentist following placement of a Hall PMC with signs or symptoms of occlusal dysfunction, and no child or parent reported difficulty with eating or symptoms of TMJ dysfunction syndrome when they were directly questioned by their dentist at one year or at two year recall. Orthodontists routinely use anterior and posterior bite planes, increasing the vertical dimension significantly more than the fitting of Hall PMCs. Frequently the contact of such bite planes is on one or two teeth only. In healthy children, the presence of orthodontic appliances with bite planes does not appear to place them at increased risk of developing TMJ disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. They alter the timing of vertical dento-alveolar development on a temporary basis, with an accommodation by a temporary increase in lower face height and subsequent rapid eruption of other teeth to establish more even occlusal contacts. This increase in lower face height is itself accommodated by a slowing of vertical facial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The Hall PMCs are acting in a similar manner to such orthodontic appliances, and similarly no untoward effects were found. A recent review of the literature by Luther [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] found no evidence to support the premise that occlusal factors, including premature occlusal interferences, lead to TMJ dysfunction syndrome. Sadowsky and BeGole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] carried out a full clinical examination and structured questionnaire on 75 adults who had undergone orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances in both dental arches, at least 10 years previously, during adolescence. They compared the results with a matched sample of patients who had not undergone orthodontic treatment and found no difference in signs or symptoms of TMJ dysfunction syndrome between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival of restorations; 'Major' failures</title><p>As this was a clinical trial, it was not possible to examine the health of the pulp histologically, and absence of symptoms and signs of pulpal disease (as detailed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was used as a surrogate marker for pulpal health. There were 19 'Major' failures of Control restorations (15%) after a minimum follow-up period of 23 months, compared with three 'Major' failures of Hall PMCs, and this difference was statistically significant (p &#x0003c; 0.000) as well as clinically significant. The low failure rate of the Hall PMCs (2%) would seem to make them a successful restoration in their own right, and this is surprising given that there was no caries removal at all from these teeth. The success of the Hall PMCs when compared with the performance of the Control restorations is perhaps the reverse of what might have been expected, without an understanding that the progression of a carious lesion may be altered by changing its environment. It is interesting to compare the findings regarding the relationship of the site, and extent, of initial caries for both Control restorations and Hall PMCs, and the subsequent development of a 'Major' failure. The recommendation in the most recent edition of a standard UK Children's Dentistry textbook is that 'restoration carried out without pulp therapy in most primary molar teeth, where proximal caries has manifest clinically with the involvement of the marginal ridge, will fail. Once the breakdown of marginal ridge is evident pulp therapy is invariably required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. This treatment philosophy is based on a paper by Duggal <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and the source for this data is an MSc thesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The thesis looked at the histopathology of the dental pulp of 79 primary molar teeth with marginal ridge breakdown (MRBD). Almost all teeth (97%) showed some histological evidence of pulpal inflammation. However, in those teeth where the extent of MRBD was less than or equal to two thirds of the marginal width, pulpal inflammation was confined to the adjacent pulp horn in all of the 28 cases reported. Even in the 51 teeth where greater than two thirds of MRBD had occurred, there was only full coronal or radicular pulp involvement in 16 teeth (31%). Although this histopathology study aimed to investigate the use of the clinical appearance of the carious lesion to predict the extent of pulpal inflammation in teeth affected by dental caries, the clinical relevance of this inflammation could not be studied, and the author states; 'However, it should be borne in mind that this investigation did not study whether the changes in the pulp were reversible or not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. There is no information within the literature as to when the degree of inflammation becomes clinically relevant to pulpal prognosis, or at what stage, with removal of the insult (infected tissue), the pulpal tissue has become too inflamed to recover'. The evidence from the clinical trial of the Hall Technique would certainly seem to contradict the absolute importance of marginal ridge integrity in predicting the need for pulp therapy. It is unfortunate that in the Hall trial, presence or extent of MRBD was not recorded by the GDPs as, in retrospect, this might have helped to clarify the relationship between MRBD and subsequent clinical indications of pulpal pathology. However, it is known that 30% of the 229 lesions included in the Hall PMC study, and for which initial radiographs were available, were Class II lesions with caries extending over half way into dentine. As such, it is highly likely that the majority of these would have evidence of some degree of MRBD, firstly because of the extent of the lesion, and secondly because none of the GDPs routinely took bitewing radiographs. They would, therefore, have had to clinically detect an aproximal lesion before taking radiographs with a view to entering the child into the trial. However, the site of the lesion did not affect whether or not the teeth went on to display the clinical signs and symptoms of pulpal pathology. In addition, only 12 of the 78 control teeth (15%) recorded as having aproximal lesions resulted in a 'Major' failure. Given that pulp therapy in the hands of specialists can often have a failure rate of over 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and that it is quite an invasive treatment for a child to be expected to cope with, it would seem prudent to revise the recommendation made by Duggal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>The high "Major" failure rate for the Control restorations (15%) is disappointing but is a reflection of the outcomes related to current practice in the general practice environment. The poor outcomes for conventional restorations in this study are supported by lower levels of evidence such as the retrospective analyses of GDP records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>].</p><p>Non-visualisation of the furcation area for 37% of the Hall PMC teeth could lead to an under-diagnosis of pulpal pathology. However, for the control teeth, only two out of 19 "Major" failures were detected on radiographs alone (with 15% of radiographs unable to show the furcation area clearly). So the clinical impact of being less likely to detect pathology in the furcation area is, in real terms, debatable.</p></sec><sec><title>Survival of restorations; minor failures</title><p>The high minor failure rate for Control restorations (13% (n = 129) at 1 year, 46% (n = 124) at minimum 23 month follow up) was disappointing, and was much higher than failure rates generally reported in the literature. There are several possible reasons for this. Unlike the present study, many studies reported in the literature are carried out in Secondary Care settings, with operators working with specified materials on particular cavity types and sizes. As well as those variables, it is likely that a significant factor in the present study was the high number of Class II restorations (68% as assessed radiographically), the majority of which (73%) were restored with conventional glass ionomer restorative materials, which are no longer recommended for use in Class II cavities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. A significant relationship was found between 'Minor' failure and the use of glass ionomer for Class II cavities but there was no association between glass ionomer for Class I cavities and 'Minor' failure. Nevertheless, use of glass ionomer material reflects current practice amongst this group of GDPs, and as the study was of split-mouth design, the Hall PMCs were being fitted in the same challenging environment by the same clinicians.</p><p>There were six "Minor" failures of the Hall PMCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T13">13</xref>). While it might be assumed that the Hall PMCs would be particularly susceptible to occlusal perforation, as they are fitted without occlusal reduction of the tooth, this was not found to be the case in this study. Perforation and decementation rates were slightly lower than those reported in the literature with PMCs fitted conventionally. A retrospective analysis of survival of PMCs placed in a specialist paediatric dental practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], reported that out of 1,010 PMCs reviewed at a mean time of 2.13 years, 2.1% suffered a perforation and 0.9% became decemented. This was with 55% of the PMCs being placed under general anaesthetic and 98% under rubber dam; yet both of these figures are equivalent to those found with the Hall PMCs (0.8% perforating and 0.8% decementing). Other studies report similar or higher failure rates: 2% perforation and 14% decementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], 4.4% perforation and 8.4% decementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Two teeth with Hall PMCs (both recorded as being a poor fit) were classified as 'Minor' failures with radiographs indicating secondary caries around the cervical margin of the tooth. Again, this figure (1.6%) is comparable to that reported in the literature &#x02013; 1.2% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Despite there being quite a high level of PMCs judged as being an unsatisfactory fit radiographically (15%), the very low failure rate for the PMCs over the two year period (both for "Major" and "Minor" failures) seems to indicate, with the numbers of patients in this study, this criterion was not of great clinical relevance.</p></sec><sec><title>Sealing in caries</title><p>Hall PMCs were not only a more successful restorative technique for carious primary molars than the conventional techniques used by this sample of GDPs, they were also a successful restoration in their own right, achieving comparable survival rates to conventional restorations placed under more favourable conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] (and see related Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F18">18</xref>). This is intriguing, as there was no caries removal at all, and in 42% of cases the caries was assessed radiographically as being &#x0003e; 1/2 way through dentine, a stage at which it is very likely there would be some pulpal involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F18"><label>Figure 18</label><caption><p>Estimates of longevity of dental restorations (in permanent and primary teeth).

If the environment of an actively cariogenic plaque biofilm can be altered, for example by sealing in the caries with a restoration and so isolating it from nutrients from the oral cavity, then the caries process could arrest. This study is only one of several clinical studies supporting this approach. A recent Cochrane review compared the effect of incomplete versus complete caries removal on pulpal health, and demonstrated an overall benefit to pulpal health when caries was only partially removed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The findings of the current study offer further support to the concept of managing dental caries as a process that occurs in the plaque biofilm, with its consequences (lesion formation and progression) potentially arrestable by plaque control. Thus carious lesions need not be considered as irreversible disease requiring complete excision. However, caution should be exercised in applying these findings to the general management of dental caries without being aware of potential pit falls. As stated by van Amerongen <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], with regard to arresting caries by sealing it in with a restorative material, 'the seal's the deal!'. If the seal isn't complete, then the caries can progress. It is technically demanding for even an experienced clinician to place a restoration with total confidence that there is a complete seal around the whole perimeter of the restoration (particularly for Class II restorations), and once that restoration has been placed, then the integrity of that seal must be monitored and maintained throughout life. In addition, clinicians show wide variation in simply diagnosing the presence or absence of dental caries; how reliable are they likely to be in assessing whether existing caries is arrested, or is progressing over time? And what happens when a patient with sealed-in caries changes dentists?</p><p>The evidence from this study is that Hall PMCs allow a reliable, low-maintenance seal to be achieved by GDPs. In primary teeth managed with the technique, caries can be safely left rather than removed. The use of Hall PMCs, however, is generally limited to managing carious primary molars, and even then they will not suit every carious molar, every child or every GDP. For example, the aesthetics of the crown could be a point of discussion. If the concept of sealing in some dental caries, rather than excising it, is to be applied when restoring the carious permanent dentition, then further studies, based in Primary Care, are needed to validate restorative techniques by which GDPs can reliably achieve, monitor and maintain an effective seal under practice conditions. If patients are to benefit from the smaller cavity sizes and improved pulpal health which the 'sealing-in' approach to managing dental caries promises, then this is a research challenge which restorative dentistry in the 21<sup>st </sup>century must address.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, both Hall PMCs and Control restorations could be provided for the great majority (&#x02265; 97%) of children in the study, and in a similar time. However, the Hall Technique was assessed by GDPs as causing significantly less discomfort compared with conventional restorative techniques, and was preferred to Control restorations by a significant majority of patients, carers and GDPs. This study supports other work indicating that the progress of dentinal caries can be significantly slowed, and perhaps even arrested, beneath a well sealed restoration. After two years, Hall PMCs were a more successful method for managing caries in primary molars than the Control restorations placed by GDPs in this high caries risk group, both for signs/symptoms of pulpal disease and longevity of the restorations. The Hall Technique appears to offer an effective treatment option for managing dental caries in primary molar teeth.
