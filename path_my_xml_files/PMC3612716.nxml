Exenatide has been demonstrated to exert many of the glucoregulatory actions of GLP-1, a naturally occurring incretin hormone, but with a longer duration of effect relative to GLP-1, as exenatide is not substantially degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>]. Both exenatide twice daily and exenatide once weekly have been demonstrated to improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, with a favourable safety and tolerability profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>].</p><p>Confirming the absence of drug-induced changes in the heart rate corrected QT (QT<sub>c</sub>) interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) has become a necessary and important component of drug development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. Preclinical studies of exenatide have not demonstrated a signal for QT prolongation, including no effect on the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium current <italic>in vitro</italic> and no ECG changes or QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation in primate studies of up to 9 months in duration (Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., data on file). Surveillance of exenatide twice daily post-marketing events (&#x0003e;1.5 million patient-years of exposure) did not find an association between exenatide and QT prolongation or pro-arrhythmic events (Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc., data on file). Results from a thorough QT (TQT) study conducted in healthy subjects with a single 10 &#x003bc;g dose of exenatide twice daily and an evaluation of QT<sub>c</sub> changes in patients with type 2 diabetes following long term (30 week) exenatide once weekly treatment also demonstrated that exenatide had no effect on cardiac repolarization at therapeutic exenatide concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>]. An important limitation of these clinical studies, however, was that only therapeutic exenatide twice daily and exenatide once weekly doses were evaluated, due to tolerability concerns. Treatment with exenatide twice daily or exenatide once weekly has been shown to produce average peak (exenatide twice daily) or steady-state (exenatide once weekly) plasma concentrations ranging from &#x0223c;200 to 300 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>]. Exenatide is primarily cleared by glomerular filtration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>] and plasma exenatide concentrations are typically higher in patients with renal impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>]. Therefore it is important to evaluate QT effects at therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma exenatide concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>].</p><p>GLP-1 receptor agonists have been associated with a modest increase in heart rate with chronic dosing in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>]. In this TQT study, gradual intravenous (i.v.) exenatide infusion was used to yield sufficiently high plasma exenatide concentrations in healthy volunteers, without intolerable side effects and within a reasonable study duration (i.e. days rather than weeks). In contrast to the marketed exenatide twice daily and exenatide once weekly formulations, i.v. exenatide infusion was associated with a substantial effect on heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. (data on file, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). As standard QT<sub>c</sub> methods, such as Fridericia, Bazett and individualized corrections derived from resting ECGs, are frequently inappropriate for QT assessment during significant heart rate increases, a two stage procedure was implemented to determine the most appropriate heart rate correction method prior to QT<sub>c</sub> analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. ECGs were recorded from a broad range of heart rates at baseline and prospectively defined criteria were subsequently applied to select the best of five evaluated correction methodologies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled, three period, crossover, TQT study, employing a double-blind continuous i.v. infusion paradigm. Healthy male and non-menstruating or post-menopausal female volunteers, 18 to 65 years of age, with fasting serum glucose &#x0003c;110 mg dl<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and BMI of 25 to 35 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> at screening were eligible to participate. Subjects with clinically significant abnormal physical examination or ECG findings, a history of cardiovascular disease or unexplained syncope, abnormal renal function or a personal or family history of sudden death or long QT syndrome were excluded from participation.</p><p>Eligible subjects were randomized to one of six treatment sequences following a Williams design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>] and participated in three inpatient ECG assessment periods: i.v. exenatide infusion, i.v. placebo infusion and positive oral moxifloxacin control with i.v. placebo infusion. The i.v. infusion paradigm delivered gradually increasing plasma exenatide concentrations to achieve therapeutic steady-state plasma exenatide concentrations of &#x0223c;200 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on day 1 and &#x0223c;300 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on day 2 and the supratherapeutic concentration of &#x0223c;500 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on day 3 (total of 67 h infusion). Placebo was infused at the same rate as exenatide. A single, 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin was administered on the second infusion day during the positive control ECG assessment period. There was a minimum of 5 days washout between periods.</p><p>Blood samples for pharmacokinetic assessments were collected coincident with ECG sampling during i.v. infusion periods. Subjects received meals prior to (06.00 h) and immediately following (15.00h) the primary ECG assessment time periods and at 20.00 h.</p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the principles described in the Declaration of Helsinki (1946) up to and including the Seoul revision (2008) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>]. A common clinical protocol was approved for each site by the appropriate Institutional Review Board and all subjects provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec><title>ECG assessments</title><p>Continuous ECG monitoring was performed throughout each inpatient ECG assessment period. ECGs were extracted (four replicates) at seven time-matched hourly time points, pre-therapy and on each infusion day, after subjects were resting quietly in the supine position for 20 min prior to and 5 min following each time point. Additional pre-therapy ECGs were extracted (four replicates) while subjects were unrestricted in physical activity at six time points on the day before dosing, and at one time point 2 days before dosing when subjects were instructed to rest in the supine position for 10 min and then stand up for 15 min. These additional ECG extractions allowed collection of a broad range of pre-therapy heart rates, including periods of physical activity and inherent diurnal variation.</p><p>The double-blind i.v. infusion procedure ensured that the sponsor, subjects and investigators were blinded to exenatide and placebo treatment. Moxifloxacin was administered open label. The cardiologists at the central ECG laboratory (Cardio Analytics, Plymouth, UK) who interpreted all ECG measurements were blinded to all study treatments/sequences. Measurement of QT was performed on superimposed median waveforms from all 12 ECG leads, using a semi-automated approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory values</title><p>Plasma concentrations of exenatide (Tandem Labs, San Diego, CA, USA) were measured using a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>]. Interassay coefficient of variation was &#x02264;6%.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 60 evaluable subjects was predicted to provide &#x0003e;95% power to ensure the upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI for the largest time-matched baseline-adjusted mean difference between exenatide and placebo (&#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>) would be &#x0003c;10 ms (assuming 5 ms as the largest expected difference and 10 ms as the SD of within subject difference) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. All QT-related analyses were conducted for the intention to treat (ITT) population and the evaluable population, defined as subjects who completed all three ECG assessment periods without confounding adverse events coincident with prespecified ECG extraction time points in the primary ECG assessment window. The primary analysis was based on the evaluable population. Missing ECG data were not imputed. Safety analyses were performed for the ITT population.</p><sec><title>QT correction methods</title><p>Five heart rate correction methods were applied to calculate the corrected QT interval, including Fridericia's correction (QT<sub>c</sub>F = QT/RR<sup>1/3</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>] and two individual QT correction methods:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bcp0075-0979-m1"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bcp0075-0979-m2"/></disp-formula></p><p>where &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are the subject specific correction factors (estimated slopes) from log linear and linear regression models fitted to each subject's pre-therapy QT and RR measurements, respectively. In addition, two study population QT correction methods were applied:</p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bcp0075-0979-m3"/></disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="bcp0075-0979-m4"/></disp-formula></p><p>where &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; are the population correction factors (estimated slopes) from log-linear and linear regression models fitted to all pre-therapy QT and RR measurements for all subjects, respectively.</p><p>A total of 168 pre-therapy ECG measurements for each subject (four replicates at 14 time points in three periods) were used to derive correction factors for QT<sub>c</sub>I, QT<sub>c</sub>IL, QT<sub>c</sub>P and QT<sub>c</sub>PL. The QT-RR patterns during pre-therapy, exenatide and placebo treatments were compared visually to assess extent of overlap.</p><p>To evaluate each heart rate correction method, the QT<sub>c</sub>/RR pairs were plotted for each subject and the slope of the linear regression line was calculated for exenatide and placebo treatments separately by subject. The square of the linear regression slope was calculated separately for each subject for exenatide and placebo treatments. The average squared individual QT<sub>c</sub>-RR slopes were then calculated for each correction method for exenatide and placebo separately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. Prospectively defined rules were applied for selection of the most appropriate correction method prior to formal statistical analysis. The QT correction method that generated the average squared individual slopes closest to zero for placebo and with similar slope of QT<sub>c</sub> and RR relationship for both placebo and exenatide was then identified as the most appropriate correction method and was therefore selected for use in the primary analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>QT analysis</title><p>The average of the four replicates was used as the value from each time point. The primary inferential analysis was based on the &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub><sup>avg</sup>, defined as the change from within treatment period baseline (baseline-adjusted) in QT<sub>c</sub> averaged across three prespecified primary ECG assessment time points (13.00 h, 14.00 h, 15.00 h) on day 1, day 2 and day 3. These time points were prospectively selected based on a pilot study that demonstrated that pharmacodynamic variables, including heart rate and insulin and glucose concentrations, had stabilized at this time following the morning meal (data on file, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]). The baseline value for this analysis was defined as the mean QT<sub>c</sub> across the same pre-therapy time points for each ECG assessment period for each subject.</p><p>For the most appropriate QT<sub>c</sub>, a mixed effects model was employed with the &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> as the dependent variable, and treatment (exenatide/placebo), day, time, period, sequence, and day-by-time-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects. A random intercept for subject was included in the model. A treatment-day-time-specific variance was assumed. If the fixed effects for period and/or sequence were non-significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.1), these effects were removed from the final model. Data collected at all 21 prespecified ECG assessment time points within the ECG assessment window (09.00 h to 15.00 h for 3 days) from exenatide and placebo treatment periods were included in the model fitting. The time-matched LS mean difference in &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> (&#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>) and averaged &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> (&#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub><sup>avg</sup> or the mean of &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> over the three primary ECG assessment time points) between exenatide and placebo and associated two-sided 90% CI was produced for each day. A negative TQT study was to be concluded if, based on the most appropriate QT<sub>c</sub> method, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI for the &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub><sup>avg</sup> was &#x0003c;10 ms at all exenatide concentrations. Secondary QT<sub>c</sub> analyses were repeated for other correction methods for all time points for the evaluable and ITT populations.</p><p>The time-matched LS mean (SEM) difference between moxifloxacin and placebo and the associated two-sided 90% CI were computed. To adjust for multiplicity, a resampling-based multiple test was carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>]. Assay sensitivity was to be established if the lower bound of the two-sided adjusted 90% CI for the time-matched &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> was greater than 5 ms at any of the preselected time points (1 h, 2 h or 3 h following moxifloxacin administration). The baseline for this analysis was calculated as the mean of the three pre-therapy time points corresponding to 1 h, 2 h and 3 h following moxifloxacin administration for each subject.</p><p>Frequency of QT<sub>c</sub> outlier values (QT<sub>c</sub> &#x0003e;450 ms and &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> &#x0003e;30 ms) were summarized. Descriptive statistics for QT, QT<sub>c</sub>, heart rate, RR, PR and QRS intervals and changes in these parameters from baseline were summarized.</p></sec><sec><title>Concentration&#x02013;effect (QT<sub>c</sub>) analysis</title><p>The relationship of QT<sub>c</sub> with plasma exenatide concentration was assessed using a linear mixed effects model with &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> from the most appropriate correction method as the dependent variable, the time-matched on-treatment exenatide plasma concentration as a covariate, and subject intercept and slope as random effects, with an assumption of unstructured covariance matrix. To identify the optimal model, 10 models were evaluated to assess assumptions of linearity or log linearity, the intercept effect, the subject random effect on slope and intercept and the correlation between them. The goodness-of-fit of each model was evaluated based on the AIC, the total coefficient of determination (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="bcp0075-0979-mu8.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula>)<sub>,</sub> the number of model parameters and the assessment of diagnostic plots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Safety analyses</title><p>Treatment emergent adverse events were defined as those that occurred or worsened after initiation of study medication infusion.

No subjects were withdrawn due to changes in ECG or QT interval, resulting in minimal bias from subject discontinuations. Seventy-five (87%) subjects completed three ECG assessment periods; one subject experienced vomiting within 5 min of an ECG extraction time point and was excluded from the evaluable population, resulting in 74 evaluable subjects.

The majority of adverse events were assessed as mild in intensity. There were no events of hypoglycaemia reported. As expected, given the supratherapeutic dosing, nausea, vomiting and symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease were most commonly associated with exenatide and were observed less frequently with placebo or moxifloxacin. Three subjects withdrew from study participation due to adverse events, including events of nausea and vomiting associated with exenatide and one serious adverse event of elevation of creatinine phosphokinase observed after washout of exenatide and prior to placebo infusion in the subsequent treatment period. No other serious adverse events were reported. Overall, the low number of withdrawals due to gastrointestinal adverse events indicated that exenatide was generally well tolerated in this healthy subject population using this titration regimen, even when exenatide was administered at very high doses.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This exenatide TQT study employed i.v. infusion of exenatide to achieve therapeutic and supratherapeutic plasma exenatide concentrations in healthy volunteers without intolerable gastrointestinal adverse events and within a time frame feasible for such a study (i.e. days rather than weeks). Applying a randomized, double-blind, three-period, crossover design, this study demonstrated that exenatide does not prolong the QTc interval. A &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub> effect &#x0003e;10 ms could clearly be excluded and the study therefore met the criteria described by ICH E14 guidance as a negative TQT study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>]. The upper limit of the two-sided 90% CI for the LS mean &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>P, the most appropriate heart rate correction method based on predefined selection criteria, was below the 10 ms threshold of clinical and regulatory concern across the range of exenatide concentrations evaluated, including target mean concentrations up to 1.5- to 2.5-fold higher than those typically achieved in patients with exenatide twice daily or exenatide once weekly. There were no individual outliers, as no subject had an absolute QT<sub>c</sub> &#x0003e;450 ms or an increase from baseline in QT<sub>c</sub> &#x0003e;30 ms with exenatide. Assay sensitivity was demonstrated with a moxifloxacin positive control. Concentration&#x02212;effect modelling demonstrated the lack of a meaningful relationship between &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>P and plasma exenatide concentration, including concentrations exceeding those observed in patients with renal impairment. No effects on AV conduction (as evaluated by PR interval) or intra-ventricular conduction (as evaluated by QRS interval) were observed. These results are consistent with previous findings of no clinically meaningful changes in QT<sub>c</sub> with the GLP-1 receptor agonists exenatide and liraglutide at therapeutic concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>].</p><p>In a previous TQT study that assessed the effect on cardiac repolarization of a single subcutaneous 10 &#x003bc;g dose of exenatide twice daily, an effect on &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>F and &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>I exceeding 10 ms could be excluded, but peak plasma exenatide concentrations (mean [%CV] 208 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>] pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were substantially lower than in the current study. Furthermore, a positive slope of the relationship between &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>F and plasma exenatide concentration was observed, which could potentially be extrapolated and interpreted as suggesting a potential QT<sub>c</sub> effect at plasma concentrations above those actually observed in the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>]. However, a <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis using the evaluation method for selecting the most appropriate correction method, as in the current study, demonstrated that QT<sub>c</sub>I more appropriately removed the heart rate dependence, and no correlation between plasma exenatide concentrations and &#x00394;&#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>I was observed. The results from the two studies are therefore consistent and are now also expanded to include substantially higher plasma exenatide concentrations.</p><p>The design of this TQT study included novel features with potential utility for future investigations, including application of a prospectively-defined methodology to select an appropriate heart rate correction method and implementation of i.v. infusion to achieve and maintain steady-state drug concentrations.</p><p>A 2 to 4 beats min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase in heart rate is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes with long-term exenatide therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>]. However, during i.v. exenatide infusion in the current investigation, an increase of heart rate up to approximately 17 beats min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was observed in healthy volunteers. This observation required application of appropriate design features that are relevant to future studies of drugs that significantly increase heart rate. A wide range of heart rates was collected pre-therapy to allow derivation of an appropriate heart rate correction algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>]. This range of heart rates was achieved by extracting ECGs at several time points at which subjects were more freely moving and from a time point at which subjects performed a protocol-prescribed supine-to-standing manoeuvre. As a result, substantial overlap of pre-therapy and on-treatment heart rates was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2</xref>). As it is impossible to predict the optimal heart rate correction method for a specific dataset in advance, five different heart rate correction methods were prospectively applied to the data and the ability of each to correct for heart rate changes was evaluated using the methodology proposed by members of the FDA's Interdisciplinary Review Team for QT studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>]. It was concluded that QT<sub>c</sub>P, QT<sub>c</sub>PL and QT<sub>c</sub>F removed the heart rate dependence better than individualized correction methods on placebo data, with the mean of squared individual slopes of 0.0027-0.0028 compared with 0.0032 for QT<sub>c</sub>I and QT<sub>c</sub>IL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The optimal way of achieving a sufficiently broad range of heart rates at baseline to construct an individualized QT<sub>c</sub>I is yet to be defined and it should be recognized that the QT/RR relationship during light activity and postural procedures may not be the same as during drug-induced heart rate increases. It is therefore important to assess the appropriateness of employed QT correction methods on both drug free (placebo) and on drug conditions and to also include &#x02018;study independent&#x02019; correction methods, e.g. QT<sub>c</sub>F. In the current study, different correction methods generally corrected for heart rate changes the same way with placebo and drug, with the exception of the linear population-based method, QT<sub>c</sub>PL, which more effectively removed the heart rate dependence on exenatide than on placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). It is also noteworthy that QT<sub>c</sub>F, which uses a fixed correction factor, was comparable with methods derived from the study data (QT<sub>c</sub>I and QT<sub>c</sub>P) and that a QT<sub>c</sub> effect exceeding 10 ms could be excluded with all correction methods.</p><p>A continuous i.v. infusion paradigm was implemented to achieve and maintain both therapeutic and supratherapeutic steady-state plasma exenatide concentrations. By design, the gradual rise in exenatide exposure improved gastrointestinal tolerability in healthy subjects compared with acute dosing and allowed evaluation of higher plasma concentrations than would have otherwise been tolerated. Minimization of gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea and vomiting is important in QT studies, as these events may have significant direct effects on the QT<sub>c</sub> interval. In addition, the i.v. infusion paradigm also maintained steady-state plasma exenatide concentrations over a 6 h ECG assessment period, allowing selection of time points for QT assessment at which pharmacodynamic variables were stable. It is important to note that the sole purpose of the i.v. infusion approach was to achieve and maintain sufficiently high plasma exenatide concentrations in this specific study to assess effects on cardiac repolarization; the efficacy and the overall safety profile of exenatide in patients with diabetes has been demonstrated using the subcutaneous formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>].</p><p>Evaluation of &#x00394;QT<sub>c</sub>P across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3</xref>) during placebo infusion demonstrated a large fluctuation between early time points in the ECG assessment window, likely reflecting instability of variables such as insulin and glucose concentrations post-prandially and consistent with demonstrations of an effect of food consumption on QT<sub>c</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>] (data on file, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). This fluctuation across early time points was lower during exenatide infusion, likely due to the antihyperglycaemic effect of exenatide to blunt post-prandial rises in glucose concentrations in healthy subjects. Similar effects were observed in QT analyses for the GLP-1 receptor agonist, liraglutide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>]. As steady-state exenatide concentrations were maintained over time, the primary analysis could focus on the time period of greatest stability in pharmacodynamic variables, which was confirmed by stable serum glucose concentrations over the primary ECG assessment window. Mean serum glucose concentrations with i.v. exenatide infusion were approximately 5 mmol l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> from 09.00 h to 15.00 h. With i.v. placebo infusion, mean serum glucose concentrations were approximately 6 mmol l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the 09.00 h time point and approximately 5 mmol l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at the remaining time points in the ECG assessment period. Further investigation of the effects of glucose on QT and the potential impact of antihyperglycaemic medications on that relationship is warranted.</p><p>Given the incidence of renal impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>] and a potential for higher plasma exenatide concentrations in those with mildly or moderately impaired renal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>], it is important to establish the safety of exenatide with regard to the QT interval at higher plasma exenatide concentrations. In patients with mild and moderate renal impairment, increases in exenatide exposure of 33% and 62%, respectively, compared with patients with normal renal function, were predicted based on population pharmacokinetic analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>]. In patients treated with exenatide once weekly with normal renal function compared to those with mild or moderate renal impairment, geometric mean steady-state plasma exenatide concentrations were approximately 210 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, 290 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 340 pg ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively (data on file, Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). These plasma exenatide concentrations were clearly exceeded in the current study and the results therefore demonstrate that the observation of no QT<sub>c</sub> effect can be expanded to plasma exenatide concentrations above those observed in patients with diabetes, including the subpopulation with impaired renal function.</p><p>The novel selection procedure for determining the appropriate QT correction methodology and the utilization of a slowly increasing i.v. exenatide infusion to permit attainment of higher plasma concentrations than could have been achieved with other dosing techniques have potential applications for future TQT studies.</p><p>In summary, this TQT study in healthy volunteers supports the safe use of exenatide in regard to pro-arrhythmic risk associated with delayed cardiac repolarization or alterations in AV or intra-ventricular conduction in patients with diabetes, including those with impaired renal function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the exenatide BCB112 clinical team for their assistance in the conduct, reporting, and quality control of the studies, the BCB112 study site investigators, Drs Ronald Kimberlin, H.
