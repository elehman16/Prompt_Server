transfer (CRet) on changes in muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment after fatiguing
exercise. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-two healthy males were assigned into either the
CRet (n=11) or control (n=11) group. Fatiguing exercise and CRet intervention were applied
at the quadriceps muscle of the participants&#x02019; dominant legs. The Ely test, pelvic tilt,
lumbar lordosis, and superficial temperature were measured before and after exercise and
for 30 minutes after intervention. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way
analysis of variance, with Tukey&#x02019;s post-hoc multiple comparison test to clarify
within-group changes and Student&#x02019;s t-test to clarify between-group differences. [Results]
The Ely test and pelvic tilt were significantly different in both groups after exercise,
but there was no difference in the CRet group after intervention. Superficial temperature
significantly increased in the CRet group for 30 minutes after intervention, in contrast
to after the exercise and intervention in the control group. There was no significant
between-group difference at any timepoint, except in superficial temperature. [Conclusion]
CRet could effectively improve muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment after
fatiguing exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Thermotherapy</kwd><kwd>Lumbopelvic alignment</kwd><kwd>Muscle fatigue</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inappropriate lumbopelvic alignment is widely accepted as a risk factor for injuries. In
particular, excessive anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis are reported to be associated
with injuries such as low back pain (LBP) and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury.
Heather et al. reported that patients with LBP exhibited an increased lumbar lordosis
compared with those without LBP<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Roncarati and McMullen<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> found an
association between increased lumbar lordosis and anterior pelvic tilt and LBP. Regarding
ACL injury, Hertel et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> and Loudon et
al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that increased anterior
pelvic tilt was related to a history of ACL injury. These injuries are common in athletes
and may prevent athletes from participating in sports for a long time<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is
important to maintain the appropriate lumbopelvic alignment to prevent injuries.</p><p>Factors to define lumbopelvic alignment include a balance between the anterior and
posterior pelvic muscles. If a person stands with an exaggerated anterior pelvic tilt and
lumbar lordosis, his hip flexor and lumbar extensor muscles are shortened or tightened,
whereas the abdominal muscles are weakened<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Tashiro et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
revealed that anterior pelvic tilt was significantly greater in Japanese Keirin cyclists
than in the controls and concluded that poor flexibility of the quadriceps muscle, which
includes the rectus femoris muscle acting as a hip flexor, contributed to an increase in
anterior pelvic tilt. Thus, a decrease in hip flexor muscle flexibility can lead to
excessive anterior pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis.</p><p>Muscle fatigue is one of the factors associated with decrease in muscle flexibility.
Various studies have reported that muscle fatigue induced by intense exercise causes an
increase in muscle hardness, resulting in a decrease in muscle flexibility<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, muscle fatigue of the hip
flexor is considered to change lumbopelvic alignment by decreasing muscle flexibility. Since
poor muscle flexibility itself is also related to the occurrence of injuries<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
it is important to enhance muscle recovery after fatigue, and maintain appropriate muscle
flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment.</p><p>Various modalities are utilized to facilitate muscle recovery from fatigue, including
stretching<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, massage<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, active recovery<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, contrast water
therapy<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> cryotherapy<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and thermotherapy<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
effectiveness of these modalities is controversial. Recently, Capacitive and Resistive
electric transfer (CRet), which is a type of diathermy, has been developed as a form of deep
thermotherapy and applied in sports medicine<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. This device delivers radiofrequency energy, which passes between
an active and inactive electrode, and generates heat within the body<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous
studies indicated that CRet was more effective in improving blood circulation than a hot
pack, which is a conventional thermotherapy modality used frequently in clinical
practice<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improving blood circulation would play an important role in the
enhancement of muscle recovery after fatigue<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, CRet can be an effective modality
to enhance muscle recovery after fatigue, leading to maintain and improve the appropriate
muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment. However, there was no study indicating the
effects of CRet on fatigued muscle and the changes in muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic
alignment after fatiguing exercise are unknown. Therefore, the purpose of the present study
was to clarify the effects of CRet on changes in muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic
alignment after fatiguing exercise.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-two healthy males participated in the study. All participants were not active in
spots and were not currently on a regimented strenuous excessive exercise. The quadriceps
muscles of their dominant legs received fatiguing exercise and intervention. Individuals
with a history of orthopedic or nervous system disease in their lower limbs or low back or
who corresponds with contraindication of the CRet intervention were excluded. Written
informed consent was obtained from each participant in accordance with the guidelines
approved by Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine and the Declaration of Human
Rights, Helsinki, 1975. The study was approved by the ethical committee of Kyoto University
Graduate School of Medicine (R1284).</p><p>The experimental design and time course of the measurements were summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The Ely test, pelvic tilt, lumbar lordosis, and superficial temperature were measured
before (Pre-Ex) and after (Post-Ex) the fatiguing exercise. Then, the interventions
for CRet and control groups were performed for 15 minutes. Each measurement was
performed immediately (Post-In), 15 minutes (15-min Post-In), and 30 minutes (30-min
Post-In) after the interventions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-30-719-g001"/></fig>. Participants were randomly assigned into one of two groups the CRet group or control
group. The CRet group (n=11) received 15 minutes of CRet intervention after fatiguing
exercise, while the control group (n=11) was instructed to rest for 15 minutes. Measurements
were performed pre- and post- exercise (Pre-Ex and Post-Ex, respectively) and immediately,
15 minutes, and 30 minutes after intervention (Post-In, 15&#x02005;min Post-In, and 30&#x02005;min Post-In,
respectively).</p><p>Quadriceps muscle fatigue was induced in the participants&#x02019; dominant leg by concentric and
eccentric knee extension exercise. Participants sat on the bed with their hip joint angle at
approximately 100&#x000b0; and their feet off the floor. From this position, the participants were
instructed to extend their knee fully over 3 seconds (concentric phase), keep their knee
extended for 1 second (isometric phase), and slowly lower the leg over 3 seconds (eccentric
phase). They performed 10 sets of 10 repetitions with a 30-second interval between sets. The
resistance was set at approximately 30% of the participants&#x02019; maximum voluntary isometric
contraction (MVC) force measured using a &#x003bc; Tas F-1 hand-held dynamometer (Anima Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan).</p><p>Indiba<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> activ Pro Recovery HCR902 (Indiba S.A., Barcelona, Spain) was used for
the CRet intervention. This device operates at a frequency of 448 kHz. A rigid circular
metallic electrode with a 65-mm diameter was used as the active electrode and a large
flexible rectangular metallic plate (measuring 200 &#x000d7; 260&#x02005;mm) was used as the inactive
electrode. A radiofrequency (RF) energy was delivered using in two modes: capacitive (CAP)
and resistive (RES) at the active electrode. The CAP electrode has a polyamide coating that
acts as a dielectric medium, insulating its metallic body from the skin surface, and thus it
generates heat externally near the skin. The RES electrode is uncoated and the RF energy
travels directly through the body into the inactive electrode, therefore, it generates heat
in deeper regions of the body. There are several contraindications to receiving CRet
including pregnancy, deep vein thrombosis, hypoesthesia, damaged skin, or the presence of an
implanted pacemaker. The CRet group underwent a 15-minute intervention (5 minutes in CAP
mode, and 10 minutes in RES mode). The active electrode was continually moved in the
circular motion on the skin of posterior thigh and the inactive electrode was placed under
the thigh. A manufacturer- supplied conductive cream was used as coupling medium between the
active electrode and skin surface during the intervention. The intensity was determined
subjectively by a score of 6 or 7 on a subjective analog scale, which is an 11-point scale
for the participant self-reporting of thermal sensing (0, no thermal sensing; 10, worst
possible thermal sensing). The intensity and duration of CRet intervention were based on the
manufacturer&#x02019;s recommending method, which were considered to be the most effective without
feeling discomfort or pain<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Ely test was used to determine changes in quadriceps muscle flexibility<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants laid prone on the bed
with their dominant leg passively bent. The knee flexion angle, at which the hip rise was
felt by the examiner, was measured using a universal goniometer.</p><p>Pelvic tilt was measured using a palpation meter (PALM, Performance Attainment Associates,
St Pail, MN, USA)<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. During the
measurements, the participants stood with their feet aligned with their shoulders and were
instructed to keep their arms crossed over the chest and look at a fixed point ahead to
control for postural sway. The landmarks for measurement were the ipsilateral anterior
superior iliac spine (ASIS) and posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). Anterior pelvic tilt
was measured by placement of the PALM caliper tips in contact with the ipsilateral ASIS and
PSIS. The degree of deviation from the horizontal was read from an inclinometer. A positive
degree was used to describe anterior pelvic tilt and a negative degree was used to describe
posterior tilt in the sagittal plane. The measurements were performed two times on the
participants&#x02019; dominant leg and the average value was used for analysis.</p><p>Lumbar lordosis was measured using the Spinal Mouse (Index Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Spinal Mouse is a computer-aided
electric measuring device that measures intersegmental angles in a non-invasive manner. As
with PALM measurement, the participants stood with their feet aligned with their shoulders
and their arms beside the body; they were instructed to look at a fixed point ahead to
control postual sway. The Spinal Mouse was guided along the midline of the spine beginning
at the spinous process of C7 and finishing at the top of the anal crease (approximately the
level of S3). The lumbar lordosis angle was calculated from the sum of six segmental angles
from Th12/L1 to L5/S1. The measurements were performed three times and the average value was
used for analysis.</p><p>Superficial temperature was measured using an infrared thermometer (IT2-80, KEYENCE Co.,
Ltd., Japan) to estimate the thermal effects of the CRet intervention. The measurement site
was the center of the quadriceps muscle of the participants&#x02019; dominant legs.</p><p>For each measure index, the amount of change (&#x00394;) from the first value was calculated. The
one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the changes at each time point within the
group. The Tukey post hoc multiple comparison (Tukey-HSD) test was performed to clarify
differences within each group. The student t-test was used to compere changes at each time
point between two groups. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 20.0 (IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), with a statistical threshold of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The physical characteristics of the participants in each group are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Physical characteristics of the participants</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CRet group (n=11)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=11)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.0 &#x000b1; 1.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.2 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">171.7 &#x000b1; 5.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.5 &#x000b1; 6.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.7 &#x000b1; 7.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.0 &#x000b1; 8.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.9 &#x000b1; 2.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.1 &#x000b1; 1.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MVC (N)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">331.5 &#x000b1; 69.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">307.8 &#x000b1; 57.9</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are represented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation.

There was no significant difference in Ely test angle, pelvic tilt, and lumbar lordosis
between groups (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2)</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of CRet intervention on changes in muscle
flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment after fatiguing exercise. The results showed a
significant decrease in the angle of the Ely test and thus quadriceps flexibility, as well
as a significant increase in the angle of anterior pelvic tilt immediately after exercise in
both groups. In the control group, significant differences in Ely test results and pelvic
tilt were observed until 30 minutes after and immediately after the intervention,
respectively; while; in the CRet group, significant differences in the Ely test and pelvic
tilt were no longer observed after CRet intervention.</p><p>Intense exercise, particularly which contains eccentric contraction, is known to induce an
increase in muscle hardness<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetitive
muscle contractions frequently increase the intramuscular water content level<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. This exercise-induced fluid accumulation increases the intramuscular
pressure, resulting in an increase in muscle hardness. Therefore, Ely test angle
significantly decreased immediately after the knee extension exercise in both groups. This
result suggests that the quadriceps muscle flexibility decreased immediately after knee
extension exercise in both groups since the Ely test is an indicator of quadriceps muscle
flexibility.</p><p>The results of the present study suggested that quadriceps muscle flexibility returned to
baseline sooner in the CRet group than in the control group. This difference seems to be due
to the thermal effects of the CRet intervention. In the present study, the change in
superficial temperature was 5.1&#x000b0;C immediately after CRet intervention. Our previous study
showed that the change in superficial temperature was 2.4&#x000b0;C immediately after CRet
intervention applied at the hamstring muscles<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although we measured superficial temperature using a different
instrument, the intervention in the present study was carried out at the same intensity and
duration using the same instrument as in this previous study. Therefore, we assumed that the
thermal effects in the present study may be equal to or higher than in the previous
study.</p><p>There are three possible factors contributing to the change in quadriceps muscle
flexibility. The first factor is improvement in blood circulation to the muscle. Many
studies have revealed that thermotherapy improves blood circulation<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover,
previous studies showed that CRet intervention was more effective on the improvement in
blood circulation than hot pack application<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. An increase in muscle hardness is caused
by an increase in intramuscular pressure resulting from fluid accumulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. We infer that muscle hardness may decrease
since the accumulated fluid would be removed by the improvement in blood circulation from
CRet intervention. Muscle hardness affects muscle flexibility, thus, muscle flexibility of
the quadriceps could be improved by CRet intervention. The second factor is the increase in
soft tissue extensibility, including that in connective tissue composed primarily of
collagen fibers<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>. As temperature
increases, collagen extensibility increases, and connective tissue viscosity and the
viscoelasticity of muscle fibers are reduced<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Subsequently, the extensibility of soft tissues increases, and muscle flexibility improves.
The third factor is muscle relaxation. Thermal stimulation decreases the activity of &#x003b1; motor
neurons by changing the activity of group II fibers, &#x003b3; motor neurons and Ib fibers<xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref><sup>)</sup>. These changes in neuronal activity cause
muscle relaxation. In the present study, thermal stimulation by CRet intervention may alter
nerve activity and cause muscle relaxation, resulting in improvement in quadriceps
flexibility based on the Ely test.</p><p>The result of the present study showed that the pelvic tilt angle significantly increased
immediately after exercise in both groups and returned to its original value sooner in the
CRet group than in the control group. These changes are considered to be associated with the
change in quadriceps muscle flexibility. The position of the pelvis is determined by a
balance between the anterior and posterior pelvic muscles. Kendall et al.<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref><sup>)</sup> described that tightness of the hip
flexors led to an anterior pelvic tilt in the standing position. The quadriceps muscle group
is composed of four muscle, vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and
rectus femoris; the rectus femoris also acts as a hip flexor. Thus, it is considered that
the angle of pelvic tilt increased immediately after knee extension exercise and decreased
after CRet intervention, along with a change in quadriceps muscle flexibility.</p><p>There was no significant difference in lumbar lordosis in both groups at any time point. It
is widely believed that lumbar lordosis is associated with pelvic tilt. Levine et al.<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><sup>)</sup> found that altering pelvic tilt
significantly changed the angle of lumbar lordosis in the standing position. According to
Youdas et al.<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref><sup>)</sup>, the correlation between
pelvic tilt and lumbar lordosis in the standing position is significant, albeit weak. We
assume that the change in pelvic tilt was insufficient to affect lumbar lordosis because the
exercise and intervention were performed on participants&#x02019; dominant legs only.</p><p>Poor muscle flexibility is a risk factor of various injuries<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, thus it is important to
maintain and improve muscle flexibility to prevent injuries. Furthermore, inappropriate
lumbopelvic alignment could cause injuries such as low back pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and ACL injury<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The results of the present study indicated that fatiguing exercise decreased muscle
flexibility, resulting in a change in pelvic alignment. Those who perform fatiguing exercise
on a daily basis, for example athletes, require a faster recovery from fatigue and enhance
injury prevention through the appropriate conditioning in order for them to optimally
practice and to compete. Moreover, it is important to recover muscles after strenuous
exercise in a short time because, in many sports, situations in which athletes are not given
enough time to recover their muscle fatigue are abundant; for example, the situation in
which they have to participate in a lot of games in a day. Our study results suggest that
CRet could play an important role in athletes&#x02019; conditioning.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, we did not include female and various aged
participants, and the population was restricted to young healthy males belonging to the same
university. The effects of CRet in other populations is uncertain; therefore, further
research is required in this regard. Second, we assessed the quadriceps muscle only by the
Ely test. The detailed changes caused by exercise and CRet intervention remain unclear.
Third, the measurement time was limited. We investigate the effects of CRet on changes in
muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment before and after exercise and for 30 minutes
after intervention. The lasting effects of these are unknown. Thus, studies with long-term
follow up are needed. Despite these limitations, the results of the present study provide
valuable information on the effects of CRet.</p><p>The effects of CRet on changes in muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment after
fatiguing exercise was investigated. The results showed that the changes in quadriceps
muscle flexibility and anterior pelvic tilt was significant immediately after knee extension
exercise in both groups; however, that these indexes returned to the pre-exercise value
sooner in the CRet group than after intervention. These findings suggest that the CRet
intervention is effective on improvement of muscle flexibility and pelvic tilt after
fatiguing exercise. CRet could be a useful means to recover muscle fatigue and maintain the
appropriate muscle flexibility and lumbopelvic alignment.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Christie</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Warren</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Postural aberrations in low back pain</article-title>.
