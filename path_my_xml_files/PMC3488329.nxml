However, the usefulness of XP as compared with S-1 plus cisplatin (SP), which is considered standard therapy in Japan, has not yet been assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a multicenter randomized phase II trial to elucidate the efficacy of XP as compared with SP for first-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer. Patients with unresectable metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer, 20&#x02013;74&#x02009;years of age and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative status, will be assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either S-1 40&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> bid for 21&#x02009;days plus cisplatin 60&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 8) every 5-week cycle or capecitabine 1000&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> bid for 14&#x02009;days plus cisplatin 80&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (day 1) every 3-week cycle. Patients will be also asked to the analysis of tumor tissues for translational investigations. The Primary endpoint is progression-free survival and secondary endpoints are overall survival, time to treatment failure, tumor response rate and safety. These comparisons will also be evaluated in terms of biomarkers. Planned sample size is 100 (50 in each arm), which is appropriate for this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Fluoropyrimidine plus cisplatin combination is the standard regimen of the first line treatment for advanced gastric cancer. Both S-1 and capecitabine are the prodrug of 5-FU but differ from their process of metabolism.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For the treatment of advanced or recurrent gastric cancer (AGC), the most commonly used regimens are combination chemotherapy consisting of a fluoropyrimidine (5-fluorouracil or oral fluoropyrimidine) plus a platinum agent with or without docetaxel or anthracyclines
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>S-1 is an oral anticancer drug composed of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) prodrug tegafur and two 5-FU modulators; it has achieved high response rates in patients with gastric cancer in phase II studies
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In a phase III trial (SPIRITS trial) that compared S-1 alone to S-1 plus cisplatin (SP), SP showed a significantly longer overall survival (OS; 13&#x02009;months vs. 11&#x02009;months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.77, 95% CI 0.61&#x02013;0.98, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04) and longer progression-free survival (PFS; 6.0&#x02009;months vs. 4.0&#x02009;months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.57, 95% CI 0.44&#x02013;0.73, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, SP is now considered to be one of the standard first-line regimens for AGC in Japan.</p><p>Capecitabine is also an oral fluoropyrimidine, which is metabolized primarily in the liver and converted in tumor tissues to 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which is associated in higher concentrations in tumor cells than in normal cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Kang and colleagues evaluated the non-inferiority of capecitabine plus cisplatin (XP) compared with 5-FU plus cisplatin (FP). The median PFS showed significant non-inferiority (5.6&#x02009;months vs. 5.0&#x02009;months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.81, 95% CI 0.63&#x02013;1.04, P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. On the basis of these results, XP is now considered one of the standard treatments of AGC
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and XP was adopted as the reference arm in two recent global studies of molecular targeting agents
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, data is scarce with respect to XP treatment in Japanese patients, and also the usefulness of XP as compared with SP has not yet been assessed.</p><p>As another issue, these 2 types of oral fluoropyrimidine show some different characteristics in the mechanisms of their antitumor effect. A subset analysis of the FLAGS trial showed that S-1 seemed to be better than 5-FU in the subgroup with diffuse-type gastric cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This result was consistent with the results of a subset analysis of the JCOG9912 trial, which showed that S-1 was better than 5-FU in patients with diffuse-type gastric cancer or with gastric cancer associated with high dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), with diffuse-type tumors associated more commonly than intestinal type with high DPD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This result was expected, since S-1 consists of tegafur, otastat potassium, and gimestat which is a potent competitive inhibitor of DPD. Capecitabine is transformed to 5-FU in several steps, to be finally converted by TP as above
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A phase II trial in Japan showed that response rate (RR) was significantly higher (Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028) in patients with TP-positive and DPD-negative tumors (60%, 6/10) than in the remaining patients (13%, 2/15)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In contrast, high expression of TP is reported to be negatively associated with efficacy of 5-FU or S-1 in gastric cancer
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of the above reports, histological type (diffuse or intestinal) and biomarkers (TP, DPD, and others) may be candidates to select whether S-1 or capecitabine be used for each patient, although validation with a randomized study is necessary. We planned the current clinical trial to elucidate the efficacy of XP and SP for the first-line treatment of AGC.

The 24-week progression-free rate (PFR) will be estimated for each group, calculating point estimates and 2-sided 90% confidence intervals. The 2-sided 90% confidence interval of the difference between the 2 groups will be also estimated. Exploratory analysis will be done to test the null hypothesis that PFS is equal in both groups. Cumulative PFS curves will be constructed as time-to-event plots by the Kaplan-Meier method.</p><p>With respect to secondary endpoints, efficacy endpoints OS and TTF will be evaluated according to the method of analysis of the primary endpoint. Overall response rate (RR) is defined as the proportion of patients with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) by RECIST out of the patients with measurable lesions, and the chi-square test will be used to compare the 2 groups. The 2-sided 95% confidence interval of the difference between the 2 groups will also be estimated. For the analysis of safety, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test will be used if necessary, and the exact confidence intervals for the binomial distribution will be estimated.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample-size calculation</title><p>Assuming a threshold 24-week PFR of 40% and an expected 24-week PFR of 55% (clinically promising), and a 1.5-year registration period and a 1.5-year follow-up period, 49 patients are required in each group to ensure a 1-sided alpha of 5% and statistical power of 90%. Assuming that the 24-week PFR of the biomarker-positive (any FU-related enzyme or expression of intestinal type) population in the SP arm is 45%, and the risk reduction rate in the XP arm is 40%, 46 patients in total are needed to ensure a 2-sided alpha of 10% and statistical power of 70%. Under the hypothesis that the targeted biomarker-positive population is 50%, 92 patients in total are required. Considering the likelihood of some ineligible cases in the whole setting outlined above, the total sample size is set to 100. A following Phase III study will be designed for both randomized comparison and biomarker-oriented comparison of XP and SP (4 groups).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment program</title><p>Patients who allocated SP will be treated with S-1 and cisplatin every 5-week cycle.

The individualized treatment for cytotoxic agents also needs to be developed to have more effect and less toxicity.</p><p>This is the first study to compare two standard regimens for AGC. Additionally, the translational research is performed to explore the biomarker for chemo-sensitivity and make the individualized treatment possible. When the difference of treatment is found in efficacy or safety from this analysis, we will conduct a phase III trial to examine the possibility of individualized treatment.
