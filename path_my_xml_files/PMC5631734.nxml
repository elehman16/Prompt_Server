The objective of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of dalbavancin for the treatment of ABSSSI among overweight and obese patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a subanalysis of a previously published randomized, double-blind, phase 3 trial of 698 patients with ABSSSI, defined as major abscess, cellulitis, or traumatic wound/surgical site infection and an area of erythema &#x02265;75&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive dalbavancin 1500&#x000a0;mg intravenously (IV) as a single dose or as two doses: 1000&#x000a0;mg on Day 1 and 500&#x000a0;mg on Day 8.&#x000a0;The primary outcome measure was clinical response at 48&#x02013;72 hours, defined as &#x02265;20% reduction in infection-associated erythema. Clinical success (resolution or improvement in all signs and symptoms; no further antibiotic treatment needed) was assessed at Days 14 and 28. Safety was assessed at every&#x000a0;visit.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>There were 237 patients with normal weight (BMI &#x0003c;25), 221 patients who were overweight (BMI 25 to &#x0003c;30), and 240 patients who were obese (119 with BMI 30 to &#x0003c;35; 60 with BMI 35 to &#x0003c;40; 61 with BMI &#x02265;40). Rates of diabetes, hypertension, SIRS, and cellulitis were higher in obese patients (Figure&#x000a0;1). Clinical success rates at end-of-treatment visit and final visit were similar between normal weight, overweight, or obese patient groups (Figure&#x000a0;2). Study drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were observed in 7.2% of normal weight patients, 4.6% of overweight patients, and as follows in obese patients: 7.6% (BMI 30 to &#x0003c;35), 11.7% (BMI 35 to &#x0003c;40), and 13.1% (BMI &#x02265; 40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Rates of serious TEAEs were similar between groups, ranging from 0 to 3.3% among BMI groups. Rates of TEAEs were also similar to those reported for dalbavancin in previous phase 3 trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dalbavancin is effective and well tolerated in overweight and obese patients.</p><fig fig-type="figure" id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0044"/><graphic xlink:href="OFIDIS_ofx163_IF0045"/></fig></sec><sec id="s44"><title>Disclosures</title><p>
