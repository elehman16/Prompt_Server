However, the benefit in women with only one to three positive lymph nodes is uncertain. We aimed to assess the effect of radiotherapy in these women after mastectomy and axillary dissection.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We did a meta-analysis of individual data for 8135 women randomly assigned to treatment groups during 1964&#x02013;86 in 22 trials of radiotherapy to the chest wall and regional lymph nodes after mastectomy and axillary surgery versus the same surgery but no radiotherapy. Follow-up lasted 10 years for recurrence and to Jan 1, 2009, for mortality. Analyses were stratified by trial, individual follow-up year, age at entry, and pathological nodal status.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>3786 women had axillary dissection to at least level II and had zero, one to three, or four or more positive nodes.

Most of these guidelines conclude, however, that there is insufficient evidence to make firm recommendations for women with one to three positive lymph nodes. A previous Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials of postmastectomy radiotherapy<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> did not give detailed results for women who had one to three positive lymph nodes after axillary dissection to at least level II, nor did it distinguish between trials in which radiotherapy included the chest wall and the regional lymph nodes and other trials in which radiotherapy was given only to the regional lymph nodes. For the present report, additional data regarding the extent of axillary dissection and regarding the number of positive lymph nodes have been obtained and reviewed for each woman, and we present detailed results according to these factors for trials that included radiotherapy to the chest wall, as is usual in current practice.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Methods</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design</title><p>Trials beginning before 2000 of adjuvant radiotherapy versus no radiotherapy but the same surgery after mastectomy for invasive cancer were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis of individual patient data.

When no recurrence was reported before breast cancer death, distant recurrence was assumed to have just preceded it. If contralateral breast cancer occurred before any other recurrence, follow-up was censored on that date in analyses of recurrence. Information about the extent of axillary surgery was reviewed. Women were classified as having axillary dissection if they were in a trial in which the protocol required removal of axillary lymph nodes in at least levels I and II. For the few trials in which the extent of axillary dissection was not described in terms of levels, women were classified as having axillary dissection if the trial protocol or publications indicated that the median number of resected nodes was at least ten or, if individual information was available,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> at least ten nodes had been resected.

All recurrence analyses present data only to year 10, because many trials did not follow women beyond this time for recurrence. Analyses of mortality present data to year 20. Deaths of unknown cause before recurrence were assumed to be from causes other than breast cancer, because most occurred many years after trial entry, by which time non-breast-cancer mortality predominated.

Median length of follow-up was 9&#x000b7;4 years per woman (IQR 3&#x000b7;7&#x02013;17&#x000b7;3) and 5424 women (67%) were known to have died. The extent of axillary surgery was known for all but 183 (2%) women. 1594 (20%) women had pathologically node-negative disease, 5821 (72%) had pathologically node-positive disease, and for 720 pathological nodal status was unknown. There were 3831 women for whom pathological nodal status was known and who were classified as having axillary dissection (however, for 45 women with node-positive disease, the number of nodes affected was not known); all of these women were in trials in which radiotherapy included the chest wall, the supraclavicular or axillary fossa (or both), and the internal mammary chain (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix pp 10&#x02013;12</xref>).</p><p>Of the 1594 women with node-negative disease, 700 (44%) had axillary dissection, 870 (55%) had axillary sampling, and for 24 (1%) the extent of axillary surgery was unknown.

However, 29&#x000b7;0% of the unirradiated women with axillary sampling had a locoregional recurrence before any distant recurrence (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 39</xref>) compared with only 19&#x000b7;4% of the unirradiated women who had axillary dissection (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 16</xref>) and the proportional reduction in the rate of overall recurrence was larger after axillary sampling (RR 0&#x000b7;59, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;53&#x02013;0&#x000b7;66; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 38</xref>) than after axillary dissection (RR 0&#x000b7;75, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;67&#x02013;0&#x000b7;83, <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2E</xref>; 2p for difference between RRs, 0&#x000b7;003).</p><p>For the 3131 women with node-positive disease who had axillary dissection, the proportional reductions in the overall recurrence rates did not differ significantly between years 0&#x02013;4 and 5&#x02013;9 (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 17</xref>). Overall recurrence rates in the absence of radiotherapy were, however, higher during years 0&#x02013;4 than during years 5&#x02013;9 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2E</xref>). Consequently, the absolute reduction with radiotherapy in the 10-year overall recurrence risk (10&#x000b7;6%&#x02014;ie, 62&#x000b7;5% <italic>vs</italic> 51&#x000b7;9%), was only slightly greater than the 5-year absolute reduction (9&#x000b7;4%&#x02014;ie, 52&#x000b7;4% <italic>vs</italic> 43&#x000b7;0%). The proportional reduction in the overall recurrence rate with radiotherapy did not differ according to whether or not there was a trial policy of giving systemic therapy (ie, either chemotherapy or, for oestrogen-receptor positive women, tamoxifen), or with any other known factor. For these 3131 women, radiotherapy reduced breast cancer mortality (RR 0&#x000b7;84, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;76&#x02013;0&#x000b7;94, 2p=0&#x000b7;001). There was no significant heterogeneity in the proportional reduction in the breast cancer mortality rate according to any known tumour-related or treatment-related factor. There appeared to be little effect of radiotherapy on breast cancer mortality in the first few years, but after that the breast cancer mortality rate was lower in the radiotherapy group than in the controls until years 10&#x02013;15 and possibly beyond (<xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 17</xref>). Radiotherapy also reduced overall mortality in these 3131 women with node-positive disease who had axillary dissection (RR 0&#x000b7;89, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;81&#x02013;0&#x000b7;97, 2p=0&#x000b7;01; <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix p 15</xref>).</p><p>Among the 1314 women who had axillary dissection and only one to three positive nodes, radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;00001), overall recurrence (RR 0&#x000b7;68, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;57&#x02013;0&#x000b7;82, 2p=0&#x000b7;00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR 0&#x000b7;80, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;67&#x02013;0&#x000b7;95, 2p=0&#x000b7;01; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">figure 3A&#x02013;C</xref>). 813 women (62%) were in trials in which the policy regarding systemic therapy for both randomised groups was to give only chemotherapy, 274 (21%) had oestrogen-receptor positive disease and were in trials in which the policy was only to give tamoxifen, 46 (3%) had oestrogen-receptor positive disease and were in trials in which the policy was to give both tamoxifen and chemotherapy, and 181 (14%) were in trials in which the policy was not to give systemic therapy.

To investigate this issue, we reviewed all available evidence regarding the extent of axillary surgery for the women in these trials, including trial protocols, publications, and individual patient information if it was available. Additionally, we included the longer follow-up now available for many trials. The revised analyses of these updated data show that in these women who had mastectomy and axillary dissection of at least levels I and II, radiotherapy that included the chest wall, the supraclavicular or axillary fossa (or both), and the internal mammary chain reduced recurrence, breast cancer mortality, and overall mortality for all node-positive women considered together. When women with one to three and four or more involved axillary nodes were considered separately, the benefits of postmastectomy radiotherapy were clearly seen in each group. In these trials, 90% of women with one to three positive nodes and 95% of women with four or more positive nodes received some form of systemic treatment for their breast cancer. The most common chemotherapy was cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil and the most common endocrine therapy was tamoxifen. The beneficial effects of radiotherapy on recurrence and breast cancer mortality remained apparent when women with one to three involved lymph nodes who were in trials in which the policy was to give systemic therapy were considered on their own. By contrast, in women with node-negative disease who received mastectomy and axillary dissection, among whom the proportion of women who had a locoregional recurrence before any distant recurrence was small, there was no evidence that radiotherapy provided any benefit. Non-breast-cancer mortality and the incidence of contralateral and other second cancers in these and other trials of radiotherapy in early breast cancer will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>There have been substantial changes in practice since these women were treated. For example, breast screening has improved and local therapies are more targeted. Also, the accuracy of lymph-node analysis has increased, with more frequent use of serial sectioning and more frequent recognition of micrometastases. Hence, some of the women who were classified as having node-negative disease in these trials might have been found to be node-positive if they had been assessed today.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Furthermore, many women now receive better systemic therapy that is more effective at treating both local and distant disease.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Therefore the absolute risk of a recurrence is likely to be lower for women being considered for postmastectomy radiotherapy today than for the women in these trials and the absolute risk reductions achieved with radiotherapy are also likely to be smaller.</p><p>The proportional risk reductions we observed could be applied to women today with one to three positive nodes if they have appreciable risks of recurrence in the absence of radiotherapy and they might be the best guide that is currently available to help to estimate the likely absolute benefits from radiotherapy for women today. For example, for cancer recurrence, the unirradiated women in these trials with one to three positive nodes had an absolute 10-year risk of overall recurrence of 45&#x000b7;7%, which was reduced to 34&#x000b7;2% by their radiotherapy, so their absolute gain was 11&#x000b7;5%. If the absolute 10-year risk of overall recurrence for women being considered for postmastectomy radiotherapy today were about half of this (ie, 23%), then the absolute gain might also be roughly halved (ie, to around 6%). Similarly, if the 20-year risk of breast cancer mortality in women with one to three positive nodes were roughly halved for women today, the absolute gain from radiotherapy would also be roughly halved from 7&#x000b7;9% to around 4%.</p><p>The proportional gains from radiotherapy might, however, be greater for women irradiated today than suggested by this example, because radiotherapy planning has changed substantially and women today receive better coverage of target areas. Furthermore, doses to normal tissues are lower today, so the risks of radiotherapy are also likely to be lower.</p><p>The most common site of locoregional cancer recurrence after mastectomy is the chest wall.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Eight trials have been carried out, including around 2000 women, in which the chest wall was not irradiated. In these eight trials radiotherapy reduced locoregional recurrence in women with pathologically node-positive disease but had no significant effect on overall recurrence and no effect at all on breast cancer mortality. This finding suggests that the chest wall is an important target in postmastectomy radiotherapy. Direct evidence regarding the effect of radiotherapy to the chest wall is being collected,<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> but mature results from this current trial will not be available for some time. In the trials that are the main focus of the present report the chest wall, the supraclavicular or the axillary fossa (or both), and the internal mammary chain were all irradiated. Which regional lymph nodes should be irradiated after mastectomy is currently uncertain. Other randomised trials are investigating the risks and benefits of regional node irradiation in addition to chest wall or whole breast radiotherapy,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> but again long-term results of these trials are not yet available.</p><p>In circumstances in which, even without radiotherapy, only a small percentage of women have locoregional recurrence as a first event after mastectomy, radiotherapy is unlikely to reduce either overall recurrence or breast cancer mortality. This scenario is illustrated by the women in these 22 trials who had axillary dissection and node-negative disease. If, however, a substantial percentage of women have locoregional recurrence as a first event in the absence of radiotherapy, then radiotherapy is likely to provide benefit both by preventing locoregional recurrence and by reducing distant recurrence and breast cancer mortality. This situation is illustrated by the 3131 women in these 22 trials who had axillary dissection and node-positive disease, for whom radiotherapy reduced the 10-year risk of a recurrence of any type by 10&#x000b7;6% (62&#x000b7;5% <italic>vs</italic> 51&#x000b7;9%) and the 20-year risk of death from breast cancer by 8&#x000b7;1% (66&#x000b7;4% <italic>vs</italic> 58&#x000b7;3%). We previously reported that in the trials of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery, the findings for both node-negative and node-positive disease were consistent with about one breast cancer death being avoided in the first 15 years after radiotherapy for every four recurrences of any type (ie, either locoregional or distant) avoided in the 10 years after radiotherapy.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The women with node-positive disease in the 22 trials reported here generally had more advanced cancers and more extensive radiotherapy than the women in the trials of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery and, for these women, about one breast cancer death was avoided in the 20 years after radiotherapy for every 1&#x000b7;5 recurrences of any type (ie, either locoregional or distant) avoided during the first 10 years after radiotherapy.</p><p>Breast cancer is a disease with a long natural history. Many of the women in these trials have now been followed up for 20 years and therefore they provide information about the long-term benefits of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy techniques have improved in the past few decades and so the proportional benefits of radiotherapy are likely to be larger than in these trials. However, the absolute risks of breast cancer recurrence and mortality have reduced in many countries because of advances in detection and treatment of breast cancer, so the absolute benefits from postmastectomy radiotherapy today are likely to be smaller than those reported here.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Goldhirsch</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Winer</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name><name><surname>Coates</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Panel members.
