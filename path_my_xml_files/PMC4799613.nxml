Bacteria are considered to be the primary etiological factor. The goal of periodontal therapy is to arrest the inflammatory disease process by eliminating the microbial etiology and contributing risk factors for periodontitis, preserving the dentition in a state of health, comfort, and function with appropriate esthetics and preventing recurrence of periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Treatment protocol aims at the mechanical removal of the sub gingival biofilm, and the establishment of a local environment and microflora compatible with periodontal health. The gold standard for treating periodontal disease is mechanical scaling and root planing (SRP) which forms integral components of the periodontal treatment plan.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Carried out efficiently, SRP reduces pocket depth, bleeding on probing, gingival inflammation, and stabilize attachment levels. SRP is performed using hand instruments or sonic devices or a combination of both. In either case, patients may experience little pain associated with the instrumentation that requires the use of some kind of local anesthesia. Common procedures for pain management in periodontics are infiltration anesthesia or topical anesthesia. Disadvantages of infiltration anesthesia include needle phobia, pain associated with injections, or the long, and inconvenient duration of soft-tissue anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Alternative to infiltration anesthesia, topical anesthetics has been developed to provide patients with needle free anesthesia. Topical anesthetics used are in the form of jellies, sprays, ointments, and patches. Different techniques such as transmucosal patch containing 10% or 20% lidocaine are been used to produce anesthesia for nonsurgical periodontal therapy. Disadvantages include costs and adherence of patch in posterior regions.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hence for effective SRP, anesthetics must be characterized by convenient and painless administration, fast onset, adequate, and profound anesthesia. An intra-pocket anesthesia gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) containing lidocaine (2.5%) and prilocaine (2.5%) with thermosetting agent proved to be practicable alternative to control intra-operative pain during mechanical SRP.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] At room temperature, intra-pocket anesthetic (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) is low-viscosity fluid, whereas at body temperature it transforms into an elastic gel. In the periodontal pocket, it remains at the application site, thereby limiting the risk of its spreading to adjacent areas. The scales used to measure pain in this study were verbal rating scale (VRS) and numerical rating scale (NRS). The NRS is a single 11-point numeric scale in which respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. With 0 representing &#x02014; &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; and 10 representing &#x02014; extreme pain, e.g., &#x0201c;pain as bad as you can imagine&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of an intra-pocket anesthetic gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) in the reduction of pain during SRP in individuals with untreated periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-masked, split-mouth clinical trial comparing the action of anesthetic gel and placebo in a group of untreated periodontal patients.

This visit comprised of routine dental history (including presenting complaint, medical history, dental history) and examination (including extra-oral and intra-oral examinations, examination of dental hard tissues, and when indicated radiographic tests and vitality testing. Of the 42 patients examined, 30 met the entry requirements, and agreed to participate in the study and were subsequently invited to a second &#x0201c;test visit.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Test visit</title><p>This study was performed in a split-mouth manner, incorporating left and right sides. One side of the mouth would receive the &#x0201c;test gel&#x0201d; (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) and the other side would receive placebo gel. At baseline, every patient underwent a periodontal examination including probing pocket depth (PPD) recorded by Williams Graduated Probe at six sites per tooth. Before the treatment was started, the patients were educated on the usage of VRSs (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = slightly moderate, 3 = moderate, 4 = strong) and NRS (patient was asked to choose a score between 0 and 10 which represents the pain). No interim descriptors were used. A third party, not participating in the study randomized the side of the mouth to receive either the test or placebo gel. Gels were placed in 2 ml graduated syringes with plastic needle applicator. They were then placed in envelopes with &#x0201c;RIGHT&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;LEFT&#x0201d; written on the envelope with an identifier number. Neither the patients nor the investigator doing SRP was aware of which gel was in which envelope until the treatment was completed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anesthetic procedure</title><p>Examiner A began with the upper right side, opening the first envelope marked RIGHT. The quadrant was dried and isolated with cotton rolls. 2 ml of prefilled syringe with a blunt-tip plastic applicator was used to apply the test gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) or placebo subgingivally at sites in the chosen quadrant with probing depths &#x02265;5 mm on the facial and lingual aspect starting from the most posterior tooth of the selected quadrant and continuing anteriorly [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The gel was left undisturbed in the pocket for a period of 30 s after application. After 30 s, the pockets were irrigated with water, and thereafter, SRP procedure was initiated by Investigator B. If there was an interruption due to pain, re-application of the gel was done into the pockets of the same tooth and debridement resumed 30 s later. In case, after second application patient reported of pain then infiltration anesthesia was given and the subject was excluded from the study. Investigator A then proceeded to the lower right quadrant and the same procedure was repeated with the same gel as for the upper right quadrant. After commencement of SRP in the right quadrant, pain assessment was done within 5 min after treatment using NRS and VRS. The same procedure was carried in an identical manner with the second envelope marked &#x0201c;LEFT.&#x0201d; The patient then completed a second NRS and VRS corresponding to SRP on the left side of the mouth. By compiling results in this manner, each patient was effectively acting as their own control, producing two separate pain scores for SRP on both the right and left sides of their mouth. After completion of SRP, the masking of which gel (either test or placebo) was in which envelope was lifted, and the envelope numbers were matched. The identifier number changed with every patient.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Area isolated and gel applied</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-192-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics and data analyses were performed using statistical software.

The results demonstrated highly significant reduction in patient's perception of pain for the side of the mouth having the test gel as compared to the side of the mouth having the placebo, reported through NRS and VRS scoring <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001. The primary means of determining gel efficacy was the measurement of treatment-associated pain. The scales used were NRS and VRS. In NRS respondent is asked to indicate the numeric value on the segmented scale that best describes their pain intensity. Scores range from 0 to 10. Higher scores indicate greater pain intensity.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Advantages include easy using and scoring, requires minimal language translation, hence, can used across the globe. Often, periodontal therapy is associated with high levels of anxiety. Erten <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] indicated that periodontal therapy is associated with low levels of discomfort, but some patients become anxious and avoid treatment. Hence, to overcome the anxiety and pain during SRP and to provide patients with needle free treatment topical anesthetics may be used instead of injected anesthetics. The disadvantages of topical anesthesia for SRP are limited efficacy due to inadequate depth of penetration, too short duration of action, difficulties of administration, uncontrolled spreading, and undesirable taste,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which limits the usage of topical agents. Hence, to overcome this disadvantage and to maximize the effect many topical agents have been introduced. Evaluate the efficacy local anesthetic (EMLA) cream 5% is a 1:1 oil/water emulsion of a eutectic mixture of lidocaine (2.5%) and prilocaine (2.5%) bases.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] EMLA has been shown to reduce pain during probing,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] hand scaling,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] ultrasonic scaling,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] rubber dam clamp application,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and palatal injection.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Chung <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to EMLA cream on pain perception during scaling. Forty subjects with chronic gingivitis or periodontitis were enrolled, which was a randomized, split-mouth, controlled, masked clinical trial, the mean VAS, and VRS; when EMLA cream was applied (18.39 &#x000b1; 14.47 mm and 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.69) was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 for VAS and VRS) compared to when EMLA cream was not used (26.54 &#x000b1; 16.46 mm and 1.30 &#x000b1; 0.75). Hence, concluding significant reduction of pain is achieved by using EMLA cream and ultrasonic scaler.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, EMLA is not registered for intra-oral use. Hence, a new thermosetting topical intra-pocket anesthetic gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) has been developed for the intra-oral application. Introduced in 2004, in the United States, and in 2010, in Canada, it is a microemulsion of 25 mg/g lidocaine and 25 mg/g prilocaine gel. It is a colorless liquid, containing hydrochloric acid, purified water along with the thermosetting agent. The addition of thermosetting agent causes the solution to change from the liquid state at room temperature to gel form at the temperature of the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It is available in cartridge form. One cartridge contains 1.7 g of anesthetic gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals), which is usually sufficient for one quadrant of the dentition. The maximum recommended a dose of anesthetic gel at one treatment session is five cartridges, that is, 8.5 g gel containing 212.5 mg lidocaine base and 212.5 mg prilocaine base. Efficacy and safety of the intra-pocket anesthesia gel (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) containing lidocaine and prilocaine (25 mg G1 each) are well-documented.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Friskopp and Huledal proved a large safety margin with respect to systemic effects following the application of the anesthesia gel in periodontal pockets.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Friskopp <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] showed that the anesthetic gel provided onset of anesthesia within approximately 30 s when placed into periodontal pockets and duration of anesthesia was approximately 20 min. Three previous multicenter, double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials studied the efficacy of the anesthetic gel for purposes of SRP procedures.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The three studies included 337 individuals at 18 study centers. This studies used Hodges-Lehmann point estimate of treatment differences and found that the results favor the anesthetic gel by reducing VAS pain scores by magnitudes of 8,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] 4,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and 10,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The present study was carried out in Sullia, located at a distance of 89 km from Mangalore, Karnataka, India with maximum average temperature range of 37&#x000b0;C to minimum of 14&#x000b0;C. India is a hot tropical country, except the northern states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir in the north, and Sikkim in the northeastern hills, which have a cooler, more continental influenced climate. Canada is often associated with cold weather and snow. The intra-pocket anesthetic (Oraqix, Dentsply Pharmaceuticals) became gel within the cartridge in &#x0003c;10 min as soon as it came in contact with the external environment and had to be refrigerated again for it to become liquid again. Limitation of the present study included smaller sample size and posttreatment parameters such as PPD for both test side and placebo were not assessed. The scales used for measuring pain were of a subjective type, and a more objective method should be used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The anesthetic gel, 25 mg/lidocaine plus 25 mg/g prilocaine with thermosetting agents provides a statistically significant reduction in pain on SRP in patients with untreated periodontitis. It suggests that the gel may be alternative with patients who associate SRP to be painful and avoid dental treatment. Such a product is not available in the Indian market; hence, pharmaceutical companies should develop a product similar to it with modification of temperature changes. Additional further studies need to be conducted to determine the efficiency of the gel with larger sample size.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Page</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Kornman</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The pathogenesis of human periodontitis: An introduction</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>1997</year><volume>14</volume><fpage>9</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9567963</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Parameter on chronic periodontitis with slight to moderate loss of periodontal support.
