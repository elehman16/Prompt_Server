A single surgeon performed all surgeries. Intraoperative and post-operative pain scores were evaluated on a visual analog scale.

Advances in phaco machines, fluidics and viscoelastics have made cataract surgery faster, less traumatic with greater technical control for the surgeon. The developments of self-sealing clear corneal incision and topical anesthesia have allowed faster functional recovery post-operatively. Topical anesthesia is the safe and effective alternative to peribulbar and retrobulbar anesthesia for phacoemulsification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></p><p>Lidocaine 4%, bupivacaine 0.5%, benoxinate 0.4%, and proparacaine 0.5%H drops have been evaluated as topical anesthetic agents during cataract surgery. However, frequent instillation of these drops pre-operatively can lead to corneal clouding intraoperatively. Preservative free intracameral xylocaine can be delivered as a supplement to topical anesthesia to minimize intraoperative patient discomfort. However, a study has shown intracameral administration of xylocaine has no clinically useful role during phacoemulsification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> In addition, some reports have cautioned cataract surgeons regarding the potential corneal endothelial injury of anesthetic agents injected into the eye.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></p><p>The present study prospectively compared to the effectiveness of instilling a single drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride during the phacoemulsification to intracameral 0.5% preservative free xylocaine as a supplement to topical proparacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval of the study was obtained from the ethical committee of the hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. This prospective, randomized, and comparative study comprised 295 patients scheduled for phacoemulsification. Patients with operable cataracts of various grades were included in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref> The exclusion criteria were allergy to the topical anesthetics, deafness, nystagmus, barrier to the communication, extreme anxiety, neurological disorders, monocular patients, complicated and subluxated cataracts, non-dilating pupil and patients unable to understand a visual analog scale (VAS).</p><p>Pre-operatively, all patients had routine ophthalmic evaluation. Patients were randomized into two groups based on anesthetic agents they were to receive: the proparacaine group was comprised of the patients who received a single drop of proparacaine hydrochloride (Paracain, Sunways Pvt. Ltd., India), placed in the lower fornix, 2 min before the start of the surgery; the xylocaine group was comprised of patients who received a single drop of proparacaine 2 min before the surgery and supplemented with intracameral 0.5% preservative free xylocaine (xylocaine, Astra Zeneea Ltd., India). Pre-operatively, the pupils were dilated with topical phenylephrine 2.5% and topical tropicamide 0.8% (Appamide, Appasamy Ocular Devices, Puducherry, India). No non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were used pre-operatively. No patients received pre-operative or intraoperative sedation.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Surgical technique</title><p>All surgeries were performed by one surgeon. No superior rectus suture was taken. A universal eye speculum was used in all cases. Patients were instructed to fixate on the microscope light during surgery. A side port incision was created on the appropriate side to stabilize the globe. A 3.2 mm clear corneal temporal incision was performed through, which viscoelastic (2% Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, Appavisc, Appasamy Ocular Devices, Puducherry, India) was injected. A 5.5 mm wide capsulorhexis was created using utrata forceps. Complete cortical cleaving hydrodissection was performed by injecting a balanced salt solution between the lens capsule and the cortex with a 27-gauge cannula. The nucleus was divided using a direct chop technique. Parameters were vacuum 350 cc, flow rate 33 cc, and power 40-70 based on the grade of the nucleus in a pulse mode (Swisstech, Oertli phacoemulsification system, Switzerland). Cortical cleanup was performed with the irrigation/aspiration probe. A single piece hydrophobic or hydrophilic intraocular lens based on the patient choice was implanted in the bag. The viscoelastic material was removed from the capsular bag and from the anterior chamber. Stromal hydration of the side port and main incision was performed. No sutures were required in any case.</p><p>The duration of the surgery was recorded by the accompanying surgeon. Time of surgery (duration) was recorded from the creation of the side port incision to the completion of stromal hydration.</p><p>No patients received intracameral miotics intraoperatively or subconjunctival injection at the completion of the surgery. After completion of surgery, patients were taken to the recovery room. A standard 10-point VAS was used to assess intraoperative and post-operative pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> Post-operative pains were assessed 30 min after the completion of the surgery. A trained para-ophthalmic technician performed the pain grading procedure. The surgeon was not presented during the assessment of the pain score. The patient was also asked whether they would be going for similar anesthetic technique for the fellow eye cataract surgery.</p><p>The surgeon's subjective impression of corneal haze (grade 0 = clear, 1 = mild haze, 2 = moderate haze, 3 = severe haze), discomfort during the surgery (grade 0 = no pain, 1 = mild pain, 2 = moderate pain, 3 = severe pain), complications and supplemental anesthesia were recorded.</p><p>The anesthetist also noted vital parameters such as blood pressure, pulse rate, and oxygen saturation intraoperatively and the need for supplemental intravenous sedation.</p><p>Comparison of parameters was performed with the Chi-square test. A <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The study included 295 eyes of 295 patients.

Pain experience and surgeon comfort was comparable in both groups. The ease of application, lack of toxicity, and sufficient effect to complete the surgery makes it an efficient alternative in uncomplicated clear corneal phacoemulsification. However, it is prudent to individualize the anesthetic technique according to the patient and surgeon need.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank Dr. Niraj Prasad, anesthetist, Dr. Anumeha Jindal, assistant surgeon, for their kind help during the study period.
