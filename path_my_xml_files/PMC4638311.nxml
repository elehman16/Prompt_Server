Combined antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the standard of care in HIV-infected patients, which enables them to live longer. However, with this regimen, patients will have to stay on medication for the rest of their life. In addition, antiretroviral drugs can have dangerous side effects in both long and short terms. The recommendation of ART guideline comprises two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and one nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor if the patient is intolerant to NNRTI. Efavirenz (EFV)-based regimen is recommended as the first-line regimen by many guidelines, eg, World Health Organization,<xref rid="b1-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> European AIDS Clinical Society,<xref rid="b2-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and Thai national guidelines.<xref rid="b3-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>EFV has many neuropsychiatric adverse side effects, such as light-headedness, dizziness, difficulty sleeping, and vivid and/or disturbing dreams.<xref rid="b4-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b6-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These side effects occurred in approximately 50% of all patients and were relevant to the drug level in plasma.<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The normal requirement level of EFV is 1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;g/mL, and the neuropsychiatric effects could be increasingly found if the EFV level was more than 4 &#x000b5;g/mL.<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Nevertheless, the EFV level also had an impact on the success of the treatment. If the EFV level was in the therapeutic level, the more the number of patients with HIV RNA falling to undetectable levels.<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b10-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>For the past few years, there have been many studies on pharmacogenetics and pharmacodynamics associated with therapeutic drug monitoring. The lower metabolizer enzymes and protein transporters seem to influence the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral drugs, ultimately determining its efficacy and toxicity.<xref rid="b11-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> They are widely used in pharmacogenetics and antiretroviral drugs, eg, <italic>HLA-B*5701</italic> with abacavir<xref rid="b12-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and cytochrome P450 (<italic>CYP</italic>) <italic>2B6</italic> with nevirapine (NVP) and EFV.<xref rid="b13-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> EFV needs hepatic <italic>CYP2B6</italic> as the key component to metabolize and eliminate itself from the body. Genetic polymorphisms in <italic>CYP2B6</italic>, resulting from a nucleotide substitution at some positions, are associated with lower rate of EFV metabolism and lead to high exposure as well as a higher risk of neuropsychiatric adverse event,<xref rid="b9-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b13-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b15-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> especially the homomutant variant: <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic>.<xref rid="b16-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These correlations led to suggestions to reduce the EFV dosage. The <italic>CYP2B6*6</italic> carriers in the Japanese population who received EFV 600 mg had a very high EFV concentration in plasma, and EFV was reduced from 600 to 200 mg to remain in normal therapeutic range and minimize adverse neuropsychological events.<xref rid="b19-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In Thailand, the prevalence of <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> was approximately 8%.<xref rid="b18-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Patients with <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> had very high plasma level of EFV (ranges: 5.85&#x02013;13.47 &#x000b5;g/mL).<xref rid="b14-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b19-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To our knowledge, there was no prospective trial comparing efficacy and safety of EFV dosage adjustment according to <italic>CYP2B6</italic>. Thus, we aimed at comparing the proportion of patients who had undetectable HIV RNA at 24 weeks after ART initiation among patients who received <italic>CYP2B6</italic>-guided EFV dose and who did not. The adverse neuropsychiatric events and EFV plasma concentration were evaluated. The prevalence of <italic>CYP2B6</italic> and effectiveness of performing <italic>CYP2B6</italic> screening were other aims to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study population</title><p>This study was a 24-week prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients were recruited from two hospitals in Thailand: Ramathibodi Hospital and Maharat Nakhon Ratchasima Hospital, between April 2013 and April 2014. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Clearance Committee on Human Rights Related Research Involving Human Subjects, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University on May 22, 2013 (number MURA 2013/318). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Eligible patients at screening were HIV-infected adults older than 18 years with no previous exposure to ART. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or breast-feeding; were receiving drug(s) that might have an interaction with EFV, eg, rifampicin, fluconazole, ergot alkaloid, midazolam, triazolam, ritonavir, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbitone, or St John&#x02019;s Wort; were having active opportunistic infection, eg, tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, or penicillosis; and had hepatic dysfunction as indicated by alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase more than 5&#x02013;10 times of the upper limit of normal, alkaline phosphatase more than 5&#x02013;10 times of the upper limit of normal, or total bilirubin more than 2.5&#x02013;5 times of the upper limit of normal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>A computer-generated randomization sequence with a block of six was created by the statistician who was not involved in the study. All eligible patients received tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg plus lamivudine (3TC) 300 mg once daily. Patients were randomly assigned either to undergo <italic>CYP2B6</italic> screening study before ART initiation in the <italic>CYP2B6</italic>-guided group or to promptly initiate ART regardless of <italic>CYP2B6</italic> results in the controlled group. If <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> was found in <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic>, the patients would be initiated on a low dose of 400 mg of EFV (two tablets of 200 mg). The others would be initiated on a standard dose of 600 mg of EFV (one tablet of 600 mg). The patients and doctors in the control group did not know their <italic>CYP2B6</italic> genotype and the EFV concentration in plasma.</p><p>Clinic visits were scheduled for physical examination, adverse event reporting, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, HIV RNA, and <italic>CYP2B6</italic> at week 0. Telephone visits were scheduled at week 1 for adverse event reporting. Physical examination, adverse event reporting, biochemistry, hematology, and EFV plasma concentration were performed at week 4, 12, and 24. CD4 cell count and HIV RNA were added to schedule at week 12 and 24. Plasma HIV RNA was also measured at one reference laboratory with the Abbott m2000 real-time HIV-1 test (lower limit of detection is 40 copies/mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic DNA extraction</title><p>Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes. DNA was isolated using the MagNA Pure automated extraction system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA), which uses magnetic-bead technology with a lysis buffer and proteinase K. Nucleic acids bind to the surface of the magnetic glass particles. Cellular debris was removed by several washing steps and the purified nucleic acids were eluted. From the 1 mL input volume of EDTA-whole blood, 200 &#x000b5;L output volume of extracted genomic DNA product was obtained. The quality of genomic DNA was assessed by using Nano Drop ND-1000. Genomic DNA was detected by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Purity of the sample was evaluated by calculating the optical density (OD) ratio, 260/280 nm. The recommended purified genomic DNA template for this study was 20 ng, and the OD ratio greater than 1.7. All DNA was aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C before analysis.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>CYP2B6</italic> genotyping</title><p>All 10 mL EDTA blood samples were submitted to the laboratory of Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, for <italic>CYP2B6</italic> genotype and EFV plasma concentration level analysis. Predesigned TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) were used to genotype the predesigned TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) and were also used to genotype the <italic>CYP2B6</italic>c.516G&#x0003e;T (assay ID C__7817765_60), c.64C&#x0003e;T (assay ID C__2818162_20), c.499C&#x0003e;G (assay ID C__2752377_10), c.1375A&#x0003e;G (assay ID C__2741754_10), c.1459C&#x0003e;T (assay ID C__30634242_40), g.3003T&#x0003e;C (assay ID C__2818167_10), and g.21563C&#x0003e;T (assay ID C__22275631_10). The <italic>CYP2B6</italic> c.785A&#x0003e;G was performed by custom TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems). The sequences of primers and probes were as follows: <italic>CYP2B6</italic> c.785A&#x0003e;G, TGGAGAAGCACCGTGAAACC (forward), TGGAGCAGGTAGGTGTCGAT (reverse), VIC-CCCCCAAGGACCTC-MGB (wild-type), FAM-CCCCAGGGACCTC-MGB (mutant).</p><p>For single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis, this SNP was genotyped using allele-specific fluorogenic 5&#x02032; nuclease chain reaction assay with predesigned primers and TaqMan MGB probes (TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay; Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific forward and reverse primers to amplify the polymorphic sequence of interest used two TaqMan MGB probes: one probe was labeled with VIC dye and detected the allele 1 sequence, and the second probe was labeled with FAM dye and detected the allele 2 sequences. <italic>CYP2B6</italic> haplotype determination was interpreted using the Human Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Allele Nomenclature Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm">http://www.cypalleles.ki.se/cyp2b6.htm</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Measurement of EFV plasma concentrations</title><p>Fasting plasma EFV level at 12 hours after dosing was measured using a validated high-performance liquid chromatopraphy assay at 4, 12, and 24 weeks of ART initiation.

Sample pretreatment involved protein precipitation with acetonitrile (360 &#x000b5;L), and followed centrifugation, the sample supernatant was injected into the HPLC machine.</p><p>Analysis was performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC machine with an Omnispher C18 (150&#x000d7;4.6 mm ID/particle size 5 &#x000b5;m) analytical column (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA), a Chromquard RP guard column, and a mobile phase consisting of 10 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 3.1 acetonitrile (50:50, v/v). The retention time for EFV was 5.1 minutes. The peak of this compound was well resolved and free of interference from endogenous compounds in the plasma. The lower limit of quantification of EFV is 0.2 mg/L. The detection limit was defined as a signal-to-noise ratio of 3:1. The calibration standards for plasma samples were linear in the range of 0.2&#x02013;20 mg/L. Low-, medium-, and high-level QC samples were prepared at 0.4, 1.5, and 10 mg/L, respectively. The intra- and interday precision was within 0.0758% and 0.0091%, respectively.

Seventy percent had asymptomatic HIV infection (CDC category A), 8.3% had symptomatic HIV infection (CDC category B), and 21.7% had AIDS-defining illness (CDC category C). The common AIDS-defining illnesses were <italic>Pneumocystis jerovecii</italic> pneumonia (12.5%), followed by tuberculosis (8.3%) and cervical cancer (8.3%). Median (IQR) CD4 cell count at ART initiation was 252 (108&#x02013;396) cells/mL and median (IQR) plasma HIV RNA in log<sub>10</sub> was 4.66 (3.84&#x02013;5.48) copies/mL.</p><p>There was no statistically significant difference in baseline characteristics among the two groups.

HIV RNA was undetectable at 24 weeks in all patients who completed follow-up.</p><p>Now, the recommended range of plasma EFV concentration at 12 hours after dosing is proposed to be 1&#x02013;4 &#x000b5;g/mL.<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b22-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b24-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The subtherapeutic EFV plasma concentrations can lead to the development of viral resistance against EFV.<xref rid="b25-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This is because EFV has a low genetic barrier to viral drug resistance, resulting in only a single mutation, most frequently K103N.<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b23-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Treatment failure has been found to be more frequent in patients with low EFV trough level compared to those with a high level (&#x0003e;1.1 &#x000b5;g/mL).<xref rid="b26-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> During follow-up, we also found that five patients had EFV concentration less than 1 &#x000b5;g/mL (range: 0.691&#x02013;0.971 &#x000b5;g/mL). Three patients had subtherapeutic level at week 12 and two patients at week 4 and 12. However, all patients had normal requirement for plasma EFV concentration at week 24. Seventeen patients were able to achieve undetectable HIV RNA in their plasma at 24 weeks after ART initiation.</p><p>The patient with <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> in this study had a normal requirement concentration while receiving 400 mg of EFV and was also able to achieve the undetectable HIV RNA levels. As in the previous study,<xref rid="b19-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the plasma concentrations of EFV were therapeutically adequate in all the treated <italic>*6/*6</italic> and <italic>*6/*26</italic> carriers at the 400 mg dose.</p><p>The higher EFV concentration increased incidence of EFV-associated neuropsychological toxicity,<xref rid="b5-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b18-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b20-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> especially <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6.</italic> In our study, we found that almost all patients had dizziness symptom regardless of the mutation of <italic>CYP2B6</italic>. Other polymorphisms might also have an influence on EFV concentration, eg, <italic>CYP2B6</italic>T18492C.<xref rid="b27-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Pharmacogenetics and pharmacokinetics combined with therapeutic drug monitoring should be used to guide EFV dosages.<xref rid="b29-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Thus, CYP2B6 genotyping should be introduced in routine clinical practice because it would help the patients to avoid or decrease the adverse neuropsychiatric events after the initiation of EFV-based antiretroviral regimen. In this study, one patient who had <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> and adjusted EFV dose did not have any adverse events. Furthermore, there was a new concept from the ENCORE1 study.<xref rid="b31-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It showed that a reduced dose of 400 mg EFV is noninferior to the standard dose of 600 mg in ART-na&#x000ef;ve adults with HIV-1 infection. Adverse events related to the study drug were more frequent with 600 mg EFV than with 400 mg. Nevertheless, body weight was a factor because the plasma EFV concentrations persistently decreased at 0.9 mg/L for every 10 kg of increased body weight.<xref rid="b28-pgpm-8-155" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>There were a few limitations in this study. First, the number of patients was too small to generalize the results. Second, we found low prevalence of <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> in this study, and only one patient received EFV dosage adjustment. Third, we studied only in Thais, which may not be representative of the general information in other ethnic groups. Last, laboratory costs, eg, HIV RNA, <italic>CYP2B6</italic> genotype, and EFV concentration (US$50&#x02013;US$60 per test), were quite expensive compared to general national income and government health insurance. It should therefore be considered individually for every person.</p><p>In conclusion, a trend toward association of the <italic>CYP2B6</italic> polymorphism and plasma EFV concentrations in this study was demonstrated. Reduced EFV dose should be considered in <italic>CYP2B6 *6/*6</italic> carrier so as to help the patient not to experience adverse neuropsychological events. The patients could achieve the therapeutic EFV level and undetectable HIV RNA after initiation of ART. Pharmacogenetics and therapeutic drug monitoring might play an important role in patients to help them avoid severe adverse events. Screening <italic>CYP2B6</italic> in HIV-infected Thai patients should be considered individually because of the low prevalence of this mutation and the accessibility of this test to the general public.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by research grant from the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University and New Researchers Grant (MRG 5480136), The Mahidol University (MU)/the Thailand Research Fund and Office of the Higher Education Commission, and the Thailand Research Fund (TRF).
