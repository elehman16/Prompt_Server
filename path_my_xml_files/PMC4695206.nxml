siRNA drug against KRAS(G12D) along four months. This novel siRNA based drug was studied, in combination with chemotherapy, as targeted therapy for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer (LAPC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An open-label Phase 1/2a study in the first-line setting of patients with non-operable LAPC was initiated. In this study patients were assigned to receive a single dose of <italic>siG12D-LODERs</italic>, in three escalating dose cohorts (0.025mg, 0.75mg and 3.0mg). Gemcitabine was given on a weekly basis, following the <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> insertion, until disease progression. The recommended dose was further examined with modified FOLFIRINOX. The follow up period was eight weeks and survival until death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifteen patients with LAPC were enrolled. Among the 15 treated patients, the most frequent adverse events observed were grade 1or 2 in severity (89%); five patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs). In 12 patients analyzed by CT scans, none showed tumor progression, the majority (10/12) demonstrated stable disease and two showed partial response. Decrease in tumor marker CA19-9 was observed in 70% (7/10) of patients. Median overall survival was 15.12 months; 18 month survival was 38.5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combination of <italic>siG12D-LODER&#x02122;</italic> and chemotherapy is well tolerated, safe and demonstrated a potential efficacy in patients with LAPC.

Until recently Gemcitabine was considered the main treatment option. Recent progress in the treatment of metastatic PDAC has been shown with the addition of nab-paclitaxel to Gemcitabine [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and the introduction of FOLFIRINOX (Leucovorin, Fluorouracil, Irinotecan and Oxaliplatin) [<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. FOLFIRINOX substantially improves overall survival (OS) compared to Gemcitabine, however, it has a high toxicity profile and hence only suitable for a subset of patients. About 80% to 85% of patients with pancreatic cancer have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, i.e. stage III (LAPC) or stage IV (metastatic), and are not candidates for surgical curative intervention. Several autopsy series demonstrated that 30% of patients presenting with stage III disease died without evidence of distant metastases [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Treatment options for LAPC include several chemotherapy regimens (Gemcitabine, Gemcitabine and Erlotinib, Gemcitabine and Nab-Paclitaxel, or FOLFIRINOX) with or without radiation. It is still unclear whether chemoradiation for LAPC patients is warranted. Chauffert et al studied initial chemoradiotherapy (intermittent Cisplatin and infusional 5-FU) followed by Gemcitabine <italic>vs</italic>. Gemcitabine alone in patients with LAPC and observed a median survival of 8.6 months for the chemoradiation arm <italic>vs</italic>. 13 months for chemotherapy alone [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Loehrer et al. showed that treatment of patients with Gemcitabine alone or with radiation led to survival of 9.2 and 11.1 months respectively [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Herman et al. demonstrated that treatment of LAPC patients with chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy with concurrent fluorouracil), with or without TNFerade, led to median survival of 10.0 months in both treatment arms. Eighteen month survival was 13.3% (standard of care (SOC)) <italic>vs</italic>. 18.2% (SOC+TNFerade) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Progression Free Survival (PFS) was 7.0 months (SOC) <italic>vs</italic>. 6.8 months (SOC+TNFerade) and 18 month PFS was 6.6% (SOC) <italic>vs</italic>. 8% (SOC+TNFerade) [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Blazer et al. reported that non-resectable FOLFIRINOX-treated patients showed median OS and PFS of 12.7 and 8 months respectively [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Epithelial carcinogenesis is typically associated with the accumulation of mutations and genetic lesions, leading to the activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Mutated KRAS was proposed to be a hallmark of pancreatic cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] since this protein is mutated in more than 90% of PDACs [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Mounting literature data suggest that the KRAS mutations may be early events in the molecular pathological cascade leading to PDAC [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The vast majority of KRAS mutations in adenocarcinoma of the human pancreas are gain-of-function mutations, in which most of these occur in codon 12. Among the codon 12 mutations the most abundant is substitution of the Glycine for Aspartate (G12D) [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In PDAC cancer cells are addicted to expression of the mutated KRAS [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Still, more than 30 years of research have not yielded a specific therapy directly targeting mutated KRAS. The challenges are attributed to the picomolar affinity of this oncogene for GTP/GDP [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and failure to target any relevant allosteric regulatory sites. Recently, the maturing field of mRNA targeting by RNA interference (RNAi) has proven to be a highly potent alternative compared to the more general protein inhibition approach. It was previously shown that suppression of KRAS expression by RNAi led to growth inhibition of PDAC cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and PDAC-originated tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s1_2"><title>RNAi-based anti-mutated KRAS treatment for patients with LAPC</title><p>To address the unmet need for an efficient non-toxic treatment for patients with LAPC, and to convert the potential of RNAi into an anti-cancer therapy, Silenseed Ltd. has developed the <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> (Local Drug EluteR). <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> presents a novel solution to the major challenges of oligonucleotide therapeutics and RNAi for a large number of diseases including solid tumors. Such challenges include delivery of RNAi-based drugs and achievement of prolonged activity at a tolerated dose at the target site. The <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> is a miniature biodegradable polymeric matrix that encompasses anti-KRASG12D siRNA (siG12D). <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> is designed to provide a slow and prolonged local drug release within the tumor over several months, while ensuring protection of the siRNA drug from degradation. It can be inserted and placed into pancreatic tumor using a standard endoscope ultrasound (EUS) biopsy procedure. Here, we present the use of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> as a new therapeutic modality targeting mutated KRAS in combination with the currently available treatments including Gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX.</p><p>Our treatment of LAPC with <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> is based on accumulated pre-clinical evidence [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The results of these studies proved that (a) <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> efficiently overcomes current siRNA delivery obstacles related to systemic delivery; (b) the LODER's pharmacokinetics (PK) enable dose reduction by orders of magnitudes and eliminates toxicity; (c) the strategy of local KRAS targeting by <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> can be effectively used to inhibit PDAC cell proliferation [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>On the basis of these promising pre-clinical results, a first in-human Phase 1/2a clinical study of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> in combination with chemotherapy was initiated for patients with locally advanced PDAC. The primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability as well as to define a recommended phase 2b dose (RP2D) of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic>. Secondary objectives included measuring the efficacy potential of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> (though limited by a single dosing design), the antitumor effects on the basis of tumor response, CA19-9 levels, Time To Metastasis (TTM), PFS and OS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>LODER<italic><sup>TM</sup></italic> characteristics</title><p><italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> is a miniature biodegradable matrix designed by Silenseed, allowing slow and prolonged local release of the encapsulated drug. <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> was developed to be inserted and placed into solid tumors using a standard biopsy procedure. <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> was designed to release anti-KRASG12D siRNA (siG12D) within the pancreatic tumor for four months. <italic>siG12D-</italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup> was shown to efficiently protect the encapsulated siRNA against enzymatic degradation, while releasing the drug within a tumor <italic>in vivo</italic> in mice (reference <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The selected <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> matrix components are all FDA Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) materials, and the active agent siG12D was found to be non-toxic in all doses <italic>in vivo</italic>. Serial histopathological examination demonstrated that the drug covers the entire tumor mass typically within a week (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Our data are consistent with previous evidence of uptake of naked siRNA within solid tumors [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Direct effects of KRAS expression inhibition on the mRNA and protein levels, as well as indirect effects of inhibition of tumor growth and induction of tumor cell death, were detected in the entire tumor mass (reference <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Tumor growth was slowed as demonstrated in diverse <italic>in vivo</italic> mice models (subcutaneous and orthotopic), following implantation of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and the mice survival rates were significantly improved [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-treated tumor tissue, apoptosis of tumor cells and tissue necrosis were found to be widespread after typically one week in the entire tumor (reference <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to local effects on the tumor, we have shown in preclinical studies that siG12D slows tumor cell migration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1C</xref>) and inhibits Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) (data not shown). Consistent with the above observations, we have found that mice treated with <italic>siG12D-LODERs</italic> did not develop metastases as compared with two thirds of untreated controls and <italic>empty-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic>-treated groups, which developed metastases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The siG12D dosage in humans was selected based on the <italic>in vivo</italic> results in mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 1A-1B</xref>). We have estimated a maximum dose of 3mg of siRNA above which RNAi saturation occurs.</p><p><italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> also affects the second most abundant KRAS mutation, G12V, which implies that the <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> efficacy is not restricted to the G12D mutation (data not shown). We further showed that siG12D provides additive benefit when used concomitantly with SOC chemotherapy, i.e. Gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Figure 2A-2B</xref>).</p><p>Systemically, the dose levels of the siG12D in the peripheral circulation are below detection levels, making measurements of (systemic) pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) impractical. However, the pharmacokinetics of siG12D drug in the tumor tissues can be assessed <italic>in vivo</italic>. We have studied PK and drug transport in a subcutaneous pancreatic tumor model. The amount of intercellular siG12D molecules that penetrate into cells was assessed by detection of antisense strand of the molecule in the treated tissue using absolute quantitative Real-Time PCR. siG12D molecules were detected at distances extended by typical velocity of 1mm/day until complete tumor coverage after a week. For example, in mouse subcutaneous model tumors of more than 1.7 cm in diameter were covered by siG12D molecule within a week (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and data not shown). The PK results after a month are similar to the results after 7 days (data not shown), confirming a steady state of the drug distribution from <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic>. These direct measurements of the drug transport to extended distances are in line with results of the drug effect on the entire tissue. For example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> presents tumor tissue necrosis detected in the entire tumor area one week after <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> implantation (in this example, the tumor is extended to about 1.7cm in diameter).</p><p>Shemi et al (in preparation, 2015) explores these results and their implications on drug transport in human solid tumors. They proposed a transport model which simulated drug delivery rates and demonstrated that drug delivery originating at the inner core of a tumor differs from systemic delivery. In systemic delivery drugs (or nanocarriers) need to cross the artery walls and penetrate into the inner tumor upstream, against the interstitial fluid pressure gradient. The transport of siRNA drug from the <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> surface into the entire tumor tissue was analysed and was explained by convection dominated transport (<italic>P&#x000e9;clet</italic> number &#x0003e; 1, where the <italic>P&#x000e9;clet</italic> number reflects the rate of convection of a flow to its rate of diffusion). The drug is distributed from the inner core outwards in the tortuous tissue with effective velocity of 1mm/day, and reaches the entire tumor mass in approximately one week.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A.</bold> Study design. <bold>B.</bold>

No MTD (Maximal Tolerated Dose) was observed in the study. All 15 patients reported a total of 125 AEs. 111 of reported AEs (89%) were grade 1 and 2, which were transient and resolved. The most common AEs (grade 1-2) were diarrhea and abdominal pain which were reported by seven patients (46.7%), nausea and fatigue were reported by six (40%) and five (33.3%) patients respectively. 13 grade 3 and one grade 4 severe AEs were reported by 10 (66.7%) subjects.

Three procedure-related AEs in two patients were grade 1-2 (38%). Only one AE (grade 3 cholangitis) was considered as definitely related to the study procedure, as it was observed one day after procedure. To note, the single grade 3 AE related to pancreatitis, which was reported as &#x02018;possibly related&#x02019; to the study procedure, seems to be unlikely related to procedure as it was identified 23 days after <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> implantation. In general, our experience both in animals [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and humans is that there are no signs of pancreatitis.

Mutant KRAS is a driving oncogene in the majority of human pancreatic cancer cases [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>We have met this challenge by developing a therapeutic platform for local and prolonged delivery of siRNA. Our report describes an efficient, clinically applicable siRNA delivery method that overcomes the major obstacles of toxicity and organ accessibility. Notably, our approach enabled the conversion of KRAS from a non-druggable to a potentially druggable cancer target.</p><p>The present study evaluated single administration of three escalating doses of siG12D together with standard of care chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced inoperable pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoints were to evaluate the safety and toxicity of siG12D in combination with chemotherapy. No DLTs were observed during the study, therefore no MTD could be determined, and the highest dose administered and well tolerated was 3mg. Most AEs were grade 1 and 2, transient, and not related to the study drug or to the study procedure. In the 3mg treatment group, the AEs were related to either the implantation procedure, or the chemotherapy treatment (FOLFIRINOX).</p><p>The results of the Phase 1/2a study demonstrated a median OS of 15.12 months, a median TTM of 8.25 months; 18 months OS was 38.5% and TTM 15.4%. Most patients had stable disease and two patients had demonstrated partial responses. Six to 8.5 months after <italic>LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> insertion, 60% of the patients of whom CT data is available achieved partial response, and 40% had stable disease. No dose response was observed between the dose of siG12D and OS or TTM. Of note, two patients from the high dose group are still alive (27 and 30 months).</p><p>In this study we present the affectivity of LODER<italic><sup>TM</sup></italic> for RNAi based treatment for solid tumors. Our strategy combines selection of cancer-driver target with prolonged delivery to cancer cells. The LODER<italic><sup>TM</sup></italic> platform is based on encompassing of siRNA within a miniature biodegradable polymeric matrix that protects and enables the release of the siRNA drug for an extended duration of time regionally within tumor tissue. The LODER<italic><sup>TM</sup></italic> is specifically designed to be inserted with existing EUS biopsy procedures. We showed the efficacy of siG12D drug, and that the innovative <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> delivery system is efficient, site-specific, and safe.</p><p>In summary, the concomitant administration of <italic>siG12D-LODER<sup>TM</sup></italic> and chemotherapy was safe and well tolerated. The prolonged clinical benefit warrants further evaluation of this agent in combination with chemotherapy. A multinational randomized Phase 2b clinical trial is currently in progress (NCT01676259).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>PATIENTS, MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The Phase 1/2a study (NCT01188785) was conducted at three medical centers in Israel, namely the Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel HaShomer, the Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center, Ein Kererm Jerusalem, and the Shaare Zedek Hospital, Jerusalem.
