During laparoscopy, the main trespasses to physiological hemostasis in an anesthetized patient include the patient's positioning, creation of pneumoperitoneum by the insufflating gas and extubation. These result in complex hemodynamic, pulmonary and metabolic effects on the blood flow, tissue perfusion, and pulmonary mechanics.</p><p>Various pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods have been used by the anesthesiologists and surgeons over the years to prevent or attenuate these adverse hemodynamic changes associated with pneumoperitoneum.

However, there is limited literature, comparing the intravenous and intramuscular routes of clonidine premedicant in laparoscopic surgery. Hence the present study was undertaken to evaluate the effects of clonidine premedication on the adverse hemodynamic changes that occur during laparoscopic cholecystectomy and also compare the efficacy of IV and IM clonidine premedication.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized, double-blind, comparative and prospective study. After approval from the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent, 80 adult patients in the age group of 20-60 yrs., of either sex and of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I or II, posted for elective cholecystectomy under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups using computer-generated randomization list.</p><p>Group I - Patients received injection Clonidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg in 100 ml normal saline as intravenous infusion, 15 minutes prior to anesthesia</p><p>Group II - Patients received injection Clonidine 2 &#x003bc;g/kg, intramuscularly, 60-90 minutes prior to anesthesia.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients with uncontrolled hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic reactive airway disease, aortic stenosis, left ventricular failure, AV conduction block, any rhythm other than sinus rhythm, patient's receiving Clonidine/Methyl Dopa/B-blocker/Benzodiazepines/MAO inhibitor, any drug dependence and allergy to Clonidine.</p><p>After 6 hours fasting and premedicating with Tab. Diazepam 5 mg on the night prior to surgery, patients were preloaded with 500 ml of lactated ringer's solution in the operation theater prior to induction of anesthesia. Patients assigned to group I received 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of inj. Clonidine in 100 ml of normal saline as intravenous infusion, 15 min prior to the scheduled surgery and those assigned to group II were given 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of inj. Clonidine, intramuscularly, 60-90 min before the scheduled time of surgery. The observer was blinded to the drug being received by the patient.</p><p>A standard anesthetic technique was followed for all the patients. Patients were induced with thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg IV and succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg/kg IV to facilitate tracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% oxygen in nitrous oxide, 0.5-1% isoflurane and injection vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg bolus. This was followed by 0.02 mg/kg for maintenance of muscle relaxation.</p><p>Controlled mechanical ventilation with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg and ventilatory frequency of 14 breaths/min was done to maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) at 35-45 mmHg and any increase was adjusted with increase in respiratory rate and/or ventilation accordingly.</p><p>Pneumoperitoneum was created by insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> and operation table was tilted to about 15 degrees reverse trendelenburg position. Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was maintained between 12-15 mmHg throughout surgical procedure. At the end of the surgery, residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV after return of protective reflexes.</p><p>Intraoperative monitoring included heart rate (HR), continuous electrocardiography, noninvasive systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), and EtCO<sub>2</sub>. The hemodynamic parameters were recorded at the baseline (before premedication), prior to induction, 1 min after intubation, before insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub>, after insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub> at 1,5,10,20,30,45,60 min, after release of CO<sub>2</sub>, at 1 and 10 minutes after extubation. Patients were also observed for drowsiness, dry mouth, skin rashes, nausea and vomiting.</p><p>All the episodes of circulatory derangements were recorded. Hypertension (defined as SBP &#x0003e;170 mmHg) was treated with isoflurane (0.20% increments) at 2-minute intervals up to 2% if required. Tachycardia (defined as heart rate &#x0003e;90 beats/min) was treated with bolus dose of fentanyl 25 mcg. Hypotension (defined as SBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg) was treated by reducing the concentration of isoflurane and 250 ml bolus dose of lactated Ringer's solution over 5 minutes followed by ephedrine 6 mg, if the patient was unresponsive. Bradycardia (defined as heart rate &#x0003c;50 beats/min associated with hypotension) was treated with atropine 0.6 mg and repeated once if necessary.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data collected was tested for normalcy.

The transient acute hemodynamic response which usually occurs at laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation is also seen during insertion of the Veress needle, trocar and during the period of the pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgical procedures. The sympathetic effects associated with insufflation of CO<sub>2</sub>, as well as the shifts in intravascular volume resulting from the Trendelenburg position, can lead to hemodynamic perturbations during surgery. Various studies done over the years have proved these detrimental effects occurring during pneumoperitoneum in the intraoperative period. Various pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions have been used to re-establish the baseline hemodynamic parameters to allow for safe performance of laparoscopy and clonidine is one of them.</p><p>The number of females who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy was more when compared to the males in both the groups, this was in consensus with the well established fact that cholecystitis is more common in females and similar to study results of Das M <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Dose selection is in consensus with previous studies by Tripathi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] We chose to administer IM clonidine 60-90 min prior to induction and IV clonidine 15 min prior to induction. In view of the fact that, clonidine has a half-life of 8-12 hrs with peak effect achieved in 1-1.5 hrs after IM administration and 20 minutes after IV administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] IAP was maintained between 12 and 15 mmHg based upon left ventricle ejection fraction observations by Cunningham <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] and Dorsay <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>Our results show, that the hemodynamic parameters (HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP) were comparable to the baseline in both the groups, thereby, providing stable hemodynamics and protection against stress response triggered by pneumoperitoneum as well as by laryngoscopy and intubation in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP and MAP) were better maintained in the IV as compared to the IM route while the HR was comparable in both the groups. The incidence of hypertension, which required treatment, was significantly higher in the IM group but there were no episodes of hypotension in either group.</p><p>Laisalmi <italic>et al</italic>. found that clonidine (4.5 mcg/kg IM) blunted the deleterious hemodynamic stress response during laparoscopic surgery, had opioid sparing effect and maintained renal integrity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Joris <italic>et al</italic>. found that clonidine premedication (8 mcg/kg) IV improved intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic stability and smoothed the changes in HR, arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] A significant reduction was noted in the HR and MAP when compared to placebo. Reduction in the level of catecholamine and vasopressin following pneumoperitoneum by clonidine is considered responsible for such a change.</p><p>Overall, the SBP was maintained near the baseline SBP throughout the surgery with no wide fluctuations during laryngoscopy, surgical incision or pneumoperitoneum in both the groups. The highest SBP was noted after 5-10 min of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation and the lowest SBP was noted before CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in both the groups. This inference was corroborated to the study done by Aho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] who had studied the effect of IM clonidine on hemodynamic and plasma beta-endorphin responses in 90 patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy. The women in the study group received IM clonidine 3 (group I) or 4.5 (group II) mcg/kg, 45-60 minutes before induction of anesthesia while the control group (group III) recieved 2 ml IM saline. In all the groups, the MAP increased after the beginning of laparoscopy but the control group showed a greater increase in MAP than the study group. Thereafter, MAP decreased and was lower than the baseline value indicating that clonidine effectively prevents the maximal hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation and to gynecologic laparoscopy.</p><p>Ray <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] and Altan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] used IV 3 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine 15 min prior to induction, followed by continuous infusion and found significant incidence of bradycardia and hypotension. We used 2 &#x003bc;g/kg clonidine 15 min prior to induction and gave no intraoperative infusion; hence incidence of hypotension and bradycardia were insignificant. Overall, adverse effects noted with IV clonidine were less than with IM clonidine (<italic>P</italic>=0.02). Patients receiving IV clonidine had better control of hemodynamics than those receiving IM clonidine as IM group had significantly higher SBP, MAP and more patients with incidence of hypertension requiring treatment. Limitation of the study was that the sample size in our study was small but had significantly important results, and we suggest future studies to be undertaken with a larger population size.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of the study recommends routine use of clonidine premedication in ASA I or II patients undergoing
