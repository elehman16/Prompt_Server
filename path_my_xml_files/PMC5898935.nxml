Moreover, despite advances in medical treatment and revascularisation techniques, many CAD patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) experience major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) in the years following the intervention [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It has been suggested that OSA may contribute to the occurrence of MACCEs in revascularised CAD cohorts. In a 6-month follow-up study after PCI, MACCEs were observed in almost 24% of patients with concomitant OSA compared with 5% of those without OSA [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More recent data support an independent relationship between OSA and subsequent MACCEs in patients undergoing PCI [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], as well as in those treated with CABG [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is recommended as first-line treatment for OSA, and is associated with reduced daytime sleepiness and improved quality of life in symptomatic patients [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the majority of CAD patients with OSA do not experience daytime sleepiness and there is currently no clearly established rationale for treatment in such patients. CPAP has been shown to be beneficial in patients with CAD and OSA who are adherent to treatment [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. An observational, nonrandomised study suggested that patients who received CPAP treatment for OSA had reduced cardiac mortality at 5&#x02005;years after PCI compared with those who declined CPAP treatment [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Until recently, there was a lack of long-term prospective randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to address whether cardiac patients with nonsleepy OSA should be offered CPAP treatment to reduce MACCEs.</p><p>The RICCADSA (Randomised Intervention with CPAP in CAD and OSA) trial was the first RCT to investigate the impact of CPAP on MACCEs in revascularised CAD patients and nonsleepy OSA [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The results showed that routine CPAP prescription to CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA did not significantly reduce long-term adverse outcomes in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. A reduction in risk for adverse events was only observed after adjustment for baseline comorbidities and CPAP adherence [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a recent report from an RCT conducted in a much larger cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease, CPAP treatment plus usual care did not prevent cardiovascular events in the ITT population compared with usual care alone, despite a significant reduction in daytime sleepiness and improvement in health-related quality of life and mood [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>This analysis was conducted in the observational arm of the RICCADSA cohort and investigated the risk for MACCEs in CAD patients with sleepy OSA treated with CPAP compared with CAD patients who did not have OSA, as a randomisation of untreated sleepy OSA patients to control would not be ethically feasible. The impact of CPAP on daytime sleepiness in patients with sleepy OSA was also evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study subjects</title><p>The RICCADSA study methodology has been published previously [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and is detailed in the supplementary material. In summary, the study population consisted of adult patients with angiography-verified CAD who had undergone PCI or CABG in Skaraborg County, Sweden, in the previous 6&#x02005;months and had an apnoea&#x02013;hypopnoea index (AHI) of &#x0003c;5 or &#x02265;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during a sleep study. Patients with borderline OSA (AHI 5.0&#x02013;14.9&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and those with predominant (&#x0003e;50%) central apnoeas and hypopnoeas of Cheyne&#x02013;Stokes nature were excluded (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>). Patients were recruited between December 2005 and November 2010, and follow-up was completed in May 2013 with a predefined minimum follow-up of 2&#x02005;years. CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA (AHI &#x02265;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score &#x0003c;10) were included in the RCT arm [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Patients with a sleepy OSA phenotype (AHI &#x02265;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, ESS score &#x02265;10) who were receiving CPAP and CAD patients without OSA were included in the observational arm and followed prospectively (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Flow of patients through the study.

Based on the interim analysis of group assignment and the inclusion rate in February 2010, approximately 150 patients with sleepy OSA and 110 patients without OSA were expected to be included in the observational arm during the inclusion of the RCT arm. There was only one report [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with a cohort of 89 patients with revascularised CAD (51 OSA <italic>versus</italic> 38 no OSA) available at the time of the interim analysis; therefore, the expected number of patients included in the observational arm (n=260) was considered to be sufficient to address the research question.</p><p>An independent clinical event committee, unaware of patient identities and group allocation, reviewed all data obtained from hospital records and death certificates by the end of May 2013. Moreover, a random 10% selection of the database for baseline clinical data and follow-up procedures, including CPAP adherence and primary end-points, was monitored by a data monitoring board.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Methods</title><p>Full details of home sleep recordings (cardiorespiratory polygraphy (CRPG)) and in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) for the OSA group are provided in the supplementary material. Sleepy OSA patients were offered CPAP treatment and fitted with an automatic CPAP device (S8 or S9; ResMed, San Diego, CA, USA) by trained staff. Additional follow-up details, including adherence to CPAP treatment, are provided in the supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary end-point was the rate of MACCEs (repeat revascularisation, myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular mortality). Data were obtained from patients' medical records and, when necessary, from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register as well as the Swedish National Cause of Death Registry. As described previously, each event was evaluated separately and as part of the combined end-point [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For patients who experienced more than one event during the follow-up period, only the first event was included in the combined end-point. Secondary end-points included all-cause mortality and acute hospital admission for cardiovascular reasons. Cardiovascular diagnosis criteria defined by the independent clinical event committee are available in the supplementary material. The clinical indication for CPAP prescription to CAD patients with sleepy OSA was mainly to reduce daytime sleepiness and therefore ESS scores were evaluated separately.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics are given as mean and standard deviation or number (percentage). For baseline differences between the groups, the Chi-squared test and t-test were applied. Total sleep time, time spent in the supine position and AHI values from repeated sleep recordings (CRPG <italic>versus</italic> PSG) at the individual level, as well as changes in ESS score and body mass index (BMI) from baseline over time within the OSA group, were compared with the paired t-test. Pearson correlation analysis was performed to test the linear relationship between AHI values from CRPG <italic>versus</italic> PSG.</p><p>Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the impact of OSA on the primary end-point. Multivariate adjustment was made for age, sex, baseline AHI, BMI, current smoking, revascularisation type, former revascularisation, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lung disease and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline. A secondary analysis was performed after excluding patients who died or were lost to follow-up, or returned the CPAP device before the predefined minimum follow-up of 2&#x02005;years. For the on-treatment analysis of the OSA group, a time-dependent Cox model [<xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] was used to estimate the impact of CPAP usage (cut-off levels of 4&#x02005;h per night) on the primary end-point. As described previously in the RCT arm of the RICCADSA trial [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], this approach accounts for the time-varying character of the intervention because subject follow-up is split into multiple intervals according to the visit dates of the CPAP usage evaluation. Visits were planned after 1, 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months, and then annually until the end of the study. Incomplete usage data due to missed visits were replaced. One missing episode was replaced by the last observation, if the missing episode was followed by a visit. Two or more subsequent missing visits were replaced by 0. If the data from the first visit after 1&#x02005;month were missing, they were replaced by the usage data of the 3-month visit. For the on-treatment analysis of the OSA group, multivariate adjustment was made for CPAP nights/period, and age, sex, baseline AHI, BMI, current smoking, revascularisation type, former revascularisation, acute myocardial infarction, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, lung disease and LVEF at baseline.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-sided and p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 22.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) and Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study participants</title><p>A consecutive population of 1259 patients met the inclusion criteria for screening, of whom 662 (52.7%) agreed to participate in the sleep study (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>).

The results showed that the risk for MACCEs in revascularised CAD patients with sleepy OSA on CPAP was similar to that in CAD patients without OSA. In a multivariate analysis, age and former revascularisation were associated with an increased risk for MACCEs, while CABG appeared to be superior to PCI for reducing the risk for subsequent MACCEs in this cohort.</p><p>Many CAD patients experience MACCEs in the years after intervention, despite advances in medical treatment and revascularisation techniques [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and it has been suggested that OSA may play an important role in this context. Y<sc>umino</sc>
<italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] documented MACCEs after PCI in almost 24% of patients with concomitant OSA compared with 5% of those without OSA over a 6-month follow-up. More recently, a single-centre study of 340 consecutive CAD patients treated with a drug-eluting stent reported that the incidence of a major cardiac event (MACE; new revascularisation, myocardial infarction or cardiac mortality) over a median 2-year follow-up was 25% in patients with OSA (AHI &#x02265;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on CRPG) compared with 16% in those with AHI &#x0003c;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p=0.038) and that OSA was an independent predictor of MACEs, nearly doubling the risk [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In a much larger cohort of CAD patients undergoing PCI [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], L<sc>ee</sc>
<italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that 45% of 1311 patients had OSA (AHI &#x02265;15 events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on CRPG within 7&#x02005;days after revascularisation). In this multicentre study conducted in five countries, OSA was a predictor of MACCEs over a median follow-up of almost 2&#x02005;years, with an adjusted HR of 1.6 independent of age, sex, ethnicity, BMI, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Moreover, in a smaller study of 67 CAD patients undergoing CABG, MACCEs were observed in 35% of OSA patients (AHI &#x02265;15 events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> on CRPG) compared with 16% in patients with AHI &#x0003c;15&#x02005;events&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (p=0.02) during a mean follow-up of 4.5&#x02005;years and OSA was an independent predictor of incident MACCEs with a 4-fold risk increase in multivariate analysis [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Less is known about the impact of CPAP treatment on long-term cardiovascular outcomes in CAD patients with OSA. A retrospective analysis of 55 CAD patients with OSA over a mean follow-up of 7.3&#x02005;years showed a significantly lower occurrence of the composite end-point (cardiovascular death, acute coronary syndrome, hospitalisation for cardiac failure or need for revascularisation) in those compliant with prescribed CPAP therapy [<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In another retrospective study of 371 revascularised CAD patients with OSA, C<sc>assar</sc>
<italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] found that the cardiac death rate over 5&#x02005;years after PCI was significantly lower in 175 patients treated with CPAP (3% <italic>versus</italic> 10% in 196 untreated patients). In a later prospective follow-up study of 186 post-myocardial infarction patients, treated OSA patients had a lower risk for recurrent myocardial infarction (adjusted HR 0.16) and revascularisation (adjusted HR 0.15) than untreated OSA patients [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Until recently, there was a lack of prospective studies regarding the risk for incident MACCEs in revascularised CAD patients with symptomatic OSA patients on CPAP treatment, partly because it is unethical to randomise such patients to no treatment. However, because many cardiac patients do not report daytime symptoms, it has been argued that RCTs are crucial to address whether such patients should be offered CPAP treatment to reduce MACCEs [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In this context, the RICCADSA trial was the first RCT to investigate the impact of CPAP on MACCEs in revascularised CAD patients [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The study demonstrated that routine CPAP prescription to CAD patients with nonsleepy OSA did not significantly reduce long-term adverse outcomes in the ITT population, but that risk reduction was observed after adjustment for baseline comorbidities and CPAP adherence [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The most recent study investigating the secondary prevention potential of CPAP in patients with OSA is the SAVE (Sleep Apnoea Cardiovascular End-points) trial. In this large, multicentre, multinational cohort study, 2717 patients with moderate-to-severe OSA and established cardiovascular disease were assigned to CPAP treatment plus usual care (n=1359) or usual care (n=1358) [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. After a mean follow-up of 3.7&#x02005;years, the results showed that CPAP treatment did not prevent cardiovascular events in the ITT population despite a significant reduction in daytime sleepiness and improvement in health-related quality of life and mood [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Half of the SAVE study population had established CAD (of whom 77% had a history of revascularisation), and 20% of the study population had an ESS score between 11 and 15, indicating mild to moderate daytime sleepiness. In the CPAP group, mean device usage was 3.3&#x02005;h per night and 42% had good adherence (CPAP usage &#x02265;4&#x02005;h per night). The results of a secondary analysis suggested that patients who were adherent to CPAP had a lower risk for stroke (unadjusted HR 0.56; p=0.05). The SAVE study results indicate that getting nonsleepy patients to comply with CPAP is challenging, which is consistent with the results of the RCT arm of the RICCADSA cohort. Moreover, on-treatment analysis of the RCT arm of the RICCADSA cohort as well as propensity score-matched secondary analysis of the SAVE data suggest that CPAP adherence of at least 4&#x02005;h per night is required to achieve cardiovascular benefits. In the observational arm of the RICCADSA cohort, 24% of sleepy OSA patients who started CPAP at baseline returned the device within 2&#x02005;years, which is comparable with the adherence rates in sleep clinic cohorts with CAD [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, CPAP treatment is feasible in CAD populations with sleepy OSA, significantly reduces daytime sleepiness and may also reduce long-term cardiovascular risk. The current analysis did not identify a dose&#x02013;response relationship for CPAP usage and the primary end-point in sleepy OSA patients, probably due to the small absolute number of patients in each CPAP usage category. Interestingly, secondary analysis excluding 37 nonadherent OSA patients at 2-year follow-up resulted in a nonsignificant increase in the hazard ratio for OSA patients on CPAP <italic>versus</italic> no OSA, most likely due to the proportional increase in comorbidity in the OSA group when the less severe patients were eliminated. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the degree of obesity over time in patients with OSA adherent to CPAP. Such changes, in addition to other uncontrolled lifestyle factors and possible improvements in OSA severity over time associated with better control of underlying CAD, at least in some patients, might influence the long-term impact of CPAP treatment in CAD patients with concomitant OSA.</p><p>The strengths of this study include its prospective design for CPAP-treated patients with CAD and sleepy OSA compared with no OSA, with only three patients lost to follow-up. Although the inclusion rate for eligible patients for sleep screening for the whole RICCADSA trial was 53%, the inclusion design was consecutive and there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics of patients undergoing <italic>versus</italic> not undergoing sleep study [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The current study also had a number of limitations. This was a single-centre trial with two sites, meaning that the results are not generalisable across geographic regions. Moreover, &#x0201c;sleepy&#x0201d; OSA was defined based on an ESS score threshold, which may not reflect objective sleepiness. However, the ESS is a generally accepted tool for subjective daytime sleepiness and other methods (<italic>e.g.</italic> the objective Multiple Sleep Latency Test [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) were not feasible for the large-scale cardiac population. Furthermore, the trial had an open-label design and there was no placebo control arm for the OSA group. However, there is no true sham CPAP or other appropriate placebo for CPAP in a long-term trial in CAD patients and this is also inappropriate for ethical reasons. Finally, results of the observational studies must be interpreted with care because CPAP usage is mainly patient-driven and self-selection bias cannot be excluded. This kind of bias can only be avoided by an ITT analysis of a randomised trial. Lack of a control group of untreated OSA in this observational arm is therefore an additional limitation. However, a randomisation of sleepy CAD patients to control would not be ethically feasible.</p><p>It should be emphasised that the original sample size calculation for the RICCADSA trial was performed for the RCT arm and was intended to provide adequate power to detect a statistically significant difference between treatment groups based on the event rate assumptions used. Separate sample size and power estimates were not performed for the observational arm. In the absence of a control group of untreated sleepy OSA patients, we chose the no OSA patient group to act as controls to show that sleepy OSA patients treated with CPAP would not be inferior to patients without OSA in this CAD population. The multivariate analysis showed a HR of 0.96 (95% CI 0.40&#x02013;2.31). To better prove noninferiority (<italic>i.e.</italic> to reach a CI &#x0003c;1.2), the observational arm study would therefore have needed 922 patients (387 no OSA and 535 sleepy OSA on CPAP) using the same event and dropout rates.</p><p>In conclusion, while age and previous revascularisation were associated with increased risk for MACCEs and CABG was protective compared with PCI regarding long-term adverse outcomes, the risk for MACCEs in this revascularised CAD cohort with sleepy OSA treated with CPAP was similar to that in CAD patients without OSA. The potential role of CPAP in secondary cardiovascular prevention protocols for patients with CAD needs to be further evaluated in larger clinical cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supplementary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00749-2017.Supp1</object-id><p><bold>Please note:</bold> supplementary material is not edited by the Editorial Office, and is uploaded as it has been supplied by the author.</p><p>Supplementary material <inline-supplementary-material id="SS1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="ERJ-00749-2017_Supplement.pdf" content-type="local-data">ERJ-00749-2017_Supplement</inline-supplementary-material></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Disclosures</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="disclosures"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1183/13993003.00749-2017.Supp2</object-id><p>C.
