In the United States from 1993 to 2008, the estimated rates of influenza-associated hospitalizations were 91.5 per 100 000 for children in the first 12 months of life and 21.9 per 100 000 for children 1 to 4 years of age [1]. Influenza is also associated with outpatient and emergency department visits, diagnoses of otitis media, and prescriptions for antibiotics.</p><p>Although influenza vaccines are accepted worldwide as the most effective method for preventing influenza [<xref rid="PIU098C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], there is a paucity of data on the efficacy of inactivated influenza vaccines in young children, especially those younger than 2 years. Indeed, recent systematic reviews of methodologically rigorous studies or randomized controlled trials [<xref rid="PIU098C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="PIU098C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found few data demonstrating the immunogenicity or efficacy of the influenza vaccine in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza in young children. More research on the influenza vaccine in this age group is needed [<xref rid="PIU098C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>The emergence of 2 lineages of influenza B virus since the 1980s, with a subsequent mismatch of circulating and vaccine strains, led to the development of quadrivalent influenza vaccines (QIVs) containing both the Yamagata and the Victoria lineages. QIVs, both live attenuated and inactivated, were approved in the United States beginning in the 2013&#x02013;2014 season. QIVs containing both B virus lineages are estimated to reduce the numbers of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by influenza [<xref rid="PIU098C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Studies of the immunogenicity [<xref rid="PIU098C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU098C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and effectiveness [<xref rid="PIU098C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] of various QIVs in children from 6 months to 17 years of age have met regulatory immunogenicity criteria for seasonal influenza vaccines; 1 of the approved QIVs showed 73% efficacy in preventing moderate-to-severe influenza in children aged 3 to 8 years [<xref rid="PIU098C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>In an open-label study in 6- to 35-month-olds conducted in the 2010&#x02013;2011 season, a QIV was immunogenic and had a safety profile consistent with that of other inactivated influenza vaccines, and in a concurrent randomized controlled study in 3- to 17-year-olds, no interference with immune responses to the QIV occurred compared to a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) containing a B Victoria component [<xref rid="PIU098C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In this Phase 3 randomized controlled study of children 6 through 35 months of age conducted in the 2012&#x02013;2013 season, we assessed the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of a QIV containing influenza B strains from both lineages versus those of a TIV containing the same H1N1 and H3N2 and a B Yamagata component. In the 2012&#x02013;2013 season, the recommended B Yamagata antigen had changed (to B/Hubei-Wujiagang/158/09) from that of the 2010&#x02013;2011 season, providing an opportunity to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immune responses to a vaccine containing influenza antigens from another combination of influenza strains.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized (1:1) controlled double-blind comparison of QIV and TIV in 6- to 35-month-old children to determine safety and immunogenicity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PIU098F1">1</xref>). The study was initiated on November 1, 2012, and the day 180 visit concluded on June 19, 2013.

The randomization sequence was generated by using MATEX, a software program developed for use in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) that uses a minimization algorithm to balance treatment allocation between age groups (6&#x02013;17 months and 18&#x02013;35 months), between prestudy influenza vaccine priming statuses (primed vs unprimed), and among study centers.</p><p>Before the first vaccination, a brief history-directed physical examination was performed, and blood was drawn. Children who had previously received &#x02265;2 doses of an influenza vaccine at least 1 month apart or who had received at least 1 dose before the previous season were considered vaccine primed. Vaccine-primed children received one 0.5-mL dose of study vaccine on day 0 and had blood collected on day 28 (visit 2). Vaccine-unprimed participants received a second 0.5-mL dose of vaccine on day 28 and had blood collected on day 56. Receipt of previous influenza vaccines was determined by parental/guardian history. Vaccines were administered intramuscularly in the anterolateral region of the left thigh (for children aged 6&#x02013;11 months) or the deltoid region of the nondominant arm (for those aged &#x02265;12 months) using a 25-mm (1-inch) 22- to 25-gauge needle, as determined by the vaccinator on the basis of participant age and muscle mass. The children were observed at the study site for 30 minutes after administration of the study vaccine. Routine childhood vaccines were permitted to be given concurrently.</p><p>Parents/guardians were instructed on the use of a diary card for recording any solicited injection-site or general adverse events (AEs) for 7 days and any unsolicited AEs for 28 days and to bring this diary with them at the next study visit. Parents were instructed to contact the investigator immediately if the child displayed any symptoms they perceived as serious. Antipyretics taken between 6 hours before and 12 hours after vaccination were recorded. On day 180, parents/guardians were asked if changes in the child's health had occurred since the last vaccination to identify unsolicited AEs.</p><p>Participant flow is seen in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="PIU098F1">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>Antibody titers against the vaccine strains were measured in serum samples by hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) assays performed at the GlaxoSmithKline Vaccines laboratory in Dresden, Germany, using standardized procedures [<xref rid="PIU098C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>The primary objective was to assess the immunogenicity of the QIV 28 days after the completion of dosing (day 28 for vaccine-primed children and day 56 for vaccine-unprimed children) on the basis of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research's (CBER's) seroconversion rate (SCR) criterion (lower limit [LL] of the 95% confidence interval [CI] for each of the 4 strains) [<xref rid="PIU098C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>A secondary objective was to determine the immunogenic superiority of the B/Victoria strain in the QIV, compared to that in the TIV, 28 days after the final vaccination in terms of the geometric mean titer (GMT) ratio (QIV/TIV) (success criterion, LL of the 95% CI, &#x0003e;1.5), adjusted by the baseline antibody titer (analysis of covariance model) and the SCR difference (QIV &#x02013; TIV) (success criterion, LL of the 95% CI, &#x0003e;10%). Immunogenicity was also described for each group, age stratum, and priming status, with 95% CIs for the following parameters: the GMT of HI and seroprotection rate (SPR) on day 0 and 28 days after the final vaccination and the SCR and mean geometric increase (MGI) 28 days after the final vaccination with 95% CIs.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>Reactogenicity</title><p>The frequencies of solicited injection-site AEs (pain, redness, and swelling) and solicited general AEs (drowsiness, fever, irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite) were described (primary safety objective).

The child recovered without sequelae, and the second dose of vaccine was given with no fever reported. All SAEs were resolved by the end of the study. At least 1 MAE was reported for 52.2% (n = 156) and 51.7% (n = 156) of the QIV and TIV recipients, respectively. The most common MAEs were the unsolicited AEs: nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, and pharyngitis. Two pIMDs were reported in the TIV group (MedRA codes &#x0201c;alopecia areata&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;colitis ulcerative&#x0201d;), and they resolved by day 180. No pIMDs were reported in the QIV group. No AEs led to participant discontinuation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this randomized double-blind controlled trial of 6- to 35-month-old children, the QIV met regulatory criteria for immunogenicity and was superior to the TIV for the B/Victoria strain present in the QIV. QIVs are expected to improve protection against influenza B when 2 B lineages are cocirculating or there is mismatch between the B lineage in the TIV and the circulating strain. Although immunogenicity is an indirect measure of clinical protection against influenza-associated illness, it is notable that in a recent phase 3 efficacy trial in 3- to 8-year-old children, the efficacy of the QIV was confirmed. The vaccine effectiveness rate in this older age group against reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction&#x02013;confirmed influenza was 55.4% (95% CI, 39.2%&#x02013;67.3%) in the TVC and against moderate-to severe-influenza was 73.1% (95% CI, 47.1%&#x02013;86.3%) [<xref rid="PIU098C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. An efficacy trial in children aged 6 to 35 months (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01439360) is underway.</p><p>Attaining robust immune responses to influenza vaccine in infants in the first years of life has been an ongoing challenge. In this study, immune responses in the younger age stratum (6&#x02013;17 months) were lower than those of the 18- to 35-month-olds, and the SPRs for H3N2 and the B virus (Victoria lineage) did not meet CBER immunogenicity criteria. We note that in a predominately vaccine-unprimed population, such as in this study, SCRs may be a better measure of vaccine response. Strategies for overcoming the reduced immunogenicity of vaccine have included using 2 doses in the first year a child is vaccinated, using a 0.5-ml &#x0201c;adult dose&#x0201d; [<xref rid="PIU098C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="PIU098C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and adjuvantation with oil-in-water emulsions [<xref rid="PIU098C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="PIU098C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or virosomes [<xref rid="PIU098C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The frequencies of both local and systemic AEs in the week after immunization were comparable in the QIV and TIV recipients, after dose 1 or 2, and across the age strata. Adverse events were somewhat less common than those observed in a previous open-label (unblinded) trial of this QIV product in the same age group except for fever, which was slightly higher [<xref rid="PIU098C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Grade 3 events were also similar across groups and uncommon. There are few published data on the reactogenicity of inactivated nonadjuvanted influenza vaccines in children younger than 3 years to which our results can be compared. Most systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials of influenza vaccines in children have focused instead on immunogenicity and/or effectiveness. Two narrative reviews found few primary studies of inactivated split-virus vaccines that documented AEs in young children [<xref rid="PIU098C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="PIU098C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Fever is probably the most concerning AE after influenza immunization in children under 5 years of age because of its association with febrile seizures. In the 2010&#x02013;2011 and 2011&#x02013;2012 seasons, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention noted an increase in febrile seizures in the 48 hours after TIV receipt in 6- to 48-month-old children, at a frequency of less than 1 in 1000 children vaccinated [<xref rid="PIU098C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. No increase was seen in the subsequent season. In this study of 601 children from 6 to 35 months of age, an exploratory analysis of the RR of fever in QIV recipients compared to TIV recipients during a 4-day follow-up period did not detect any significant findings, but the CIs were wide. Similar to previous QIV study results, no excess reactogenicity seems to occur with the higher dose of influenza antigen (60 &#x000b5;g).</p><p>A limitation of this study is that it was conducted in children in stable health, and the results may not be generalizable to children in this age group with chronic conditions, particularly immunodeficiency. Also, the study end points, antibody responses, are surrogate outcomes for clinical protection. Although efficacy studies of this QIV in children aged 3 to 8 years have shown clinical protection [9], clinical efficacy for this QIV was shown in 3- to 8-year-olds but not in 6- to 35-month-olds. Other limitations are that most children in this study had not previously received influenza vaccine; children in this age group with previous influenza vaccine exposure (vaccine-primed) may respond differently to a subsequent inactivated influenza vaccine. Although routine childhood immunizations were permitted in this study, the number of children who concurrently received vaccines was insufficient to evaluate immune responses and reactogenicity with concurrent administration.</p><p>In summary, in this randomized controlled trial in children aged 6 to 35 months, an inactivated QIV had an immunogenicity that was superior to that of a TIV for the added B strain and acceptable immunogenicity for the shared strains, with no notable difference in reactogenicity and safety compared to the TIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jpids.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/jpids/piu098/-/DC1">Supplementary materials are available at the <italic>Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society</italic> online (http://jpids.oxfordjournals.org).
