A high body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of developing asthma. Prospective studies suggested that a high BMI precedes asthma symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Moreover, a dose-response effect of BMI on asthma symptoms has been detected [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In comparison to their lean counterparts, the obese-asthmatic population is characterised by decreased asthma control, high medication use, and frequent asthma-related hospital admissions [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. As obese children often become obese adults, it is necessary to tackle obesity early in life [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>It is largely unknown whether weight reduction in overweight/obese children can improve asthma features (symptoms, lung function, amount of medication) in patients with already established disease, or can prevent the development of asthma in children at risk (e.g. with the combination of obesity and a first degree family member with asthma) [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Most weight reduction studies in asthmatic patients have been conducted in adults [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. After weight reduction, improvements in lung function, asthma symptoms, asthma control and use of rescue medication have been found. However, most studies have sample sizes &#x0003c; 40 participants and weight loss was frequently achieved with bariatric surgery [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In children, a handful of studies have been performed [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These studies provided some interesting evidence that weight loss can induce beneficial changes in childhood asthma outcomes, such as asthma-related quality of life (QOL), asthma control, and improvements in lung function [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although these first results are promising, the majority of these paediatric studies had small sample sizes (e.g. &#x0003c; 40 subjects) and/or no control group. Therefore, a well-powered randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a long term follow-up is needed to validate these findings.</p><p>In addition to methodological issues, the mechanisms underlying the increased risk of asthma in overweight/obese children, and/or the improvement in asthma features following weight loss, are poorly understood. Obesity causes mechanical, metabolic, and immunological changes that may affect the respiratory system [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Both mechanical changes (including improvements in chest wall compliance as a result of less mass loading of fat in and around the chest wall) and inflammatory changes (including increases in adiponectin, reductions in c-reactive protein and leptin) have been proposed to bring about improvement in asthma after weight reduction [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, limited weight reduction studies in asthmatic children investigated the outcome parameters of both pathways [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a longitudinal, multidisciplinary, RCT directed towards weight reduction in overweight/obese children with (a high risk of developing) asthma. Our primary outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted) and the BMI-standard deviation score (SDS). Secondary outcomes were other asthma features (asthma control, medication, asthma related QOL), lifestyle parameters (e.g. aerobic fitness), lung function indices, and inflammatory mediators (serum leptin and adiponectin).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Study design</title><p>Children were included in a multifactorial RCT entitled MIKADO (clinicaltrial.gov NCT00998413) [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

The power analysis was described previously [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD unless stated otherwise. Loss to follow up was defined as discontinuation of the measurements, regardless of completion of the intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157158.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Non-compliance was defined as discontinuation of the intervention program, regardless of completion of the measurements. Participants who were lost to follow up were considered missing at random, as loss to follow up status (yes/no) was not associated with the most important baseline characteristics, and change in BMI-SDS and FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted.</p><p>For all analyses, linear mixed model analysis techniques were used, as this technique corrects for the correlation with individuals in groups, which occurs in repeated-measures RCT designs. Another advantage of this technique is that it obviously accounts for missing values, in case data are missing at random. For the primary analysis, two linear mixed models were developed with both FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted and BMI-SDS as dependent factors. Both intention to treat (with all participants who completed the measurements) and per-protocol analyses (with only participants who continued the intervention) were performed.

FVC% predicted improved by significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group, and improvements in asthma control and PAQLQ were more pronounced in the intervention group than in the control group. A considerable number of children/parents in the control group (receiving &#x02018;the usual care&#x02019;) wished to improve their body weight, lung function and/or asthma outcomes (which was one of the motivations to participate in the study), and sought the extra professional help of a dietician, a weight reduction consultant, or online weight reduction advice during the study. Such behaviour is difficult to prevent in a real-life study such as this.</p><p>The improvements in BMI in this study were in line with data of a recent meta-analysis of paediatric weight reduction programs by Waters et al, showing the effects of weight reduction programmes on BMI/BMIz of -0.15kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.21 to -0.09) [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Some studies in asthma described weight loss with effects ranging from 0.2 BMI-SDS points to an impressive weight reduction of 6 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in BMI in one study [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The results of the latter study could be slightly distorted as only per protocol analyses were shown and no control group was used [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, we did not achieve more weight reduction in the intervention than the control group of our study for reasons discussed below.</p><p>We found many clinically relevant improvements in asthma features and lung function variables (including FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, FVC% predicted, asthma control and asthma-related QOL) in both the intervention and control group. The only variable that improved significantly more in the intervention group was FVC% predicted. The improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> and FVC in the intervention group was approximately 10% which is substantial and clinically meaningful. Moreover, there was a non-significant trend towards more improvement in asthma-related QOL in the intervention group compared to the control group. Our promising findings of positive effects of weight reduction on asthma parameters are supported by previous (mostly small and non-controlled) studies, that demonstrated small though relevant improvements in asthma-related QOL, asthma control, lung function indices and EIB after weight reduction [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>How can we explain the lack of contrast between the intervention and control group? Usually, children with overweight and obesity do not decrease, but increase their BMI-SDS over time [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Most likely, the control group was motivated to lose weight because of the extra attention and perceived awareness of the problem and the participation in the study [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157158.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This is reflected in the large number of participants who arranged professional help for weight reduction during the study period. It was not possible to blind the study. We did a lot to stimulate intervention adherence in the intervention group, including imbursements for children when they reached their personal goals, additional social bonding activities, and regular evaluations. This was to some extent successful. The average presence for sport, group, parental and individual sessions was good, and the average heart rate for each sport session was 79% of the maximum heart rate. However, 24 participants did not complete the entire intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157158.g001">Fig 1</xref>), and the majority of the discontinuers (63%) stopped during the initial six months of the intervention. In a follow-up study, we (qualitatively) analysed the reasons for non-compliance in interviews with both children and caregivers. In those interviews, it was often reported that the high intensity of the programme was difficult to combine with daily life routines, despite numerous efforts of the researchers to adjust time schedules. Based on this experience, our advice for future studies is to include the intervention in a daily routine, such as a school environment, to avoid non-compliance.</p><p>The question arises as to whether the lung function improvements could be attributed to improvements in BMI-SDS, and/or mechanical and inflammatory changes. We performed a post-hoc analysis (independent of group allocation), to investigate whether changes in asthma features (FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, FVC% predicted and asthma control) were associated with changes in BMI-SDS, changes in leptin or changes in a marker of the mechanical pathway (ERV% predicted) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0157158.s005">S4 File</xref>. Post hoc analyses). We found that changes over time in either BMI-SDS, leptin and ERV% predicted were not related to changes in FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted, FVC% predicted, or asthma control in the group as a whole. This may be a consequence of the small changes of BMI-SDS in children over time. When analysed cross-sectionally, we detected an association between more severe asthma features (including low FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted and FVC% predicted), and a high BMI-SDS and low ERV% predicted. Moreover, an association was found between a marker of the mechanical pathway (low ERV% predicted), but not the inflammatory pathway (leptin) with lower lung functions in overweight/obese children. This implies that children with the most severe obesity have altered mechanical markers, and more severe asthma features.</p><p>This study has several methodological strengths [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]: 1) This is a weight reduction study in overweight/obese children with asthma with an RCT design; 2) a considerable number of children (n = 87); 3) a long-term intervention spanning 18 months; 4) outcome measures of both the inflammatory and mechanical pathways.</p><p>In addition to these strengths, potential limitations can be mentioned. For the study we included both children with asthma as well as children with overweight/obesity and a family history of asthma. The latter group was included as these children are at a high risk of developing asthma and frequently have respiratory symptoms. Therefore we hypothesised that this group could also benefit from a weight loss intervention. However, this heterogeneity in the study population could have diluted the results and might be considered to be a limitation of the study.). However, we believe that the influence on results is limited in our intervention as outcome parameters such as asthma control and PAQLQ were only determined in the children with asthma. For future studies, a more homogeneous patient population or separate analyses (which our sample size did not allow) of these patient categories is advised, though the study in both groups is relevant as children with overweight/obesity with a high risk of developing asthma can also benefit from weight reduction interventions.</p><p>What are the clinical implications of this study? It is evident from this study that the trend towards an increase in weight/BMI can be reversed in overweight/obesity children with (a high risk of developing) asthma, although the lack of contrast between the intervention and control group is somewhat disappointing. Decreases in body weight and BMI in the children were accompanied by clinically relevant improvements in all lung function indices, asthma control, aerobic fitness, and asthma-related quality of life. Another point of interest is the underlying mechanism of the asthma-obesity relationship. In our population we reported a weak association between a marker of the mechanical pathway (ERV% predicted) with BMI-SDS, but no association between a marker of the inflammatory pathway (leptin) with BMI-SDS. In order to avoid the trend in the control group that parents/children look for weight reduction measures, a randomized consent design may be more appropriate for future RCTs on this topic [<xref rid="pone.0157158.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In summary, this 18-month study on weight reduction shows that overweight/obese children with (a high risk of developing) asthma decreased in body weight and BMI-SDS, and demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in all lung function indices (FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, ERV, TLC), asthma control, aerobic fitness, and asthma quality of life (PAQLQ), although improvements were generally no greater in the intervention than in the control group. Only FVC% predicted improved significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group, and improvements in asthma control and asthma related quality of life were more pronounced in the intervention group than in the control group. We found some indications for the &#x02018;mechanical pathway&#x02019; as an underlying mechanism for the improvement in asthma parameters after weight loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Additional Figures.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Statistical analyses.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s004"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>CONSORT statement.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s005"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Post hoc analyses.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157158.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Additional baseline characteristics.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157158.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the children and their parents for their participation; medical and health sciences master&#x02019;s students Donna van den Bersselaar, Laura Bruijnzeels, Laura van den Hout, Lianne Verlinden, Margaux Scheerhoorn, Maroeska de Laat and Reasita Hudales for their assistance during the measurements and sport sessions of the intervention; research nurse Sylvia Esten for her assistance during the recruitment phase and for performing measurements; the intervention professionals Andreas Minne, Anja Ritterbeeks, Anouk Reijnen, Koen Loddewijkx, Miranda Coenjaerds and Veronique Hall for their enthusiasm and devotion to the intervention; Jeanette Dankert, Jan Heijnen, Tiny Dauven, Sasha Hutchinson, Ester Klaassen and Frans Feron for their help with patient recruitment; and the lung function department of Maastricht University Medical Centre for its assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0157158.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>. <article-title>The global childhood obesity epidemic and the association between socio-economic status and childhood obesity</article-title>. <source>Int Rev Psychiatry</source>
