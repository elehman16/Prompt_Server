Shortening the duration of gametocyte circulation reduces the probability of parasite spread and might, therefore, facilitate control. Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is universally adopted as first-line treatment for clinical falciparum malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], effectively clears asexual parasites and immature gametocytes, and is associated with lower post-treatment infectivity based on membrane feeding assays compared to other antimalarials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mature gametocytes, however, persist after ACT in microscopic or submicroscopic concentrations and residual transmission has been reported following sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine in combination with artesunate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Primaquine, tafenoquine and methylene blue radically clear mature gametocytes with primaquine being the only one commonly used as antimalarial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The World Health Organization recommends a single low dose (0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg) as a gametocytocide in combination with ACT for <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria in elimination and artemisinin resistance containment scenarios [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, wide-scale adoption of this recommendation is limited by safety concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], despite evidence that a higher dose, 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg, is associated with only minor haematological changes in G6PD normal children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the effect of the 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg dose in clearing gametocytes or preventing transmission after currently used ACT regimens has not been formally assessed. A dose-finding study in Uganda suggested a 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg dose is as efficacious in clearing gametocytes as the previously recommended dose of 0.75&#x000a0;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which has been associated with haemolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. At present, only mosquito feeding assays can truly determine the lowest efficacious dose of primaquine for preventing transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Here, we compare gametocyte dynamics after AL alone or in combination with 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg or 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine dose in children with asymptomatic falciparum infection. We selected asymptomatic parasite carriers since these contribute considerably to the infectious reservoir for malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and malaria elimination and artemisinin resistance containment strategies will need to involve the targeting of asymptomatic malaria infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For a subset of participants, post-treatment infectiousness was determined by mosquito membrane feeding experiments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Role of the funding source</title><p>Authors had full access to the trial data.

Initially, individuals were recruited regardless of microscopy gametocyte status (Study Phase A). Since no mosquito infections were detected (0/106 participants), the parasitological criterion for inclusion in infectiousness assessments was modified to include only children with patent gametocytes at screening, regardless of their asexual parasite count, to maximize pre-treatment infectivity (Study Phase B). Exclusion criteria were: haemoglobin level at screening lower than 8&#x000a0;g/dL, fever or history of fever in the last 24&#x000a0;hours, evidence of severe illness, known allergy to study medications, antimalarials taken in the last 48&#x000a0;hours, primaquine use in the last four weeks, blood transfusion in the last 90&#x000a0;days, and non-falciparum malaria infection at screening. Overall, 360 children were enrolled: 210 in Study Phase A (inclusion criterion: asexual parasite density 1,000 - 200,000 parasites/&#x003bc;L) and 150 participants in Study Phase B (inclusion criterion: presence of gametocytes by microscopy) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Clinical trial profile. <bold>a</bold> Study Phase where the presence of asexual parasites (1,000 - 200,000 parasites/&#x003bc;L) at screening was an inclusion criterion (initial 143 and final 67 participants). <bold>b</bold> Study Phase where children with patent gametocytes, regardless of their asexual parasite count, at screening were eligible (150 participants).

Primaquine doses were prepared as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and given with the fifth dose (day 2) of AL. All treatment doses were administered under supervision and with fatty food (biscuits) to ensure adequate absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and minimise the risk of gastro-intestinal side effects.

On day 0 (day of enrolment), AL administration was initiated. On each follow-up day, study subjects were examined and, except on day 1, had a blood slide prepared to detect malaria parasites and their haemoglobin levels quantified by Hemocue photometer (HemoCue AB, Angelholm, Sweden). Smears were screened for asexual stage parasites and gametocytes, and double-read. Biochemistry and full blood count assessments were performed on days 0, 3 and 7 on venous samples.</p><p>Finger-prick-blood samples (50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) were collected on all visits, except on day 1, stored in 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of RNAprotect&#x000ae; cell reagent (Qiagen), and used for gametocyte detection and quantification: quantitative nucleic acid sequence based amplification (QT-NASBA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was performed for samples collected on days 0 and 7; and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR), which allows better quantification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], was used to estimate gametocyte densities in all available samples for individuals with patent gametocytes on day 0. Briefly, total nucleic acids (NA) were extracted using a MagNAPure LC automatic extractor (Total Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit &#x02013; High Performance, Roche Applied Science). QT-NASBA was performed directly on total NA samples as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], with a minor change in the KCl concentration used: 60 instead of 80&#x000a0;mM. For gametocyte quantification by qRT-PCR, the remaining genomic human and parasite DNA were first removed with the RQ1 DNaseI Digest Kit (Promega), then cDNA was synthesized with the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems); from cDNA samples, the Pfs25 sequence was amplified using primers described by Wampfler et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], GoTaq&#x000ae; qPCR Master Mix (Promega), and CFX96&#x02122; Real-Time PCR Detection System (BIO-RAD), using the standard cycling program as described in the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Amplification was set to continue for 40&#x000a0;cycles and the cut-off for positivity was set at assigned gametocyte density of more than 0.02 gametocytes per &#x003bc;L, determined by a dilution series of mature stage V in vitro produced gametocytes (NF54 strain).</p><p>A subset of recruited children was invited to participate in membrane feeding assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] at two time-points (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with the number of participants being dictated by the availability of mosquitoes. For each experiment, venous blood was taken and offered to 60 or more locally-reared female <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> mosquitoes. Fully fed mosquitoes were selected, kept on glucose at 27&#x02013;29&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and dissected seven days later.

The primary safety endpoint was maximal fall in haemoglobin levels during follow-up. Secondary efficacy endpoints were: gametocyte prevalence on days 3, 7, 10 and 14, and proportion of mosquitoes developing infection and their oocyst counts in feeding assays performed after treatment administration. Secondary safety endpoints included: number of participants requiring blood transfusion, maximal percentage decrease in haemoglobin concentration, proportion of participants with haemoglobin levels below 5&#x000a0;g/dL and number of serious adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size calculations were based on non-inferiority of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg versus 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine dose.

For the 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine dose, a 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) for the difference with the 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg dose was calculated. The non-linear model was also used to assess superiority of the primaquine arms over the placebo group. Gametocyte prevalences on different visit days were compared between study arms by &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis) were used to compare parasite levels among different study groups. To quantify the effect of primaquine on transmission, post-treatment mosquito infection rates were compared between treatment arms. The maximal fall in haemoglobin levels measured by Hemocue photometer was presented as mean (95&#x000a0;% CI) per study arm; Student&#x02019;s t-test was used for pair-wise comparisons.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We screened 2,176 (877 in Study Phase A and 1,299 in Study Phase B) and enrolled 360 children (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In this study, we recruited asymptomatic parasitaemic children, a group that is believed to contribute significantly to transmission in endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and would potentially be given low dose primaquine if used in future community chemotherapy campaigns. We showed that individuals receiving a 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine dose in combination with AL had similar gametocyte clearance time compared to children in the 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine arm. Both regimens were associated with significantly shorter post-treatment gametocyte circulation compared to the ACT partner drug alone. In the subset of participants who had their infectivity quantified by feeding experiments, infectiousness was effectively reduced after treatment in all arms. Our observations suggest that (1), on the basis of gametocyte carriage, the primaquine dose of 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg is as effective as the previously evaluated dose, 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg; and (2) gametocytaemia is not a good predictor of post-treatment infectivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]: infectivity is very low after AL and not detected after AL-primaquine.</p><p>Previous trials on low dose primaquine&#x02019;s transmission-reducing properties have assessed efficacy based on gametocyte carriage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the non-linear relationship between gametocyte levels and mosquito infection rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] during experimental infections suggests that reductions in numbers of circulating gametocytes might not be directly translated into changes in transmission potential. Additionally, primaquine might have an impact on infectiousness before sexual stage parasites clearance is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Pfs25 mRNA transcripts are more abundantly present in female gametocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and may also be detected in non-infectious gametocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. It was recently hypothesized that male gametocytes might be more sensitive to 8-aminoquinolines in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and, since they represent a smaller fraction of the total gametocyte population compared to female gametocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], their clearance will only minimally influence gametocytaemia by Pfs25 mRNA-based quantification methods but significantly affect infectiousness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Thus, estimating the effect of primaquine on transmission requires direct assessment of infectivity. In this trial, we quantified infectiousness for 255 individuals and 22,894 dissected mosquitoes and adapted our study design to maximise discriminative power by enriching our study population for individuals with microscopically-detectable gametocytes.</p><p>We observed that 38.0&#x000a0;% of gametocytaemic individuals infected mosquitoes before treatment. This is within the normal range of infectivity in patent gametocyte carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], although considerably higher infection rates have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. After treatment, only one child infected mosquitoes, suggesting that transmissibility was substantially reduced by AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Low infectivity after AL alone made it impossible to detect an added value of primaquine in this context. The almost complete absence of infected mosquitoes post-treatment contrasts with the limited efficacy of artemisinin derivatives against mature gametocytes, and could be related to lumefantrine, that inhibits male gametocyte exflagellation and reduces oocyst numbers in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Factors intrinsic to these infections (e.g. gametocyte sex ratios) or to the host (e.g. transmission-reducing immunity) could also have contributed to this low infectiousness. Another explanation is that membrane feeding experiments, which in general underestimate infectiousness compared to skin feeding assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], might not have been sensitive enough to detect very low infectivity. The successful detection of pre-treatment infectiousness, however, suggests that low sensitivity cannot fully explain our findings. Only a few studies (summarised in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Table S7) assessed the effect of AL on transmission: similar to our observations, in The Gambia, post-treatment gametocyte carriage was observed, but mosquito infections were not detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In contrast, in Kenya, transmission was observed after AL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and clonally complex infections were detected by PCR in infected mosquito guts.</p><p>Determining the true impact of primaquine on malaria infectivity should be high on the malaria elimination agenda. Larger clinical studies with appropriate sample sizes to test efficacy outcomes involving infectiousness reduction are necessary. These studies may also determine the optimum timing of primaquine administration. In our study, primaquine was administered on the last day of AL use, to follow the same treatment procedures as a previous dose-finding trial in Uganda, although there are logistical advantages to administering primaquine with the first supervised dose of AL. Ideally, these studies will include symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria infections to demonstrate the efficacy of primaquine in all infections that contribute to the human infectious reservoir for malaria. These studies will be logistically complex and need to consider all factors that influence infectiousness as they might also influence efficacy estimates: (1) membrane feeding assays underestimate infectivity compared to direct skin feeding assays and consequently low level post-treatment infectivity might be misclassified as non-infectiousness when using this artificial system; (2) the number of mosquitoes used in each assay might not represent the number of mosquito bites an infectious individual would receive in natural settings (especially acknowledging as this is a single time point assessment), and binary outcomes (e.g. &#x0201c;infectious&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;not-infectious&#x0201d;) might be less relevant than within-individual changes in mosquito infection rates; (3) baseline infectivity will depend on the inclusion criteria and although recruiting individuals with high gametocyte densities would maximize the power to observe changes in infectiousness with treatment, these individuals might not be representative of an &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; infected person. As duration and intensity of infectiousness are likely to depend on host age and transmission setting, individuals from different ages and study sites, representing a wide spectrum of endemicities, would need to be recruited.</p><p>Primaquine-induced haemolysis in individuals with G6PD deficiency is a concern for control programs and one major reason why this drug is not widely used in Africa. Here, a rapid diagnostic test was used to exclude individuals with this condition. No cases of severe haemolysis were observed, corroborating previous observations made in symptomatic children with normal G6PD activity receiving a single 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, contrary to this previous trial undertaken in Uganda, children receiving 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine in this study had larger haemoglobin drops compared to the placebo group, suggesting that mild haemolysis might have occurred. While our study provides detailed haematological assessment after primaquine administration in G6PD normal non-anaemic children with asymptomatic falciparum infections, G6PD deficiency could lead to greater haemoglobin drops and studies recruiting G6PD deficient individuals are necessary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The ultimate goal of using primaquine in falciparum malaria in conjunction with ACT is to minimise post-treatment malaria transmission, reduce the transmission of artemisinin-resistant parasites and accelerate attempts to eliminate malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Although mathematical models have been developed to estimate the potential impact of this drug on population-level transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], its effect on infectiousness needs to be quantified. In this study, children receiving 0.40&#x000a0;mg/kg or 0.25&#x000a0;mg/kg primaquine doses cleared gametocytes with similar rates; both treatment regimens reduced gametocyte carriage compared to ACT alone. Feeding assays, however, indicate that infectiousness is considerably reduced by AL alone, suggesting that the benefit of adding primaquine to first-line antimalarials is influenced by partner drug.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12916_2016_581_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Protocol.
