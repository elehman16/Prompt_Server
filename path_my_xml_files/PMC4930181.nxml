However, the selenium content in the soil in Europe is generally low. Previous reports indicate that a dietary supplement of selenium could reduce cardiovascular disease but mainly in populations in low selenium areas. The objective of this secondary analysis of a previous randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial from our group was to determine whether the effects on cardiovascular mortality of supplementation with a fixed dose of selenium and coenzyme Q10 combined during a four-year intervention were dependent on the basal level of selenium.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>In 668 healthy elderly individuals from a municipality in Sweden, serum selenium concentration was measured. Of these, 219 individuals received daily supplementation with selenium (200 &#x003bc;g Se as selenized yeast) and coenzyme Q10 (200 mg) combined for four years. The remaining participants (n = 449) received either placebo (n = 222) or no treatment (n = 227). All cardiovascular mortality was registered. No participant was lost during a median follow-up of 5.2 years. Based on death certificates and autopsy results, all mortality was registered.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Findings</title><p>The mean serum selenium concentration among participants at baseline was low, 67.1 &#x003bc;g/L. Based on the distribution of selenium concentration at baseline, the supplemented group was divided into three groups; &#x0003c;65 &#x003bc;g/L, 65&#x02013;85 &#x003bc;g/L, and &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L (45 and 90 percentiles) and the remaining participants were distributed accordingly. Among the non-treated participants, lower cardiovascular mortality was found in the high selenium group as compared with the low selenium group (13.0% vs. 24.1%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). In the group with the lowest selenium basal concentration, those receiving placebo or no supplementation had a mortality of 24.1%, while mortality was 12.1% in the group receiving the active substance, which was an absolute risk reduction of 12%. In the middle selenium concentration group a mortality of 14.0% in the non-treated group, and 6.0% in the actively treated group could be demonstrated; thus, there was an absolute risk reduction of 8.0%. In the group with a serum concentration of &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L, a cardiovascular mortality of 17.5% in the non-treated group, and 13.0% in the actively treated group was observed. No significant risk reduction by supplementation could thus be found in this group.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this evaluation of healthy elderly Swedish municipality members, two important results could be reported. Firstly, a low mean serum selenium concentration, 67 &#x003bc;g/L, was found among the participants, and the cardiovascular mortality was higher in the subgroup with the lower selenium concentrations &#x0003c;65 &#x003bc;g/L in comparison with those having a selenium concentration &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L. Secondly, supplementation was cardio-protective in those with a low selenium concentration, &#x02264;85 at inclusion. In those with serum selenium&#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L and no apparent deficiency, there was no effect of supplementation. This is a small study, but it presents interesting data, and more research on the impact of lower selenium intake than recommended is therefore warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01443780">NCT01443780</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>University of Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8205-0041</contrib-id><name><surname>Alehagen</surname><given-names>Urban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>PharmaNord ApS, Vejle, Denmark</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8205-0041</contrib-id><name><surname>Alehagen</surname><given-names>Urban</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The costs of the analysis were partially supported by grants from Pharma Nord Aps, Denmark, the County Council of &#x000d6;sterg&#x000f6;tland, and Link&#x000f6;ping University.

In anti-oxidative defence several selenoproteins, including glutathione peroxidases (GPX) and thioredoxin reductase, are important. Selenoprotein P (SEPP1), which is the most abundant selenoprotein in the blood, and plays an important role in supplying other tissues with selenium, also has anti-oxidative properties. The human selenoproteome has 25 genes encoding selenoproteins, of which all contain the amino acid selenocysteine [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In plasma, SEPP1 constitutes about 60% and GPX constitutes about 25% of the selenium-containing proteins [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To obtain an optimal function of SEPP1, an intake of approximately105 &#x003bc;g/day has been found to be necessary [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As the selenium content of the soil varies in different parts of the world, the estimated selenium intake varies between populations from different geographical regions. It has been estimated that the selenium intake in a US population is about 120 &#x003bc;g/day [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157541.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], whereas lower intakes, even below 50 &#x003bc;g/day in some cases, have been reported from different European countries, including Sweden [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157541.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Until now, most of the discussions regarding optimal selenium intake have been based on the selenium intake required in order to obtain the optimal function of the enzyme GPX in blood or plasma. However, recent data indicates that a more appropriate indicator of optimal selenium intake might be the level required to obtain the optimal expression of SEPP1 [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Studies on cardiovascular mortality in population groups given dietary selenium supplementation have shown conflicting results. However, background dietary selenium intake varies widely. The most obvious reason for the discrepancies between studies is that in order to obtain positive effects of nutrient supplementation regardless of type, a documented deficiency or suboptimal supply of the substance to be supplemented should exist in the population under investigation.</p><p>As the calculated selenium intake in the general population in the US is above 100 &#x003bc;g/day, full expression of SEPP1 and most other selenoproteins is expected; hence, it is not surprising that investigations such as the US-based SELECT and the NPC trials could not demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular mortality through dietary supplementation with selenomethioneine or selenized yeast, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>However, there are observational studies showing lower selenium levels in patients with myocardial infarction than in controls, and increased risk for myocardial infarction could be calculated in those with the lowest selenium status [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. An early report by Salonen and co-workers found an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality with a selenium intake of less than 45 &#x003bc;g/day [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Blankenberg et al. were able to demonstrate an increased risk for those with a low selenium intake, as evaluated from determinations of GPX 1 activity in blood [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a rat model, in comparison with rats on a low selenium diet, those supplemented with selenium had a reduced infarct size and less remodelling [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Our Nordic group recently reported data on cardiovascular mortality obtained from an elderly healthy population, where the median serum selenium concentration was 67 &#x003bc;g/L, and where those in the lowest quartile had a mean selenium concentration of 57 &#x003bc;g/L [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The latter group had a substantially increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in comparison with the second to the fourth quartiles, even when adjusted for several clinical variables known to influence cardiovascular risk, such as male gender, smoking, ischemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and reduced cardiac function (ejection fraction (EF)&#x0003c;40%) [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this secondary analysis of a previously published main study [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] was to determine whether there were different cardiovascular mortality risks for three different strata of selenium concentrations in serum, and whether the possible impact of selenium supplementation on cardiovascular mortality differed depending on the baseline serum level of selenium in the same strata and applying the same follow-up period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study population</title><p>This is a secondary post-hoc analysis of a recently published study where the participants in the study were recruited from a rural municipality of 10,300 inhabitants in the south-east of Sweden [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>All citizens in the municipality aged between 70&#x02013;80 years were invited to participate in the study. From a population of 1,130 individuals living in the municipality of the chosen age-range, 675 consented to participate. Of these, 668 agreed that blood samples could be drawn, and they were thus included in the present study for analysis of selenium. All cardiovascular mortality was analysed in this study population.</p><p>Of the 668 included, a total of 443 agreed to participate in an intervention study. In the intervention project, which was published earlier [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 219 persons were given the active supplement of selenium + coenzyme Q10 (active treatment group), and 222 persons received the placebo supplement (placebo group), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157541.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</p><fig id="pone.0157541.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0157541.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>CONSORT flow chart of the study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0157541.g001"/></fig><p>The first participant was included in January 2003, and the last participant concluded the study in February 2010. All participants were examined by one of three experienced cardiologists. In each case, a new clinical history was recorded, a clinical examination was performed, Doppler-echocardiography and a new electrocardiogram were carried out, and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class was assessed. The latter grades how a patient with heart disease experiences symptoms of tiredness, breathlessness or chest pain; it is graded from I-IV, where IV represents symptoms at rest. Blood pressure was measured in the right arm with the participant resting in a supine position.</p><p>All participants were supplemented for 48 months, and were re-examined at the end of each six-month period. The median follow-up time was 5.2 years. All cardiovascular mortalities were registered. The mortality information was obtained from the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden, which registers all deaths of Swedish citizens.</p><p>The study population for the current risk evaluation consisted of 668 individuals, which included 449 individuals serving as controls, who received placebo treatment (n = 222) and 227 individuals who did not receive any treatment, in addition to 219 participants given active supplementation. To increase the statistical power we used a combined control group consisting of those who received the placebos and the individuals who did not receive any treatment. To check whether this was an appropriate procedure, analyses were also carried out using the placebos alone as a control group. Serum selenium analyses were performed in samples collected from all participants at inclusion and from 98 randomised participants at 48 months.</p><p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Committee (Diary no. 03&#x02013;176) and conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.

The basal level of selenium was analysed in 668 participants, whereas when evaluating the effect of the intervention, those on active treatment (n = 219) were compared against those not on treatment. Censored participants were those still living at the end of the study, or those who had died for reasons other than cardiovascular diseases. Completed participants were those who had died due to cardiovascular diseases.</p><p>The participants receiving active treatment with selenium and Q10 (n = 219) were divided into groups according to the distribution of serum selenium at baseline as follows: those above the 10 percentile (n = 20) had a value &#x0003e;85 ug/L and the rest (n = 199) were divided in two equal groups: those with s-Se 65&#x02013;85 ug/L (n = 100) (45&#x02013;90 percentile) and those with a s-Se &#x0003c;65 ug/L (n = 99) (&#x0003c;45 percentile). Participants who did not receive any active treatment (n = 449) were classified accordingly: &#x0003e;85 ug/L, n = 57; 65&#x02013;85 ug/l, n = 193; &#x0003c; 65 ug/L, n = 199. Of those, the participants receiving a placebo (n = 221) were distributed as follows; &#x0003c;65 ug/L n = 101, 65&#x02013;85 ug/L n = 93, and finally &#x0003e;85 ug/L n = 27. The participants receiving a placebo and the controls were compared regarding cardiovascular mortality without finding any significant difference, which is why it was possible to amalgamate the two groups into one in the following evaluations.</p><p>Assessment of the risk of cardiovascular mortality for the three strata in the serum selenium was performed using univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regressions. Factors that influence measured selenium levels include certain diseases and smoking. In the multivariate model, adjustments were made for the following clinical variables: male gender, smoking, ischemic heart disease, and EF &#x0003c;40% according to echocardiography.</p><p>P-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered significant, based on two-sided evaluations.

This is also in agreement with the EVA study (Etude du Vieillissement Art&#x000e9;riel) that reported an association between low plasma concentration of selenium and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>That the supplementation had an effect on the selenium concentration could be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157541.g001">Fig 1</xref>, and it could also be demonstrated that the fixed selenium dose used within the selenium concentration range seen in the study population gave approximately the same selenium concentration independent of the basal selenium concentration after the given dose.</p><p>Furthermore, in the group with the low selenium concentration (&#x0003c;65 &#x003bc;g/L), the supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 resulted in a substantial reduction in the risk of cardiovascular mortality during the observation period. The reduction in cardiovascular mortality was also substantial in the group having a selenium concentration of 65&#x02013;85 &#x003bc;g/L. However, in the group having a concentration of &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L the minor mortality reduction did not attain statistical significance and it was not possible to determine whether there was a true reduction or not. First, the sample size of this group was limited, as only 14.5% of the total study population had a selenium concentration &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L. By dividing the group into subjects receiving active treatment, those receiving placebos, and untreated controls, the sample size was reduced even more and finally, the number of deaths in this group was too small to perform statistical evaluations; 10 in the control group and only three in the active treatment group.</p><p>However, by evaluating the first and fourth quartiles of basal selenium concentration, a substantial difference in effect of the supplementation could be demonstrated, indicating there is a greater effect if a more pronounced selenium deficiency exists (19).</p><p>The result could also indicate that if a lesser need for supplementation exists, no positive result should be expected, as indicated from the French SU.VI.MAX (SUpplementation en VItamines et Min&#x000e9;raux AntioXydants) study [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This study, which did not find any effect of supplementation of antioxidants and selenium on cardiovascular mortality, reported an average selenium concentration in plasma at baseline of 1.09 &#x003bc;mol/L (86 &#x003bc;g/L) in women and 1.14 &#x003bc;mol/L (90 &#x003bc;g/L) in men. The findings of that study are compatible with our findings of small or no effects in those with a higher basal selenium level, which might be explained by the existence of an already sufficient selenium supply and an optimized level of SEPP1 and other selenium enzymes. [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The supplementation used in our study clearly raised the selenium concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0157541.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and it could also be seen that the fixed selenium dose resulted in approximately the same selenium concentration in our supplemented subgroups after four years. The serum selenium concentrations achieved after supplementation would secure full expression of the selenoproteins.</p><p>Reports from the Nordic countries indicate that the selenium intake is low there [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, Finland is an example of the opposite, since the authorities in 1986 decided to carry out selenium supplementation through fertilizers [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This increased the selenium intake in Finland significantly, compared to the other Nordic countries [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>A low selenium intake results in a selenium concentration below the levels for optimum expression of both GPX and SEPP1. Our Nordic group has recently reported suboptimal plasma concentrations of selenium (mean value 67 &#x003bc;g/L) in an elderly &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; municipality population in the south of Sweden [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Based on the data reported by Xia and co-workers regarding the interrelationship between selenium and coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], an intervention with both substances for a four-year-period was performed in the main study of our intervention project. The main results have been published recently [<xref rid="pone.0157541.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], showing a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality in the supplemented group. However, the study did not evaluate whether the effect of the combined intervention differed depending on the plasma selenium concentration at inclusion. The present post-hoc analysis of the aforementioned study has therefore stratified the investigated population into three groups, depending on serum selenium concentration at inclusion. Positive effects of the combined supplementation were clearly demonstrated in those with a suboptimal selenium level at inclusion. More effective results of the supplementation could be observed in those with lower levels of serum selenium at inclusion. Furthermore, we were able to report that in those with selenium levels approximately in the range needed for optimal function of SEPP1, no obvious effects of the supplementation could be observed. Finally, it should be emphasized that in our examined study population of elderly Swedes, a clear need for higher selenium intakes existed, since the basic level was low and only a small proportion, 1.6%, had adequate levels for optimizing the expression of SEPP1 and other selenoproteins.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations</title><p>Some limitations of our study could be identified. The most important one was the limited size of the subgroups, generally resulting in loss of statistical power and uncertainties regarding the obtained results, as well as making an even more detailed subgroup division impossible. Secondly, the study population was an elderly healthy population in Sweden with generally low selenium concentrations, and few participants had higher selenium concentrations sufficient to optimize expression of selenoproteins. This limits the possibilities for comparison of the effect of supplementation between the groups with low selenium and the group with high selenium in our study population.</p><p>Also, the included population consisted of persons in a relatively narrow age span, so care should be taken in extrapolating the results to other age strata.</p><p>Finally, the included population consisted of a homogenous Caucasian population, and extrapolation of the present observations to other populations may be limited.</p><p>However, in spite of the above presented limitations, we believe that the information provided is interesting and important.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In an elderly healthy Swedish population, higher cardiovascular mortality could be reported among those with a serum selenium concentration &#x0003c;65 &#x003bc;g/L in comparison with those having a concentration of &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L during a follow-up period of 5.2 years.</p><p>The effect of dietary supplementation over four years with selenium and coenzyme Q10 combined in three groups (&#x0003c;65 &#x003bc;g/L, 65&#x02013;85 &#x003bc;g/L and &#x0003e;85 &#x003bc;g/L) was evaluated. In the two lower groups, substantial reductions of cardiovascular mortality were demonstrated, whereas in the group with the highest selenium concentration, no significant reduction of mortality could be demonstrated. Possibly, no need for supplementation existed in order to obtain full expression of one of the important selenoproteins&#x02014;selenoprotein P. The results are important and indicate that supplementation with selenium and coenzyme Q10 could be considered in the vast majority of populations of areas where the soil has low selenium content.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157541.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157541.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0157541.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rayman</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name>. <article-title>Selenium and human health</article-title>. <source>Lancet</source>. <year>2012</year>;<volume>379</volume>(<issue>9822</issue>):<fpage>1256</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>68</lpage>.
