A total of 90 dentate subjects (45 males, 45 females, mean age 30.23 years) who reported to the Department of Periodontics, Government Dental College and Research Institute, Bangalore were recruited for this double-blinded, parallel, randomized controlled clinical trial conducted in May 2011&#x02013; to November 2011. All randomly screened participants were informed about the nature of the study and signed an informed consent form. Group sample sizes were decided by power analysis with 95% power and a significance level of 0.05.</p><p>Subjects diagnosed with chronic generalized gingivitis, aged 25&#x02013;40 years, having at least 20 natural teeth, with no history of periodontal therapy or previous use of antibiotics or antiinflammatory medication within the preceding 6 months were included in the study. All patients fulfilled the clinical criteria of the gingival index (Loe and Silness[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]) &#x0003e;1, pocket probing depth &#x02264;3 mm, clinical attachment loss=0, with no evidence of radiographic bone loss. Subjects with known allergies to the constituents of the formulation, hematological disorders or other systemic illness, pregnant and lactating females, undergoing orthodontic treatment and with smoking habits were excluded.</p><p>The participants were assigned randomly by a computer generated numbering sequence to one of the three groups (30 subjects in each group): Group 1: Placebo toothpaste (Group Pharmaceuticals, Bangalore, India), Group 2: Test toothpaste containing AF (Group Pharmaceuticals, Bangalore, India), and Group 3: Fluoridated toothpaste containing triclosan and polymer (Group Pharmaceuticals, Bangalore, India).</p><p>Patients accepted to participate in the study returned for a baseline examination. Patients were told not to perform any oral hygiene (including chewing gum) for 8 h prior to the baseline and follow up examinations. Patients were assessed for plaque using the plaque index (PI) (Tureskey <italic>et al</italic>. modification of Quigley Hein Index) and gingival inflammation using the gingival index (GI) (Loe and Silness), as well as for oral soft-tissue status. Following the assessments, all subjects received a supragingival prophylaxis and polishing to remove plaque, calculus, and extrinsic stain. After prophylaxis, patients were instructed on the proper brushing technique and were given either of the dentifrices or the placebo toothpaste along with a diary to record product usage and daily oral hygiene activities. The dentifrices were dispensed to subjects by a dental assistant not involved in the study. All tubes were covered in plain white covering labeled only with lot numbers to ensure proper blinding of the product from the patients and the examiner. Subjects were also given a soft bristled toothbrush to use during the clinical study. Subjects were asked to refrain from all other unassigned forms of oral hygiene, including nonstudy toothbrushes or toothpastes, dental floss, chewing gum, or oral rinses during the study. Subjects were assessed for gingivitis using the GI and for plaque, using the PI in the same dental unit under identical conditions at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 weeks.</p><p>At the baseline and at each visit, the dental plaque sample was collected from each subject. Each volunteer was asked to gargle his or her mouth with saline to remove any food debris. Taking all aseptic measures, the plaque was collected from the buccal groove of the lower first molar tooth using a sterile paper point so that the standardized length of the paper point (colored area) touched the tooth for 5 s. This specimen was immersed in 1 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS). These plaque specimens were vortexed for 10 s and immediately subcultures were performed on Mitis Salivarius (MS) agar for streptococcus species and GMC medium for <italic>Actinomyces</italic> species taking 5 ml of plaque in PBS.</p><p>The colonies of <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus intermedius</italic>, <italic>Streptococcus orali, Actinomyces viscosus</italic>, and <italic>Actinomyces naeslundii</italic> were identified based on colony morphology. The colonies with similar morphology were counted using a colony counter and their numbers were recorded and the total number was taken into account. Apart from clinical and microbiologic evaluation, subjective evaluation was also undertaken at each visit, using a questionnaire relating to the taste and flavor of the dentifrices or any adverse effect experienced after use. To check for compliance, the participants were asked to return their assigned tubes, so that the investigator could verify the amount of dentifrice that was used.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS version 10.5 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The values of different parameters collected are expressed as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Normality of continuous data was tested using Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov test. Mean change from baseline to 6, 12, and 24 weeks were calculated.

These agents have generally been incorporated into either mouth rinses or toothpastes. The main action of these agents has been focused on their antimicrobial action. There have been a number of active ingredients incorporated into various dentifrices. Triclosan/copolymer dentifrices have been studied extensively for their antiplaque and antigingivitis effectiveness. Tricolsan is a phenolic agent comprised of bisphenol and a nonionic germicide.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Lindhe <italic>et al</italic>. reported on the results of a 6-month clinical trial comparing a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice with a fluoride-containing dentifrice and found that the triclosan group had more plaque reduction and resolution of gingivitis than the regular fluoride dentifrice group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Studies including long-term clinical trials,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] short-term experimental gingivitis models,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and short-term randomized clinical studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] have demonstrated significant reductions in plaque and gingivitis from about 20% to as high as 60%. Considering aforementioned data, triclosan containing dentifrice with copolymer was taken as a positive control in this study.</p><p>AFs as caries inhibitory and antiplaque agents have been developed about 40 years ago,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and their beneficial effect has been proved in over 600 studies from the beginning of the early 70s.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The AF N-octadecyltrimethylendiamine-N, N, N-tris (2-ethanol)-dihydrof luoride (C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>58</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.2 HF) is a cationic antimicrobial known to reduce plaque formation and prevent caries formation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Toothpaste containing both AF and SnF<sub>2</sub> was introduced in 1985 and the cariostatic potential has been documented in several studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] SnF<sub>2</sub> also has a well-known plaque inhibiting effect and may inhibit bacterial metabolism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] It has been shown that a combination of AF and SnF<sub>2</sub> reduced both plaque and retarded gingivitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>The findings of this present study indicate that dentifrice containing AF alone also can be equally efficacious as containing triclosan and polymer in the reduction of plaque and gingivitis.</p><p>The reduction in plaque and gingivitis scores in group 1 (placebo) can be attributed to the Hawthorne effect (i.e., patients frequently appear to improve merely from the effects of being placed in a clinical trial).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>Because of its cationic nature, AF are also expected to interact with negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces as well as with salivary pellicle surfaces through electrostatic interactions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] AF adsorption to salivary pellicles has been extensively studied in the past[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] with respect to its effects on the charge and hydrophobicity of pellicle surfaces, but never with respect to its effects on tooth surfaces <italic>in vivo</italic>, as can be established through intraoral contact angles measurements.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Recent studies have shown that the hydrophobicity of tooth surfaces goes through a daily cycle, becoming hydrophilic after brushing and recovering to relatively hydrophobic values during the day, depending on the type of toothpaste employed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Interestingly, <italic>in vitro</italic> water contact angles on toothpaste-treated and untreated pellicle surfaces were generally more hydrophilic than those observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, likely because in vivo greasy substances adsorbed from food and initial biofilm formation form part of the pellicle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>Another unexplored aspect of AF is its antimicrobial mode of action. Plaque formation, like biofilm formation in general, commences with an initial adhesion phase after which the adhering organisms start to grow and form a biofilm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] Considering the effects of AF on the pellicle surface properties, as well as its known antimicrobial properties, its mode of action could either be through effects on bacterial adhesion, bacterial growth or killing.</p><p>Further studies are required to explore the various mode of action through which this agent can play crucial role in the management of periodontal diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors express their gratitude to Mr. R.
