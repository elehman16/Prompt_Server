ALERT STUDENT is a platform that allows creation and distribution of Learning Objects named <italic>flashcards</italic>, and provides insight into student judgments-of-learning through a metric called &#x02018;recall accuracy&#x02018;. This study aims to understand how the spaced-repetition and test-enhanced learning features provided by the platform affect recall accuracy, and to characterize the effect that students, <italic>flashcards</italic> and repetitions exert on this measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three spaced laboratory sessions (s0, s1 and s2), were conducted with n=96 medical students. The intervention employed a study task, and a quiz task that consisted in mentally answering open-ended questions about each <italic>flashcard</italic> and grading recall accuracy. Students were randomized into study-quiz and quiz groups. On s0 both groups performed the quiz task. On s1 and s2, the study-quiz group performed the study task followed by the quiz task, whereas the quiz group only performed the quiz task. We measured differences in recall accuracy between groups/sessions, its variance components, and the G-coefficients for the <italic>flashcard</italic> component.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At s0 there were no differences in recall accuracy between groups. The experiment group achieved a significant increase in recall accuracy that was superior to the quiz group in s1 and s2. In the study-quiz group, increases in recall accuracy were mainly due to the session, followed by <italic>flashcard</italic> factors and student factors. In the quiz group, increases in recall accuracy were mainly accounted by <italic>flashcard</italic> factors, followed by student and session factors. The <italic>flashcard</italic> G-coefficient indicated an agreement on recall accuracy of 91% in the quiz group, and of 47% in the study-quiz group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Recall accuracy is an easily collectible measurement that increases the educational value of Learning Objects and open-ended questions. This metric seems to vary in a way consistent with knowledge retention, but further investigation is necessary to ascertain the nature of such relationship. Recall accuracy has educational implications to students and educators, and may contribute to deliver tailored learning experiences, assess the effectiveness of instruction, and facilitate research comparing blended-learning interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12909-014-0275-0) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medical education</kwd><kwd>Memory retention</kwd><kwd>Computer-assisted instruction</kwd><kwd>E-learning</kwd><kwd>Tailored-learning</kwd><kwd>Spaced repetition</kwd><kwd>Test-enhanced learning</kwd><kwd>Judgment of learning</kwd><kwd>Curriculum evaluation</kwd><kwd>Blended-learning</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Medical education is a complex field where updates in medical knowledge, educational technology and teaching strategies intertwine in a progressive fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Over the past decade there has been a shift in this field, where traditional instructor-centered teaching is yielding to a learner-centered model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], in which the learner has greater control over the learning methodology and the role of a teacher becomes that of a facilitator of knowledge acquisition, replacing the role of an information provider [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Since the information learned by medical students is easily forgotten, it is important to design methodologies that enable longer periods of retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There is vast literature regarding the application of educational strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], instructional design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and cognitive learning science [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] to the field of medical education in order to improve learning outcomes. Two promising approaches that emerge from that literature are &#x02018;spaced repetition&#x02019; and &#x02018;test-enhanced learning&#x02019;.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Spaced repetition</title><p>The term &#x02018;spaced education&#x02019; describes educational interventions that are built in order to make use of the &#x02018;spacing effect&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This effect refers to the finding that educational interventions that are distributed and repeated over time result in more efficient learning and retention compared to massed educational interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Even though most of the evidence regarding the &#x02018;spacing effect&#x02019; has been gathered in settings where interventions ranged from hours to days, there is some evidence suggesting that it can also generate significant improvements in longer-term retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Studies carried in the medical setting show that the application of such spaced interventions increase retention of learning materials. The interventions yielding these results have been designed as spaced-education games [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], delivery of content by email in spaced periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], blended approaches composed of face-to-face sessions and spaced contacts with on-line material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Cook et al. performed a meta analysis that regarded the application of spaced repetition and other methodologies on internet-based learning, and concluded that spaced repetition improves, at least, student satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. That work suggests that educators should consider incorporating repetition when designing internet-based learning interventions, even though the strength of such recommendations still needs reinforcement by further research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Test-enhanced learning</title><p>Even though tests are mainly used as a way to assess students, there is strong evidence that they stimulate learning by increasing retention of the information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. That has led Larsen et al. to define the term &#x02018;test-enhanced learning&#x02019; to refer to interventions where tests are explicitly used to stimulate learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. This approach is rooted in the observation that after an initial contact with the learning material, being tested on the material increases information retention more than reviewing that material again [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. This effect increases with the number of tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the spacing of tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Moreover, tests composed of open ended questions (OEQs) have been shown to be superior to multiple choice questions (MCQs) for that purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Providing the correct answer as feedback also increases the retention effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. While most evidence indicates that immediate feedback is generally the most effective timing to maximize retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], there is recent evidence indicating that delayed feedback may have a stronger effect in some situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p><p>The test-enhancement effect is mostly explained by the recall effort required to answer the question, leading to superior retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, there is also the indirect benefit of exercising judgments of learning (JOLs) that guide further study sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. JOLs, or meta-memory judgments, are made when knowledge is acquired or revisited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Theories of self-regulated study claim that active learners use JOLs to decide whether to allocate further cognitive resources toward study of a given item or to move on to other items [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], thus supporting the indirect test-enhancement effect.</p><p>In the medical education setting, it has been shown that solving concrete clinical problems requires a strong grasp of the underlying factual knowledge that is inherent to the problem. Test-enhanced learning frameworks work particularly well for the retention of the factual knowledge required for higher order clinical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. It remains unclear, as in the case of spaced repetition, whether the test-enhancement effect can be maintained in the long term, as most of the evidence regards intervals ranging from weeks to months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Self-assessment and the ALERT STUDENT Platform</title><p>The creation of e-learning systems that enable systematic application of retention enhancement methodologies constitutes an important contribution to the information management axis of the core-competences for medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and may improve students ability to learn and retain the factual knowledge network required for effective clinical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Based on the fact that there are few reports of systems implementing these principles in such a fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>], we have developed the platform ALERT STUDENT, a system that empowers medical students with a set of tools to systematically employ spaced repetition and test-enhanced methodologies to study learning materials designed in the form of Leaning Objects (LOs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. This platform and the theoretical background supporting each of the features has been described in detail on a previous paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. LOs are groupings of instructional materials structured to meet specific educational objectives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] which are created using a set of guidelines to make content portable, interactive and reusable, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and have been shown to enhance learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>The platform implements test-enhanced learning in the form of quizzes. These are composed of sets of OEQs about each of the LOs. The questions are meant to stimulate students to recall learned information, and therefore enable the measurement of JOLs. Typically, JOLs can be estimated as the prediction of the learner about how well it would recall an item after being presented the item [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Numerous methods exist to assess JOLs for different purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. The cue-only JOL, a method where the student must determine the recall of an item (in our case a LO) when only the cue (the OEQ) is presented at the time of judgment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], is of particular interest to us. We extend this type of JOL to define a measurement named &#x02018;recall accuracy&#x02018;. The recall accuracy is similar to the cue-only JOL because after being presented the cue and trying to retrieve the target, the student is presented the LO that contains the target. The student then grades the similarity between the retrieved target and the actual target. The process of measuring recall accuracy corresponds to the immediate feedback stage employed on test-enhanced learning approaches. This approach maximizes the potential of LOs and the OEQ to serve as learning material, recall cue and recall feedback.</p><p>To sum up, educators can use the platform to publish LOs, and students can apply the spaced repetition and test-enhanced methodologies on those LOs to hopefully improve their learning retention and direct study sessions effectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Evaluation of education programs</title><p>Even though most educators value the importance of monitoring the impact of their educational interventions, systematic evaluation is not common practice, and is frequently based on inference measures such as extent of participation and satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Additionally, most program evaluations reflect student cognitive, emotional and developmental experiences at a rather superficial level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>This issue also affects medical education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Evaluation should drive both learning and curriculum development and demands serious attention at the earliest stages of change.</p><p>To make accurate evaluations of learning programs, it is essential to develop longitudinal databases that allow long term follow up of outcomes of interest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. In this line of thought we believe that recall accuracy information collected through the ALERT STUDENT platform in real-time may provide an additional resource to be included in student-oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and program-oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] evaluation approaches, through the estimation of longitudinal student performance, and the determination of instruction and content fitness to student cohorts, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aims to this study</title><p>Since recall accuracy plays a key role in the learning method implemented by the ALERT STUDENT platform, this work aims, firstly, to characterize how recall accuracy evolves with usage of the spaced-repetition and test-enhanced learning tools in a controlled setting, and secondly, to characterize the extent to which students, LOs and intervention sessions contribute to the variation in recall accuracy. We hypothesize that recall accuracy improves along sessions, but we do not know how the contact with the system modulates it.</p><p>In addition we hypothesize that recall accuracy may constitute a relevant source of information to determine the learning difficulty of a LO for a given student cohort, and believe this information may contribute to the evaluation of the fitness of educational interventions. To elucidate this topic, we performed a G-Study to assess the agreement over the contribution of the LOs to recall accuracy scores, and performed a D-Study to characterize the conditions in which the number of students and repetitions of grading recall accuracy yield strong agreement on the difficulty of the LOs for the examined student cohort.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The Faculty of Medicine of the University of <italic>Porto</italic> (FMUP) implements a 6-year graduate program. Applicants are mainly high school graduates. The first three years focus on basic sciences while the last three focus on clinical specialties. For the purpose of this work, content about the Golgi Complex was designed using lectures from the Cellular and Molecular Biology class, taught in the second semester of the first grade.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>ALERT STUDENT platform</title><p>The ALERT STUDENT the platform allows the creation and distribution of LOs named <italic>flashcards</italic>. These are self-contained information chunks with related OEQs. A <italic>flashcard</italic> is composed of a small number of information pieces and OEQs that correspond to one of the information pieces. Educators can put together ordered sequences of <italic>flashcards</italic> that describe broader learning objectives, thus forming high-order LOs denominated <italic>notebooks</italic>.</p><p><italic>Notebooks</italic> are the units in which the spaced-repetition sessions and the test-enhanced learning tasks can be performed. Spaced-repetition tools are made available through a <italic>study mode</italic> feature that presents in order the complete set of <italic>flashcards</italic> belonging to a <italic>notebook</italic> in a study-friendly environment enriched with note taking, text highlighting, and a <italic>flashcard</italic> study priority cue based on personal recall accuracy from corresponding OEQs. The <italic>flashcard</italic> information and OEQs can be studied in this mode. Test-enhanced learning is achieved through the <italic>quiz mode</italic>, a complementary environment where retention of <italic>flashcard</italic> information can be self-assessed through recall accuracy using the OEQs as cues. Recall accuracy is graded for each question using a 4 point <italic>likert</italic> scale (0 - no recall, 1 - scarce recall, 2 - good recall, 3 - full recall). On every quiz session, the system picks one OEQ for every piece of information on every <italic>flashcard</italic>. OEQs are displayed one at a time. In case there is more than one OEQ for an information piece, the system picks one OEQ that has not yet been graded. When all the OEQs have been graded for a given information piece, the system picks the OEQ with the lowest recall accuracy. At the end of a <italic>quiz mode</italic> session, the student is presented the set of <italic>flashcards</italic> and OEQs for which recall accuracy was 0.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pilot study</title><p>A pilot study was performed to design a <italic>notebook</italic> that could be studied in 20 minutes. 5th grade students (n = 6) were assigned to a read a <italic>notebook</italic> with 30 <italic>flashcards</italic> created using lecture material about the Golgi Complex. The final <italic>notebook</italic> was created using the <italic>flashcards</italic> that the students were able to study within the time limit. That <italic>notebook</italic> consisted of the first 27 <italic>flashcards</italic>, totaling 37 information pieces and 63 OEQs. Each <italic>flashcard</italic> contained one or two pieces of information, sometimes accompanied by an image - there were 5 images in total. Each piece of information in a <italic>flashcard</italic> corresponded to a set of 1 to 4 OEQs. This <italic>notebook</italic> script is available as a Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> to this paper.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to estimate the sample size, 2nd grade students (n = 2), 4th grade (n = 2), and 5th grade (n = 2) medical students were asked to grade their recall accuracy for the 63 OEQs. The 4th and 5th year students knowledge was assumed to correspond to a low recall accuracy about the Golgi, and was expected to represent the mean recall accuracy of a similar student sample before the research intervention. 2nd grade medical students knowledge was assumed to correspond to a high recall accuracy about the Golgi, and was expected to represent the mean the recall accuracy of a student sample after the research intervention.</p><p>The average percentage difference in recall accuracy between the two student groups was 41%. Finding a similar difference in mean recall accuracy before and after an intervention using the study and quiz tools was assumed to be a reasonable expectation. Thus, the sample size required to discriminate statistical significance under such circumstances was n = 48, assuming a power of 80% and a significance level of 0.05. The sample size was incremented to n = 96 to take advantage of the laboratory capacity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention design</title><p>Ninety-six (n = 96) students from the 4th and 5th grades of our school were randomly picked from the universe of enrolled students (approx. 500), and were contacted via email to participate one month prior to this study. Two students promptly declined to participate and two more students were randomly picked. Students were assigned into &#x02018;study-quiz&#x02019; group or &#x02018;quiz&#x02019; group using simple randomization.</p><p>The intervention employed a study task and a quiz task. The study task consisted in studying the Golgi <italic>notebook</italic> during 20 minutes using the <italic>study mode</italic>. The students were able to take notes and highlight the text. The quiz task consisted in using the <italic>quiz mode</italic> to answer the OEQs about the Golgi and grade recall accuracy, within 15 minutes. Before each task students were instructed on the purpose of each task and the researcher exemplified each of the tasks in the system. Students performed each task alone. Doubts raised by the students concerning platform usage were cleared by the researcher.</p><p>Three laboratory sessions (s0, s1 and s2) of 1 hour duration were carried with one week intervals. On s0, both groups performed the quiz task. On s1 and s2, the quiz group performed the quiz task alone, and the study-quiz group performed the study task immediately followed by the quiz task. Since the platform implements a study workflow centered on performing the study task followed by the quiz task, the study-quiz group was created to indirectly measure changes in recall accuracy attributable to the study task. The quiz group describes the changes in recall accuracy that are attributable to the quiz task. This procedure is detailed in Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

We selected a basic science topic and 4th and 5th grade medical students, in order to maximize the odds of a low degree of prior knowledge. We chose the Golgi Complex because the majority of the curriculum does not build directly on this concept, and thus it was likely a forgotten topic. This was important because the lowest the a prior knowledge before our intervention, the smaller student sample would be required to discriminate significant differences in recall accuracy during the study sessions, thus rendering this study feasible.</p><sec id="Sec17"><title>Evolution of recall accuracy across sessions</title><p>There is an effect on recall accuracy reported by students along sessions. It was expected that the study-quiz group would out-perform the quiz group in terms of recall accuracy, at least on s1. Since the quiz task provides the learning materials as the correct answers to the OEQs and additional feedback at the end of the task, it has high learning value. Because we used a 4 point scale to grade recall accuracy, it was reasonable to consider the hypothesis that the quiz task provides enough learning value to master the content and thus expect both groups to report similar recall accuracy results.</p><p>The recall accuracy increase was stronger in session s1 for the study-quiz group. It was expected to see an increase in this session since the content was tailored to be fully covered within the 20 minute time limit. The strong gain indicates that this session was the one that accounted for the greatest increase in recall accuracy.</p><p>Findings by Karpicke et al. suggest that the testing effect plays an essential role in memory retention, and that after an initial contact with the learning material it is more beneficial to test rather than re-study the material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition, since using open-ended assessment questions as a means to learn improves knowledge retention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], it was unclear how strong would that increase be in the quiz group. However that increase was only a modest one. That finding might be explained, at least in part, by minimization of the cueing effect - the ability to answer questions correctly because of the presence of certain questions elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] - through the usage of different questions for each information piece. OEQs are known to minimize cueing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] and in addition, the different questions, although having the same content as answer, minimized that effect. This shows that pairing OEQs with LOs increases the value of the learning material.</p><p>In our study we found that recall accuracy increased more in the study-quiz than in the quiz group. If we assume that recall accuracy represents knowledge, then the most likely explanation for higher the increase in recall for the study-quiz group is the additional time-on-task. We were concerned that, because the metric is a subjective one, repeated contact with the content would cause the recall accuracy value to overshoot to nearly 100% after the first contact, regardless of prior knowledge or the time-on-task. However, recall accuracy evolved along sessions according to the underlying variables: recall accuracy at s0 was low because the student cohort did not have any formal contact with the Golgi over 2 years; the study-quiz group - with longer time-on-task - had higher results than the quiz group; recall accuracy improved along the sessions for both groups in part because of the effect of previous sessions.</p><p>Thus recall accuracy evolved in accordance to the factors influencing learning.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Adequacy of recall accuracy as a measurement of knowledge</title><p>The consistent differences in recall accuracy between groups give and indication that this measurement, although being of subjective nature, seems to be positively related with knowledge acquisition.</p><p>Karpicke et al. has shown that in a controlled setting, students cannot reliably predict how well they will perform on a test based on their JOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Other studies conducted in ecological settings also have shown that the relationship of knowledge self-assessment with motivation and satisfaction are stronger than with cognitive learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Additional research found that in a blocked practice situation learners tend to be overconfident and JOLs are often unreliable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>].</p><p>Our study design differed from the classical designs for studying the effects of spaced repetition, knowledge retention and JOLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] because it was intended to describe recall accuracy evolution in a use-case similar to the real-world use of the system. Therefore, available evidence may not be completely applicable to this study. However, based on our results, we cannot completely refute the hypothesis that recall accuracy is independent of knowledge acquisition and dependent on affective factors. It is possible, though unlikely, that affective factors introduce a systematic error in recall accuracy grading. The colorful nature and intensity of such factors would most likely lead to a random error rather than systematic variation. This finds support in our results regarding recall accuracy variance components, since the <italic>flashcard</italic> component contributed substantially more than the participant component to the total variance. In addition, it is well known that higher time-on-task is one of the most important determinants of learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Because recall accuracy was higher on the study-quiz group - with greater time-on-task - this is likely mainly explained by the learning effect.</p><p>Furthermore, other studies have measured JOLs differently than in this study. While other approaches typically measure JOL by requiring the subject to predict how well would they perform when tested in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], our approach focuses on requiring subjects to compare their answer with the <italic>flashcard</italic> containing the correct information. Because our approach does not require a future projection and is additionally performed in the presence of both the recalled and correct answers, it is unlikely to vary independently of the learning effect.</p><p>Thus, we hypothesize that measuring recall accuracy immediately after the recall effort and in the presence of the correct answer may help students make sound JOLs. However further work is needed to compare recall accuracy with an objective measurement of knowledge, such as a MCQ test, in order to prove that hypothesis. Assuming a relationship between both variables is found, it would also be relevant to understand how different degrees of recall accuracy map to different degrees of knowledge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Recall accuracy components of variance</title><p>Regarding the quiz group, the recall variance was mainly affected by the differences in <italic>flashcard</italic> and by the differences in participants. This indicates, firstly, that systematic differences in the <italic>flashcards</italic> were mainly responsible for the variation in recall scores, and secondly, to a smaller extent, differences between participants, possibly regarding affective and knowledge factors also played a role. The effect of the multiple sessions accounted little for the increase in recall accuracy over the sessions. The high G-coefficient for the <italic>flashcard</italic> variance component indicates the <italic>flashcards</italic> are very well characterized in terms of recall accuracy under these circumstances. Thus, factors intrinsic to the content, such as its size, complexity, or presentation, are very likely responsible for differences in recall accuracy between <italic>flashcards</italic>.</p><p>Assuming the recall accuracy is related to knowledge acquisition, systematic differences in recall accuracy between <italic>flashcards</italic> can indicate which materials are harder to learn and which materials are easy. Using this information to conduct revisions of the learning material may be useful to find content that would benefit from redesign, adaptation, or introductory information.</p><p>With respect to the study-quiz group, the contact with the content over multiple sessions was the main driver of recall accuracy improvement. Participant features had little effect in the increase recall accuracy over sessions and the <italic>flashcard</italic> features also accounted for less effect than in the quiz group. This suggests that the students in the study-quiz group increased their knowledge about the content and their prior knowledge had little effect in the learning process when using the study tools. This effect is most likely explained by the additional time-on-task of the study-quiz group. In addition, some of the effect may also be explained by findings in other studies that show that there is benefit in using repeated testing with study session in order to enhance learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Potential implications to educators</title><p>The way in which content can be organized to optimize learning has been extensively studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. This study demonstrates how LOs can be of value for both study and self-assessment when combined with OEQs. The detailed insight on recall accuracy can be used by educators to classify LO difficulty and estimate the effort of a course. By providing a diagnostic test on the beginning a course in the form of the quiz task, educators can get a detailed snapshot of the material difficulty for the class. This data can be useful to evaluate educational interventions at a deeper level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Because the platform can be used by the students to guide learning on their own, educators can access real-time information of recall accuracy and use it to tailor the structure of the class to better meet the course goals. Furthermore, research has identified the delivery of tailored learning experiences as one of the aims that blended education approaches have yet fully reached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p>In a hypothetical scenario where students repeatedly study and quiz, it is expected that the main component of recall accuracy variance is the session count. Deviation from such a pattern could suggest flaws in content design, excessive course difficulty or other inefficacies in teaching and learning methodologies. Sustained increases in recall accuracy mainly explained by the session would inform the educator of a continuous and successful commitment of the students. If educators take constructive action from such observations then a positive feedback cycle between student engagement and the success of the learning activity would be established. Because students know educators can take real-time action based on their progress, they engage more strongly in the learning activities. Stronger engagement will lead to better learning outcomes, that will lead to further tailored action by the teacher. Indeed, student engagement is the main driver of learning outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Providing tools that can foster such engagement is key to achieve successful learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Potential implications to learners</title><p>Students need tools to help retain knowledge for longer periods and easily identify materials that are more difficult to learn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This goal may be achieved by providing learners with personal insight on their learning effectiveness, using personal and peer progress data based on self-assessment results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].</p><p>The past recall accuracy can be used as an explicit cue to guide the learning process and help managing study time. Since JOL measurements are implicitly used by learner to guide the learning task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], an explicit recall accuracy cue displayed for each <italic>flashcard</italic> in the form of a color code can improve the value of the JOL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The feedback that is thus formed between the quiz and the study task further promotes the spaced repetition of study and self assessment sessions and can improve student engagement, the main driver of successful learning.

Cook asserted that little has been done regarding Friedman&#x02019;s proposal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] of comparing computer based approaches rather than comparing against traditional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p>The platform ALERT STUDENT intends to add value to the blended learning approach, through the collection of recall accuracy data, and prescription of a method that can be systematically applied in most areas of medical knowledge. Over this platform, interventions with different configuration, instructional method or presentation can be developed, and thus allow sound comparison between computer assisted interventions and comparison between different fields of medical knowledge. The platform does not intend, however, demote the usage of other tools, rather it intends to potentiate their usage. As an example, the platform could be used to deliver the learning materials and provide the study and quiz features, that would act in concert with MCQ progress tests during class. Educators could use information about recall accuracy and number of study and quiz repetitions to gain insight on the relationship between test results and student effort. That information would be relevant to help educators mentor students more effectively. Again, the information brought by recall accuracy could be helpful to tailor other instructional methods and thus drive student satisfaction and motivation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations and further work</title><p>This work has several limitations. Recall accuracy cannot be granted to correspond to knowledge retention. As previously mentioned, additional research is required to investigate the relationship between the two. In the light of our findings, it also becomes relevant to characterize recall accuracy in ecological scenarios and multiple areas of medical curriculum, under larger learning workloads.</p><p>We have indirectly characterized the effect of the study task on the recall accuracy. We expect however that an equivalent time on the quiz task alone would yield higher effects in recall accuracy, in consonance with the findings by Larsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. That is also a matter that justifies further investigation.</p><p>The system works around factual knowledge, therefore it is only useful in settings that require acquisition of such knowledge. Complex competences such as multi level reasoning and transfer cannot be translated in terms of recall accuracy. Ways in which the system could be empowered to measure such skills would constitute important improvements of the platform.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study focus on measuring recall accuracy of LOs using OEQs in a laboratory setting through the ALERT STUDENT platform. We found that the quiz task alone led to a modest increase on recall accuracy, and that the study-quiz task had high impact in recall accuracy. The session effect was the main determinant of recall accuracy on the study-quiz group, and the <italic>flashcard</italic> and participant effects determined most of the increase in recall accuracy in the quiz group. We concluded that recall accuracy seems to be linked with knowledge retention and proposed further investigation to ascertain the nature of this relationship. Recall accuracy is an easily collectible measurement that increases the educational value of LOs and OEQs. In addition, we have discussed the educational implications of providing real-time recall accuracy information to students and educators, and proposed scenarios in which such information could be useful to deliver tailored learning experiences, assess the effectiveness of instruction, and facilitate research comparing blended learning interventions.</p><p>The present findings will be explored in more detail in future work, as they may help future physicians and medical schools meet the challenge of information management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and instilling a culture of continuous learning, underpinning the core competencies outlined for XXI century physicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12909_2014_275_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1</label><caption><p>
