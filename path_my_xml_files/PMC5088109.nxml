group and 25 minute group and its effect on stress hormone, blood pressure and heart rate
was analyzed in order to provide a theoretical rationale to apply scalp massage as stress
therapy. [Subjects and Methods] A scalp massage was applied to 34 female office workers
twice a week for a total of 10 weeks; the subjects were classified into 15&#x02005;min., 25&#x02005;min.
and control groups, and their stress hormone levels, blood pressure and heart rate were
evaluated. [Results] Significant differences in norepinephrine, cortisol and blood
pressure (SBP &#x00026; DBP) were found in terms of interaction by time interval and between
groups. [Conclusion] As a result of applying scalp massage to female office workers for 15
and 25 minutes, positive effects were observed on stress hormone, blood pressure and heart
rate. Therefore, scalp massage can be used for stress control with no spatial or time
limit.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Massage</kwd><kwd>Stress hormone</kwd><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The use of female human resources is highlighted as an important factor in the aging Korean
society, especially as married women have started entering the labour market. In addition, a
wide range of fields utilize female labour and the distribution ratio of women in each field
is increasing, with female participation in social and economic activities reaching 50.2% in
2013, 51.3% in 2014 and 51.8% in 2015<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Office jobs in particular are experiencing a greater influx of female resources than any
other area, accompanied by the risk of various diseases due to poor working posture and
environments, long-term use of computers, task over-load, mental stress, etc<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stress that female office workers
experience in the male-centred organizational culture in Korea seems to have more
significant implications<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, moderate stress plays a positive role in physical and mental vitality while
achievement motivation elicits feelings of tension. However, undue stress caused by task
over-load might have negative effects on the mind and body, for example, personal anxiety,
reduced concentration, loss of drive to work, stress-related diseases, etc. It might also
have direct or indirect negative effects on organizational performance, for example,
occurrence of negligent accidents, expansion of healthcare expenses, a decrease in
productivity and loss of employment<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Thus, a stress therapy program with easy applicability during busy business hours can
improve the health of female office workers. One of the easily applicable stress therapy
options, in terms of time and space, is massage. Not only does it have therapeutic effects
on various bodily functions including the nervous, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and
integumentary systems, it is also recognized as a type of aerohydropathy as it helps to
promote local and general circulation, increases immunologic function, optimizes natural
healing ability and helps maintain body balance and harmony. Massage is the oldest method
used to resolve tiredness in the mind and body, and can treat and prevent illness<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Massage on the neck muscles extends the
range of cervical spine rotation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> and
improves neck flexor muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, massage after total knee arthroplasty decreases pain and increases the
diarthrodial range<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study,
10 to 20 minutes were determined to be appropriate for a scalp massage<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. As mentioned above, massage has positive effects on
muscles. In addition to the extension of diarthrodial range, it influences stress hormones
(epinephrine and norepinephrine), which can trigger the activation of sympathetic nerves
such as an increase in heart rate, contraction of blood vessels and muscle tension, as well
as circulation throughout the body via blood<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, massage has been confirmed to have positive effects on
changes in hormones<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, blood pressure<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and heart rate<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was performed to provide a theoretical
rationale for the application of massage as stress therapy in female office workers. With
the goal of improving health and quality of life, this study is based on the analysis of the
effects of massage on stress hormones, including blood pressure and heart rate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The target population of this study was female office workers; 20&#x02013;49 year old female office

collected blood was centrifuged for 10 minutes at 3,000&#x02005;rpm using a centrifuge (Model
HC-16A, Korea); the post-centrifugal plasma was stored at &#x02212;73&#x02005;&#x000b0;C and referred to Laboratory
N for hemanalysis. Blood collection was conducted before the first scalp massage and at 9 am
the following day. Blood was also collected after 10 weeks in the same manner. Blood
pressure was measured before the first scalp massage and after 10 weeks, for a total of two
times, using a mercury sphygmomanometer (OMRON HEM-770A, Japan). The blood pressure was
measured after at least 10 minutes of rest. The mean value of the 2 measurements was used as
the average blood pressure. The subjects&#x02019; heart rates were also measured before the program
and after 10 weeks at a stable status using the Sport Tester PE 3000 (Polar Electro Co.
Finland); each measurement was conducted for 5 minutes and the mean value of the 2
measurements was used as the heart rate. The program SPSS (Ver 20.0) was used for data
processing. The mean and standard deviations were used for elementary statistics. The
primary effect and interaction effect on the time interval and between groups were evaluated
using a two-way repeated ANOVA, and a post-Hoc test was conducted using the Duncan test. The
statistical significance level was set as p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In total, there were 34 subjects in this study. A scalp massage was performed for 15

sympathetic system-adrenal medulla axis involved in the secretion of epinephrine and
norepinephrine and the other is the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal medulla (HPA) axis
involved in the secretion of cortisol<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The physiological effect of massage in general can be divided into a relaxation effect and a
stimulation effect. The relaxation effect involves hypothalamic reactions associated with
the decline of sympathetic system activity and an increase in parasympathetic system
activity. There are two types of stimulation effects: one is reflexive and the other is
mechanical. The reflex effect is refreshing and relaxing due to delivering stimulation at
the cutaneous peripheral nerve to the cerebrum. Peripheral cutaneous stimulation promotes
circulation through stimulation of the parasympathetic nerve, relaxation of muscles and
extension of capillary vessels. Ultimately, massage reduces sympathetic nerve activity while
increasing parasympathetic nerve activity<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, 15-minute and 25-minute scalp massages had a
significant effect on norepinephrine and cortisol while the 25-minute scalp massage had a
significant effect on epinephrine. This suggests that a scalp massage decreases the
activation of the sympathetic nerve while increasing the activation of the parasympathetic
nerve, resulting in a decrease in the secretion of norepinephrine and cortisol, or in other
words, stabilization of hormone levels. However, only in the case of the 25-minute scalp
massage was there a significant difference in the level of epinephrine. After exposure to
stress, the levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine change rapidly. This seems to be caused
by either personal sensitivity differences and time variance<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> or as a result of personal differences between subjects and time
variance. In addition, the study demonstrated that the levels of epinephrine were
unpredictable and could increase in uncontrolled noise environments<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, reactions to stress can differ according to
different stress characteristics.</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that the low frequency (LF) sympathetic nerve activity marker
significantly decreased whereas the high frequency (HF) parasympathetic nerve activity
marker significantly increased after 15 minutes of scalp massage<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study demonstrated the effects of a 20 minute
scalp massage on norepinephrine and cortisol<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of our study were in agreement with these existing
studies, suggesting that a&#x0003e;15 minute scalp massage has a positive effect on stress
hormones.</p><p>The results also suggested that stress increases cardiac output and blood pressure by
influencing the sympathetic nerve, resulting in the increase of peripheral blood pressure by
epinephrine, leading to the relaxation of blood vessels and increased blood flow rate in the
liver, heart muscles and brain tissues. In addition, norepinephrine is known to cause
vasoconstriction, increase blood pressure, general peripheral resistance<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, and pulse due to rising blood cortisol
concentration levels during mental stress.</p><p>There was a significant decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure after 15 and
25 minute scalp massages, which seems to be a result of the stabilization of hormone levels
caused by an increase in the activation of sympathetic nerves and parasympathetic nerves and
the subsequent decrease in the concentration of norepinephrine and cortisol hormone. This is
probably because the scalp massage promoted blood circulation, resulting in a positive
effect on the neck muscles and the relaxation of blood vessels<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. After performing scalp
massage in adults at the normotensive or prehypertensive stage, blood pressure was found to
have decreased significantly<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Additionally, 4 weeks of massage at work was shown to significantly decrease strain and
blood pressure<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Under the control of the autonomic nervous system, the heart rate increases when the
reaction of the sympathetic nerve system is accentuated. In this study, the heart rate did
not seem to decrease significantly despite a decrease in the level of norepinephrine and
cortisol hormones controlling the sympathetic nerve system. However, the heart rate showed a
tendency to drop slightly. In a previous study involving carotid sinus massage in aged
subjects, blood pressure and heart rate were shown to decrease<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> and a significant decrease in heart rate was confirmed
after 45&#x02013;60 minutes of muscle massage in middle aged men and female performed at different
intensities<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study using massage
(at moderate and mild intensity) and a vibrator, massage treatment at moderate intensity was
shown to significantly reduce the heart rate<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. These differences from the existing study might be because massage
in this study was not performed frequently (twice a week) and the intensity was relatively
mild. In general, only the heart rate did not show a significant difference and the scalp
massage had positive effects in terms of hormones and blood pressure.</p><p>We recommend active utilization of a scalp massage program with no spatial or time limits
in female office workers, as the use of a scalp massage lasting 15 minutes or less as a
stress control program could have a positive effect. Furthermore, better results are
expected in future studies if the intensity of the massage is varied while considering the
physical condition of the subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by Dongguk University Research Fund of 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other"><institution>Statistics Korea</institution>: Economically Active Population Survey,
