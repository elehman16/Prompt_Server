It is also associated with growth faltering (i.e. deficit in height or stunting), micronutrient deficiencies, delayed cognitive development and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Stunting and micronutrient deficiencies are significant health problems among infants and young children in Tanzania. Prevalence of stunting among children aged 6&#x02013;59 months in the national surveys of 2005 and 2009/2010 was 37.7% and 42%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Children in rural areas were more affected than their urban peers (40.5% vs 37.7% in 2005; 44.7% vs 32.1% in 2010). Children living in the southern and central regions of the country were more affected than those living in other regions.</p><p>Poor breastfeeding practices, inadequate dietary intake from complementary foods, high rates and repeated episodes of diseases, maternal inadequate nutritional knowledge and household food insecurity have been associated with stunting in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Overall, only 2 out of 10 Tanzanian children are fed in accordance with the recommended infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Among the breastfed children (6&#x02013;23 months-old), 61% were given foods from three or more food groups, 39% were fed the minimum number of times, 30% consumed iron-rich foods and 62% consumed vitamin A-rich foods.</p><p>A formative research was conducted in one of the central regions with high rates of malnutrition to closely examine feeding practices, diets and nutritional status of infants and young children and guide decisions on improvement. The research was conducted in Dodoma in two phases. The first survey, conducted in 2009 during the post-harvest season, involved 496 households with infants aged 1 to 12&#x000a0;months. The second survey revisited the same households and infants in 2010 during the harvest season. Results of the surveys indicated high prevalence of stunting; 34% in 2009 and 59% in 2010. Morbidity due to acute respiratory illness (ARI) was 64% in 2009 and 57% in 2010. Diarrhoea affected 48% children in 2009 and 37% in 2010. Prevalence of anaemia was high (11 - 60% in 2009; 20 - 75% in 2010). Complementary fluids and foods were introduced at the median age of 3.0&#x000a0;months and 90% of children had received these foods earlier than the recommended age of 6&#x000a0;months. Feeding frequencies (1.7 in 2009 and 2.4 in 2010) were lower than the age-specific World Health Organisation (WHO) recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Portion sizes for different types of relish/sauce were small.</p><p>Similar findings in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) have been documented in rural areas and have progressively worsened throughout the first year of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Systematic reviews of complementary feeding interventions have provided evidence of well adopted feeding practices, improved food recipes, increased dietary adequacy and growth and reduced prevalence of anaemia and morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The interventions included a combination of strategies, namely culturally-appropriate group nutrition education, individual counselling, interpersonal communication, home visits and mass media [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Great impact and sustainability of the interventions were achieved through participatory approaches and community involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The formative research in Dodoma showed that age-specific, systematic and locally relevant interventions are needed to ensure rural children receive the best possible start in life. To address the nutrition and health situation, intervention strategies were identified and contextualised according to, among other factors, local dietary patterns, meal preparation, food beliefs and preferences, food availability and cost and ability to change attitudes. The strategies were packaged as a nutrition education package. Opportunities that could optimise successful delivery of the package and encourage behaviour change include willingness to modifying some feeding options, seasonal availability and accessibility of foods, established set-up of village peers and existence of health centres and health staff in some villages. This paper describes the rationale, design and methods of a cluster randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition package in rural Tanzania.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives and hypothesis</title><p>The primary objective of the intervention trial is to implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a nutrition education package in improving infant and young child feeding practices, dietary adequacy and growth. The trial hypothesises that the nutrition education package will be more effective than the routine health education. The primary outcome will be linear growth as assessed by change in length-for-age Z scores. Secondary outcomes will include feeding practices, nutrients intake and level of knowledge on recommended practices. Results of the trial are expected to provide evidence to the effectiveness of the package in community settings and, where appropriate, recommendations to strengthen the nutrition component of health education in child health services.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Development of the nutrition education package</title><p>Intervention Mapping and Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] provided the theoretical framework for the design and development of the package and the intervention. The intervention mapping framework integrates theory, empirical findings from the literature and information collected from the target population to develop culturally appropriate and theoretically sound interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The framework has been used successfully to develop health behaviour interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This study applied consecutively and iteratively the six steps of intervention mapping.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Step 1: Needs assessment</title><p>Needs assessment involved a literature study on complementary feeding strategies in LMIC, review of secondary data on child health and the formative research conducted in 2009 and 2010 in the study area. Key informant interviews, focus group discussions, food market surveys and household surveys were conducted to obtain in-depth insight into the nutrition and health situation of infants and young children, community and household factors, parents&#x02019; motivations and behaviours that facilitate and constrain infant and young child feeding and health.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Step 2: Identifying intervention performance and change objectives</title><p>Results from <italic>Step 1</italic> were used to identify behaviours, motivations, barriers, predisposing and enabling factors associated with inadequate dietary intake, morbidity and poor growth. A conceptual framework illustrating expected behaviours and mediating factors for improvement of child growth was developed (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Aspects that will be implemented by the intervention are also presented. The overall intervention objective &#x0201c;improve feeding practices, dietary adequacy and growth of infants and young children (6&#x02013;15 months)&#x0201d; was formulated and divided into sub-objectives and behavioural performance objectives (i.e. target behaviours that have to be accomplished by the target group to achieve the intervention objective). A matrix of intervention objectives and behavioural performance objectives, classifying individual and environmental determinants as mediating mechanisms and modifying conditions was developed (See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Discussions with district health experts and village health committees helped to refine the intervention further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Step 3: Selection of theory-based intervention methods and techniques</title><p>Theoretical methods considered to influence changes of performance objectives (i.e. target behaviours) were identified and practical strategies were selected to put the theoretical methods into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], individual nutrition education and counselling interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and summary of theoretical methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] were used in the selection of existing methods and techniques, and the development of new strategies which fitted our intervention and behavioural objectives. Theory of Planned Behaviour was used as the main focus of behavioural change during the selection of theory-based methods and strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The theory has been widely employed in health and nutrition behaviour change studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], including infant feeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The theory facilitates an understanding of how behavioural intentions influence actual behaviour change, with skills, abilities and environmental factors acting as important moderators of change.</p><p>The theoretical methods were translated into practical strategies and these were related to the levels of the intervention. An example includes a behavioural objective and outcome expectation of &#x0201c;adding mashed animal-source food to infant meals at least 3 times per week would provide nutrients to make a child grow well and offer protection against common illnesses.&#x0201d; A mother will be willing and more likely to apply the recommendation using the following methods and techniques:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>the individualisation method to provide opportunities for mothers to have personal questions and concerns about child feeding answered (e.g. what to feed, how to feed) or instructions paced according to individual progress;</p></list-item><list-item><p>cognitive skills training with guided practice to influence self-efficacy;</p></list-item><list-item><p>tailoring to increase practical knowledge on selection and preparation of new food recipes; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>mobilising social support (e.g. trained peers, sensitised family members and health facility staff) to offer encouragement and support, and likely to help the mother to maintain optimal child feeding practices.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Step 4: Developing the intervention and pre-testing</title><p>The intervention objectives, selected methods and strategies were combined and a nutrition education package was developed. The nutrition education package is composed of four components, namely 1) education and counselling of mothers, 2) training community-based nutrition counsellors and monthly home visits, 3) sensitisation meetings, and 4) supervision of community-based nutrition counsellors. Draft versions of the package were discussed with district health and nutrition experts, village health committees and fine-tuned by the research team. Behavioural change at the individual level is intended for mothers of rural infants aged 6&#x000a0;months through education and counselling sessions and cooking demonstrations. Based on local typical meals, the intervention will promote preparation and consumption of a variety of foods. Behavioural change at the family level will consist of sensitisation meetings with family members of targeted infants. This will help to create a nutrition-promoting environment. At the community level, the intervention will train community-based peers such as village health workers, lay counsellors and resource persons to support mothers and families through home visits. In addition, sensitisation meetings with health facility staff will help to reinforce and support mothers&#x02019; behaviour change.</p><p>Training and educational resources were developed to support the implementation of the package. These include: 1) Training guide for community-based nutrition counsellors, 2) Manual for community-based nutrition counsellors, 3) Educational plan for mothers, 4) Information booklet for mothers and families, and 5) Counselling cards. The resources contain topics on breast feeding, complementary feeding, selection and preparation of locally available foods, feeding during illness, healthcare-seeking, hygiene and home environment sanitation. In addition to these, resources for nutrition counsellors cover communication skills, behaviour change communication and counselling skills. The developed resources were pre-tested with a convenient sample to assess whether the content and format were realistic, understandable, culturally appropriate, visually appealing and motivating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Step 5: Implementation plan of intervention</title><p>The intervention strategy is centred on the child with their mothers as the primary target group. To stimulate lasting behaviour change, ensure continuity, and enhance linkage between communities and health facilities, secondary target groups have been incorporated in the intervention. These include family members (fathers, grandmothers, school-going siblings), community-based nutrition counsellors and healthy facility staff. Supportive structures such as district health management team and village health committees will be consulted regularly to enhance intervention support and feedback.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Step 6: Evaluation plan of intervention</title><p>The effectiveness of the nutrition education package is evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial, whereby villages will be randomly allocated to receive a nutrition education package or routine health education. The intervention group will receive the nutrition education package, whereas the control group will continue to receive routine health education given monthly at health facilities. Children aged 6&#x000a0;months and their families will be recruited and followed up for 9&#x000a0;months. Extensive process evaluation will also be performed to document reach, dose and fidelity of the intervention trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study setting</title><p>The intervention will be conducted in Mpwapwa District in Dodoma Region, central Tanzania. Dodoma is among the regions in the country with the highest prevalence of stunting, 44.4% in 2005 and 56.0% in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The District has a total population of 304,096 and 67,577 households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The region is predominantly semi-arid, characterised by a short single wet season (November to March) and a long dry season (May to mid-November). Subsistence farming and traditional rearing of animals are the primary economic activities. The district health system makes child health services available through a network of 43 dispensaries, 2 health centres and 1 district hospital. Mpwapwa district is administratively divided into 3 divisions, 18 wards, and 84 villages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A village is the lowest administrative unit and is considered as a geopolitical unit and intact social group. It has a local government authority and committees. Each village usually has two village health workers. They work as volunteers, mainly to assist health facility staff during immunisation and child growth monitoring activities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Study design</title><p>The intervention trial will use a parallel cluster-randomised controlled trial design (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) and will be conducted and reported in line with the CONSORT recommendations for cluster randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Because the intervention will be delivered in community settings and encourage collective participation at household settings, to minimise contamination and facilitate logistical convenience in delivery, the unit of randomisation will be the village. Villages will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control study groups. The intervention duration will be 9&#x000a0;months. Infants will be recruited when aged 6&#x000a0;months and followed up until they attain 15&#x000a0;months.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>
<bold>Trial profile.</bold>
</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2014_7188_Fig1_HTML" id="d30e531"/></fig></p><p>The control group will continue to receive routine health education, a standard government health service for children below the age of five years, offered monthly by health staff at health facilities. Routine health education offers education to mothers during growth monitoring and immunisation contacts. The sessions are usually short (10&#x02013;15 minutes) and focus on general health issues including child feeding, prevention of diseases such as malaria and importance of immunisations.</p><p>The intervention group will receive the nutrition education package in addition to the routine health education. Mothers and caregivers will receive 3 sessions of education and counselling on optimal infant and young child feeding and health, when the child reaches 6&#x000a0;months, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months. Nutrition counsellors will receive training at baseline and the session will be repeated after 6&#x000a0;months. After training, the nutrition counsellors will conduct monthly home visits to counsel and support mothers and their families. Supervisory visits will be conducted by the research team after every 2&#x000a0;months to assess counsellors&#x02019; work. Separate sensitisation meetings with families and health staff responsible for child health will be conducted at baseline and meeting will be repeated after 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sampling and randomisation</title><p>A village forms a unit of randomisation for the trial, while infants and their parents within the village will form units of observation. Two out of three Divisions (Kibakwe, Mpwapwa, Rudi) in the district will be selected by simple random sampling. A list of all villages in the selected divisions will be compiled, and villages found to have an on-going intervention or project will be excluded. Eighteen villages will be selected from the list by simple random sampling. The preselected villages will be listed alphabetically. A simple randomisation with a 1:1 allocation will be used to randomise villages to either control or intervention group. A list of random numbers will be generated in MS Excel 2007 and the generated values will be fixed by copying them as &#x0201c;values&#x0201d; next to the alphabetic list of the preselected villages. These will then be arranged in ascending order according to the generated random numbers: and the first 9 will be selected as intervention clusters and the last 9 as control clusters.</p><p>Generation of allocation sequence and randomisation of clusters will be done by a statistician blinded to study groups and not participating in the research. Data collectors will be masked of the village allocation by not informing them of the allocation, not being part of trial implementers and not being residents in any of the villages. However, trial participants may know if they are in the intervention or control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size estimate</title><p>The sample size was calculated for unmatched cluster-randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] as follows:

A coefficient of variation between clusters (k) of 0.1 was assumed and 30 infants per cluster based on district&#x02019;s estimates of birth rates. Data from the 2009 formative survey were used to make assumptions on change of values of the primary outcome length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ): a mean LAZ of &#x02212;1.5 and a standard deviation of 1.3 in the control group. From the formula, 8.9 (~9) clusters will be needed to detect at least a 0.35 difference in LAZ between intervention and control groups, with the power of 80% (Z<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.84) and a statistical significance of 5% (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Z<sub>&#x003b1;/2</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.96, two-tailed test). A total of 270 infants will be enrolled in each study group. Allowing for a 10% loss to follow-up, a sample size of 297 infants, i.e. 33 per village, will be required. A total of 594 (~600) infants will be recruited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Recruitment and collection of baseline information</title><p>After cluster randomisation, sub-village leaders will identify all infants aged 6&#x000a0;months and their parents in a systematic door-to-door survey.

Procedures for preparing nutritious meals based on promoted recipes will be described during the sessions. The recipes are based on meat, legumes, vegetables and root/tuber, and the foods can be eaten alone as a complete meal or eaten with cooked staple (stiff porridge <italic>ugali</italic>, rice, green banana, cassava). Under the guidance of the researcher, mothers of recruited infants and community-based nutrition counsellors will centrally prepare meals based on proposed recipes. One portion will be fed on-site and another given for feeding at home on the same day. Responsive feeding styles will be practiced by mothers during the feeding sessions and observed. For each cooking session, recipes will be alternated to reduce monotony, improve texture and flavour, and stimulate reflex chewing. Mothers will be encouraged to try the recipes and other feeding recommendations at home. Information booklets containing topic content, recipe examples and promoted recommendations will be distributed after the first session.</p><p>After cooking demonstrations, mothers will be invited for individual counselling. The counselling sessions will include listening, learning about their difficulties and assessing the situation, providing relevant information, and building mother&#x02019;s confidence to modify behaviours and overcome barriers. The mother will be referred to nutrition counsellors in her village for support and follow-up during the monthly home visits. Follow-up visits at home will be done by community-based nutrition counsellors. After completion of each session (Part 1, 2, and 3), mothers will be encouraged to set achievable goals (i.e. to prompt intention to try the recommendations). Feedback regarding the set goals will be reviewed during the next education session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Component 2: Training community-based nutrition counsellors and monthly home visits</title><p>This component aims to empower community-based nutrition counsellors with action-oriented knowledge and skills to effectively counsel and negotiate with mothers and families to adopt recommended practices. In each intervention village, 2 individuals will be recruited and trained to carry out four major tasks: 1) counsel and support mothers and their families during home visits, 2) refer infants identified with danger signs of illnesses and malnutrition to health facilities, 3) supervise cooking demonstrations during the education sessions and 4) mobilise mothers for outcome assessments. Potential individuals will be nominated by village leaders in their respective villages, and the research team will interview and recruit the most suitable candidates. To be selected, a candidate has to be aged between 25 and 45&#x000a0;years, be a resident in the village with no plans of leaving within a year, has completed at least 7&#x000a0;years of formal education and has personal experience in infant feeding. In addition, the candidate will have to demonstrate that they have time, are eager to participate in the trial and willing to undertake home visits.</p><p>All recruited nutrition counsellors will be centrally trained for 3&#x000a0;days. The first training session will be conducted at the beginning of the intervention whereas the second session of similar content will be repeated 6&#x000a0;months later (i.e. when infants are aged 12&#x000a0;months). The training will contain three modules. <bold>Module 1</bold> will focus on orientation and introduction, why nutrition matters during the first two years of life, feeding principles and practices, use of locally available foods to make nutritious complementary meals, child health and preventive measures. <bold>Module 2</bold> will focus on communication skills, behaviour change communication, counselling skills and negotiation, problem solving (trying different solutions to common problems), use of counselling resources, field practice and feedback on field practice. <bold>Module 3</bold> will focus on home visits tasks and procedures, use of counselling resources, supervisory visits and training evaluation. A standardised test with multiple and open-ended questions will be given before and after training to test knowledge and attitudes about child feeding and health. The training methodology will include lectures, small group activities and discussions, plenary discussions, demonstrations, role plays, and hands-on field practice with mothers in villages which will not be part of the intervention. Theoretical training will be followed by practical exercises designed to test performance. During the practice sessions, they will be observed and their skills discussed for improvement during plenary sessions. After training, counsellors will be issued counselling resources (counselling cards, workbook, family card, referral slip, counselling manual) as home visiting tools.</p><p>The nutrition counsellors will begin home visits immediately after their training. Each nutrition counsellor will be assigned 10&#x02013;12 mothers residing in their village and each mother will be individually visited and counselled. They will make home visits once per month for 9&#x000a0;months of the intervention period. Mothers with sick children or children with feeding problems will be offered additional visits. The counselling will take place at home to ensure other family members can also take part in the sessions. The counsellors will be responsible for keeping home visits records in workbooks. These will include:</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>behaviour adopted by mothers;</p></list-item><list-item><p>issues discussed, barriers, next/missed appointments;</p></list-item><list-item><p>referrals to health facilities given to infants with danger signs of childhood illnesses; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>in-depth information of best-case and worst-case household circumstances for lessons learned during the intervention.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Achievements and unresolved difficulties during the visits will be discussed during supervisory or monitoring visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Component 3: Supervision of community-based nutrition counsellors</title><p>The aim of supervising nutrition counsellors is two-fold: 1) to reinforce theoretical knowledge, counselling and practical skills learned during training, and 2) to give support and feedback needed to address child nutrition challenges in their communities. Supervisory visits coupled with observed counselling sessions, review of home visits workbooks and discussions on feedback will be made by the research team to assess the quality of counsellors&#x02019; work. An observation checklist for individual counselling will be used to assess practice on interpersonal skills, active listening, effective use of counselling resources, offer referrals appropriately, promote problem-solving among mothers, and discuss practical solutions. Counsellors will receive a simple score of 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Yes, sufficient&#x0201d; or 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;Yes, limited&#x0201d; if a correct practice is observed, and 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0201c;None at all&#x0201d; if the practice is not done. Supervisory visits will take place in the villages at 2-weeks interval in the first 2&#x000a0;months of intervention, and thereafter visits will be made at 2-month interval.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Component 4: Sensitisation meetings</title><p>Sensitisation meetings will be held in intervention villages in the form of presentations and discussions with selected groups likely to influence the success and sustainability of the intervention.

A 1 to 2&#x000a0;hour sensitisation meeting will be held with fathers, grandmothers and older siblings of recruited infants. The structure of the meeting will consist of four parts: Intervention rationale, content and activities; why nutrition matters during the first two years of life; promoted recommendations and their role in supporting mothers; and importance of adherence to intervention for its success.

A 3 to 4&#x000a0;hour sensitisation meeting will take place in respective villages. At the meeting, the intervention will be outlined and its implications for community infants and young child discussed. Other topics for presentation and discussion will include why nutrition matters during the first two years of life; feeding principles and practices, use of locally available foods to make nutritious complementary meals, and key messages to share with the mothers.

Data will be analysed using STATA release 12.0 (STATA Corporation, Texas, 2007). Frequency distributions will be run to identify outliers. Impact evaluation data will be compared between intervention and control villages using hierarchical or multi-level models and presented at the cluster and individual levels. The methods will provide adjustment for potential covariates and confounders at the cluster and individual levels. Data will be analysed by intention to treat. Linear mixed models will be used for continuous outcomes (e.g. growth parameters) with cluster, household, and child as random effects to account for clustered observations. Generalised linear mixed models will be used for discrete outcomes (e.g. frequency of specific food intakes, practices, etc.). Random effects logistic regression analyses, taking clustering into account, will be used where appropriate. Values of p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p><p>The process evaluation data will use both inductive and deductive approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] to analyse qualitative data. The data will include structured observation checklists, in-depth interviews, and documents. From these, frequent, major, or significant themes inherent in raw data will be identified and coded. After coding, the transcripts will be entered in and analysed using NVivo version 10 (QSR International, Australia). Content will be analysed in terms of countable concepts/objects e.g. descriptive statistics, or in the broadest terms (e.g. majority, some, very few). Direct quotations from the group discussions will also be provided. Key analytical categories will be identified and interpreted to explore all aspects of intervention delivery, identify factors contributing to intervention success or failure, if intervention results have been affected by implementation process, and document encountered barriers. Within the intervention group, outcomes will be compared between groups of people with high and low scores for a process evaluation characteristic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>By offering age-specific, practical problem-solving education and counselling on feeding and health care practices, and ensuring continuous support, it is expected that the nutrition education package will result in a larger impact on dietary adequacy, growth and health than could be achieved through routine health education alone. The package will look into improving the quality of nutrition education, interpersonal skills needed to communicate nutrition recommendations and capacity of families to act on nutrition recommendations. The package will achieve these through the implementation of its components: education and counselling mothers; training community-based nutrition counsellors and monthly home visits; sensitisation meetings with families and health facility staff; and supervision of community-based nutrition counsellors. With respect to the multi-component nature of this intervention, understanding of outcome results and implementation pathway need to be well documented. Implementation or process data are critical to understand what, how and why an intervention works or does not work. For a successful intervention to be replicated, data on implementation are necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. In developing country settings, where resources are limited and basic public health problems prevalent, knowledge of implementation is critical to promote effective programmes, their replication and expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>This intervention study is in line with a global focus on infant and young child nutrition. In addition, infant and young child feeding is one of the priority areas specified in the Tanzania&#x02019;s National Nutrition Strategy (July 2011-June 2016). The intervention has included components that are likely to enhance maintenance of behaviour after completion of intervention. Mothers, caregivers and family members who participate in the intervention will serve as future reference points for other households. To influence long-lasting behaviour change, trained community-based nutrition counsellors will remain a valuable resource to their respective villages and district. Sensitised health facility staff will apply gained knowledge and attitudinal change to counsel mothers during routine well-baby and sick-child visits. The intervention components can feasibly be integrated into existing health services and district health plans. If successful, the approach used to deliver the nutrition education package could be easily and inexpensively scaled and disseminated in other rural villages in the country.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First of all, potential risks may arise due to lack of double blinding. Parents of study infants and nutrition counsellors allocated to intervention group may be aware of the allocated arm. To minimise this limitation, data collectors will be kept blinded to village allocation and will not be residents in intervention or control villages. Intervention implementers will not be part of the team collecting outcome data. The second limitation is that self-reporting measurements such as maternal recall of recommended practices may overestimate nutrition outcomes and behaviours due to recall bias. In this trial, the recall period will be relatively short (past week or past two weeks) to optimise the reliability of self-reports. Thirdly, the intervention duration of 9&#x000a0;months is relatively short to assess change of certain behaviour and the sustained effects. However, it was observed in previous trials that similar outcome measures demonstrated change within 6&#x000a0;months of intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the effects were sustained 3 and 12&#x000a0;months after intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. This trial is designed to assess outcomes within the common intervention duration of 6&#x000a0;months as well as follow-up measurements to allow evaluation of short and mid-term effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec39"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12889_2014_7188_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
