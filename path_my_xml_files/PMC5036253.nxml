In addition, physical examinations, vital signs assessments, clinical laboratory tests (haematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis), electrocardiogram and endoscopy were performed to determine the status of gastric or duodenal ulceration; antimicrobial susceptibility testing (standard agar plate dilution method) was also conducted to investigate levels of resistance of <italic>H pylori</italic> to the antimicrobial drugs being administered.</p><p>At the end of the first-line eradication therapy, physical examinations, vital signs assessments, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory tests and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 genotyping tests were performed. <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication was determined by <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath tests with UBIT 100&#x02005;mg tablets (Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) using a cut-off of 2.5%. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and concomitant medications were monitored throughout the study. All TEAEs including their severity and causality, as well as those leading to study drug discontinuation and serious TEAEs were descriptively summarised and categorised in terms of System Organ Class and Preferred Term by treatment group in the safety analysis set (all subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug).

The sample size was therefore calculated relative to that in a previous phase III study of lansoprazole-based triple therapy<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> conducted by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd. To ensure an eradication rate of 90%, the protocol-defined sample size was determined as 200 subjects per treatment group (the vonoprazan group and the lansoprazole group) to have a &#x0003e;90% power to detect the non-inferiority of vonoprazan to lansoprazole with a non-inferiority margin of 10% using the Farrington and Manning test.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Taking into account possible dropouts (approximately 10% of subjects) after randomisation, a total of 220 subjects were targeted for recruitment for each treatment group. However, at the time that the study was initiated, it was clear that the <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rates with first-line triple therapy were declining, particularly due to the increasing prevalence of CLR-resistant strains in Japan, which had risen to around 30%.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Consequently, to ensure that the statistical power of the study was maintained, a blinded interim analysis was included in the protocol to ascertain the pooled first-line <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rate with <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath tests performed in approximately 200 consecutive subjects before unblinding of the treatment. According to the interim estimate of the first-line <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rate, 81.6%, the target number of subjects required for the primary end point was determined to be 318 per treatment group, and the target number of subjects to be randomised was increased to 324 per treatment group (allowing for a 2% dropout rate). The sample size was recalculated in a blinded fashion and was thought unlikely to impact on the type I error rate.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> With an assumed pooled eradication rate of 90% and the original sample size of 440, it was estimated that there would be at least 44 subjects failing their allocated vonoprazan-based or lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy. Thus, in the protocol, 50 subjects were targeted for the second-line eradication phase.</p><p>For the primary and secondary end points, frequency, point estimates and two-sided 95% CIs were calculated by treatment group for the full analysis set (FAS; all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the study drug). The non-inferiority of vonoprazan-based first-line triple therapy to lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy was evaluated for the primary end point using the Farrington and Manning test with a non-inferiority margin of 10%.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test (with Yates's continuity correction) of the difference between treatments was also performed as a post hoc analysis for the primary end point including subgroup analyses. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was also performed.

However, the subgroup results should be interpreted as hypothesis-generating, given the smaller size of some subgroups and the exploratory nature of the subgroup analyses.</p><p>Moreover, the study had some potential limitations. First, individuals with active or bleeding ulcers were excluded and therefore the study results cannot be generalised to these patients, even though PPI-based triple therapy has been shown to produce comparable eradication of <italic>H pylori</italic> in patients with active ulcer and those with ulcer scars alike.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Also, as no <italic>H pylori</italic> efficacy data for vonoprazan were available when the study was planned and <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rates with triple therapy were known to be declining, there was some loss of precision when determining the original sample size. However, a pre-planned blinded interim analysis was included in the protocol to ensure that a sufficient number of subjects were recruited in the study to achieve the desired statistical power, so that the efficacy of the two regimens could be accurately compared. Additionally, the post hoc statistical analysis testing for the superiority of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole was not pre-planned. However, the pre-planned calculation of 95% CIs in the primary analysis suggested a statistically significant difference in favour of vonoprazan, thus corroborating the post hoc analysis testing. Furthermore, the observed sizable clinical treatment difference in the eradication rate favouring vonoprazan, together with consistently favourable outcomes across a number of subgroups with vonoprazan, also provides evidence for the hypothesis of greater efficacy of vonoprazan compared with lansoprazole for the treatment of <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication.</p><p>CLR resistance is becoming a global clinical concern for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication, especially in Japan where the drug has been available for the longest time.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> As a consequence, the loss of efficacy of traditional PPI-based triple therapy has become a compelling issue, and a number of treatment approaches have been advocated to help improve <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Eradication rates were reported to be higher with high-dose PPI-based triple therapy or with 10-day to 14-day treatment regimens.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Due to the importance of this issue, a potentially important post hoc finding in our study was that the <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication rate among those infected with CLR-resistant strains was significantly higher with vonoprazan-based first-line triple therapy compared with lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy (p&#x0003c;0.0001) and also appears to be higher than the eradication rate reported with increased dose or length of treatment with PPI-based therapy. Nevertheless, the efficacy of vonoprazan shown in CLR-resistant strains should be viewed cautiously, given the cross-study nature of the analyses. Additionally, the relatively lighter mean body weight of the Japanese subjects may have favourably affected the study results. A high second-line eradication rate was another important finding in our study, though the sample size was small.</p><p>While the mechanism for a high eradication rate with vonoprazan observed in those infected with CLR-resistant strains remains unclear, it may be accounted for in part by the potential synergy between vonoprazan and the antimicrobials used. <italic>H pylori</italic> is more susceptible to antimicrobials when it restores its replicative capability at a pH higher than 6.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Vonoprazan has a highly potent gastric acid-inhibitory effect as it accumulates in high concentrations and becomes slowly cleared from gastric glands,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;19</xref> and consequently potentially provides an environment in which antimicrobials can have greater efficacy. In addition, co-administration of omeprazole, a PPI, has been shown to increase the chemical stability of AMX and CLR in gastric juice, thus preventing the antimicrobials, which are fragile at lower pH levels, from degradation.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer Working Group recommend that all countries explore the possibility of introducing population-based <italic>H pylori</italic> screening and treatment programmes, adjusted to local healthcare environments and needs. This is based on findings from randomised clinical trials, which demonstrated the effectiveness of <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication in preventing gastric cancer, which is considered a global health problem, as well as on health-economic models which have shown that <italic>H pylori</italic> screening and treatment may prove to be cost-effective.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Given the increasing resistance to antimicrobials and the declining clinical response rates observed with current treatments, vonoprazan-based triple therapy may represent a new treatment option for <italic>H pylori</italic>-positive patients and has the potential to reduce gastric cancer.</p><p>In conclusion, vonoprazan-based triple therapy was shown to be effective as first-line and second-line treatments, and was well tolerated. As a promising new treatment option, vonoprazan may also be considered for additional therapeutic approaches, such as sequential, quadruple and long-term therapy for <italic>H pylori</italic> eradication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Richard Jenkins from Takeda Development Centre, Europe, G&#x000f6;ran Hasselgren and Fiona Steinkamp of Takeda Pharmaceuticals International GmbH for reviewing the manuscript.
