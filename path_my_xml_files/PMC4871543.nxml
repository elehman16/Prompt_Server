This study aimed to determine the acute effects of 3 hours of morning versus evening blue-enriched light exposure compared to dim light on hunger, metabolic function, and physiological arousal. Nineteen healthy adults completed this 4-day inpatient protocol under dim light conditions (&#x0003c;20lux). Participants were randomized to 3 hours of blue-enriched light exposure on Day 3 starting either 0.5 hours after wake (n = 9; morning group) or 10.5 hours after wake (n = 10; evening group). All participants remained in dim light on Day 2 to serve as their baseline. Subjective hunger and sleepiness scales were collected hourly. Blood was sampled at 30-minute intervals for 4 hours in association with the light exposure period for glucose, insulin, cortisol, leptin, and ghrelin. Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and area under the curve (AUC) for insulin, glucose, HOMA-IR and cortisol were calculated. Comparisons relative to baseline were done using t-tests and repeated measures ANOVAs. In both the morning and evening groups, insulin total area, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-IR AUC were increased and subjective sleepiness was reduced with blue-enriched light compared to dim light. The evening group, but not the morning group, had significantly higher glucose peak value during blue-enriched light exposure compared to dim light. There were no other significant differences between the morning or the evening groups in response to blue-enriched light exposure. Blue-enriched light exposure acutely alters glucose metabolism and sleepiness, however the mechanisms behind this relationship and its impacts on hunger and appetite regulation remain unclear. These results provide further support for a role of environmental light exposure in the regulation of metabolism.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32HL790915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheung</surname><given-names>Ivy N.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8UL1TR000150-05</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004320</institution-id><institution>Philips</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2011 Philips Consumer Lifestyle Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reid</surname><given-names>Kathryn J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002600</institution-id><institution>American Sleep Medicine Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malkani</surname><given-names>Roneil G.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution>Philips Respironics</institution></funding-source><award-id>Educational Research Gift</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zee</surname><given-names>Phyllis C.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>National Institutes of Health: 5T32HL790915 (INC), 8UL1TR000150-05 to Clinical Research Unit, American Sleep Medicine Foundation (RGM), and Philips Consumer Lifestyle Research Grant 2011 (KJR and PCZ).

The impacts of light exposure on hunger and metabolism are of particular interest. There are at least two potential mechanisms by which alterations in light-dark exposure may impact hunger and metabolism, one is via the circadian system, and the second is via physiological arousal.</p><p>The circadian system controls the timing of physiological and behavioral rhythms such as rest and activity patterns [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], alertness [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], hunger and appetite [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and glucose and insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Perturbations to these rhythms have been associated with poor health [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The strongest exogenous modulator of the central circadian clock is the pattern of light-dark exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], with the circadian system most sensitive to blue-wavelength light [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Not only does light-dark exposure change across the day, but the wavelength of light also varies across the day [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Light exposure also impacts the level of physiological arousal, such as sleepiness, alertness [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and cortisol levels [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Cortisol levels also influence hepatic and peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity and, consequently, circulating glucose levels [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], thereby providing another possible path by which light exposure may impact metabolism.</p><p>Recent studies in humans have examined the impact of light exposure on body weight and metabolism. Studies manipulating morning light exposure are typically associated with leaner body weight, lower body fat and altered appetite outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. On the other hand, later timing of light tends to be associated with heavier body weight. Recent work from our group in adults reports an association between the timing of habitual light exposure and body mass index (BMI); people with a later mean timing of light exposure over 500 lux (MLiT500) had a higher BMI [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Furthermore, shift work, which is often accompanied by increased light exposure at night, is associated with higher BMI [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and risk of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, few studies have examined the impact of evening light, as opposed to light at night, on hunger, weight regulation, and metabolism. There is significant variation in hunger across the day, corresponding with endogenous circadian rhythms; specifically, a 17% difference in hunger between the morning trough and evening peak [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As such, the impact of light exposure on hunger should be studied at different times of day.</p><p>Animal studies suggest that the timing of light exposure impacts the timing of food intake and therefore metabolism, which in turn influences weight regulation [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. For example, mice subjected to constant light show an increase in food intake during the normal rest period, decreased energy expenditure, loss of circadian variation in insulin sensitivity, and higher body weight gain, despite similar overall caloric intake compared to mice kept in a normal light-dark cycle. However, weight and fat gain even while under constant light were attenuated when food intake was restricted to the normal active period [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Although evidence from both human and animal studies suggests that light exposure modulates food intake, metabolic function, and weight regulation, most studies have examined light exposure at only one time of day despite known circadian variations in these functions. Additionally, these studies examine impacts of light exposure over time, leading us to postulate that acute actions of light exposure (that may lead to these longer term outcomes) may occur via immediate alterations to hunger and/or metabolism. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of 3 hours of morning versus evening blue-enriched light exposure on hunger, metabolic function, and physiological arousal. We hypothesized that morning blue-enriched light would decrease overall hunger and positively impact metabolic function, while evening blue-enriched light would increase hunger and negatively impact metabolic function and that these effects would be associated with changes in physiological arousal, namely cortisol and sleepiness levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>The Northwestern University Institutional Review Board approved this study and all participants provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Nineteen healthy adults were recruited from the Chicago area with fliers and newspaper advertisements.

While the content of breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals were different, the content of a specific meal was the same on each experimental day (i.e. breakfast on Days 2 and 3 was identical, but was different from lunch). Participants consumed at least 90% of their meals and there were no statistically significant differences in overall and carbohydrate intake on Days 2 and 3.

Measurement of 24 inches distance from the light box was done at a downward angle from eye level to the light box. Light exposure was conducted as follows: overhead lights were turned on and the light from the light boxes was gradually increased using the four intensity settings on the light boxes in 5-minute increments at 280, 320, 340, and 370 lux and similarly tapered down in a reversed manner starting 15 minutes prior to completion of the three-hour light exposure condition. Participants were monitored closely by research staff during light exposure conditions and were instructed to face forward and keep eyes open while engaging in seated activities such as reading or watching movies. Light exposure in lux at the eye level was monitored using a lux meter (Minolta Auto Light Meter IV F) during dim light condition set ups and throughout the blue-enriched light exposure period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Outcome Measures</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Screening and Demographics</title><p>Wrist activity monitoring was conducted for one week of screening and one additional week immediately prior to the CRU visit using actiwatches (Actiwatch-L and Spectrum, Philips Respironics) to measure average weekday rest start time, rest end time, and total sleep time. Actigraphy analysis was done using Actiware (version 5, Philips Respironics) with the aid of the sleep log, and a valid day was defined as one without any off-wrist time during the rest interval and with less than 4 hours of off-wrist time in a 24-hour period. Midpoint of sleep was calculated as the average time between rest start time and rest end time. Time above light threshold (TALT) of 1,000 lux for white light was calculated as the average minutes per day with light exposure above 1,000 lux for the week of recording.</p><p>Height and weight were taken by clinical research staff upon arrival to the CRU and body mass index was calculated as [weight (kg)/(height (m))<sup>2</sup>].</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Hunger</title><p>The VASH [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] assesses participants&#x02019; hunger, desire to eat, amount of food that they could eat, and fullness. A hunger composite score (Hcomp) was calculated using the formula Hcomp = [(hunger) + (desire) + (amount) + 100 &#x02013;(full)]/4 to yield an Hcomp score between 0&#x02013;100, with a higher value indicative of greater hunger.

Ghrelin was measured with a Millipore total ghrelin RIA kit, with standards from 150 to 9600 pg/mL, inter-assay precision of 14.7&#x02013;17.8%, and intra-assay precision of 3.3&#x02013;10.0%.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Metabolic Function</title><p>Glucose was measured using the glucose oxidase method on a Beckman CX3D Analyzer. Insulin was measured by chemiluminescent immunoassay on a Siemens Immulite 2000 with sensitivity limited to 14.4 pmol/L. Blood samples were taken for 4 hours at 30 minute intervals. The first sample was taken 30 minutes before the scheduled light exposure period and the second sample was taken 30 minutes later during light exposure but before the meal. To determine the impact of light following a meal, a meal was given 30 minutes after the first sample. The third to seventh samples were taken during the light exposure period and the eighth to ninth samples were taken following the light exposure period.</p><p>The homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated as glucose (mg/dl) x insulin (&#x003bc;U/mL)/405, using the second sample on each day immediately prior to the meal, which was after 30 minutes of blue-enriched light exposure on Day 3.</p><p>When used for diagnostic purposes, HOMA-IR is validated under fasting conditions. However, experimentally HOMA-IR has been used to compare relative insulin resistance under the following conditions: post breakfast, midday meal and evening meal in sleep restricted versus rested states [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], as HOMA-IR total area across 24 hours in sleep restricted versus rested states [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and to measure insulin resistance 0&#x02013;6 hours after the breakfast meal in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>For the morning group, the HOMA-IR is fasting (14 hour fast between the evening meal at 11hrs after wake and the following morning&#x02019;s meal at 1hr after wake), while for the evening group HOMA-IR is calculated following a 5.5 hour fast. In a previous study, a reasonable correlation between glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR values from overnight fast samples and samples taken 4 hours after the lunch meal [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] have been shown.

These time points were selected to allow for a fasting baseline blood sample, a blood sample with light exposure before the meal, and blood samples following the meal during light exposure. The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) was missing for one morning and one evening group participant. A single blood sample was missing for one morning group participant and out of range insulin levels for one participant in the morning group were removed. One morning group participant had an Actiwatch failure during the week prior to the CRU stay.

Specifically, both the morning and evening blue-enriched light exposure resulted in higher insulin resistance relative to dim light. In the evening group, blue-enriched light also led to higher peak glucose compared to dim light, suggesting an inability of insulin to adequately compensate for the increase in glucose at this time of day.</p><p>While blue-enriched light clearly altered subjective alertness in the evening, the lack of effect on subjective hunger was surprising considering the findings from a previous study showing changes in subjective appetite with morning bright light exposure [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is possible that, unlike subjective alertness, a single acute light exposure may not be sufficient to illicit changes in subjective hunger. However, repeated daily exposures or exposure while in a natural environment (as opposed to a laboratory setting with controlled food intake and little physical activity) may lead to different outcomes more in line with these prior field-based studies.</p><p>There was also no effect of blue-enriched light exposure on hormonal measures of hunger/satiety (leptin and ghrelin). This is in contrast to findings from Figueiro and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reporting changes in leptin and ghrelin in response to morning red, green, and blue light following sleep restriction (5 hours of time in bed). This difference could be explained by the sleep restriction in their study, while the participants in the current study were given more opportunity to sleep (8 hours of time in bed) prior to light exposure.</p><p>In both rodents [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and humans [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], daily light exposure patterns are associated with body weight, body composition, and metabolism even after taking caloric intake into account. Given these reports, light&#x02019;s influence on weight regulation likely involves other mechanisms beyond a potential increase in caloric intake due to changes in hunger/appetite. One possible mechanism is the impact of blue-enriched light exposure on glucose metabolism, as observed in these earlier animal studies and in the current study. The metabolic response to blue-enriched light exposure was quick; within 30 minutes of blue-enriched light exposure onset, HOMA-IR was 30% higher in the morning and 19% higher in the evening compared to dim light exposure. It is plausible that extended or more chronic exposure to blue-enriched light may further impact insulin resistance, given that HOMA-IR is 50&#x02013;65% higher in the morning with repeated sleep restriction compared to the fully rested state [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These changes in insulin resistance with blue-enriched light exposure could, over time, impact feeding behaviors, body composition, and/or body weight.</p><p>The differential effect of morning compared to evening light on peak glucose and the subsequent possibility that participants are less able to maintain glucose with increased insulin secretion in the evening may be due to the fact that glucose levels are naturally greater following the evening meal than the morning meal [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which influences the ability of insulin to bring down glucose levels during evening light exposure. While the effects of a single pulse of blue-enriched light in the morning or the evening on glucose and insulin levels suggest that light exposure later in the day may be detrimental [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], they do not necessarily support the idea of morning light being beneficial [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is also unclear whether these effects would continue to be observed with repeated daily exposures.</p><p>The lack of change in cortisol in response to blue-enriched light exposure was surprising given our hypothesis that the effects of light exposure on hunger and metabolism may occur via increases in sympathetic activation, in particular via light exposure&#x02019;s effects on cortisol. There are, however, several potential explanations for why we observed no significant change. One possibility is that we may not have sampled cortisol frequently enough. If cortisol drove the effects on glucose metabolism that were observed within 30 minutes of light exposure, cortisol would need to change almost immediately following onset of light exposure, and 30 minute sampling of cortisol may not be sufficient. Another explanation is that the effects of light exposure may not have a significant effect on cortisol; evidence of this in the literature is equivocal, with some studies showing decreases in cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] while others show increases in cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Finally, Fonken and colleagues concluded that the reductions in corticosterone that they observed in mice under conditions of bright light for 8 weeks were due to masking of the glucocorticoid rhythm by food intake and that changes in glucocorticoid concentrations are probably not necessary for altered metabolism [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Despite the lack of change in cortisol, sleepiness results were in line with the hypothesized increase in physiological arousal: both morning and evening subjective sleepiness were reduced more with blue-enriched light exposure compared to the dim light condition as a change from baseline. Although this indicates that light exposure had the expected alerting effect, the lack of association between these changes in sleepiness from the blue-enriched light and dim light condition with changes in HOMA-IR suggests the need to explore additional explanations (other than increased physiological arousal) for the observed changes. Also, morning subjective sleepiness was unexpectedly higher at baseline on the blue-enriched light day (Day 3) compared to the dim light day (Day 2); this phenomenon was consistent among the morning group participants. The reason for this difference is unclear, but we postulate that it may be due to the number of procedures in a short period of time, including the insertion of the intravenous needle for repeated blood sampling on Day 2, which was around the time of the baseline measurement. In addition, there may be an order effect since the dim light day always preceded the blue-enriched light day.</p><p>Another possible mechanism implicated in the effects of light exposure on metabolic function is alteration of melatonin levels. While light exposure suppresses melatonin [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and melatonin downregulates insulin secretion [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], it is unlikely that melatonin plays a role in the changes in insulin observed in the current study. Melatonin production ends, on average, about 2 hours before wake and rises about 14 hours after wake in healthy men and women [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The acute light exposure in this study (starting 0.5 or 10.5 hours after wake) was given at a time when melatonin levels are typically still low. However, future studies with light exposure over successive days and light exposure at different times of day should determine effects on melatonin phase and its possible contribution to any hunger, weight, or metabolic alterations; there remains a potential role for melatonin in altering hunger, weight regulation [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], and insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] in these situations, since light exposure at specific time points can phase shift the circadian clock [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and day-time light levels influence nocturnal melatonin levels [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>While the results from the current study support a role for light exposure in regulation of metabolism, the study is not without limitations. For example, we have a small sample that was selected with a limited range of BMI, sleep, and feeding patterns and participants were kept in dim light (&#x0003c; 20 lux) during wake except for the 3 hour light exposure period. It is possible that we would not see the same effects in participants who were obese, had irregular eating and/or sleep patterns, or if participants were in typical room light conditions of 150&#x02013;500 lux throughout the wake period [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Furthermore, food intake was strictly controlled (calories, composition, and timing), which may have also influenced the subjective ratings of food preference since participants knew they could not actively select their preferred food and were required to eat all of their given meals. Future studies with a free choice of the amount and content of meals as well as timing of food intake may allow for elucidation of blue-enriched light exposure&#x02019;s impacts on behaviors concerning food preference and actual caloric intake. Finally, even though the current study was designed to compare the impact of morning versus evening blue-enriched light exposure, the lack of counterbalancing between the dim and blue-enriched light conditions could be considered a limitation for within group comparisons (dim compared to blue-enriched).</p><p>This study highlights the need for further investigation of light exposure in a real-world setting. If the effects of light exposure on glucose metabolism reported in this study are sustained and/or amplified with repeated light exposure and/or under conditions with free access to food, consequences could include changes in hunger, food intake, and/or fat storage, thereby affecting body weight. In addition, if potential changes are dependent on time-of-day, as they seem to be, there may be further consequences since, for example, the timing of food intake has been related to obesity and weight loss success [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0155601.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Also, given that light history influences the magnitude of light exposure&#x02019;s effects on the circadian system [<xref rid="pone.0155601.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], future research is needed to explore whether prior light exposure during the day may impact the effects of evening blue-enriched light exposure on glucose metabolism.</p><p>In summary, acute blue-enriched light exposure in the morning and the evening impacts glucose metabolism in healthy adults. Further research is required to determine the mechanism(s) by which this occurs, and how the mechanism(s) may be different at various times of day. Future exploration should also investigate how the relative increase in insulin resistance with light exposure would be beneficial to weight regulation in the morning and detrimental in the evening, as suggested by earlier studies. The data from this study supports the theory that environmental light exposure can impact health and enforces the need for additional research to answer remaining questions to resolve whether manipulating light exposure may be a novel approach for altering glucose metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0155601.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Manuscript data.</title><p>This Excel file contains the data included in this manuscript.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0155601.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0155601.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Ekirch</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name>. <source>At Day's Close: Night in Times Past</source>. <publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>W.W.
