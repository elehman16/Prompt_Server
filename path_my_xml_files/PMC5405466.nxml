The intervention is incorporation of bioimpedance spectroscopy (BI) determination of normally hydrated weight to set a post-dialysis target weight that limits volume depletion, compared to current standard practice. Clinicians and participants will be blinded to BI measures in the control group and a standardized record capturing management of fluid status will be used in all participants. Primary outcome is preservation of residual kidney function assessed as time to anuria (&#x02264;100&#x000a0;ml/day or &#x02264;200&#x000a0;ml urine volume in the short inter-dialytic period). A sample size of 516 was based upon a cumulative incidence of 30% anuria in the control group and 20% in the treatment group and 11% competing risks (death, transplantation) over 10&#x000a0;months, with up to 2&#x000a0;years follow-up.</p><p>Secondary outcomes include rate of decline in small solute clearance, significant adverse events, hospitalization, loss of vascular access, cardiovascular events and interventions, dialysis efficacy and safety, dialysis-related symptoms and quality of life.

The CANUSA study found that each 250&#x000a0;ml of urine per day increased 2-year survival by 36% in peritoneal dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and in the NECOSAD study complete anuria in haemodialysis (HD) patients increased the relative risk of death 17-fold compared to those with well-preserved kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A more recent US study found a graded association, with the fastest rates of RKF loss being associated with doubling of all-cause mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Other reported benefits of RKF include improved wellbeing, better quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and less need to remove high fluid volumes during dialysis sessions with reduced risks of intra-dialytic hypotension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], cardiac stunning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and associated mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This link between RKF, volume management and outcomes is further supported by observational studies indicating that increased risks associated with failing to achieve target weight are bidirectional, implying that both over- and under-hydration are a threat to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Given the value of RKF, it is surprising how few clinical trials have focussed on interventions to maintain it as a key benefit to HD patients &#x02013; the exception being ultrapure water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], which is now standard care. Worse than this, a frequently applied fluid management strategy is to reduce the post-dialysis target weight until minimal or no anti-hypertensive drugs are required as evidence of adequate control of volume status. Our recent survey of fluid management practice patterns in UK units indicates that this is still being pursued in the majority of units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], despite the risk it poses to residual kidney function by setting in place a continuing vicious cycle of volume depletion, excessive thirst and high inter-dialytic fluid gains.</p><p>The introduction of bioimpedance (BI) technology, such as BI spectroscopy, provides clinicians with the opportunity to break this cycle while avoiding the risk of excessive overhydration. BI gives additional information about body composition available at the bedside [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The principle is simple and involves the passing of a low-strength alternating current through the subject&#x02019;s body to measure the resistance and reactance to flow. These two measures are dependent on the amount of fluid and cell membranes between the electrodes (usually placed on the hand and foot on one side of the body). The measurements are then modelled using information such as the subject&#x02019;s weight and height to estimate the total volume of fluid in the body and the proportion of this that is within cells or in the extracellular space. In dialysis patients, compared to healthy subjects, the total amount of fluid (intra plus extracellular) can be high or low, but often the latter because of muscle wasting, inflammation or even over-aggressive fluid removal on dialysis. However, if the extracellular fluid is disproportionately high, this is a strong signal for an increased mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For this reason, until now trials conducted to establish the clinical value of BI in setting target weights have focussed on clinical endpoints associated with hypervolaemia, such as high blood pressure, left ventricular mass and pulse- wave pressure or worsening extracellular to intracellular fluid distribution. The results of these interventions have been mixed, and more trials are clearly needed, but the price for achieving lower blood pressure through post-dialytic hypovolaemia was accelerated loss of RKF in one such study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. There is also evidence that presence of RKF leads to more stable fluid status without intervention in peritoneal dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, BISTRO will establish the potential for BI to add value to fluid management and address the concern that this technology may be being adopted indiscriminately without clear evidence of benefit and a potential risk of harm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aim</title><p>To determine if incorporation of bioimpedance spectroscopy-derived information on body composition into the setting of the post-dialytic target weight reduces loss of residual kidney function in incident centre-based HD patients, with the potential to improve clinical outcomes, dialysis-related symptoms, hospitalization and survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>A pragmatic, multicentre, open-label prospective randomized controlled trial comparing current best practice in setting the post-dialytic target weight (control group) with the same assessment guided by serial BI measurements (intervention group).

Bioimpedance is not new, although the technology has become more sophisticated, and the actual process of taking measurements is both safe and reproducible in trained hands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Introduction of this technology to the clinical setting has been found to be acceptable to patients and many dialysis units around the world are now undertaking regular measurements as part of clinical practice. The evidence that BI gives clinicians new information about their patients&#x02019; body composition is strong and it is increasingly clear that the combination of reduced lean tissue mass and excess extracellular water (ECW) in proportion to intracellular water (ICW) &#x02013; however this is expressed (phase angle, ECW/ICW, overhydration index) &#x02013;, is associated with worse clinical outcomes.</p><p>The question remains how to use this additional information in day-to-day clinical management. Should clinicians attempt to normalize measured ECW to the patient&#x02019;s normally hydrated weight or should they deliberately volume-deplete patients by the end of their dialysis treatment in an attempt to control blood pressure and undo the damage associated with long-standing hypertension? Without an independent measure of body composition, how do clinicians know which of these strategies they are employing? Given the potential to cause harm by excessively and serially volume-depleting patients, it would seem crucial that this practice is properly evaluated in a clinical trial. BISTRO is designed to fill this knowledge gap, focussing on the simplest of potential casualties of volume depletion, residual kidney function, a commodity that has been shown to be of consistent benefit to dialysis patients.</p><p>Trials assessing fluid management are challenging to undertake. One of the reasons for this is that assessing fluid status and implementing change are an example of complex decision making. The clinician, working with the patient, needs to take several things into account (e.g. symptoms, dietary intake, multiple comorbidities, dialysis tolerance, conflicting diagnostic information) and choose from several interventions (e.g. salt restriction, increased or reduced fluid removal, pharmacological interventions, and often more than one). One of the lessons learned from the UK-Shanghai BI trial in peritoneal dialysis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], which attempted to collect decisions made at the time of fluid status assessment, was just this &#x02013;these decisions are complex, multiple and bi-directional over time. To try and understand this better for BISTRO we have developed a template that will both help clinicians order their approach to fluid assessment and clarify why they chose to over-ride the BI-derived normally hydrated weight. The disadvantage of this approach may be that fluid management is &#x02018;improved&#x02019; in the control group, so putting the intervention under greater pressure to demonstrate a benefit; the advantage is a better understanding of the intervention and even if the study is negative we will have, for the first time, a validated template to support fluid management.</p><p>Performance bias is also a risk in this type of study, which has inevitably to be an open-label design. We have endeavoured to minimize this risk by separating the BI measurements from the clinical assessments and blinding both clinicians and participants to the BI measures in the control group. This will be a major focus of the training sessions that will be undertaken at all the sites, which will also ensure consistency in how the intervention is implemented.</p><p>Finally, in designing the trial we carefully considered the pros and cons of a cluster (dialysis unit) versus a patient-level randomisation. Apart from practical reasons (for example patients often transfer from the main dialysis unit to a satellite centre after initiation of treatment, potentially forcing either drop in or out of the intervention) we became aware of significant variation between sites in their approach to fluid management. We undertook a survey of UK dialysis units to establish this, confirming that the number of sites required to get a balanced cluster randomization would have been impractical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We have, however, used the information from this survey to undertake an annual survey of practice patterns during the conduct of the trial to allow us to correct for these in the primary and secondary analyses. Understanding the interactions between these practice patterns and clinical outcomes are an additional, potentially useful benefit of the study.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCM</term><def><p>Body composition monitor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>Bioimpedance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BISTRO</term><def><p>Bioimpedance spectroscopy to maintain renal output (Trial acronym)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CANUSA</term><def><p>Canada USA study</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CEAC</term><def><p>Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Clinical report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSRI</term><def><p>Client service receipt inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTU</term><def><p>Clinical trials unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DEXA</term><def><p>Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMC</term><def><p>Data monitoring committee</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECF</term><def><p>Extra-cellular water</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L</term><def><p>European quality of life (Qol) 5 dimension 5 level score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFR</term><def><p>Glomerular filtration rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HD</term><def><p>Haemodialysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICW</term><def><p>Intracellular water</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPOS</term><def><p>Integrated palliative care outcome scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MoCA</term><def><p>Montreal cognative assessment tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NECOSAD</term><def><p>Netherlands cooperative study of adequacy in dialysis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAM</term><def><p>Patient activation measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>Quality-adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RKF</term><def><p>Residual kidney function</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF12</term><def><p>Short form 12 (Health Survey)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TSC</term><def><p>Trial steering group</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Louise Phillips-Darby (Senior trials manager) and Nancy Fernandes da Silva (Trial Manager) for their support and assistance preparing the finalised protocol submitted to the UK Integrated Research Application System and UK Health Research Authority.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>National Institute for Health, Research Health Technology Assessment Programme under assigned grant number: 14/216/01.
