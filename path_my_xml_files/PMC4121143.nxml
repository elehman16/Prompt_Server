Participants performed two sessions of a serial reaction time (SRT) task in which they had to manually react to the identity of a target letter pair presented in one of four locations around a fixation cross. When the letter pair &#x02018;XO&#x02019; was presented, a left response had to be given, when the letter pair &#x02018;OX&#x02019; was presented, a right response was required. In the Eye Movements (EM) condition, eye movements were necessary to perform the task since the fixation cross and the target were separated by at least 9&#x000b0; visual angle. In the No Eye Movements (NEM) condition, on the other hand, eye movements were minimized by keeping the distance from the fixation cross to the target below 1&#x000b0; visual angle and by limiting the stimulus presentation to 100 ms. Since the target identity changed randomly in both conditions, no manual response sequence was present in the task. However, target location was structured according to a deterministic sequence in both the EM and NEM condition. Learning of the target location sequence was determined at the end of the first session and 24 hours after initial learning. Results indicated that the sequence learning effect in the SRT task diminished, yet remained significant, over the 24 hour interval in both conditions. Importantly, the difference in eye movements had no impact on the transfer of sequence knowledge. These results suggest that the retention of visuospatial sequence knowledge occurs alike, irrespective of whether this knowledge is supported by eye movements or not.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The first author, Daphn&#x000e9; Coomans, is a research fellow of the Research Foundation - Flanders (grant FWOTM506).

This means that, every day, you encounter the same lawns, buildings, and roads. Interestingly, after several subsequent train rides, you acquire knowledge about this sequence of sceneries. For example, you know that the first large building you encounter is a white block of apartments, which is followed by a meadow, and so on. Although such knowledge can be acquired without the intention to learn, little is known about whether this knowledge is consolidated over time. Are you still able to predict the next scenery after your holiday? In the current research, we will determine whether visuospatial sequence knowledge is consolidated over time, and whether this retention is dependent on the occurrence of eye movements.</p><p>The acquisition of sequences occurs largely implicit. This means that learning takes place incidentally, without the intention to learn, and with the acquired knowledge being difficult to verbalize <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cleeremans1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Clegg1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The most popular paradigm to investigate implicit sequence learning is the serial reaction time (SRT) task <xref rid="pone.0103421-Nissen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In this task, a stimulus appears in one of four locations and participants have to respond to its location with a spatially corresponding key. Unknown to them, this stimulus location is structured according to a predetermined sequence. Results show that participants learn the sequence of locations under these conditions, as indicated by a reaction time (RT) increase when the structured sequence is replaced by a new sequence after sufficient training.</p><p>It has been shown that several sequence representations can be formed while performing an SRT task (for a review, see <xref rid="pone.0103421-Abrahamse1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>). First, knowledge can be based on the sequence of manual responses, called motor sequence learning <xref rid="pone.0103421-Deroost1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Nattkemper1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Willingham1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Willingham2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Nemeth1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Researchers generally agree that this kind of learning is the most dominant component in sequence learning <xref rid="pone.0103421-Deroost1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, sequence learning can also be based on the visuospatial movements of the stimulus <xref rid="pone.0103421-Coomans1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Coomans2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Deroost2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Remillard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Remillard2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Remillard3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Song1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Additionally, some alternative accounts suggest that representations of stimulus-response rules <xref rid="pone.0103421-Deroost3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Schwarb1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Schwarb2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and response-effects <xref rid="pone.0103421-Ziessler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Ziessler2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> are built during learning.</p><p>Consolidation refers to the preservation or enhancement of knowledge after a time delay. There has already been substantial research on the consolidation of knowledge in a typical SRT task, in which participants manually respond to a sequenced stimulus dimension. In these sequence learning studies, consolidation is consistently reported, either in the form of a preservation or an enhancement of manual motor knowledge <xref rid="pone.0103421-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Peigneux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Press1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Song2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Recently, several researchers have tried to disentangle this consolidation effect by dissociating the different motor components in the SRT task. For example, Cohen et al. <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> dissociated finger effector learning from response location learning by letting participants switch their hands in the experiment: after being trained on a sequence with their right hand, participants had to respond with their left hand in the test phase. In one condition, the presented sequence on the screen and, hence, the response location sequence was maintained, while the effector sequence was changed by the switch of hands. This condition was assumed to reflect goal-based sequence knowledge. In the second condition, the effector sequence remained the same while the response location sequence was altered by presenting a mirrored sequence in the test phase. Interestingly, sequence knowledge based on effectors increased over day, while goal-based sequence knowledge only increased after sleep.</p><p>Other studies with an explicit sequence learning task, i.e., the finger tapping task, have yielded similar results with respect to the consolidation of goal-based sequence knowledge. An effector-independent motor representation was maintained by a night of sleep or even a daytime nap, whereas this was not the case for effector-based knowledge. This knowledge only stabilized, irrespective of whether participants slept or not <xref rid="pone.0103421-Witt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>Thus, different motor sequence components do not seem to consolidate in the same manner. Consequently, results of consolidation studies investigating one type of sequence representation cannot be generalized to other sequence representations. It is therefore necessary to investigate the consolidation of all types of sequence knowledge in order to pronounce upon the role of each component in the formation of permanent sequence knowledge. Studies on the consolidation of visuospatial sequence information are scarce, though. Can sequence knowledge be consolidated at all when it is not supported by a manual sequence? Although goal-based knowledge, as assessed in the studies discussed above <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Witt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, cannot be supported by the learning of finger movements, we believe that it is not purely visuospatial in nature either. More specifically, goal-based knowledge may actually refer to response location learning, a learning component that is clearly motor in nature <xref rid="pone.0103421-Willingham1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Willingham3" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>.</p><p>One study that did investigate the consolidation of visuospatial sequence knowledge is the study of Albouy and colleagues (<xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, see also <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>). In this study, sequence learning was not measured by RTs of manual responses, but instead by RTs of oculomotor responses. Participants had to keep track of a target presented in one of four locations on the screen by making an eye movement. The location of the target was structured according to a sequence. In addition, participants also had to make a manual response when the target changed colour, which happened in a minority (20%) of the trials. Only a visuospatial, but not a sequence of manual responses, could be learned. The results of this study showed that visuospatial sequence knowledge supported by oculomotor movements is consolidated over time, as sequence knowledge was maintained for 30 minutes and 5 hours, but increased after 24 hours.</p><p>However, visuospatial sequence knowledge in this latter study was supported by eye movements. The current research was designed to investigate whether visuospatial sequence knowledge that is not supported by eye movements can also be consolidated. To this end, participants performed two sessions, with an interval of 24 hours, of an adapted SRT task in which a target letter pair (&#x0201c;XO&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;OX&#x0201d;) appeared in one of four locations on the screen (see also <xref rid="pone.0103421-Remillard1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>). Participants had to respond to the identity of the target letter pair, which changed randomly. When the letter pair &#x0201c;XO&#x0201d; was presented, a left response had to be given, when the letter pair &#x0201c;OX&#x0201d; was presented, a right response was required. Unknown to participants, the location of the target was structured according to a deterministic sequence. In the &#x02018;No Eye Movements (NEM)&#x02019; condition, eye movements were minimized by presenting the letter pairs very close to a fixation cross and limiting the stimulus presentation time to 100 ms (see <xref rid="pone.0103421-Coomans1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>). In the &#x02018;Eye Movements (EM)&#x02019; condition, on the other hand, letter pairs were widely separated so that participants were required to make oculomotor movements to be able to respond to the target. We expect that visuospatial sequence knowledge supported by eye movements will be preserved or enhanced over time, as was found in the study of Albouy et al. <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However, it is not clear whether visuospatial sequence knowledge that is not supported by eye movements will also consolidate over the 24 hour interval.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Method</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The experimental procedures were executed in compliance with local laws and institutional guidelines.

The target &#x0201c;XO&#x0201d; required a &#x02018;C&#x02019;-response with the left index finger, the target &#x0201c;OX&#x0201d; an &#x02018;N&#x02019;-response with the right index finger. In case of an erroneous response, or no response within 3000 ms, an error message was displayed in Dutch for 750 ms. After a response-stimulus interval of 400 ms the next trial was presented.</p><p>In order to hinder or stimulate oculomotor movements in the NEM and the EM condition, respectively, there were three main differences between both conditions: (1) while participants in the NEM condition were urged to focus on the fixation cross without making eye movements, participants in the EM condition were not, (2) the visual angle used to display the letter pairs was small (&#x0003c;1&#x000b0; visual angle) in the NEM condition and large (&#x0003e;9&#x000b0; visual angle) in the EM condition, and (3) letter pairs were presented for 100 ms in the NEM condition, after which only the fixation cross remained on the screen, whereas stimulus duration was not limited in the EM condition. In this latter condition, stimuli remained on the screen until a response was given or until the response time of 3000 ms elapsed.</p><p>In both conditions, the experiment consisted of two sessions separated by 24 hours. Session 1 began with two practice blocks of 50 trials. In these blocks, the location of the target changed pseudorandomly, with immediate location repetitions being excluded. The target and three distractor identities always varied randomly and individually per trial, with an equal probability of each target letter pair (&#x0201c;XO&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;OX&#x0201d;) and distractor letter pair (&#x0201c;YQ&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;QY&#x0201d;). After each block, participants received feedback about their error rates and RTs, followed by a break of 30 seconds.</p><p>After practice, 15 experimental blocks of 100 trials were presented. In these blocks, target location was structured according to a sequence (S1 or S2; S1 and S2 were evenly distributed over the NEM and the EM condition) in all blocks but Block 13. The sequences, adopted from <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, were 42132431 (S1) or 13423124 (S2) with 1 referring to the location above the fixation cross and the remaining numbers to the locations in a clockwise manner. In Block 13, an untrained sequence (S2 or S1) with the same structural properties as the trained sequence was placed on the target's location to assess sequence learning. Session 2, administered 24 hours after Session 1, consisted of 5 blocks of 100 trials. In Blocks 1, 3 and 4, the sequence trained in Session 1 was imposed on the target's location. In Blocks 2 and 5, the untrained sequence was placed on the target's location to determine sequence learning in Session 2. Untrained Block 5 was inserted in case Block 2 proved to be insensitive to consolidation effects, as additional training might be required to reactivate sequence knowledge after a time interval of 24 hours.

Participants were presented 16 trials on a sheet of paper. Per trial, four letter pairs (all &#x0201c;OX&#x0201d;) were displayed around a fixation cross (above, right, below and left from the cross). First, participants performed the task under inclusion instructions, which means that they were asked to mark a sequence of 16 locations that they believed occurred frequently in the experiment (with the restriction that no immediate repetitions could be reported). For example, if they thought that the target moved from the bottom to the top, and then to the location right from the cross, they marked the bottom location in the first trial, the top location in the second trial, and the right location in the third trial. Secondly, participants performed the task under exclusion instructions. Now, participants had to mark the transitions that were not frequently presented in the experiment. According to the PDP logic, participants should be able to report more correct transitions under inclusion than under exclusion instructions if they are consciously aware of the location sequence, because this would mean that they are able to control their sequence knowledge under exclusion instructions.</p><p>Finally, because previous research has shown that consolidation of sequence knowledge might be mediated by sleep (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0103421-Peigneux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>), sleep characteristics over night between Session 1 and Session 2 were assessed. Participants were asked to answer the following questions on a sheet of paper before starting the experiment in Session 2. First, they were asked how many hours they slept during the last night. Second, subjective sleep quality was determined by letting the participants (a) assign a number to their sleep quality from 0 to 10 (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; extremely bad; 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; extremely good) and (b) to the extent to which they felt rested (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; completely exhausted; 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; completely rested).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The first trial of each block was discarded from the analyses.

Participants performed a modified version of the SRT task in which they had to react to the identity of a target letter pair, while its location was structured. However, whereas oculomotor movements were necessary to locate the target in the EM condition, they were minimized in the NEM condition. Our results revealed a smaller sequence learning effect expressed in the SRT task after a 24 hour interval in both the EM and NEM condition, although learning remained significant in both conditions after the time delay. Importantly, no difference in retention was observed between visuospatial sequence knowledge supported by eye movements and visuospatial sequence knowledge that was not supported by eye movements. Participants in both conditions also displayed explicit awareness after the experiment, but the amount of explicit knowledge did not differ between the EM and NEM condition.</p><p>Consolidation of sequence knowledge refers to a preservation or enhancement of sequence-specific knowledge after a time delay. In the current study, the sequence-specific learning effect was always smaller in Session 2 than in Session 1. Further analyses on trained and untrained blocks separately revealed that RTs on both trained and untrained blocks decreased over the time interval. However, the smaller learning effect in Session 2 as compared to Session 1 was due to the larger decrease in RTs on untrained blocks than on trained blocks. Thus, the effect was unrelated to the learning of the sequence itself as sequence-specific knowledge does not induce faster RTs in untrained blocks. Faster RTs to both trained and untrained blocks over the interval are thus likely not indicative for consolidation of the sequence knowledge, but are probably more a reflection of familiarity with sequence-unrelated task aspects, such as stimulus detection and discrimination processes or stimulus-response mapping processes (see also <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>). Additionally, the build-up of fatigue may also have impaired performance at the end of Session 1, while participants began with renewed energy after the interval, leading to faster RTs at the beginning of Session 2 (see <xref rid="pone.0103421-Rickard1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>). We therefore conclude that sequence knowledge was at best not fully consolidated, because the knowledge was not fully preserved or enhanced over the 24 hour interval. However, although the sequence learning effect was smaller after the interval, not all sequential knowledge seemed to be forgotten as sequence learning was still present at the beginning of Session 2 in both conditions. In sum, visuospatial sequence knowledge was (at best) only partially consolidated, irrespective of whether this knowledge was supported by eye movements or not.</p><p>A parallel can be drawn between our study and the traditional perceptual/motor distinction in the sequence learning research field. In the current research, the visuospatial sequence was supported by an oculomotor sequence in the EM condition. Hence, learning in this latter condition may be regarded as a form of motor sequence learning. In our NEM condition, on the other hand, all corresponding motor responses were avoided. Therefore learning in this condition may be comparable to perceptual sequence learning. According to our knowledge, only one study previously investigated whether perceptual sequence knowledge can be consolidated. In the study of Hallgat&#x000f3; and collagues <xref rid="pone.0103421-Hallgat1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, participants had to respond to the direction of an arrow presented in the centre of the screen. In the initial training phase, they had to mentally rotate the arrow with 90&#x000b0; and answer with the response key corresponding to this latter direction. Unknown to participants, the direction of the arrow, and hence also the responses to the arrow, followed a regular sequence. After a time delay of 12 or 24 hours, participants continued to respond to the direction of the arrow, but this time by using a different stimulus-response mapping. More specifically, they did not have to rotate the arrow any longer, but now had to respond with the key directly corresponding to its direction. The authors made sure that in the perceptual condition, the presented sequence remained the same but the response sequence changed due to the mapping change, whereas in the motor condition the perceptual sequence changed so that the motor sequence was preserved. The results indicated that perceptual sequence knowledge transferred less than motor sequence knowledge, but it was still significantly present after a delay of 12 and 24 hours. Moreover, in none of the conditions, consolidation of the knowledge was dependent on whether participants had slept during the interval or not. However, two factors have to be taken into account. First, the authors did not determine perceptual sequence knowledge before the time interval (the change in mapping was only introduced after the delay), so it is impossible to establish whether knowledge actually declined over the interval or was already less significant than motor sequence knowledge after initial training. Second, because the motor sequence only shifted one response key after transfer, participants could have displayed a learning effect in the second session based on a simple abstraction of motor sequence knowledge (same response plus counter clockwise shift) instead of on pure perceptual sequence knowledge. Consequently, what the authors denoted as perceptual sequence knowledge could actually be reflecting response-shifted motor knowledge. Nonetheless, our results reveal that even when those factors are controlled for by testing for sequence knowledge before the delay and by using a random manual response sequence, like was done in the current study, the perceptual learning effect still diminishes after a time delay of 24 hours.</p><p>The result that visuospatial sequence knowledge supported by eye movements, which may be regarded as a form of motor learning, decreased over the interval, was rather surprising. We hypothesized that this kind of knowledge would be consolidated over time, as previous research showed that oculomotor sequence knowledge increases after a time delay of 24 hours <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy2" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Yet, a crucial difference between the study of Albouy et al. and our study is that the integration of structured information was likely easier to accomplish in their study, as less noise was interspersed between trials: participants in their study had to respond manually to a colour change of the target, which only happened in 20% of the trials. In contrast, in our task, participants had to manually respond to the identity of a randomly changing target on <italic>each</italic> trial. Thus, compared to the study of Albouy et al., more noise was present on the manual response level in our study because of the random manual responses made on every trial, which might have interfered with the consolidation of the knowledge.</p><p>Several measures were taken to constrain eye movements in the NEM condition, including the short presentation of the target and distractor letter pairs during 100 ms. This manipulation, however, not only restricted eye movements in the NEM condition, but also made the task harder to perform than in the EM condition, where no presentation limit was used. This was reflected in higher error rates in the former condition. One might therefore wonder whether a difference in task difficulty may have influenced our results. However, we found no differences between the consolidation of visuospatial sequence knowledge, irrespective of whether this knowledge was supported by eye movements or not. Although learning effects were generally larger in the EM condition, where RTs were overall higher, the absolute sizes of these effects are not the measures of consolidation by themselves. More specifically, consolidation is derived from the comparison of the learning effects before and after the time delay, thus taking the size of the initial learning effect into account. In the current study, the sequence learning effect decreased similarly over the 24 hour interval in both conditions, irrespective of the size of the initial learning effect. Accordingly, the observed effects were highly unlikely to be modulated by task difficulty.</p><p>However, although there was no difference between the retention of visuospatial knowledge with and without eye movements in the current study, the use of the sequence knowledge at the end of Session 2 proved not entirely alike. Reaction times of participants in the EM condition, but not those of participants in the NEM condition, increased when they encountered a second untrained block (Block 5) in Session 2. Since participants in both conditions were able to display sequence knowledge after the second session in an awareness test, the disappearance of the RT learning effect at the end of Session 2 in the NEM condition can probably not be attributed to a loss of knowledge itself. It rather seems that, although knowledge was still present, participants in the NEM condition were not able to express it in their reaction times. In a previous study <xref rid="pone.0103421-Coomans2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, we have already found that the expression of visuospatial sequence knowledge without the presence of a corresponding motor sequence is much more dependent on other task characteristics, like the perceptual difficulty of a task, than the expression of sequence knowledge that is supported by a (manual) response component. Accordingly, we surmise that facing deviant information twice in one session reduced the reliance on sequence knowledge in the NEM condition, but not in the EM condition, where a reliable oculomotor response sequence was present.</p><p>Finally, it has to be pointed out that we did not control for two factors that may have influenced the consolidation process in the current study. First, we did not use sleep diaries to assess whether the sleep-wake cycle of participants prior to the experiment was normal, though sleep may play an important role in the consolidation of sequence knowledge <xref rid="pone.0103421-Peigneux1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Witt1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0103421-Albouy1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Yet, because we did control for sleep in the night between the first and the second session of the experiment, we can infer that participants in both conditions did not differ in the total number of hours they slept during that night, their sleep quality and the extent to which they felt rested. Second, our sample consisted of a majority of females in both conditions. There is a possibility that our results were influenced by the menstrual cycle of our participants, which has been shown to affect the consolidation of explicit motor sequence knowledge <xref rid="pone.0103421-Genzel1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. It might therefore be useful to take the effect of sex and female hormones into account in future consolidation studies, and to investigate whether the effect of hormones on memory can be generalized to implicit sequence learning tasks.</p><p>To conclude, in the current study we found that visuospatial sequence knowledge was not fully consolidated after a period of 24 hours, irrespective of whether this knowledge was supported by oculomotor movements. We therefore postulate that not the presence of eye movements, but other task aspects like the presence of random noise is important for whether or not sequence-specific knowledge is fully preserved over time.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0103421-Cleeremans1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
