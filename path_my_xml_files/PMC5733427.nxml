However, approximately 40%&#x02013;70% of neuroleptic-resistant patients with schizophrenia are nonresponders even to clozapine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Moreover, with clozapine exists a risk of agranulocytosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Quetiapine, with structural analogy to clozapine, but with molecular discrepancies explaining the lack of agranulocytosis risk[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] seems to be an alternative in TRS. There are a few studies showing the efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia resistant to previous antipsychotics,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] but the findings have not been replicated in other studies, and there is a dearth of such studies carried out on the Indian population. Thus to look at an alternative treatment regimen for TRS, this study was a logical outcome where the authors set out to address some unanswered queries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>Patients who came to the Department of Psychiatry of Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Chandigarh, India were considered for the study.

The patients were randomly assigned into two groups as: Group A (clozapine group) or Group B (quetiapine group) as per a computer-generated random table with an aim to recruit a minimum of twenty patients in each group and were followed up for 14 weeks after treatment initiation. The trial was registered with Clinical Trial Registry, India (CTRI Registration number CTRI/2016/02/006660).</p><p>The principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Indian Council of Medical Research[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] was complied with and the study was approved by the ethical review committee of the institution.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Intervention</title><p>After recruitment, patients who were on antipsychotics were given a drug-free/washout period (1 week for oral; 1 month for long-acting depot preparation). The patients were randomly allocated to either of the Group A or B. The dosages of the drugs were kept in the therapeutic range of 150&#x02013;450 mg/day for clozapine and 400&#x02013;800 mg/day for quetiapine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Clozapine was started with 25 mg/day in two divided doses and increased by 25 mg/day, whereas quetiapine was started at 50 mg/day in two divided doses and increased by 50 mg/day. The minimum therapeutic dose in all the patients was reached within 2 weeks of starting the treatment. After this, patients were continued on the same dose for 4 weeks. At the end of 4 weeks, if the improvement was not adequate (&#x0003c; 50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS][<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] score), the dose of the respective drug was further increased to the maximum permissible dose and the patients were re-assessed after 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Concomitant medications (like benzodiazepines for sleep disturbances, amitriptyline for hypersalivation, etc.) were permitted wherever required, and it was documented. Patients having serious adverse drug reaction were dropped from the study and managed as per the standard guidelines. Each patient's sociodemographic and clinical variables were recorded on prescribed Performa designed specifically for the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Physical examination, body weight, height, QTc interval on electrocardiogram, blood chemistry, and complete hemogram were carried out at the baseline, 2<sup>nd</sup> week and thereafter every 4<sup>th</sup> week.

Forty patients who completed all four assessments were included in the final analysis. The two groups were comparable at baseline on sociodemographic and clinical variables. The mean dose of clozapine was 322.50 mg/day, and quetiapine was 790.0 mg/day.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Clozapine group</title><p>In this study, 6 (30%) patients in clozapine group showed response. This finding concurs with the multi-centric study conducted by Kane <italic>et al</italic>. which established clozapine as preferred drug for TRS[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and another large randomized double-blind comparative study of clozapine and haloperidol in patients of refractory schizophrenia in which superior improvement was observed in the clozapine group.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Significantly, more patients in clozapine group had &#x02265;20% reduction in symptoms than the comparator drugs in both these studies.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The response rate of 30% with clozapine in this study is somewhat similar to these two studies.</p><p>The superiority of clozapine over typical and atypical antipsychotics has been reported in some systematic reviews and meta-analysis. However, studies comparing clozapine with quetiapine were not included in these. Furthermore, there was a high degree of heterogenicity in terms of duration of the study, dosage of drugs used, level of resistance to previous treatment and financial support from a drug company among various studies included in these systematic reviews and meta-analysis, and hence it may not be appropriate to include these studies in a meta-analysis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Quetiapine group</title><p>In this study, patients with quetiapine had significant improvement only in negative symptoms and overall 3 (15%) patients showed response. These findings are in contradiction to an earlier study on 95 TRS patients, wherein 59% of quetiapine-treated patients were defined as PANSS responders compared to 38% of haloperidol-treated patients and quetiapine showed numerically greater but nonsignificant improvement at 8 weeks in all subscales and total score of PANSS in comparison to haloperidol.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The reason for greater improvement could be the inclusion of mildly ill patients (score of 3 or more on CGI), whereas all the patients in our study were moderately ill (score of 4 or more on CGI) and lower degree of treatment resistance. Findings of this study are also inconsistent with the findings of a smaller 4-week study which showed response in 50% of the cases as well as significant reduction in total PANSS scores in patients who were refractory to first-generation antipsychotics and were later treated with quetiapine.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Reasons for higher response rate in that study could be lower degree of treatment resistance, small sample size, single-blind design which can lead to bias. Moreover, unlike the current study, this study did not have a comparator group. The response rate to typical and atypical antipsychotics in other studies has not been as high as reported in the above-mentioned two studies.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-11"><title>Clozapine versus quetiapine group</title><p>In this study, the difference between clozapine and quetiapine in term of response rate was not statistically significant which can be attributed to a smaller sample size of this study.</p><p>Patients assigned to clozapine had significantly greater reductions on positive symptoms, general psychopathology and total PANSS score than the patients assigned to quetiapine. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups so far as reduction in negative symptoms was concerned; both drugs produced significant improvement in negative symptoms from the baseline assessment. These results are consistent with Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) Phase 2 investigations, where patients assigned to clozapine had significant reductions in the PANSS total score and PANSS general psychopathology subscale than the patients assigned to quetiapine. Reductions in positive and negative subscale scores in clozapine group were greater than quetiapine, but it was not statistically significant in that study.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Another noncommercially funded, pragmatic, open, multisite, and randomized controlled trial comparing clozapine with other SGA (including quetiapine) showed that the improvement seen in clozapine group was significantly higher in comparison to SGA group at 12, 26, and 52 weeks, although authors did not publish results for the different SGA.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>However, findings of this study should be interpreted carefully because clozapine is associated with sedation, hyper-salivation, orthostatic hypertension and metabolic side effects[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] leading to poor tolerability. Other serious side effects such as agranulocytosis,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] seizure,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and myocarditis[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] have been reported in the literature. Further important limitation arises from the need of slow titration and weekly blood counts which are laborious.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In addition, a significant proportion of TRS population is nonresponder to even clozapine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Thus, there is still a prospect for using other molecules when clozapine is ineffective or intolerable though uncertainty exists regarding which molecule should be used in such a scenario.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Negative symptoms predominate major portion of the course of illness and account for much of the long-term morbidity and poor functional outcome of patients with schizophrenia.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] In such a scenario, quetiapine can be considered as a viable alternative as it showed a response in 15% of patients and was associated with significant improvement in negative symptoms. In fact, a metaanalysis conducted by Cochrane Schizophrenia group has found quetiapine to be more efficacious than clozapine on the negative symptom subscore.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>The current study found that quetiapine was better so far as side effects of the two drugs were concerned as reflected by the GASS score. In addition, the side effects of both the drugs were mild in severity as only one patient in each group had dropped out due to side effects. However, the retention rate was better in the clozapine group as 4 patients dropped out from this group as compared to 9 patients in the other group. Clozapine was associated with sedation, hyper-salivation, and weight gain in greater proportion of the patients, whereas quetiapine caused anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, difficulty in passing urine, etc.) in more number of patients and this finding are consistent with previous CATIE trials.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The current study, in fact, showed greater anticholinergic side effects due to quetiapine compared to a previous industry-sponsored study.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Clozapine is still a good choice in TRS, and it was found to be more effective than quetiapine. However, clozapine was associated with greater side effects than quetiapine. Quetiapine, on the other hand, was also effective and equivalent to clozapine in the reduction of negative symptoms. Thus quetiapine might be a better choice in cases of TRS with predominant negative symptomatology, especially in instances where clozapine is ineffective or cannot be used.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-13" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Patients who participated in the study, all faculty of the Department of Psychiatry, GMCH, Chandigarh, India.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whiteford</surname><given-names>HA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrari</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Degenhardt</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Feigin</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Vos</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The global burden of mental, neurological and substance use disorders: An analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010</article-title><source>PLoS One</source><year>2015</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>e0116820</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25658103</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Conley</surname><given-names>RR</given-names></name><name><surname>Kelly</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of treatment resistance in schizophrenia</article-title><source>Biol Psychiatry</source><year>2001</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>898</fpage><lpage>911</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11743944</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Honigfeld</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Meltzer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clozapine for the treatment-resistant schizophrenic.
