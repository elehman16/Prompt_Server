Together with abdominal obesity adolescent&#x02019;s inadequate diets are risk factors for non-communicable diseases. We report the effectiveness of a school-based intervention on the dietary intake and waist circumference among Ecuadorian adolescents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial including 1430 adolescents (12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years old) was conducted. The program aimed at improving the nutritional value of dietary intake, physical activity (primary outcomes), body mass index, waist circumference and blood pressure (secondary outcomes). This paper reports: (i) the effect on fruit and vegetable intake, added sugar intake, unhealthy snacking (consumption of unhealthy food items that are not in line with the dietary guidelines eaten during snack time; i.e. table sugar, sweets, salty snacks, fast food, soft drinks and packaged food), breakfast intake and waist circumference; and, (ii) dose and reach of the intervention. Dietary outcomes were estimated by means of two 24-h recall at baseline, after the first 17-months (stage one) and after the last 11-months (stage two) of implementation. Dose and reach were evaluated using field notes and attendance forms. Educational toolkits and healthy eating workshops with parents and food kiosks staff in the schools were implemented in two different stages. The overall effect was assessed using linear mixed models and regression spline mixed effect models were applied to evaluate the effect after each stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Data from 1046 adolescents in 20 schools were analyzed. Participants from the intervention group consumed lower quantities of unhealthy snacks (&#x02212;23.32&#x000a0;g; 95% CI: &#x02212;45.25,-1.37) and less added sugar (&#x02212;5.66&#x000a0;g; 95% CI: &#x02212;9.63,-1.65) at the end of the trial. Daily fruit and vegetable intake decreased in both the intervention and control groups compared to baseline, albeit this decrease was 23.88&#x000a0;g (95% CI: 7.36, 40.40) lower in the intervention group. Waist circumference (&#x02212;0.84&#x000a0;cm; 95% CI: &#x02212;1.68, 0.28) was lower in the intervention group at the end of the program; the effect was mainly observed at stage one. Dose and reach were also higher at stage one.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The trial had positive effects on risk factors for non-communicable diseases, i.e. decreased consumption of unhealthy snacks. The program strategies must be implemented at the national level through collaboration between the academia and policy makers to assure impact at larger scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par6">

Overweight-obese children show higher mortality rates and are more likely to become obese adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The risk of obesity and other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is attenuated by reducing blood pressure, increasing physical activity, supporting diets rich in fruit, vegetables, grains and nuts, and restricting the intake of sugared beverages and sweets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In Ecuador, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and stroke are leading causes of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with a larger disease burden in the urban areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Overweight, obesity and dyslipidemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], together with a diet poor in fiber, fruit and vegetables, and high in added sugar, refined grains and processed food are prevalent among Ecuadorian adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Prevention is needed to tackle this increasing burden of NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Interventions focusing on education and improvements of the food environment have proven to be effective to reduce the risk of NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Schools are suitable settings to implement preventive interventions for adolescents as they deal with environmental drivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with respect to dietary intake and its determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, school-based lifestyle interventions in LMICs have methodological and conceptual flaws i.e. they are often not theory- and evidence-based or adapted to the specific context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In Latin America, only a few school-based interventions targeting healthy eating and/or physical activity have been implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The available programs in the region are usually short term, target small samples and/or at risk populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and showed deficiencies in their designs and evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, school-based interventions have not been performed in Andean States such as Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador and Per&#x000fa;, where the ethnic, cultural and social context differs in comparison with other Latin American countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This is especially important as health promotion success rates rely on context considerations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">We conducted a school-based cluster randomized controlled trial with parental involvement called &#x0201c;ACTIVITAL&#x0201d;, aimed at improving the nutritional value of dietary intake and physical activity in a sample of school-going Ecuadorian adolescents. To our knowledge, the ACTIVITAL trial is innovative in its setting as it (i) was tailored to the local context using a theoretical framework and participatory approaches and (ii) targeted multiple populations (i.e. adolescents, school staff, and parents) and dietary risk factors for NCDs as well as physical activity. This paper reports: (i) the overall effect of the trial after three consecutive school years on dietary intake (primary outcome) and waist circumference, (ii) the effect of the trial after the first 17&#x000a0;months and the last 11&#x000a0;months of implementation, as well as (ii) the dose and reach of the strategies implemented.

At the time of the study, the Ecuadorian school system was comprised of four levels: elementary school (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;year-old children), primary school (1st-7th grade; 6&#x02013;11&#x000a0;year-old children), middle school (8th to 10th grade; 12&#x02013;14-year-old adolescents) and high school (1st-3rd year high school; 15&#x02013;17&#x000a0;year-old adolescents). Within the education system, there are both private and public schools. Students attend school either in the morning (7:00&#x02013;13:00) or in the afternoon (12:00&#x02013;18:00), with one break of approximately 30&#x000a0;min. A school year in Cuenca runs from September to June. Most adolescents (73%) regularly attend school in the urban area of Cuenca [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. All schools must follow a standard curriculum and use government issued learning materials.</p><p id="Par17">
<italic>A la carte</italic> foods (e.g. pre-packaged snacks, hot meals and soft drinks) are offered by private on-site school food kiosks.

Adolescents also have easy access to street food near the schools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design and sample size</title><p id="Par18">This study was conducted in 20 schools. A pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial was designed with the schools (clusters) as units of randomization. To reach the desired sample size of 70 students per school, schools were eligible if they (i) were located in the urban area of Cuenca, and (ii) had at least 90 students enrolled in the 8th and 9th grade. The schools&#x02019; selection process is described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>: 28 schools were matched by size (total number of students; no more than a 15% difference), type (public-private), school gender (single gender or co-ed. schools) and socioeconomic status (monthly fee; no more than 30% difference) into 14 pairs. The best ten matching pairs were selected. From the ten allotted pairs, each school was randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group, using random numbers in Stata 12.0 by a researcher who was not directly involved in the implementation. Adolescents and school staff were not aware about the existence of a counterfactual school.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of progress</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2017_299_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par19">In each school, two 8th and two 9th grades were randomly selected. All adolescents from these grades were invited to participate and 70 students were selected at random. A total of 10 matched pairs of schools including an average sample of 65 children per school considering a Type I error of 5%, a coefficient of between-cluster variation (K<sub>m</sub>) of 0.15 and a power of 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], allowed for the detection of a decrease in 10% of the energy percentage derived from fat. This corresponded to a total sample size of 1300 adolescents in 20 schools.

A needs assessment, including both qualitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and quantitative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] data, was performed to ensure appropriateness of the program. Focus group discussions identified the following factors as influencing dietary intake: lack of knowledge about nutrition quality and healthy eating, less healthy eating habits at high school, and greater accessibility to pocket money used to buy tasty yet unhealthy food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A dietary assessment prior to the study showed that the study population consumed insufficient fiber, fruit and vegetables, and an excess of added sugar, refined grains and processed foods during snacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These data served to define the intervention objectives and strategies using the Intervention Mapping (IM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and the Comprehensive and Participatory Planning and Evaluation (CPPE) approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The possible intervention strategies identified during the CPPE were combined with the IM techniques to define the final intervention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This process resulted in the development of the intervention program named ACTIVITAL with the following intervention objectives: adolescents (i) decrease their sugar intake, (ii) increase their daily fruit and vegetable intake, (iii) decrease their unhealthy snack intake, (iv) increase their healthy breakfast intake, and (v) school food kiosks increase the offer of healthy food. Separate matrices of change objectives for adolescents, parents and school staff were generated. Finally, different effective theoretical methods were identified from literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] to translate the objectives into intervention strategies.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Description of the intervention development process.

For afternoon schools, the timings were morning snack from 8:00&#x02013;11:00 and afternoon snack from 12:00&#x02013;18:00. Night snacks were set equally for the whole sample at any hour later than 21:00. The timing during weekend was similar for all the participants: morning snack from 9:00&#x02013;12:00, afternoon snack from 15:00&#x02013;18:00 and night snack at any hour later than 21:00. Secondly, all the &#x0201c;unhealthy&#x0201d; food items rich in sodium, fat or added sugar but low in nutrition value (usually available in vending machines, cafeterias and food kiosks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]) consumed during these snack times were identified. These items comprised: (a) table sugar and sweets (honey, candies, chocolates, ice creams, sweet cookies, traditional sweet desserts and sugar added to juices, coffee, etc.), (b) salty snacks and fast food (packaged salty snacks, salty crackers, French fries, pizza, hamburgers) (c) soft drinks (soda, artificial sweetened juices, energy drinks) and (d) other packaged food (ketchup, packaged soups, gelatine). Finally, the intake of unhealthy foods per day during all the snack times was calculated. Unhealthy snacking is reported as g/day.</p><p id="Par29">Unhealthy snacking at school was defined by identifying consumers of unhealthy foods prepared at school according to the following procedure: (i) from the list of recipes classified as unhealthy foods, we identified those prepared at school; next (ii) the participants were classified as 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;non-consumers, if they had not reported any of the school-prepared items in the 24-h recalls, and 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;consumers if at least one of the school-prepared item was reported in any recall.</p><p id="Par30">Breakfast time was defined following a similar approach as the snack timing definition. For morning schools, breakfast time was set between 5:00&#x02013;7:00 and for afternoon schools from 5:00&#x02013;8:00. Breakfast intake is reported as a dichotomous variable (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;non-consumers; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;consumers).</p><p id="Par31">Energy from fat was calculated by dividing the daily energy of fat by the total energy intake per day (E%/day).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Other measurements</title><p id="Par32">Waist circumference was measured in duplicate by two trained interviewers using standardized procedures.

Poverty was defined using the definition of Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBN). This system categorizes a household as poor if one or more deficiencies in access to education, health, housing, water, electricity and employment are reported. Adolescents were allocated to one of two groups: &#x02018;Poor&#x02019; if at least one deprivation was present or &#x02018;Better-off&#x02019; if none was reported. The following extra questions based on the national census [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] about remittances and snack allowance were asked: &#x02018;Does the family receive remittances from abroad?&#x02019; &#x02018;Does the adolescent receive a daily snack allowance?&#x02019; and &#x02018;How much does the adolescent receive for his/her snack allowance?&#x02019; Age was obtained from the reported date of birth.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Dose and reach of the intervention</title><p id="Par34">Dose and reach of the intervention strategies were evaluated for different audiences (adolescents, parents and school staff) using field notes and attendance signed forms.

The overall effect after the full intervention period was assessed using linear mixed models. The models were adjusted for baseline differences between the treatment and the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The models comprised the school pair and participants as random effect. The treatment allocation was nested as a random slope within each pair. Adolescent&#x02019;s sex and UBN at baseline were included as fixed effects. The effect of the intervention was evaluated by testing the interaction term between follow-up time (in months) and treatment allocation. The results of the interaction term between the treatment groups with time (in months) were multiplied by 28 (duration of the trial) to calculate the overall intervention effect. Therefore, the reported differences between the intervention and the control group correspond to the effect after the whole program implementation and indicates the mean differences for continuous dependent variables and the proportion difference for dichotomous outcomes between the treatment and the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Regression spline mixed effects models were used for this purpose, accounting for the effects of clustering by individual and school. One knot (the point of time where the slope of the linear function changes) was defined at the mean time (in months) of the first follow-up data collection (17&#x000a0;months). The Stata command &#x0201c;mkspline&#x0201d; was used to create two auxiliary variables (t1&#x02009;=&#x02009;time in months one and t2&#x02009;=&#x02009;time in months two).

The Beta coefficients of these interaction terms were multiplied by 17 for the effect after the first stage and by 11 for the second stage, corresponding to the respective duration of both stages. Therefore, the reported differences between the intervention and the control group correspond to the effect after each intervention stage and indicates the mean differences for continuous dependent variables and the proportion difference for dichotomous outcomes between the treatment and the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p id="Par40">We assessed the influence of missing data on the outcomes with a <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.1.

This decrease is explained by the fact that half of the participants reached high school; in the Ecuadorian school system, at high school, adolescents are distributed into different specializations according to their preferences, the last implies that more classrooms had to be included to involve all the sampled adolescents.

In total, 70% of the schools attended at least 80% of the food kiosks staff workshops at stage one and 60% at stage two.

This study adds value to the current literature as it provides a comprehensive school-based intervention designed by means of a theoretical and participative approach able to target multiple populations and risk factors among adolescents living in an Andean upper middle-income country.</p><p id="Par49">At the end of the intervention, fruit and vegetable intake decreased in both the intervention and control groups, but this decrease was lower in the intervention group. Although the intervention was unable to increase the fruit and vegetable intake, it effectively attenuated the decrease of fruit and vegetable intake during adolescence. Still, the intake in the intervention group in the present study remained below the recommended intake of 400&#x000a0;g of fruits and vegetables per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the effect is lower compared to other school-based health promotion programs in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, the latter programs, included fruit and vegetables as the only outcome.</p><p id="Par50">We report a decrease of 23&#x000a0;g/d in unhealthy snack intake and a decrease of 15% in the proportion of consumers of unhealthy snacks prepared at school in the intervention group after the first stage. Previous research has demonstrated that multicomponent programs involving parents, aiming at the food sources both in and outside of school and focusing on a variety of unhealthy food items seem to be less likely to fail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The decrease in the fraction of consumers of unhealthy food at school during stage one suggests improvements in the food prepared at school as it concurs with a higher staff response.</p><p id="Par51">Our reductions of 1 cm of waist circumference is comparable to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Diets high in fruit and vegetables, low in fast food and soda, and improvements in physical fitness were previously found inversely correlated with waist circumference. The ACTIVITAL trial also had important effects on both physical activity and physical fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The proportion of adolescents reaching the recommended moderate to vigorous physical activity decreased less in the intervention group, the proportion of adolescents spending more than 3&#x000a0;h in front of a screen decreased in the intervention group during weekdays, performance on the vertical jump test was better among the intervention participants, and finally, participants in the control group performed worse on the speed shuttle run test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par52">The effect on fruit and vegetable intake, unhealthy snacking and waist circumference was larger during stage one of the intervention. Differences in program implementation between stage one and two can explain this. In contrast to stage two, (i) participatory workshops were performed, (ii) dose and reach were higher (iii) and more workshops with the food kiosks staff were implemented during stage one. Previous studies have shown how participatory approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and parental support are important factors for school-based health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The low parental response could be the consequence of the lack of parents&#x02019; recognition of their responsibility in their children&#x02019;s eating behavior according with qualitative data obtained in the same population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Future studies should identify the most effective strategies to involve parents in diet-oriented health promotion programs implemented in LMICs. Previous reports from high-income countries have documented the difficulty of reaching parents even after adapting interventions to their requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The latest research suggests that there is still insufficient evidence on how to engage and reach parents in these kinds of programs.</p><p id="Par53">Cluster randomized controlled trials should have both internal and external validity to enable generalizability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Although our sample size retained for analysis was smaller than expected, there are several reasons to conclude that ACTIVITALs&#x02019; internal validity was fairly acceptable: (i) analysis of missing values did not provide different results, (ii) outcome differences between the dropouts and the sample retained for analysis were small, (iii) the cluster nature of the study was considered in both the sample size calculations and data analyses, and, (v) the participants in the intervention and the control group were selected at random.</p><p id="Par54">External validity could be evaluated by the adoption, i.e. the extent to which the setting is representative to the wider population, and the evaluation of the implementation of the program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Regarding adoption, the findings of ACTIVITAL are mainly applicable to urban areas. The program may not be effective among rural adolescents as the needs assessment showed that determinants of healthy eating and physical activity were substantially different between both areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Even though some urban schools were not considered for randomization in the pair-matching process because they either had very few students or an unavailable matching pair, this selection does not influence the adoption of the program in the urban area. In recent years, the Ecuadorian school system was reformed. Currently, all the schools have become co-ed., and an important proportion of the small schools have closed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">We acknowledge a number of limitations. The 24-h recalls were applied only during weekdays. Although the average of two recalls is appropriate to estimate mean group intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], it does not allow estimating usual individual intake and the proportion of individuals at risk of inadequate intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The main purpose of the study however, was to assess differences between the intervention vs. control group. Data on differences between the adolescents who agreed to participate and those who did not was not collected. The causes of the differential effect between stage one and two remain to be confirmed using an effectiveness study comparing a highly controlled intervention with an intervention implemented in usual school conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. This research would clarify if the attenuated effect is the consequence of a relapse of the program or the consequence of the lack of control in habitual conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par56">ACTIVITAL had positive effects on dietary risk factors for NCDs, i.e. fruit and vegetable intake and the consumption of unhealthy food items during snacking. Although still below the nutritional recommendations, the combined effect of the intervention is encouraging and promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It suggests that school-based interventions can address various risk factors simultaneously in adolescents from LMICs. The program strategies must be implemented at the national level by collaboration between the academia and policy makers to assure impact at larger scale.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AIC</term><def><p id="Par7">Akaike Information Criteria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BIC</term><def><p id="Par8">Schwartz&#x02019;s Bayesian Information Criteria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPPE</term><def><p id="Par9">Comprehensive and Participatory Planning and Evaluation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IM</term><def><p id="Par10">Intervention mapping</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NCDs</term><def><p id="Par11">Non-communicable diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UBN</term><def><p id="Par12">Unsatisfied basic needs</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We acknowledge the cooperation of schools, directors, teachers, parents, adolescents, school food kiosks staff and any other school staff involved in the ACTIVITAL program.
