Treated infants received decreasing concentrations of iNO (INOmax, IKARIA, Clinton, NJ, USA) delivered using INOvent (Datex-Ohmeda, Madison, WI, USA), beginning at 7 to 21 days of age according to the following schedule: 20&#x02009;p.p.m. &#x000d7; 3 days, 10&#x02009;p.p.m. &#x000d7; 7 days, 5&#x02009;p.p.m. &#x000d7; 7 days, 2&#x02009;p.p.m. &#x000d7; 7 days, for a minimum duration of 24 days. Respiratory severity score was used as an index of respiratory support and is calculated as mean airway pressure &#x000d7; fraction of inspired oxygen.</p><p>Samples of TA fluid and plasma were obtained at baseline (before starting study gas) and within 24&#x02009;h of each change of dose of study gas (study days 1, 4, 11, and 18) or until the infant was extubated. TA samples were obtained from 90 infants (47 placebo treated and 43 iNO treated) and plasma samples were obtained from 102 infants (50 placebo treated and 52 iNO treated) from four centers (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Westchester Medical Center, and Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics in Kansas City, MO, USA). Approval from the IRB at all participating institutions and informed consent were obtained before patient enrollment and sample collection.</p><p>TA samples were collected as described earlier<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> using saline lavage according to the schedule noted above. Aspirated samples were placed in sterile tubes, centrifuged at 500&#x02009;<italic>g</italic> for 10&#x02009;min, and the supernatants were stored at &#x02212;70&#x02009;&#x000b0;C.

These demographics do not differ significantly from those of the entire population of infants in the parent trial (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>At study entry, before receiving study gas, there was no difference in either TA or plasma NO<sub>x</sub> levels between control and iNO-treated infants. Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between gestational age, birth weight, age at entry, or respiratory severity score at entry with NO<sub>x</sub> in plasma or TA at entry (data not shown).</p><p>In control infants, there was no change in concentrations of TA NO<sub>x</sub> or nitrite during the study period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a and b</xref>, respectively). iNO administration was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in median TA NO<sub>x</sub> at 20&#x02009;p.p.m. (51.7 vs 22.5&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> protein, <italic>P</italic>=0.0003) and a 1.7-fold increase at 10&#x02009;p.p.m. (35.4 vs 20.4&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.012). There were no significant differences in NO<sub>x</sub> at either 5&#x02009;p.p.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or 2&#x02009;p.p.m. (data not shown). The pattern was similar for nitrite concentrations, with significant increases of 1.8-fold (6.3 vs 3.6&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.22) at 20&#x02009;p.p.m. and 2.0-fold (7.8 vs 3.8&#x02009;nmol&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>, <italic>P</italic>=0.017) at 10&#x02009;p.p.m. for iNO-treated infants. Nitrite as a percentage of total metabolites was similar for both groups at all doses of study gas (mean was 14.2 and 14.4&#x00025; for iNO and control infants, respectively).</p><p>NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations in plasma of placebo infants had no apparent change during administration of study gas; the median value for 270 samples from 50 infants collected over multiple time points was 36.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;. In iNO-treated infants, plasma NO<sub>x</sub> levels (medians) were significantly increased compared with control infants at 20&#x02009;p.p.m. (95.9 vs 42.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), 10&#x02009;p.p.m. (80.9 vs 35.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), and 5&#x02009;p.p.m. (55.0 vs 34.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;, <italic>P</italic>=0.0016), but not at 2&#x02009;p.p.m. (44.0 vs 38.7&#x02009;&#x003bc;, <italic>P</italic>=0.37) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). As infants administered control study gas had no apparent time-dependent changes in plasma NO<sub>x</sub>, we examined the changes in plasma NO<sub>x</sub> in iNO-treated infants as a function of NO gas doses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> shows that when these data are plotted as fold-increase compared with the median control value, a clear dose&#x02013;response relationship is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). To measure the extent of change in plasma NO<sub>x</sub> after iNO administration, we compared values on days 1 and 3 (equivalent to 20 and recently switched to 10&#x02009;p.p.m. NO, respectively) to the individual infant's pre-gas value. Plasma NO<sub>x</sub> increased 2.9&#x000b1;0.2- and 3.6&#x000b1;0.3-fold (mean&#x000b1;s.e., <italic>n</italic>=37 and 28 on days 1 and 3, respectively). These were significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) greater than the changes seen in infants receiving placebo gas (1.1&#x000b1;0.1- and 1.2&#x000b1;0.1-fold on days 1 and 3).</p><p>To elucidate the association between NO metabolite levels and outcome, we first compared TA NO<sub>x</sub>, TA nitrite, or plasma NO<sub>x</sub> and outcome in both the treatment and control group at all treatment dose after therapy was initiated and found no significant improvement or deterioration in outcome (data not shown). However, in <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, we tested for a possible relationship between TA NO<sub>x</sub> levels at study entry, which reflects endogenous NO levels, and the clinical outcome of survival without BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Infants were divided into four quartiles based on their NO<sub>x</sub> concentration in TA related to the median of the entire group. In control infants, outcome was not related to level of NO<sub>x</sub> at study entry. For treated infants, outcome was better (87.5&#x00025; survival without BPD) among infants with the lowest quartile of NO<sub>x</sub> compared with the combined outcome for the other three quartiles (34.6&#x00025;, <italic>P</italic>=0.027). The infants in the lowest quartile of NO<sub>x</sub> did not differ from the remaining infants from whom we received samples as well as those in the parent trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> with respect to gestational age (25.3 weeks), birth weight (739&#x02009;g), age at entry (16 days), or entry respiratory severity score (3.5). For comparison, the infants in the highest quartile of NO<sub>x</sub> had an average gestational age of 25.5 weeks, birth weight of 766&#x02009;g, age at entry of 17.6 days, and entry respiratory severity score of 5.03. Regarding race, there were three Caucasian and five African&#x02013;American infants in the lowest quartile compared with five Caucasian, two African American, and one Asian infant in the highest quartile.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of iNO in premature infants has only recently been investigated in a series of randomized, controlled clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> Most trial protocols for the use of iNO to prevent BPD have used &#x0003c;14 days of treatment at &#x02a7d;10&#x02009;p.p.m. iNO. The NO CLD trial was unique in its use of decreasing concentrations of iNO starting at 20&#x02009;p.p.m. and in continuing treatment for 24 days by nasal cannulae when an infant was extubated. This protocol provided the opportunity to monitor NO<sub>x</sub> at different iNO doses over an extended period. We report a dose-related effect of iNO on levels of NO<sub>x</sub> in both TA and plasma, indicating effective delivery of NO to the injured lung and systemic uptake of exogenous NO and/or its metabolites. To our knowledge, this is the first description of metabolites related to use of iNO in the infant. In addition, we provide new information on endogenous NO levels, as reflected by metabolite concentrations, in premature infants. At study entry during the second or third postnatal week, before receiving study gas, total metabolite levels were not associated with degree of prematurity or severity of lung disease. However, a sub-population of the study infants with lower metabolite levels seemed to have a better clinical response to iNO, consistent with the concept of iNO as replacement therapy for a developmental deficiency of endogenous NO production.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup></p><p>In the premature baboon model of BPD, iNO at 5&#x02009;p.p.m. for 2 weeks beginning at birth improved respiratory function and lung structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The level of total NO<sub>x</sub> in TA fluid did not change, consistent with our observations in the human infant at this dose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Plasma NO<sub>x</sub> levels were increased &#x0223c;twofold in treated animals throughout the time of iNO administration, which is similar to the findings at 5 to 10&#x02009;p.p.m. iNO in this study of human infants.</p><p>As NO cannot be directly measured in stored biological samples, levels of nitrite and total NO oxidative metabolites were used as surrogate markers for NO. Nitrite represented &#x0223c;14&#x00025; of NO<sub>x</sub> in TA fluid, indicating that nitrate and potentially other NO metabolites constitute most of NO species present. Although it is clear from both this study and the baboon model that iNO can lead to an increase in plasma-borne NO<sub>x</sub>, it is uncertain whether NO and/or its metabolites diffuse across the lung. Studies in mice and rabbits showed that within 10&#x02009;min after intratracheal instillation of nitrite, the levels in lung and plasma were equal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Nitrite represents a portion of the bioactive pool of NO metabolites and has been shown to provide protection after ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury in a variety of tissues, including the brain, in animal studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In this regard, it is noteworthy that Kinsella <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> showed on head ultrasound an overall decrease in the combined outcome of grade 3 or 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, and ventriculomegaly in their iNO-treated group. Furthermore, Mestan <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> described an improvement in neurodevelopmental outcome, specifically in the cognitive portion of the Bayley Scale of Infant Development, in the iNO-treated infants compared with control in the Schreiber trial,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> which persisted after adjustment for the decrease in severe intraventricular hemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. The observations of elevated NO<sub>x</sub> support the possibility for extrapulmonary effects of iNO in infants that may be independent of improved pulmonary status.</p><p>There were no associations observed between TA or plasma NO<sub>x</sub> concentrations at study entry and measures of prematurity or severity of lung disease. Infant baboons delivered prematurely (at the end of the second trimester) are deficient in endogenous NO production, and NO synthase activity remains suppressed after birth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref></sup> Our observations suggest that endogenous NO production in sick preterm human infants does not increase appreciably between 24 and 30 weeks, or, alternatively, that developmental changes are not observed within the postnatal timeframe of this study. The concentration of plasma NO<sub>x</sub> in control infants (36.4&#x02009;&#x003bc;) is somewhat lower than the level reported for healthy full-term infants on day 5 (55.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;), perhaps reflecting an effect of gestational age.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup></p><p>Infants with lower TA NO<sub>x</sub> levels at entry seemed to have a better clinical response to iNO therapy (survival without BPD) than infants with higher entry NO<sub>x</sub>, consistent with the concept that insufficiency of endogenous NO contributes to BPD. An alternative hypothesis is that the infants in the lowest quartile have a lesser degree of inflammation or oxidative stress at study entry. To support this hypothesis, we examined the 8-epi PGF 2&#x003b1; levels in these infants and found them to be lower (86&#x02009;ng&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> protein) than what we have earlier reported in a larger group of iNO responders,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> but there was wide variability in this measurement (0.35 to 534&#x02009;ng&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> protein). These results should be interpreted with caution and need confirmation because of the relatively small number of infants in each quartile of NO<sub>x</sub> concentration.</p><p>Conversely, we did not find an association with NO<sub>x</sub> levels and adverse outcome at any dose in either the iNO-treated or control infants in this study. Specific NO metabolites have been described before in relation to BPD and response to therapy. Banks <italic>et al.</italic> showed that a specific NO metabolite, 3-nitrotyrosine, is elevated in plasma in the first month of life in infants who develop BPD. Furthermore, increased levels of 3-nitrotyrosine after the first month of life correlated with the fraction of inspired oxygen the infant was receiving.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Lorch <italic>et al.</italic> described the plasma levels of 3-nitrotyrosine in infants with BPD who were receiving iNO. A significant decrease within the first 72&#x02009;h after starting therapy was observed in those infants who were weaned off mechanical ventilation compared with those who remained on mechanical ventilation at discharge or who expired.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> These data suggest that markers of nitrative and oxidative stress are associated with both BPD and response to therapy. We have previously reported from data in the NO CLD trial that 3-nitrotyrosine did not change in infants with and without BPD, whether they were receiving iNO or placebo.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> This discrepancy may be explained by differences in study population, severity of illness, progression of clinical course, when samples were taken, or differences in assay techniques. However, given that 3-nitrotyrosine is a small component of total NO<sub>x</sub> metabolites, it is not surprising that we did not see changes in this study.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, TA samples could not be obtained after infants were extubated, which reduced the number of samples available at 5 and 2&#x02009;p.p.m. and accordingly reduced the power of our study at these points. In general, variability in the TA data was greater than in plasma values, which reflects in part the necessity to use an imperfect denominator (total protein) to correct for dilution of epithelial lining fluid by the lavage saline. Second, infants from whom samples were received were from a subset of NO CLD trial sites enrolling patients. Although their demographics were the same as infants in the parent trial, and, therefore, representative of the entire cohort, this remains a limitation. Third, although infants in this study had similar nutritional management strategies, there was no specific control over or measurement of nitrate intake, which may influence the measurement of NO<sub>x</sub> within plasma. Lastly, as NO cannot be directly measured within these samples, one must rely on measurements of its most abundant metabolites as markers of NO content.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that iNO therapy for premature infants results in dose-related increases in NO<sub>x</sub> in both lung fluid and the circulation. These findings indicate the efficiency and quantitative nature of NO delivery to infants with lung disease and raise the possibility of increased delivery of NO to other tissues with iNO therapy. As iNO treatment is not associated with increased incidence of co-morbidities of prematurity, and may offer neuroprotection, uptake of NO and metabolites into the circulation may represent an additional benefit of iNO for the at-risk premature infant.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>RAB and PLB have received research grant support and advisor fees from IKARIA (formerly INO Therapeutics).
