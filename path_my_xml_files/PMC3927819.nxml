In addition, interventions are needed that help to overcome barriers to psychosocial treatment such as limited face-to-face psychosocial support services, a shortage of adequately trained professionals, geographical distance, perceived and personal stigma and a preference for consumer-centric and self-directed learning. <italic>My Road Ahead</italic> is an online cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention for prostate cancer. This protocol describes a randomised controlled trial (RCT) that will evaluate the efficacy of this online intervention alone, the intervention in combination with a moderated online forum, and the moderated online forum alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study utilises a RCT design with three groups receiving: 1) the 6-module My Road Ahead intervention alone; 2) the My Road Ahead intervention plus a moderated online forum; and 3) the moderated online forum alone. It is expected that 150 men with localised prostate cancer will be recruited into the RCT. Online measures will assess men&#x02019;s psychological distress as well as sexual and relationship adjustment at baseline, post-intervention, 3&#x000a0;month follow-up and 6&#x000a0;month follow-up. The study is being conducted in Australia and participants will be recruited from April 2012 to Feb 2014. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of My Road Ahead in reducing psychological distress.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, My Road Ahead is the first self-directed online psychological intervention developed for men who have been treated for localised prostate cancer. The RCT will assess the efficacy of this intervention in improving psychological well-being, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction and overall quality of life. If successful, this intervention could provide much needed support to men receiving treatment for localised prostate cancer in a highly accessible manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12611000278932">ACTRN12611000278932</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>E-intervention</kwd><kwd>Online</kwd><kwd>Therapy</kwd><kwd>Distress</kwd><kwd>Men</kwd><kwd>Web-based</kwd><kwd>CBT</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed non-melanoma skin cancer in males worldwide. In Australia, 19,403 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and Australian men have a 1 in 7 chance of diagnosis of prostate cancer by age 75 and a 1 in 4 chance by age 85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Registry data demonstrates that 93% of men have localised disease at diagnosis in contemporary practice in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Survival rates have increased over time and 5-year prostate cancer related survival is now 92% in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. While treatment advances have contributed to this significant improvement in survival, all treatment options will result in significant decrements in quality of life (QoL) including erectile dysfunction (ED), urinary incontinence and bowel urgency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These residual symptoms can be very difficult for the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] given their significant impact on the patient&#x02019;s general quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Survivorship issues in the prostate cancer patient population therefore pose unique challenges in terms of enhancing outcomes and reducing the negative impact on QoL.</p><p>To date, QoL research has generally focussed on the physical impact of treatments on prostate cancer patients. However, research investigating the impact of prostate cancer treatment on psychological well-being is increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The results of these studies have revealed that among those who have had prostate cancer treatment, the prevalence of mood, anxiety and adjustment disorders ranges from 9-24% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The results from other studies suggest that physical side effects of prostate cancer treatment (such as incontinence and sexual dysfunction) are especially associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Patients also report high levels of unmet need in relation to their prostate cancer experience with one Australian study finding that 74% of men report some form of unmet need in relation to their prostate cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The most commonly reported area of unmet need was in the psychological support domain where 54% of men expressed that they felt some level of unmet psychological support need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Sexuality was reported by 47% of men as an area where they had some level of need for assistance or support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><sec><title>Psychosocial interventions for men treated for localised prostate cancer</title><p>The efficacy of psychosocial support has been repeatedly reported in the general cancer setting. Unfortunately, access to evidence-based and timely psychosocial support is often limited, particularly in rural and remote regions of Australia but also in public hospitals across the country and, indeed, worldwide. It has been reported that only 14 to 21% of Australian women with cancer attend face-to-face support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Men are lower utilisers of health services in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and international reports indicate that mental health service utilisation by men is lower than women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review of psychosocial interventions for men with prostate cancer and their partners highlighted the poor quality of current research in this field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The authors concluded that group cognitive-behavioural and psycho-educational interventions with a specific focus on cancer specific distress show the most robust research evidence for efficacy, however, further research is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Another review explored psychosocial interventions addressing sexual or relationship functioning in men treated for prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This review concluded that there is some evidence to support the efficacy of psychosocial interventions in improving sexual functioning especially when delivered face-to-face or through utilisation of complex interventions that specifically target sexuality and the relationship. However, this review also concluded that further research is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Related to sexuality and intimacy, masculinity is emerging as an important area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and yet it is not routinely addressed and integrated into interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Online interventions</title><p>Mental and behavioural health promotion, prevention, treatment and management-oriented interventions that are delivered via the internet or other electronic technologies, with or without human support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], often referred to as &#x0201c;e-Interventions&#x0201d;, can overcome many barriers of access that are commonly encountered in our healthcare system. Whilst the use of e-Interventions has grown in both the mental health and general health setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] it has received limited attention in the cancer setting.</p><p>In the cancer setting, most online research has focused on developing and evaluating online peer support interventions with mixed outcomes in female cancer samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. van den Brink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] developed an online information and support intervention for head and neck cancer patients in the Netherlands with the aim of overcoming the communication and information bottlenecks in supportive head and neck cancer care. The authors reported that patient use and satisfaction with the intervention was very high despite patients having recently undergone intensive surgical treatment. Patient age was not a barrier (mean age 59&#x000a0;years and range 38-78) and, despite 56% of participants having limited computer experience prior to the use of the intervention, consistently positive feedback was received. This online support intervention showed improved QoL outcomes in participants as compared to those in a control group who did not access the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, the intervention focused on psycho-education and support rather than skills in coping with the experience of cancer diagnosis, treatment and recovery.</p><p>Schover et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] developed and assessed the efficacy of an online sexual counselling intervention in comparison to traditional face-to-face sexual counselling for couples following treatment for localised prostate cancer. Sexual counselling involved three face-to-face sessions with a therapist while the online intervention delivered the therapy via email contact with a therapist. This study found that the delivery of the intervention via the internet was as effective as the traditional face-to-face intervention in producing enduring improvements in sexual outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. While this study highlighted the potential utility of online interventions in this population, to date, no online self-directed intervention with minimal support and a focus on a range of identified problem areas has been developed and evaluated for localised prostate cancer.</p><p>A recent review by Leykin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] explored the role of online interventions in supporting people with cancer. This review highlighted that e-Interventions can provide the majority of people with an acceptable alternative support modality in a systematic and scalable way. Research has found that telephone and internet-based support is particularly important for men with cancer, predominately prostate cancer, living outside metropolitan regions in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Psycho-education and self-directed therapeutic techniques can easily be transferred to an online environment and may also break down the barriers that many people face in terms of accessing support, including lack of available resources and perceived and personal stigma, fear and uncertainty in accessing mental health services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Leykin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] criticised current online resources for being predominately information and support based, with a need for evidenced-based treatment interventions.</p><p>The current study involves a randomised controlled trial (RCT) assessing the effectiveness of three online interventions: (i) access to an online intervention program (My Road Ahead-only); (ii) access to the online intervention plus to a moderated online forum (My Road Ahead-plus-forum); and (iii) access to the online form only (forum-only). This study design was chosen to evaluate the online intervention in comparison to a more basic level of care (some peer support) and to separate the effect of the online intervention and the peer support forum on treatment outcomes. Past RCTs have used a variety of control conditions from wait-list control groups, care as usual, or some basic information provision. Cuijpers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have criticised past internet-based RCTs for failing to use control groups beyond a wait-list control, since there may be an overestimation of intervention efficacy when those in a wait-list control condition are unlikely to make self-directed steps to improving their situation if they are &#x0201c;waiting&#x0201d;. A web-based comparative condition has been recommended to overcome these problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Basic moderated forums have been used in previous studies as a control group as a means to control for spontaneous improvement or to control for the general attention and the possible beneficial effects from sharing one&#x02019;s experience with others (e.g. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). In addition online support groups may themselves have positive effects for people with cancer (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]), and the use of three groups would allow for exploration of the relative benefits of the online psychological intervention and peer support (forum).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Method/design</title><sec><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The overall aim of the RCT is to examine the efficacy of the online, self-directed, psychological intervention, <italic>My Road Ahead</italic> alone versus My Road Ahead plus use of a moderated online forum, versus the forum alone in improving participants&#x02019; psychological distress as well as sexual, relationship and psychosocial adjustment from baseline to post-intervention, 3&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months follow-up.</p><p>Primary outcome:</p><p>Psychological distress as measured by the combined total score of the DASS-21 will be used as the primary outcome measure.</p><p>It is hypothesised that:</p><p>1.

The DASS-21 is a set of three self-report scales designed to measure the negative emotional states of depression, anxiety and stress as well as total distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Each of the three DASS-21 scales contains 7 items. The depression scale measures dysphoria, hopelessness, devaluation of life, self-deprecation, lack of interest/involvement, anhedonia and inertia. The anxiety scale measures autonomic arousal, skeletal muscle effects, situational anxiety, and subjective experience of anxious affect. The stress scale assesses difficulty relaxing, nervous arousal, being irritable and impatient. The total score is the sum of these three subscale scores. Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week, using a 4-point severity/frequency scale. The DASS-21 scales have good concurrent validity with the Beck measures of depression and anxiety (BDI &#x00026; BAI) and good internal consistency and reliability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><sec><title><italic>The prostate cancer-related quality of life scales (PCa-QoL)</italic></title><p>The impact of erectile dysfunction on sexual and masculine identity will be measured using the PCa-QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], which measures men&#x02019;s perceptions of early prostate cancer treatment outcomes, focussing on behavioural, interpersonal and emotional changes that patients attribute to prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The scale contains 84 Likert type items that fall into 11 scales including: 1. Urinary control (behavioural and interpersonal implications of impaired control of one&#x02019;s bladder); 2. Sexual ability - sexual intimacy (ability to perform sexually and feelings of frustration, embarrassment or failure); 3. Sexual confidence (confidence and anxiety about intimate activity and sexual thoughts); 4. Spouse affection (misgivings about demonstrations of affection with one&#x02019;s spouse), 5. Masculine self-esteem; 6. Health worry (uncertainty about one&#x02019;s health); 7. PSA concern; 8. Cancer control; 9. Informed decision; 10. Regret; and, 11. Positive outlook.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>International index of erectile function (IIEF)</italic></title><p>The IIEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] is a 15-item self-report measure that was developed to assess sexual function among men with Erectile Dysfunction (ED) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The IIEF instructs respondents to answer items according to functioning during the past 4&#x000a0;weeks. Responses to items are summed to determine the total IIEF score (range 5&#x02013;75). Rosen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] reported high internal consistency, for the total IIEF scale (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91), as well as high test-retest reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.82).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Kansas marital satisfaction scale (KMS)</italic></title><p>The KMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] is a common measure of relationship satisfaction. It is a 3-item self-reported questionnaire measuring general relationship satisfaction. Final scores on the KMS range from 3 to 21 with higher scores indicating higher relationship satisfaction. A recent meta-analysis of 398 articles evaluated the reliability of seven different relationship satisfaction measures using Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].

The CPQ-SF asks respondents to identify typical communication styles when either issues or problems arise and during discussion of issues or problems. Respondents are asked to rate the likelihood that certain issues/problems occur on a 9-point scale from very unlikely to very likely.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Dyadic sexual communication scale (DSC)</italic></title><p>The DSC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] was originally developed as a 13-item scale to measure a respondent&#x02019;s self-reported perception of their communication with their partner related to sexual relationships. Subsequently, Choi, Catania, and Dolcini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] created a 4-item version of the DSC scale. The short-form DSC has 4 items requesting ratings on a 5-point scale: strongly disagree, disagree, neutral, agree, and strongly agree. Reliability of the 4 item version of the DSC was found to be acceptable taken from a male sample as part of the larger study mentioned above (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;.65) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>General confidence</italic></title><p>Because of the strong link between sexual potency and general confidence, a 1-item scale was created to assess general confidence (<italic>I feel confident in most areas of my life</italic>) which will be rated a 5-point scale: <italic>almost never/never</italic> to <italic>almost always/always</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Healthcare service utilisation and demographics</italic></title><p>Participants will also be asked to record the number of contacts they have with additional support services including psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers as well as attending a support group or accessing support from the cancer council or other online resources. Degree of engagement of the participant&#x02019;s partner in the program and completion of the exercises will also be assessed post-intervention.</p><p>Demographic details include age, date of birth, marital status, employment status, gross annual income, ethnicity, languages spoken. Other participant details including postcode, prostate cancer date of diagnosis, date of treatment, type of treatment, use of oral erectile function medications (e.g. use of Viagra or cialis), use of injection therapies for erectile function (e.g. Caverject injections), and use of other mechanical aids for erectile function will also be collected.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Program and forum satisfaction questionnaires</italic></title><p>Program completion will be tracked and recorded through the online system which will allow reporting of the proportion of the program completed by each user as well as details about which modules are most accessed. A questionnaire has been developed for this study for the purpose of measuring the level of program satisfaction and level of inclusion of partners. Respondents will be presented with open-ended questions relating to the &#x0201c;best&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worst&#x0201d; parts of the program and how the program could be improved, including any additional features they might find useful. If men do not work through all the modules they will be asked for reasons. An equivalent questionnaire has been developed to measure satisfaction with the moderated forum.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A medium effect size is estimated for the primary outcome measure, total distress, as measured by the DASS-21 total score between groups across the five assessment points. To power the study at the 80% level, based on an alpha level of .05 with an estimated medium effect size (f&#x02009;=&#x02009;.25) and with three groups completing five assessment points, 125 complete responses will be required. To account for an estimated 20% drop-out rate a total of 150 participants will be required; 50 per group.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data will be analysed using repeated measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) with between and within subjects factors examined while controlling for age. To examine any bias that may arise as a consequence of attrition, baseline data will be examined to explore if there are any statistically significant factors associated with participants who drop out compared to those who do not. This will allow an analysis for attrition bias in the final results based on the predicted probability of attrition as recommended by Rubin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and Heckman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].

The RCT will assess the efficacy of this intervention in improving psychological well-being, sexual satisfaction, relationship satisfaction and overall quality of life. If successful this intervention could provide much needed support to men receiving treatment for localised prostate cancer in an accessible, appealing and accessible manner.</p><p>This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed intervention by comparing the outcomes of participants who receive access to My Road Ahead, with or without access to a forum, to the outcomes of participants who receive access to a forum only. This design enables evaluation of the benefits of the peer discussion forum in addition to the developed intervention. This novel approach to evaluation of the contribution of the peer discussion forum will provide much needed data about the role of psychological strategies and peer discussion.</p><p>Lack of available psychosocial support services for men treated for prostate cancer is a significant problem worldwide. Integration of psychosocial services within the treatment team is very rare and patient reported unmet needs in this domain are very high. If My Road Ahead is successful we hope to be able to provide access to the program to all men treated for localised prostate cancer in Australia thereby increasing access by reducing barriers to access as well as reducing stigma associated with accessing psychosocial services.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ACW &#x02013; 25% contribution to paper including study design, clinical content development, data analysis and report writing.
