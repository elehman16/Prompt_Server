The purpose of our study was to investigate the acute effects of tDCS on cortical activity using electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with an affective disorder. Eighteen patients diagnosed with an affective disorder and experiencing a depressive episode participated in a sham-controlled study of tDCS, each receiving a session of active (2 mA for 20 minutes) and sham tDCS to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The effects of tDCS on EEG activity were assessed after each session using event-related potentials (ERP) and measurement of spectral activity during a visual working memory (VWM) task. We observed task and intervention dependent effects on both ERPs and task-related alpha and theta activity, where active compared to sham stimulation resulted in a significant reduction in the N2 amplitude and reduced theta activity over frontal areas during memory retrieval. In summary a single session of anodal tDCS stimulation to the left DLPFC during a major depressive episode resulted in modulated brain activity evident in task-related EEG. Effects on the N2 and frontal theta activity likely reflect modulated activity in the medial frontal cortex and hence indicate that the after-effects of tDCS extend beyond the direct focal effects to the left DLPFC.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the ARC Thinking Systems grant (TS0669860); the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC #510142); BrainNRG collaborative award (JSMF22002082), and the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO #45110-030).

Clinical improvements following tDCS manifest as reductions in depressive symptoms <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kalu1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Brunoni1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, as well as improved cognitive performance in attention and working memory domains <xref rid="pone.0098503-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As an emerging therapeutic tool tDCS overall is well tolerated, safe and non-invasive, has few side effects, and does not require delivery with anaesthesia <xref rid="pone.0098503-Rosa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However there is a relative paucity of knowledge regarding the direct effects of tDCS on cortical activity in patients experiencing a major depressive episode <xref rid="pone.0098503-Rosa1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Stagg1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, impeding both the development of quantitative markers of physiological response to stimulation and a more personalised treatment approach.</p><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an obvious candidate for studying changes in cortical activity following tDCS <xref rid="pone.0098503-Keeser1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. tDCS is known to affect neural excitability in a polarity specific way and the neuromodulatory effects are widely acknowledged <xref rid="pone.0098503-Antal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Terney1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. In addition to focal changes around the location of anodal stimulation, tDCS may have wide-ranging cognitive and behavioural effects resulting from propagation through brain networks <xref rid="pone.0098503-Ruffini1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. EEG has been widely used to study the neural correlates in cognitive paradigms such as visual working memory (VWM) <xref rid="pone.0098503-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Kochan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and hence is now used to investigate the modulatory effects of tDCS. These studies suggest a strong direct effect of tDCS on EEG activity in healthy subjects, both at rest <xref rid="pone.0098503-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and during cognitive tasks <xref rid="pone.0098503-Heimrath1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Zaehle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. For example, Keeser <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Keeser1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found increased amplitude of the P2 and P3 components in a working memory task localized to the parahippocampal gyrus. Similarly, Tseng <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> found an increased N2 amplitude and memory performance after tDCS to parietal cortex and Van der Hasselt <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Vanderhasselt1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> show enhanced N450 amplitudes when inhibiting habitual responses of opposing emotionally valent stimuli. Hence, EEG appears to be particularly suited to study widespread cortical activity changes induced by tDCS.</p><p>Whilst these studies sought to primarily elucidate the basic neurophysiological impact of tDCS, the findings suggest a role for EEG as a marker or predictor of response in the therapeutic setting <xref rid="pone.0098503-Fregni1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Brunoni2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. For instance, a case study by Palm <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Palm1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> reported acute effects of tDCS using EEG obtained from a patient with pharmacological therapy-resistant major depression. There are numerous investigations demonstrating changes in EEG following therapeutic tDCS in patients; with epilepsy <xref rid="pone.0098503-Faria1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, stroke <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kasashima1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> alcohol dependence <xref rid="pone.0098503-daSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, chronic pain <xref rid="pone.0098503-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, and also neuropsychiatric disease including major depression <xref rid="pone.0098503-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kuo1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. However no sham-controlled studies examining direct tDCS effects on EEG activity in patients experiencing a major depressive episode have been undertaken. For the therapeutic use of tDCS in patients with depression, a continuous current of 1&#x02013;2 mA is applied up to 20 min via an anode located over the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) <xref rid="pone.0098503-Loo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of tDCS remain poorly understood, but it has been recently suggested treatment effects may result from modulation of activity in associated areas connected to the DLPFC such as the subgenual cingulate <xref rid="pone.0098503-Ruffini1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The widespread effects of tDCS on cortical functioning and disturbances in prefrontal regions can be effectively assessed using a VWM paradigm <xref rid="pone.0098503-Brunoni3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Impairments in cognitive functioning are a well-known neuropsychological consequence in affective disorders and VWM is thus a useful tool for exploring these associated cognitive dysfunctions <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kalska1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Segrave1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Moreover, tDCS to the left DLPFC has been shown to improve cognitive performance in a VWM task <xref rid="pone.0098503-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In patients with major depressive disorder, tDCS has been shown to improve cognitive functions such as working memory <xref rid="pone.0098503-Loo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Finally, VWM is known to engage a constellation of brain areas, many located in the prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kochan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. By engaging these areas potentially modulated by tDCS, task-related EEG responses may register these indirect effects on cortical functioning.</p><p>The objectives of our study were to investigate the acute after-effects of tDCS on cortical EEG activity during a VWM task in patients with an affective disorder during a depressive episode. EEG data were acquired from participants enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study testing effects of a single session of active versus sham tDCS. We studied EEG activity during a VWM task, focusing on traditional evoked potentials as well as event-related spectral changes. Based on previous results on tDCS in healthy subjects, we expected that tDCS would improve working memory and modulate the corresponding activity of prefrontal cortical regions through the propagation of stimulation-induced activity through brain networks. Additionally, we hypothesised that assessing task-related EEG activity in a VWM paradigm would allow characterisation of cognitive sub-functions and quantitative neurophysiological markers affected by tDCS in patients experiencing depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Eighteen participants were invited to participate in our study prior to entry into a clinical trial investigating tDCS stimulation for the treatment of depression at the Black Dog Institute, Sydney, Australia (registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>: NCT00763230) <xref rid="pone.0098503-Loo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Data was collected from eighteen participants; however only fourteen data sets were used for the final analysis due to artefactual EEG and poor task performance. Informed consent was given in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines and the study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of The University of New South Wales. Written and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to study enrolment in accordance with the National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines and the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of New South Wales.</p><p>Participants were diagnosed in a semi-structured interview using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) <xref rid="pone.0098503-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, with confirmation in a clinical interview by a psychiatrist. Participants with a DSM-IV major depressive episode and a score of &#x02265;20 on the Montgomery-&#x000c5;sperg depression scale (MADRS) were included. In two patients, the present episode occurred in the context of bipolar disorder; all others had unipolar depressive disorders. Trained raters assessed mood and functioning during the study using the MADRS and Clinical Global Impression &#x02013; severity of Illness (CGI-S). Exclusion criteria included: other Axis 1 disorders, alcohol misuse, drug dependence or misuse, neurological disorders, electronic or metal implants, history of heart disease, electronic or metal implants, treatment with ECT in current episode, pregnancy and concurrent treatment with medications shown to modulate the effects of tDCS (benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, dextromethorphan and pseudoephedrine). During the study five participants were medication free and all others were taking the following antidepressant medications; duloxetine (2), citalopram (1), venlafaxine (1), duloxetine/mirtazapine (1), desvenlafaxine (1), dothiepin (1), mirtazapine (2), escitalopram (1), olanzapine/paroxetine (1), fluoxetine/zolpidem (1), nortriptyline/lithium (1). For clinical and ethical reasons, participants were not required to withdraw from these medications and any concurrent psychotropic medications were continued at stable doses.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>tDCS</title><p>The study protocol was a double-blind sham-controlled crossover design where participants were randomised to one of two arms of the study in which they received either tDCS followed by sham (Group 1) or sham followed by active tDCS (Group 2) in a ratio of 1&#x02236;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0098503-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Hence, each participant received one session of active and one session of sham tDCS. The tDCS was administered using an Eldith DC-stimulator (NeuroConn GmbH, Germany). The anode placed over the left DLPFC (identified as F3 on the international 10&#x02013;20 EEG system) and cathode placed over the lateral aspect of the contralateral orbit (at the F8 position). Active stimulation was given at 2 mA for 20 min, with a gradual ramp up/down of the current over 30 s. For sham stimulation, a 1 mA current was applied for 30 s with ramp up/down over 10 s, giving an initial sensation of tDCS while minimising stimulatory effects. Active and sham sessions were performed 7&#x02013;8 days apart. Following each intervention, EEG activity was acquired to investigate the acute effects of the brain stimulation on cortical activity. EEG data from four participants were excluded because of failure to perform the VWM task at higher than chance levels (1 participant), or because of excessive EEG artefacts (3 participants).

Cleaned EEG data was re-referenced to the average reference and filtered using a low-pass 45-Hz Butterworth zero-phase filter.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Event-related Potentials</title><p>ERP analysis was used to assess differences between active and sham tDCS conditions on cognitive manipulations relating to memory load.

Here we examined acute effects of a single session of anodal tDCS to the left DLPFC on task-related EEG activity using a sham-controlled crossover design. We assessed behavioural correlates, ERPs and spectral changes during a VWM task in these patients after receiving tDCS. Respectively we observed significant effects of tDCS on cortical EEG activity in both electrophysiological measures (ERPs and ERS/ERD) during the retrieval period of the VWM task, but found no significant effects on behavioural measures. A distinct finding was that active tDCS resulted in a reduction of the event-related N2 component over prefrontal brain areas during medium memory load. In addition, we observed a significant reduction in frontal theta activity following active compared to sham stimulation and increased occipito-parietal alpha desynchronisation after active tDCS during the retention phase.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first sham-controlled EEG study investigating the effects of tDCS stimulation in a group of patients with an affective disorder. Our results corroborate previous findings from a case study which recorded EEG after anodal tDCS in a patient with major depressive disorder showing reduction in alpha and theta power <xref rid="pone.0098503-Palm1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Our findings are consistent with previous EEG studies examining effects of tDCS in healthy participants. The reduction in alpha power over the occipito-parietal cortex after tDCS closely mirrors the reduction in alpha power observed during an emotionally-salient oddball task after anodal tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-Maeoka1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, during VWM after anodal tDCS to the left prefrontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-Zaehle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or the right parietal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-Heimrath1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The reduction of alpha band activity over occipito-parietal cortices could reflect general effects of tDCS on the fronto-parietal network known to be active when processing stimuli in the VWM system <xref rid="pone.0098503-Heimrath1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition to reduced occipito-parietal alpha, we also observed a reduction in frontal theta oscillations during memory retrieval in response to tDCS. This finding is supported by previous studies showing reduced frontal theta in resting-state EEG <xref rid="pone.0098503-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, and during a working memory task <xref rid="pone.0098503-Hoy1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A potential explanation of the observed reduction of frontal theta power while VWM performance was unaffected may be that anodal tDCS facilitated more efficient neurocognitive functioning, such that similar performance was attained with less effort. Consistent with the current findings, the effect of tDCS on event related potentials have mainly been reported around 250 ms latency. Keeser <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Keeser1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found increased amplitude of the P2 and P3 components in a working memory task that were localized to the parahippocampal gyrus. Similarly, Tseng <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0098503-Tseng1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> found an increased N2 (250&#x02013;320 ms) amplitude and memory performance after tDCS to posterior parietal cortex only in poor performers. Hence, tDCS induces widespread changes in cortical activity reflected by a few key indicators in EEG recordings. The above studies were mostly in healthy subjects and our findings extend this emerging body of knowledge in a clinical population experiencing a depressive episode.</p><p>The behavioural effects of tDCS in the literature are mixed and in our study we found no behavioural effects of tDCS on the VWM task. Previous studies have found improved task performance <xref rid="pone.0098503-Oliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Fregni1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Chi1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Ohn1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Fregni2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, improved accuracy <xref rid="pone.0098503-Keeser2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and faster reaction times in response to tDCS <xref rid="pone.0098503-Keeser2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Zaehle1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Brunoni3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. An explanation for the lack of effects in our study may relate to task difficulty: Hard trials may have been too complex resulting in close to chance performance (floor effect), while the easy trials not challenging enough (ceiling effect) <xref rid="pone.0098503-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Awh1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Fukuda1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. Indeed, the effects of tDCS on the N2 component were only found during medium memory load. In future studies, the sensitivity of the VWM task may be improved by titrating individuals and adjusting task difficulty to individual capabilities. The current paradigm was specifically developed for electrophysiological <xref rid="pone.0098503-Boonstra1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and neuroimaging <xref rid="pone.0098503-Kochan1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> studies and may therefore lack sensitivity to detect behavioural changes after tDCS, however there is strong evidence to suggest working memory is a suitable system to characterise the effects of tDCS <xref rid="pone.0098503-Brunoni3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the clinical trial following our study, cognitive performance was measured five minutes after tDCS and improvements were observed <xref rid="pone.0098503-Loo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. In contrast, in our study a sixty-minute lag time existed between tDCS and the cognitive task due to the EEG setup time and may potentially have diminished the acute effects of tDCS. EEG measures may be more sensitive to the effects of tDCS than behavioural tests, which assess overall task performance and generally involve many interconnected cognitive functions. EEG measures may be able to distinguish between these components and reflect the effect on specific cognitive functions, such as stimulus encoding or attention, as well as distinguishing region-specific effects. This would also further enhance the potential of EEG as an objective clinical endpoint in the research and therapeutic setting.</p><p>This exploratory study sought to elucidate the effects of tDCS on EEG measures in view of investigating potential biomarkers for use in a clinical setting. However, in the current study only 18 patients were recruited and four patients were excluded due to high levels of EEG artefacts or inadequate task performance. We chose a within subjects design to optimise the power, given the sample size. The within subjects design is an efficient use of participants time and allowed detection of differences across our different variables with sufficient statistical power to draw inference about the treatment effects. Our study was a satellite study to a clinical trial assessing the efficacy of tDCS in depression <xref rid="pone.0098503-Loo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. A core feature of the clinical trial was to determine the efficacy for treating patients exhibiting symptoms of depression &#x02013; symptomatology of both unipolar and bipolar depression. We performed exploratory correlation analysis between the EEG measures and subsequent improvement in the clinical trial (see Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0098503.s001">Text S1</xref>). This shows a weak correlation in those participants in whom the regression analysis could be performed (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8). However, the effect did not survive removal of an outlier from the data. These early promising findings provide scope for a larger future study that integrates EEG following tDCS and a regression analysis with clinical outcomes, which may disentangle the effects of tDCS in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Simultaneous tDCS and EEG <xref rid="pone.0098503-Faria1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Schestatsky1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> would reduce the time required for the EEG set-up and allow for more extensive testing in larger patient groups. Such a study would confirm whether the identified EEG measures indeed predict the differences in clinical improvement after tDCS treatment and thus address questions regarding treatment of affective disorders. Moreover, there is no agreement on what constitutes the most efficacious amount of tDCS, the optimal exposure time <xref rid="pone.0098503-DellOsso1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-ArulAnandam1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> or the effect and efficacy of concurrent pharmacological intervention <xref rid="pone.0098503-Nitsche2" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Potentially, EEG could play a role in monitoring the response to tDCS, using an approach tailored to the more subtle effect of tDCS.</p><p>The current findings may also help to uncover potential physiological mechanisms underlying the clinical improvements following tDCS. The observed changes in theta and N2 were found in channel FCz over the medial frontal cortex. The modulation of these EEG components most likely reflects indirect effects of brain stimulations rather than direct effects on the left DLPFC. That is, the frontal theta rhythm in working memory has been associated with the medial frontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-Asada1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Jensen2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Likewise, several studies support the view that the N2 component is generated by sources in the medial frontal cortex <xref rid="pone.0098503-vanSchie1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098503-Nieuwenhuis1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. The N2 component is thought to reflect novelty detection and conflict monitoring <xref rid="pone.0098503-Folstein1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. This is consistent with the present finding that the N2 is significantly reduced during the retrieval phase when participants decide whether the same stimulus was perceived. The medial frontal cortex is linked to decision uncertainty <xref rid="pone.0098503-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> and also to depression <xref rid="pone.0098503-Mayberg1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098503-Seminowicz1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Moreover, major depressive disorder has been characterized by abnormal patterns in brain oscillations in the theta <xref rid="pone.0098503-LinkenkaerHansen1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and alpha band <xref rid="pone.0098503-Segrave1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Hence, the current findings suggest modulated activity of the medial frontal cortex after tDCS engendering the idea that focal brain stimulation propagates through brain networks resulting in wide-ranging effects on cortical functioning <xref rid="pone.0098503-Ruffini1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In sum, the present study shows the suitability of EEG to detect the cortical after-effects of tDCS in patients experiencing depression (see also <xref rid="pone.0098503-Baskaran1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>). The observed effects on EEG components are considered to have a source in medial frontal cortex suggesting that tDCS affects cortical functioning beyond focal changes at the stimulation site. Concurrent monitoring of the effects tDCS using EEG would allow mapping these changes in network activity enabling a more personalised approach to tDCS treatment delivery. A neurophysiological understanding of the mechanism underlying the effects of tDCS will further help to optimise treatment protocols.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0098503.s001"><label>Text S1</label><caption><p>
