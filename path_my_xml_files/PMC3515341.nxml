Key contributors to treatment non-adherence are fear of hypoglycaemia, difficulty and lack of self-efficacy associated with insulin dose determination. Because manual calculation of insulin boluses is both complex and time consuming, people may rely on empirical estimates, which can result in persistent hypoglycaemia and/or hyperglycaemia. Use of automated bolus advisors (BA) has been shown to help insulin pump users to more accurately meet prandial insulin dosage requirements, improve postprandial glycaemic excursions, and achieve optimal glycaemic control with an increased time within optimal range. Use of a BA containing an early algorithm based on sliding scales for insulin dosing has also been shown to improve HbA1c levels in people treated with multiple daily insulin injections (MDI). We designed a study to determine if use of an automated BA can improve clinical and psychosocial outcomes in people treated with MDI.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study (ABACUS) is a 6-month, prospective, randomised, multi-centre, multi-national trial to determine if automated BA use improves glycaemic control as measured by a change in HbA1c in people using MDI with elevated HbA1c levels (#62;7.5%). A total of 226 T1DM and T2DM participants will be recruited. Anticipated attrition of 20% will yield a sample size of 90 participants, which will provide #62;80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.5%, with SD of 0.9%, using a one-sided 5% <italic>t</italic>-test, with 5% significance level. Other measures of glycaemic control, self-care behaviours and psychosocial issues will also be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>It is critical that healthcare providers utilise available technologies that both facilitate effective glucose management and address concerns about safety and lifestyle. Automated BAs may help people using MDI to manage their diabetes more effectively and minimise the risk of long-term diabetes related complications. Findings from a recent study suggest that BA use positively addresses both safety and lifestyle concerns; however, randomised trials are needed to confirm these perceptions and determine whether bolus advisor use improves clinical outcomes. Our study is designed to make these assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NCT01460446</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Insulin therapy</kwd><kwd>Multiple daily injections</kwd><kwd>Diabetes</kwd><kwd>Randomised</kwd><kwd>HbA1c</kwd><kwd>Psychosocial</kwd><kwd>Hypoglycaemia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Large clinical trials have shown that intensive management of glycaemia and other vascular risk factors can prevent or delay the development of microvascular and macrovascular complications in both type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Achieving optimal glycaemic control in people with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and advanced T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] often requires intensive insulin therapy, which involves either use of insulin pumps or multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Such therapies divide insulin doses into basal, prandial and corrective elements, which can be adjusted independently to achieve optimal results. Despite the benefits of intensive diabetes management, many people with T1DM and insulin-treated T2DM do not follow and/or adjust their insulin regimens as needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. A recent survey of 331 people with T1DM showed that 64% of the participants assessed their prandial insulin need inappropriately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>A significant obstacle to intensive insulin management is fear of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which has detrimental effects on people&#x02019;s willingness to effectively manage their diabetes, particularly in terms of appropriate insulin dosing (e.g., under-dosing of insulin to avoid hypoglycaemia). This can lead to poor metabolic control and subsequent poor health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other key contributors to treatment non-adherence are lack of self-efficacy and difficulties associated with insulin dose determination. Calculation of an insulin dose is a complex process that must take numerous factors into account, such as the current preprandial glucose level, grams of carbohydrate (CHO) to be ingested, insulin sensitivity, insulin-to-CHO ratio, and active insulin on board. Further, poor glycaemic control has been correlated with poor numeracy skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This may lead to an inability to count carbohydrates, errors in interpreting blood glucose (bG) results to determine correction doses and inaccuracies in calculating insulin doses based on insulin-to-CHO ratios.</p><p>Although many insulin pumps now feature automated bolus advisors, which automatically calculate bolus insulin dosages to cover carbohydrate (CHO) intake and address out-of-range bG levels based on individualised insulin parameter estimates, people using MDI therapy must perform these dosage calculations manually. However, because manual calculation of insulin boluses is both complex and time consuming, people may rely on empirical estimates, which can result in persistent hypoglycaemia and/or hyperglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, manual bolus calculation does not take into account the effect of the active insulin that remains from the initial bolus (insulin-on-board), which creates a high potential for errors, particularly when determining a correction bolus.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that use of automated bolus calculators helps insulin pump users more accurately meet prandial insulin dosage requirements, improve postprandial glycaemic excursions, and achieve optimal glycaemic control with an increased time within target range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is, indeed, possible that such automated calculations may be a major source of the perceived benefits of pump therapy for many patients. For example, a study by Garg and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] showed that use of a bolus advisor containing an early algorithm based on sliding scales for insulin dosing in people using MDI resulted in improved HbA1c levels. Results from a recent survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] suggest that use of an automated bolus advisor may reduce fear of hypoglycaemia, increase confidence in bolus calculation, improve ability to control bG levels and achieve glycaemic goals, create a sense of increased flexibility in lifestyle, and improve overall well being. In a small pilot study, Schmidt and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] found that automated bolus advisor use, in conjunction with training in CHO counting and MDI therapy, improves treatment satisfaction. However, to date, no large randomised trials have been conducted to determine whether use of an automated bolus advisor can improve glycaemic control and promote greater adherence to therapy in people treated with MDI therapy.</p><p>We hypothesised that, in addition to reducing HbA1c, use of an automated bolus advisor in people treated with MDI therapy can increase the time bG stays within the target range, reduce the magnitude of post-prandial excursions, reduce the frequency/severity of hypoglycaemia, and improve psychosocial outcomes, including treatment satisfaction, social functioning and factors important to quality of life. We designed a study to test this hypothesis, using a new automated bolus advisor system that integrates bolus calculation into a bG meter.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study (ABACUS) is a 6-month, multi-center, multi-national, prospective, randomised, controlled study to assess the impact of automated bolus advisor use on clinical and psychosocial outcomes in poorly controlled (#62;7.5% HbA1c), MDI-treated T1DM and T2DM participants. The trial will be conducted at approximately 30 sites in the UK and Germany. All sites will have prior experience working with the bolus advisor prior to study initiation. All clinical investigators from the sites involved will be given detailed educational input regarding the device settings and adjustment principles (either using the automated bolus advisor or using more traditional &#x02018;paper-copy&#x02019; (e.g., insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio/insulin sensitivity factor) at centralised study training sessions.

The goal is to decrease HbA1c by #62;0.5%. Secondary outcomes include: 1) change in time spent within bG target range; 2) frequency and severity of hypoglycaemia; 3) change in magnitude of postprandial glucose excursions; 4) change in glycaemic variability parameters; 5) frequency of bolus advisor use; 6) frequency of participants&#x02019; adjustments to proposed bolus amounts; 7) self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) test frequency; 8) change in participants&#x02019; therapy adherence and use of rule sets; and 9) participant self-care behaviours, and psychosocial outcomes including treatment satisfaction, social functioning and factors important to quality of life.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study will recruit 226 T1DM and T2DM patients who have been using MDI therapy for at least 6 months.

The per protocol population (PP) will include all participants of the ITT group who completed all scheduled visits without any major protocol deviations. Participants must complete at least 80% of all bG measurements of the 3-day glycaemic profile form to be included in the PP analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome analysis</title><p>Anticipated attrition of 20% will yield a sample size of 180 (90 per study group), which will provide #62;80% power to detect a mean difference of 0.5% in change in HbA1c, with SD of 0.9%. The absolute and relative change in HbA1c from baseline to study end for the CNL and EXP groups will compared using the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for the pooled ITT population. These tests will be performed at the one-sided 5% level of significance for rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference or a difference in favor of the CNL group. An analysis of covariance with the binary covariables (study group, sex and diabetes type) and the continuous baseline covariables (HbA1c, age and CHO counting assessment score) will be performed for the absolute and relative HbA1c change. Additional separate analyses of (co)variance will be performed using two explanatory variables (study group and one adjusting covariable) for the above mentioned covariables and other baseline covariables (e.g., country, center, time since diabetes diagnosis, existing diabetes related diseases, time since MDI start, bG measures from SMBG at baseline, frequencies of hypoglycaemia at baseline, laboratory parameters and, summary scores from psychosocial questionnaires) for the pooled groups. The one-sided 95% confidence intervals of the HbA1c change for CNL and EXP groups and the difference between the groups will also be calculated for the pooled groups.</p><p>Summary statistics (N, mean, median, SD, lower and upper quartile, minimum and maximum) will be provided for the observed HbA1c values by study group for each applicable scheduled visit (Visits 1, 6 and 9).

This can lead to poor metabolic control and subsequent poor health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Inadequate management of glycaemia within this population is complex and often the result of many factors, including: fear of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; lack of self-efficacy and difficulty with insulin dose adjustment; and poor numeracy skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Many of today&#x02019;s insulin pump systems now feature automated bolus advisor technology, which calculates individualised bolus insulin dosages to cover carbohydrate (CHO) intake and address out-of-range bG levels. Studies have shown that use of automated bolus advisor technology among insulin pump users facilitates accurate determination of prandial insulin dosages, reduces postprandial excursion, and reduces hypoglycaemia, leading to improved glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Our study is designed to assess the impact of automated bolus advisor use on glycaemic control, user adherence, self-care behaviours, treatment satisfaction, social functioning and factors important to quality of life. A potential limiation of our study design is the intensity of diabetes management provided to both groups, which may lead to significant improvements in all participants and, thus, limit between-group differences. A third, &#x0201c;pure&#x0201d; control arm (no intervention) would have been ideal to compare the intervention with real-world clinical care; however, this option was not feasible.</p><p>Given the benefits of tight metabolic control, it is critical that healthcare providers utilise available technologies that not only facilitate effective glucose management but also address concerns about safety and lifestyle, which can discourage adherence to therapy. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that automated bolus advisor use positively addresses safety and lifestyle concerns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], large, randomised trials are needed to confirm these findings and assess the utility of automated bolus advisor use in improving intra-day and long-term glycaemic control. Our study is designed to make these assessments. Findings will be available in late 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABACUS: Automated Bolus Advisor Control and Usability Study; AE: Adverse event; BA: Bolus advisor; BG: Blood glucose; BGRI: Blood glucose risk index; CGM: Continuous glucose monitoring; CHO: Carbohydrate; CNL: Control group; DAFNE: Dose Adjustment for Normal Eating; DTSQc: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (change); DTSQs: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (baseline); EQ-5D-5L: EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Levels measure; EXP: Experimental group; FBC: Full blood count; HbA1c: Glycated haemoglobin; HBGI: High blood glucose index; HFS II: Hypoglycaemia Fear Scale); I:CHO: Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio; ITT: Intent to treat; LBGI: Low blood glucose index; MAGE: Mean amplitude of glycaemia excursions; MDI: Multiple daily insulin injections; PAID: Problem Area in Diabetes; PHQ-8: Patient Health Questionnaire 8; PP: Per protocol; SD: Standard deviation; SAE: Significant adverse event; SMBG: Self-monitoring of blood glucose; T1DM: Type 1 diabetes; T2DM: Type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Funding for the study and preparation of the manuscript was provided by Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.
