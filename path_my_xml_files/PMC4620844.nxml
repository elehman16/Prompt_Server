This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized phase II trial is the first study in China to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PFD in IPF patients. A summary of these 4 RCT studies is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T5" position="float"><label>TABLE 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of RCT Researches About Pirfenidone for IPF Cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-94-e1600-g008"/></table-wrap><p>In our study, although no significant difference in the primary endpoints was observed between the PFD and control groups, significant PFD efficacy was shown based on the decline in FVC at the 24th week between these 2 groups. We also showed that PFD treatment prolonged the PFS duration of IPF patients. Somewhat similar results were observed in one of the CAPACITY studies (ie, study 006), in which no significant difference in the primary endpoint (ie, percentage predicted FVC at the 72nd week [the EOT point]) was shown between the PFD and control groups. However, a significant PFD treatment effect on the percentage-predicted FVC (the primary endpoint) was observed between week 12 and week 48.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In contrast, the pooled data from the CAPACITY study supported a PFD effect on the percentage predicted FVC, the PFS time, and the distance on the 6MWT. Furthermore, this PFD effect on the percentage-predicted FVC and the PFS time was verified in the ASCEND study.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> We performed a further analysis of all of the data, and we found that 4 cases, 3 cases in the PFD group and 1 case in the control group, showed a substantial decline in the PFT parameters, including FVC, TLC, and DLCO, because of AEs within 4 weeks of the EOT timepoint. After we reevaluated the data excluding theses 4 cases, a significant PFD treatment effect on FVC was observed at both 24 and 48 weeks. Larger sample sizes or long-term similar study is expected to verify the results.</p><p>Treatment with 600&#x0200a;mg of NAC 3 times daily was used as the baseline treatment for both the PFD and control groups. Although a recent trial of NAC in IPF showed that high-dose NAC did not help to preserve FVC in IPF patients who had mild to moderate impairment in pulmonary function at baseline,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> some basic research has shown that NAC displays antioxidant activity, which helps suppress oxidative stress in pulmonary fibrosis,<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in alveoli,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and inhibits TGF-&#x003b2;1 release into the lung.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Although in the new treatment guideline conditional recommendation against the use of NAC monotherapy for IPF was suggested, the ATS committee still does recommend to keep patients on NAC if they are tolerating well.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> All that means is that the overall evidence for or against the use of NAC is still not very clear. We cannot totally exclude the NAC effect on IPF cases. As high-dose NAC was administered to both the PFD and control groups, NAC might have added noise to the results of our trial. In Oltmann study,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> 12 cases (19%) used NAC during PFD treatment, and these combination therapy patients had a higher rate of disease progression than their patients with PFD monotherapy. However, the cases receiving NAC and PFD combination therapy exhibited worse baseline pulmonary function. Our clinical trial might be the first study to administer PFD and NAC combination therapy to IPF cases. Larger sample sizes and long-term studies are needed in China to confirm the efficacy of PFD and NAC on Chinese IPF patients.</p><p>Similar to 4 RCT studies,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> AEs occurred more frequently in the PFD group than in the control group, and skin- and gastrointestinal-related AEs were the primary AEs in the PFD group. Sixteen cases (42.11%) had skin-related AEs in the PFD group. All of these skin-related events were mild to moderate in severity, reversible, and without clinical sequelae. Only 1 case discontinued the trial because of a severe rash. Similar to previous PFD trials,<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> elevation of the aminotransferase levels occurred more frequently in the PFD group. However, all these events in our study were mild to moderate in severity, reversible, and without clinical sequelae. The long-term safety evaluation of PFD showed that the adjusted incidence of aminotransferase level elevation was 1.7 per 100 person exposure years, and the elevations in the alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels were more than 3-fold above the upper limit of normal (3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;ULN), which only occurred in 2.7% of patients.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Based on an analysis of cases with a median PFD exposure duration of 2.6 years, Valeyre et al<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> suggested that long-term treatment with PFD was safe and generally well tolerated.</p><p>To decrease drug-related AEs, the expert panel discussed the management of PFD-related AEs. They supplied detailed recommendations for the prevention and management of PFD-related AEs, including education, general approaches, and additional measures.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> During our trial, education was provided by physicians and the PFD dispenser at the same time as the patients were enrolled. A dose titration schedule, suggestion to administer the medications with food, and recommendation to avoid exposure to direct sunlight were provided to all patients.</p><p>There were some limitations to our trial. First, all of our enrolled cases were prescribed high-dose NAC as the baseline treatment, and there was no placebo-only group. Although recent clinical trials have shown that NAC has no significant benefit to the preservation of FVC in IPF patients with mild to moderate impairment in lung function,<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> the interaction between NAC and PFD is unclear. Because the IFIGENIA study showed the role of high-dose NAC in the preservation of FVC and DLCO in IPF patients, we cannot exclude the influence of high-dose NAC on our results. Second, there was some selection bias in our study. Although our cases were from different provinces, all cases were from China, and almost all were Han Chinese (73 cases, 96.1%). All of our cases had limited function based on the PFT results, and all were able to finish the 6MWT. Third, because all of the cases were from China, only 76 cases were enrolled, which is a smaller sample size than the CAPACITY study<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and the ASCEND study.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup></p><p>However, our study is the first randomized, double blind, modified-placebo controlled clinical trial examining the efficacy and safety of PFD combined with high-dose NAC in IPF patients with mild to moderate impairment of pulmonary function. This trial is also the first multicenter study investigating PFD treatment in Chinese IPF patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, we found that PFD combined with high-dose NAC compared to placebo combined with high-dose NAC prolonged the PFS time in Chinese IPF patients with mild to moderate impairment of pulmonary function. The percent-changes in FVC and SPO<sub>2</sub> on the 6MWT were significantly different at the 24th week, but these effects did not persist to the 48th week. Although AEs were common in the PFD group, they were mild to moderate in severity, reversible, and without clinical sequelae. Further studies including a larger sample size and a longer study duration are needed to confirm these encouraging results regarding the treatment of IPF patients with PFD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Beijing Kawin Technology Shareholding Co., Ltd. for providing the NAC, PFD, and matching placebo tablets that were used in this study.
