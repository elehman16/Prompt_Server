Based on aforementioned exclusion criteria, among 319 screened patients, 209 were excluded in this step, and 18 refused to participate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Screening and enrolment were accomplished by two psychiatrists, one senior resident of psychiatry and an expert psychologist.

General and neurological physical examination, electrocardiogram, blood chemistry, hematology, thyroid, liver and renal function tests were performed, and patients who had abnormal results were excluded. Information about the study process and the drug profile was provided for patients, and written consents were obtained. To provide a base line and to ensure patients&#x02019; compliance and stability, all patients entered a 1-week run-in period, during which they received placebo. The previously stable therapeutic regimens were continued during the study course.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Patients were excluded if they had poor treatment adherence during the run-in period [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].</p><p>Primarily, 38 patients were randomly allocated to each group, using random-numbers table. However, the number decreased during the process due to drop-out [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The expert epidemiologist, who generated random allocation scheme, was not involved in other steps of the study. Furthermore, the two expert psychologists that implemented the random allocation and assignment did not participate in other parts of the trial. Allocation was concealed by means of sequentially coded sealed envelopes. During the next 4-week, one group received an add-on treatment of 25 mg of DCS (Eli-Lilly, Indianapolis, Indiana) twice daily,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] while the other received placebo.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] An attending professor of psychiatry administered the medication in the university clinic. As all patients were already on various psychopharmacologic treatments, either DCS or placebo was added to the stable previous regimen. At the end of this period (5<sup>th</sup> week), both groups were assessed through clinical interview, CAPS and drug side effect questionnaire by a senior resident of psychiatry. Physical exam, laboratory tests and electrocardiogram were performed. Both groups entered a 2-week washout period.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Following washout, the two groups received cross-over treatments for 4-week [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. Psychiatric and general medical assessments were re-obtained at the end of the 11<sup>th</sup> week through clinical interview, CAPS, side effect questionnaire and paraclinical tests by the same senior resident. Patients, the psychiatrists who performed the interviews or administered medication, and a resident who filled the questionnaires and assessed clinical and paraclinical work-ups were blinded to the patients&#x02019; group assignment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>].</p><p>The Persian version of CAPS (test-retest reliability = 0.86, Cronbach's &#x003b1; = 0.92) was used to evaluate patients&#x02019; PTSD state and to assess intervention outcomes.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] It is widely used for diagnostic purposes, and for tracking fine changes in symptom frequency or intensity over time or as a treatment outcome.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Since it is the most valid[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and a highly reliable assessment tool for PTSD, it has become a standard criterion measure in this field.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] CAPS is a structured interview corresponding to DSM-IV criteria, addressing all symptom clusters separately. B, C and D symptom clusters are rated for both frequency and intensity (including the impact of symptoms on patient's function). Frequency scores range from 0 to 4 (scale 0 = none of the time, 4 = most or all of the time), and the overall frequency score is calculated by summing frequency scores of all symptom. Likewise, intensity scores embrace 0-4 (scale 0 = none, 4 = extreme). Furthermore, intensity scores are summed to provide the overall intensity rating. Frequency and intensity scores are calculated for all symptom questions and/or for the three symptom clusters. Alternative scoring systems have also been suggested. Other questions assess criteria A, E and F. Besides, additional items inquire about guilt and dissociation. The whole interview consists of six clusters, including 60 questions. The overall score may range from 0 to 148. The present study focuses on criterion C (avoidance and numbing) which assesses seven symptoms through 21 questions; seven questions address the presence/absence of symptoms by means of yes/no answers, finally representing as the number of symptoms. Another seven questions assess the frequency of symptoms (scale 0 = none of the time, 4 = most or all of the time). And the other seven inquire how intensive the symptoms are and how they affect the patient's life and function.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Both frequency and intensity scores ranged from 0 to 28. CAPS was first filled for each participant as a base line, and then at the end of each intervention period.</p><p>The primary outcomes were the overall number of avoidance and numbing symptoms, symptom frequency, and symptom intensity, which were measured separately. Secondary outcomes were tolerability and safety of DCS assessed through the side effect questionnaire, clinical and paraclinical evaluation.

Yet it failed to diminish the frequency and the number of symptoms. It is noteworthy that the aforementioned dosage of DCS turned out to be safe and well-tolerated.</p><p>From a neurochemical point of view, an aspect of PTSD is disability in extinction of traumatic injury.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Stressors are registered and remembered when they activate NMDA receptor which consequently produces a long-term memory.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] On the other hand, symptoms like diminished interest, restricted affect, detachment, and social withdrawal, very much like negative symptoms of schizophrenia, have been suggested to be associated with dysfunction or dysregulation of NMDA receptor.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] As DCS plays a partial agonist role at glycine regulatory site on NMDA synaptic receptor complex, it has positive effects on new learning, memory consolidation and retrieval processes in rodent studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Previous studies on the efficacy of DCS in treatment of PTSD have demonstrated disconsonant results. In a controlled trial by de Kleine <italic>et al</italic>., augmentation of exposure therapy with DCS did not enhance the overall treatment outcome; but it yielded higher symptom reduction in more severe PTSD cases.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Moreover, controlled trial by Litz <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that imaginal exposure plus DCS in combat-related PTSD leads to increased PTSD symptoms.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] On the other hand, a recent pilot-controlled trial by Difede <italic>et al</italic>. showed greater remission rate of PTSD symptoms.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, Heresco-Levy <italic>et al</italic>. used DCS for treatment of PTSD in a pilot-controlled study; DCS treatment was not only associated with a significant decrease in total PTSD scores but also with a noticeable reduction in numbing, avoidance and anxiety; yet similar improvements were also found during placebo treatment.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The inconsistency of results of different studies can be viewed in terms of methodology; as in some studies, subjects were solely males, while in others patients were majorly females. Furthermore, trials have addressed different trauma types; as some have focused on sexual assaults while others have studied combat-related PTSD.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Our present study suggests that DCS can function as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the intensity of numbing and avoidance in chronic PTSD, and can help improve patients&#x02019; function in this regard.</p><p>The fact that subjects of our sample were exclusively males, exposed to combat trauma, may interfere with generalizablity. Moreover, regarding the significant carry-over effect in the assessment of intensity and function impairment, a 2-week washout appears to be insufficient. Besides, a decreasing, but nonsignificant trend in the number of symptoms during DCS treatment suggests that a larger sample volume may lead to more obvious results. Patients were either receiving disability payment or litigating to receive support pension; therefore, treatment results might have been influenced.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors have contributed in designing and conducting the study.
