However, participating in exercise training and being physically fit can reduce mortality.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Long-term studies show that decreased physical fitness in middle-aged individuals increases the risk of CVD up to 50%, so the lifetime benefits of regular exercise are accompanied by prevention of cardiac risk factors.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Aging is associated with changes of body composition, physical functioning, and substrate utilization and muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy leads to declining muscle strength and function, along with diminished quality of life. Age-related changes in body composition and muscle atrophy play an important role in frailty.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Exercise training influence on improving quality of life is correlated with decreasing body fat, obesity, increasing muscle strength, health improvement, and alleviating muscular pains. Furthermore, exercise training plays an important role in decreasing the risk of CVD, hypertension, osteoporosis, cancer, and diabetes.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Chronic diseases account for approximately 60% of all deaths worldwide.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recently, numerous other CVD risk factors and markers have been identified. Although the pathological role of these new investigated risk factors in the development of CVD is severely debated, their role is added to traditional risk factors in preventing and anticipating CVD and related death.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A number of recently identified factors associated with inflammation and which are new risk factors for CVD and form plaque on vessels walls are intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP).[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, the pathogenic role of these risk factors in the development of CVD is controversial. One of the most sensitive cellular markers in identifying the formation of atherosclerotic plaque on the walls of the vascular endothelial is attaching cell molecules such as ICAM-1 and VCAM-1.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 are two main groups of four groups of cell adhesion molecules.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] These two molecules are glycoprotein that exist in some areas, such as vascular endothelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets and play the role of mediator in inflammation. Studies on the effect of aerobic and strength exercise on values of these adhesion molecules in adults are controversial.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Rankovic <italic>et al</italic>. surveyed the effect of aerobic training on the levels of VCAM-1 in middle-aged individuals and observed a significant decrease in the levels of VCAM-1.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Olson <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of 1-year strength training on middle-aged women and did not observe any significant reduction in the levels of VCAM-1.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>CRP is a spherical plasma protein that is involved in systemic inflammatory response in most vertebrates and invertebrates. Rapid increase in CRP synthesis a few hours after infection or tissue damage indicates that it participates in host defense and is a part of the innate immune response. In liver cells, CRP is synthesized mainly by interleukin-6 (IL-6).[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Increased CRP levels in blood cause tissue inflammation, lipid deposition, and blockage in vessel walls. The primary strategy for reducing CRP is medication therapy.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Libardi <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effects of strength, endurance, and combined training on CRP levels in middle-aged men and observed no statistically significant differences before and after exercise training.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Olson <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of 1-year strength training in middle-aged women and observed a significant improvement in CRP in strength training group.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Effect of aerobic and strength exercise in prevention and reduction of CVD has been studied in many researches.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Given the role of inflammation in CVD, one of the mechanisms to reduce the disease is to improve body composition and inflammatory markers by regular aerobic and strength exercise in middle-aged people. In the past decade, many studies have been performed on the effects of aerobic and strength training on body composition and inflammation remarks; however, the results of these studies have been associated with many contradictions on the basis of case, type, and nature.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] It is proven that daily physical activity improves general health in healthy middle-aged sedentary people. Most people do not have much time for exercise training, so finding the most effective and less time consuming exercise training is important.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] The researches comparing the effectiveness of aerobic, strength, and combined training are limited and further researches seem necessary to better understand the effects of different types of exercise training on body composition and cardiac risk factors. Considering the limited studies about influence of different modes of exercise training on body composition, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in sedentary middle-aged men, more future researches are necessary to clarify physiological response of different modes exercise training. Thus, in this study, we examined the effect of 12 weeks of aerobic, strength and combined training on body composition, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in sedentary middle-aged men.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This was a quasi-experimental study. Participants were informed of the objectives, procedure, as well as possible risks of training programs and their written information consent. Individuals were selected according to their age, &#x0003c;30 body mass index (BMI), physical health, not attending in exercise training for 6 months before the study, normal state of variables at pretest, lack of a specific diet, medication, and smoking. Exclusion criteria consisted of not participating in more than two training sessions and unwillingness to continue to participate in the study. The primary criteria for evaluating participants' health were to check the physical examination by a physician and review the health questionnaire. None of the participants were affected by chronic autoimmune, systemic, CVD, hepatic, or other diseases which can continuously change the body composition, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP status. In addition, at the preliminary session, the participants were asked not to change their diet and lifestyle during the 12 weeks. Qualified individuals were randomly assigned into four groups: aerobic (<italic>n</italic> = 12), strength (<italic>n</italic> = 12), combined (<italic>n</italic> = 11), and control (<italic>n</italic> = 12) groups.

To measure body composition, body composition analyzer (Inbody version 3.0 made in South Korea) was used. Participants stand on device with minimum coverage and without any metals and hold device's electrodes. Participants should be smooth and without choking and head toward the front during the measurement. Time performing the measurement was the same for everyone and after at least 3 h of their meals (breakfast). All participants met considerations related to the execution of tests, including emptying bladder and intestines and not eating or drinking before the test. The reliability of the device has been declared between 1 and 0.98 in previous studies. The validity of the device to measure body composition is 98%. Blood samples were collected after 12 h fasting at pretest and 48 h after the last training session at posttest. Blood samples (10 cc) were taken from left hand in sitting position. ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 were assayed by EIA commercial kit (R and D System Co., Abington, UK).

Furthermore, few studies have confirmed the beneficial effect of combining aerobic and strength training.</p><p>According to the present study findings, body weight in aerobic and combined training decreased significantly in posttest compared to pretest. Furthermore, significant differences in body weight between aerobic and combined compared to strength groups and aerobic compared to combined training were observed after 12 weeks. Donges <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of 12 weeks of strength, aerobic, and combined training on body composition of sedentary middle-aged men and observed significant improvements in body weight values.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Ferrara <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effects of 6 months of aerobic and strength exercise on middle-aged men, and a significant decrease was observed in body weight in aerobic and strength exercise groups.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] To maintain one's ideal body weight, the energy intake needs to be equal to the energy output, which is called energy balance and disturbing energy balance can cause over or under normal weight. It seems that exercising plays a critical role in controlling body weight. It is recommended to consider duration, intensity, and type of exercise training to lose weight.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] Although both aerobic and combined training exercises resulted in decreased body weight, aerobic training led to better results in losing weight. Possibly, participants' participation in strength and combined training has resulted in increased fat-free mass; however, in aerobic training, only the fat percentage has decreased. Hence, aerobic training has shown better results in improving total body weight compared to other groups participating in the study.</p><p>BMI in aerobic and combined training has significantly decreased in posttest compared to pretest. In addition, a significant difference in BMI between aerobic and combined training, aerobic and control groups, and strength and combined training was observed after 12 weeks. Ho <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of combined aerobic and strength training on BMI values in middle-age men and women and observed a significant decrease after 12 weeks.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Bijeh <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effects of 6-month aerobic exercise on middle-aged women and observed significant changes in BMI values in these participants.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] BMI is used to classify individuals based on normal weight, overweight, and obesity worldwide, increases when one grows older, and is associated with sex and ethnicity.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] Values for BMI are influenced by both body fat percentage and lean body mass, and since body fat percentage decreased significantly in all three groups, lean body mass was also decreased; of course, aerobic and combined training led to better results because of further reduction in BMI values.</p><p>Body fat percentage decreased significantly in all three training groups in posttest compared to pretest. The aerobic and control group had a significant difference in body fat percentage after 12 weeks. Donges <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of 12 weeks of strength, aerobic, and combined training on sedentary middle-aged men's body composition and observed significant improvements in the amounts of body fat percentage.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Willis <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of 3-month aerobic and strength training on the values of body fat percentage in sedentary adult participants and only a significant decrease was observed in combined exercise group.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Alteration in body composition is age related and has a strong genetic predisposition. It is also influenced by environmental factors such as nutrition, disease, and physical activity and changes along with age, especially in men. Weight gain has been commonly observed at the age of 20&#x02013;50 and is accompanied by gains in adipose tissue. During middle-aged individuals, the increase in adipose tissue distribution happens along with an increase in central abdominal sites and a decrease in limbs' fat. Changes in body composition depend on type, intensity, and length of exercise training.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] Participating in exercise training will not only decrease body fat percentage but also can induce favorable effects on health.</p><p>Fat-free mass in strength and combined training increased significantly in posttest compared to pretest. Furthermore, significant differences were observed in fat-free mass between aerobic and strength, strength and control, combined and aerobic, and combined and control training after 12 weeks. Willis <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of 3-month aerobic and strength training on lean body mass values in sedentary adult participants. They observed a significant increase in the aerobic exercise group, unchanged in strength training, and a significant increase in combined group.[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Strength training led to more improvements in body composition and had a more appropriate role in improving body composition compared to aerobic training.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] It seems that combined aerobic and strength training programs have more favorable effects on body composition.</p><p>ICAM-1 levels were decreased in all three groups, but only in combined training, it was significantly lowered in posttest compared to pretest. In addition, there was no significant difference between groups. Zoppini <italic>et al</italic>. reported reduced ICAM-1 levels after 6 months of training twice a week.[<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Olson <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of strength training on middle-aged overweight women and did not observe a significant reduction in ICAM-1 levels.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Regular exercise prevents the releasing of inflammatory mediators from adipose tissue by reducing sympathetic stimulation and increasing anti-inflammatory cytokine and consequently reduces the concentration of attaching cell molecules.[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] Another mechanism in reducing the inflammatory marker of ICAM-1 might be the antioxidation effect of aerobic training. Oxygen-free radicals cause the increased expression of inflammatory mediators and attaching cell molecules. In addition, studies have shown that the antioxidative defense will improve by exercise training.[<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] Exercise training may reduce sICAM-1 levels by improving antioxidative system.</p><p>VCAM-1 levels in the strength and combined training were significantly different in posttest compared to pretest. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between groups participating in the study. Rankovic <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of aerobic training on VCAM-1 levels in middle-aged individuals and observed a significant decrease. The results are consistent with the results of the present study.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Sabatier <italic>et al</italic>. observed a significant decrease in the levels of VCAM-1after 14 weeks of aerobic training in healthy individuals. It has been shown that increased anti-inflammatory cytokine will prevent inflammatory agents release from adipose tissue, resulting in reduced attaching molecules levels. On the other hand, since cortisol acts as a strong anti-inflammatory agent in preventing cytokines secretion and anti-inflammatory mechanisms and since physical training often stimulates cortisol during exercise, perhaps exercise causes cortisol secretion and increases antioxidant capacity.[<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] Finally, the mechanism related to these factors is probably the main factor of decreased VCAM-1.</p><p>CRP levels in aerobic training decreased significantly in posttest compared to pretest. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between groups participating in the study. Libardi <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effect of strength, endurance, and combined training on CRP levels in middle-aged men and did not observe statistically significant difference before and after training.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Olson <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effects of strength training in middle-aged women and observed significant improvements in CRP levels. Exercise training has beneficial effects on prevention and treatment of CVD.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Exercise training has indirect positive effects on cardiovascular system through a variety of mechanisms such as increased blood volume, decreased viscosity, increased stroke volume, decreased blood pressure, elevated antioxidant defense, and altered blood lipids. On the other hand, according to anti-inflammatory effects of exercise training and its role in reducing inflammatory markers, it can be a suitable solution against inflammatory agents and CVD risk factors. One of the mechanisms of inflammation is producing cytokines such as IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha and consequently increasing CRP values.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Population, sample size, nutrition, lack of physical activity control out of training sessions, and sleep and psychological states were limitations of the present study. The results showed that 12-week workout, 20&#x02013;60 min/session, and 3 days a week of moderate intensity exercise improves body composition, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP than those who did not participate in any training. However, all three types of exercises had small benefits on body composition, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and CRP in sedentary middle-aged men, and the importance of combining these types of training required further investigations.

However, further studies are needed to control other mechanisms in various exercises.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"
