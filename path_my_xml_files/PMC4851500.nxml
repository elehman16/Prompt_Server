INTRODUCTION</title><p>Arthroplasty of the knee joint represents a significant advance in the treatment of severe pathology of the joints, but the treatment does not stop with surgery. The aim is to provide a pain-free movement and thereby improve the patient&#x02019;s quality of life (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The tasks of rehabilitation after arthroplasty are directed to: painless movements of the operated joint, improving range of motion, establishing the concrete scheme of walk and encouraging independence in activities of everyday life (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). For many years there is a need for determining the effects of continuous rehabilitation after the primary arthroplasty (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) which served as a basis for our research.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

SUBJECTS AND METHODOLOGY</title><p>A prospective study was conducted from 2011 to 2013 in The Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation &#x0201c;Dr Miroslav Zotovic&#x0201d; Banja Luka. 140 patients of both sexes, aged 45 to 85 with implanted endoprosthesis based on primary osteoarthritis, participated. All patients were surgically treated at the Orthopedic ward of the same institution, by the same surgical team and the same surgical technique to retain the cruciatum posterius. After surgical treatment, all patients were conducted through early rehabilitation by the Protocol, after which they were divided into two groups, of 70 patients each, on the basis of whether they go on with continued rehabilitation or had the stationary rehabilitation in the delayed time period. Parameters of exclusion from the study were: acute psychoses, acute thromboses, pulmonary embolism, cardiac and pulmonary decompensation, acute stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, an advanced stage and hospital clinical osteoarthritis of neighboring joints (hips and contralateral knee). To the first, experimental, group, the range of motion in the knee joint and the extent of the knee joint through the medium of patella were measured after the admission and the discharge from the continuous rehabilitation and three months after surgery. The second, control, group began rehabilitation, on average, two months after the surgery. The above measurements were performed at the admission and the discharge from rehabilitation.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done by software package SPSS, version 19.0, using descriptive statistics (&#x000b1; SD, median), non-parametric tests: Mann-Whitney U-test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum test, &#x003c7;2 test. The value of p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of The Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation &#x0201c;Dr Miroslav Zotovi&#x00107;&#x0201d;, Banja Luka.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>4.

It was established that in the measured period from surgery, extension was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group of patients, p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>5. DISCUSSION</title><p>There is a constant question when to start and how long to conduct the post-operative rehabilitation after implantation of total knee joint endoprosthesis so that we could, in the shortest period of time, get the full functional capacity of the patient. There is a question - if on already accepted and confirmed early rehabilitation (<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) go on with the continuous stationary rehabilitation at the specialized centers or to give patients the space to adapt to their lives at home, and then, after a couple of months, conduct stationary rehabilitation? This was the motive to the start this study. The aim of the postoperative rehabilitation is: to reduce the pain, swelling, inflammation, possibility of thrombotic complications, to re-establish a normal range of motion in the treated joint, to return and increase the power of the flexor and extensor of the knee, to reach the appropriate motor patterns and to improve the general physical capacity (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Our study was designed in a way that the two groups, the experimental one and the control one, conducted the early rehabilitation, after which the experimental group went on with continued rehabilitation which lasted, on average, 21 days in the specialized ward, while the control group, on average, after a period of two months, was admitted to rehabilitation, also for a period of time of 21 days in the same ward as the previous one. One of the most important goals is to eliminate the swelling that does not allow full involvement in the return of the range of motion. Our results showed that there is a difference in the extent of the knee, measured over the medium of patella, which is an indication of the withdrawal of the swelling at the discharge compared to the admission in patients of both groups, but the reduction of the swelling was greater and more significant in the experimental group. In the first group, on the control after three months there were no significant changes. The researchers (<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) came to the similar results following the patients who had the knee arthroplasty, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months after their surgery and they emphasize the need for continuous post-operative rehabilitation. Group of authors (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) also found that the positive results of the surgical treatment and rehabilitation are noticed quite early, but in the fourth postoperative week, which is significant evidence that the treatment was effective.</p><p>The question was whether the waiting time for rehabilitation affects on the range of motion of the knee with a total endoprosthesis implantation? The results of measurements of the range of motion, flexion and extension showed a significant difference in the same in both groups on the discharge in regard to the admission, while in the experimental group was some improvement three months after the surgery regarding the move of flexion, but not the extension, where we gave the answer to the question: &#x0201e;Can the functional status that affects on the range of motion of the knee, three months postoperatively after the total knee arthroplasty, be predicted from data collected after active rehabilitation?&#x0201d; (<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It is of great importance, as it is confirmed by the authors (<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), to send the patients, after the total knee arthroplasty, in the short physiotherapy treatment in order to provide short-term benefits. Finally, comparing the results of the experimental group after three months, and control group at the discharge from rehabilitation, which is for both groups the same time after the surgery, it shows a significant improvement in the experimental group, which confirms the importance of continuous rehabilitation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>6. CONCLUSION</title><p>Results of the monitoring of the reduction of swelling and the return of the range of motion after knee arthroplasty confirm the advantage of continuous rehabilitation. Further research will be followed by other indicators of functional recovery and quality of life of patients after such surgical interventions.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>&#x02022; Competing interests:</bold> none to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>The WHOQOL Group</collab><article-title>The World Health Organisation Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL): development and general psychometric properties</article-title><source>Soc Sci Med</source><year>1998</year><month>6</month><volume>46</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>1569</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9672396</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nilsdotter</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Toksving-Larsen</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Knee arthroplasty: are patients&#x02019; expectations fulfilled?
