In a one-year randomized trial, we tested whether the efficacy of a behavioral weight-loss program was improved by incorporating either of two portion-control strategies instead of standard advice about eating less.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Subjects/Methods</title><p id="P2">The Portion-Control Strategies Trial included 186 women with obesity (81%) or overweight (19%). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three equally intensive behavioral programs consisting of 19 individual sessions over 12 months. The Standard Advice Group was instructed to eat less food while making healthy choices, the Portion Selection Group was instructed to choose portions based on energy density using tools such as food scales, and the Pre-portioned Foods Group was instructed to structure meals around pre-portioned foods such as single-serving main dishes, for which some vouchers were provided. In an intention-to-treat analysis, a mixed-effects model compared weight loss trajectories across 23 measurements; at Month 12, weight was measured for 151 participants (81%).</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Results</title><p id="P3">The trajectories showed that the Pre-portioned Foods Group initially lost weight at a greater rate than the other two groups (P=0.021), but subsequently regained weight at a greater rate (P=0.0005). As a result, weight loss did not differ significantly across groups at Month 6 (mean&#x000b1;SE 5.2&#x000b1;0.4 kg) or Month 12 (4.5&#x000b1;0.5 kg). After one year, measured weight loss averaged 6% of baseline weight. The frequency of using portion-control strategies initially differed across groups, then declined over time and converged at Months 6 and 12.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P4">Incorporating instruction on portion-control strategies within a one-year behavioral program did not lead to greater weight loss than standard advice. Using pre-portioned foods enhanced early weight loss, but this was not sustained over time. Long-term maintenance of behavioral strategies to manage portions remains a challenge.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S5"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P5">The rise in obesity prevalence has occurred in parallel with increases in food portion size<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. In addition, many controlled studies have shown that offering individuals larger portions leads to substantial and sustained increases in energy intake<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. These data demonstrate that the availability of large portions can override the regulation of energy balance and could have persistent effects that promote obesity. Dietary guidelines<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> recommend portion control to help limit energy intake, but little is known about the efficacy of different portion-control strategies for weight management<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. In this randomized controlled trial, standard advice to eat less was compared with two focused portion-control strategies: one that uses knowledge and tools to select satisfying portions while restricting energy intake, and another that changes the personal eating environment in order to limit exposure to large portions.</p><p id="P6">Weight-loss recommendations often advise reducing energy intake by simply eating less<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Recent research indicates that such advice should include the influence of energy density (ED) on amounts that can be consumed<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. When restricting energy intake, individuals can eat their usual amount of food by consuming larger portions of low-energy-dense foods (vegetables, fruits, lean proteins) while limiting portions of higher-energy-dense foods (high-fat, low-water foods). The use of tools such as food scales and household measures could improve the implementation of such recommendations<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. Surprisingly few studies have examined whether use of portion-control tools is sustained over time and whether they facilitate weight management; however, promising results have been found using plates that indicate appropriate proportions of meal components<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. We tested whether providing education and tools to limit intake of high-ED foods and promote intake of low-ED foods improved weight loss when incorporated into a standard behavioral program.</p><p id="P7">Another portion-control strategy is to structure the eating environment to limit exposure to large portions<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>. This can be achieved using pre-portioned foods that are packaged for a single eating occasion, such as frozen main dishes, single-serving snacks, and liquid meal replacements. Studies show that just as the availability of large portions leads to overconsumption, using pre-portioned foods helps to limit energy intake and promotes weight loss<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. Several evidence-based reports support the use of pre-portioned meals for weight management, although the evidence for this comes primarily from studies of liquid meal replacements<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>. In the few studies that have tested the long-term effects of pre-portioned foods, the items were provided throughout the study<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. For example, several studies found that providing portion-controlled main dishes twice a day for the 8- to 12-week duration of the trial led to greater weight loss than a self-selected diet<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. We examined whether use of pre-portioned foods is sustained over a longer period as provision is reduced, and whether this strategy facilitates long-term weight loss.</p><p id="P8">There is a need for evidence-based strategies to help individuals limit energy intake for obesity management in an environment characterized by large portions of energy-dense foods. The Portion-Control Strategies Trial helps fill this gap by systematically comparing the effects of different portion-control strategies on weight loss over one year. We tested the hypothesis that participants who were taught to use tools to select portions based on ED or to structure meals with pre-portioned foods would have greater weight loss than those following standard advice to eat less.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="S6"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P9">Participants were recruited through local advertisements; eligibility was determined by telephone interview and screening sessions. Eligible participants were women aged 20&#x02013;65 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 28&#x02013;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Potential subjects were excluded if they had blood pressure &#x0003e;160/100 mm Hg, reported a weight change &#x0003e;4.5 kg in the past three months, had a medical condition that precluded participation or that limited physical activity, were following a special diet or weight-loss program, were pregnant or lactating, scored &#x0003e;19 on the Eating Attitudes Test<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup>, or scored &#x0003e;25 on the Beck Depression Inventory<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>. To be enrolled, potential subjects were required to complete three daily food and activity diaries and a two-week run-in period.</p><p id="P10">Participants were stratified by BMI and age and randomly assigned to one of three groups using blocks of six sequences from a random number generator. Participants and interventionists were informed of the group assignment for instructional purposes; assignment was masked from those who assessed outcomes including dietary recalls and blood analyses. The sample size was determined by using a mixed-effects model<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> to analyze the trajectories of weight loss in exemplary data sets based on trials of behavioral programs in similar populations<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Power was determined from the non-centrality parameter and the critical F-value for a two-sided Type 1 error rate of 0.05. It was estimated that differential rates of weight loss (linear and quadratic coefficients) could be detected between any two groups with 80% power by testing 48 participants per group (144 in total). To allow for a 20% non-completion rate, the sample size was set at 180 participants.</p><p id="P11">The trial protocol was approved by the Office for Research Protections of The Pennsylvania State University and registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01474759. Participants provided signed informed consent and were financially compensated for participation. The trial was conducted at the Clinical Research Center on the University Park campus of The Pennsylvania State University from July 2012 to March 2015.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Behavioral programs</title><p id="P12">In this parallel-group trial, participants met individually with registered dietitians and trained interventionists for 19 sessions over one year. Each interventionist used standard instruction manuals, received regular training to ensure fidelity to program content, and had equal contact with the groups. Thirty-minute sessions were scheduled weekly in Month 1 and biweekly in Months 2&#x02013;6, and one-hour sessions were scheduled monthly in Months 7&#x02013;12. In each group, energy balance was explained as the basis for weight loss, but in order to test the influence of different portion-control strategies, instruction focused on following the assigned dietary program and making behavioral changes. The specific principles of each program were reinforced within basic lessons about food categories (fruit, vegetables, fats, whole grains and fiber, lean protein, and dairy foods) as well as meal planning and managing behavior change. All participants received similar instruction on increasing physical activity through walking, with the goal of achieving 10,000 steps daily. At each session, participants were given written lesson plans and supplemental materials to review and add to their personal binders. For purposes of self-monitoring, subjects were encouraged to keep daily records of body weight, pedometer counts, and foods eaten. During each session, the interventionist reviewed these records with the participant and helped set goals for the next session.</p><p id="P13">Participants in the <underline>Standard Advice Group</underline> were instructed to follow dietary guidelines<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> that emphasized eating less while making healthy choices from all food groups. Educational sessions and materials focused on eating recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables for health purposes; choosing foods containing lean protein, whole grains, and healthy fats; and reducing intake of sodium and added sugar. One session provided instruction on standard serving sizes in each food group and on understanding food labels. Throughout the trial, participants were taught to plan meals with a variety of foods in order to achieve a balance of nutrients and maintain a healthy diet while eating less.</p><p id="P14">Participants in the <underline>Portion Selection Group</underline> were instructed to choose food portions based on energy density in order to eat satisfying portions of low-ED foods and to control portions of higher-ED foods<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. Over several sessions, individuals were taught the concepts of ED and methods for modifying the ED of dishes and meals by altering portions of low- and high-ED foods. To facilitate choosing portions, participants were given a portion-selection tool at each of the first four sessions and instructed in its use: a digital food scale, a set of household measures (cups and spoons), a placemat that illustrated appropriate proportions of meal components, and a card illustrating portion estimation using common objects (such as the hand or a computer mouse). Participants were instructed to continue using the tools that they found helpful; throughout the trial, advice to choose portions based on ED was reinforced.</p><p id="P15">Participants in the <underline>Pre-portioned Foods Group</underline> were instructed to structure their meals and to learn appropriate food portions by using pre-portioned foods such as individual servings of main dishes, side dishes, snacks, yogurt, and whole fruits. Participants were instructed to eat pre-portioned main dishes daily for lunch and dinner during Months 1&#x02013;3 of the trial and were encouraged to continue this practice subsequently. To facilitate this, participants were given prepaid vouchers for single-serving main dishes at the rate of 14 vouchers per week in Month 1, which was gradually reduced to four per week during Months 4&#x02013;12. Throughout the trial, participants were taught about selecting all types of pre-portioned foods and snacks and how to prepare their own.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Outcome assessments</title><p id="P16">In addition to the instructional sessions, four assessment sessions were conducted at the end of Months 1, 3, 6, and 12.

Recalls were scheduled on two weekdays and one weekend day for a sample of 124 participants (67%) and completed by 123 participants. Recalls were administered by telephone by the Diet Assessment Center of The Pennsylvania State University and analyzed using Nutrition Data System for Research software<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>. In addition to nutrient intakes, recalls were analyzed for food group servings and number of pre-portioned foods. Reported items were categorized according to ED as Very low (0.0&#x02013;0.59 kcal/g), Low (0.6&#x02013;1.49 kcal/g), Medium (1.5&#x02013;3.99 kcal/g), or High (4.0&#x02013;9.0 kcal/g)<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P20">Physical activity was assessed using pedometers provided to participants (Yamax-Digiwalker Model SW-200, Warminster, Pennsylvania, USA).

Group assignment was treated as a fixed factor in the model and time (trial week) was treated as a continuous covariate. Time was also included as a random factor to account for correlation of repeated measures within subjects; thus the trajectory of weight change was characterized separately for each participant. Polynomial factors of time were tested as both fixed and random factors and included if they improved the fit of the model. Additional baseline characteristics such as restraint score were tested as covariates, and their interactions with polynomial factors of time were included if significant.</p><p id="P23">Secondary outcomes that were measured at several time points (cardiometabolic factors, dietary intakes, questionnaire responses, and pedometer counts) were analyzed by a linear mixed-effects model with categorical fixed factors of group, time, and their interaction, if significant. Correlation of repeated measures within subjects was accounted for by modeling the covariance structure of the data. All models included the randomization variables of baseline BMI and age. Tests of group means were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Tukey-Kramer method. Differences across groups in baseline characteristics were tested by a fixed-effects model for continuous variables and by Fisher&#x02019;s exact test for categorical variables; differences in retention rates in the trial were assessed by the log-rank test. Analyses were performed using SAS software (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, North Carolina, USA).

At Month 3, for example, modeled weight loss (mean&#x000b1;SE) in the Pre-portioned Foods Group was 5.1&#x000b1;0.4 kg compared to 3.7&#x000b1;0.4 kg in the Standard Advice Group and 3.8&#x000b1;0.4 kg in the Portion Selection Group.

As a result, mean weight loss did not differ significantly across groups at Month 6 (mean&#x000b1;SE 5.2&#x000b1;0.4 kg) or Month 12 (4.5&#x000b1;0.5 kg). The trajectories for observed weight loss showed a similar pattern to the intention-to-treat analysis, but the magnitude of weight loss was greater since it did not include estimated trajectories for participants who withdrew from the trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Figure S1</xref>).</p><p id="P26">Dietary restraint score was the only baseline characteristic found to influence the trajectory of weight loss.

The number of self-monitoring records was highly correlated with the number of sessions attended (r=0.72; P&#x0003c;0.0001).</p><p id="P34">Several ratings of satisfaction with the diet differed across the groups (P=0.001). Compared to baseline, at Month 1 the Pre-portioned Foods Group reported spending less time and effort on meals and feeling more self-conscious and deprived when eating; at Months 1, 3, and 6 they reported spending less money on food (all P&#x0003c;0.0001). The other two groups had no changes over time in ratings of satisfaction with the diet.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S20"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p id="P35">Although portion control is part of most behavioral weight management programs, little is known about the efficacy or sustainability of different portion-control strategies. The results of The Portion-Control Strategies Trial indicate that within a one-year behavioral program, three strategies led to similar weight loss: the standard message to eat less, using tools to select portions based on energy density, and structuring meals with pre-portioned foods. Across groups, 45% of participants achieved a clinically relevant weight loss of &#x02265;5%<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup>, indicating that all three of the programs had utility for weight management; these results are comparable with those of other behavioral programs in non-clinical populations<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup>. The incorporation of specific portion-control strategies did not improve weight loss or cardiometabolic risk factors compared to standard dietary advice to eat less while making healthy food choices. Initial weight loss was enhanced by provision of pre-portioned foods to limit exposure to large portions, but this was not sustained over time. In all groups, reported use of targeted strategies showed adherence during the first several months, but strategy use then declined and converged over the year. The long-term maintenance of behavioral strategies to manage portion size remains a challenge<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P36">Instruction to use pre-portioned foods at several meals each day, supported by provision of vouchers, resulted in more rapid initial weight loss than the other strategies. This may be related to the structured eating environment provided by pre-portioned foods, which led to fewer decisions about amounts to eat<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>. The initial success may also have occurred because the use of pre-portioned foods could be adopted immediately with minimal instruction, while the other strategies were taught in sessions extending over several weeks. An important question was whether the use of pre-portioned foods would continue when vouchers were not provided. We found that after the frequency of voucher provision was decreased to several per week, the higher rate of weight loss was not sustained. Weight regain during the second half of the trial was likely related to decreased use of pre-portioned foods, influenced by participant reports of increased cost and feelings of self-consciousness and deprivation. Further work is needed on methods to incorporate portion-controlled options into everyday decisions about what and how much to eat.</p><p id="P37">One portion-control strategy that is frequently advocated by professional organizations is to use tools such as household measures or common objects to provide guidance on recommended portion sizes<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup>. To our knowledge, there are no data on the utility or sustainability of using portion-selection tools for weight management, other than using plates showing appropriate proportions of foods<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>. Most of the research related to such tools has focused on whether they improve the accuracy of portion size estimation<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup>. One study, however, assessed the usage of portion-control tools and found that household measures were rated as the easiest to use and reported to be the most likely to be used again<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. The current trial found that household measures were initially the most frequently used tool of the four provided, but after three months their reported use decreased substantially. More data are needed to determine whether such short-term adoption of tools improves understanding of appropriate portions, and whether more sustainable tools can be developed<sup><xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup>.</p><p id="P38">An unexpected finding of the trial was the similarity in weight loss trajectories of the Portion Selection and Standard Advice groups. In a previous study, we found that instruction on reducing dietary energy density by increasing intake of water-rich foods led to lower ED and greater weight loss than advice to eat less and reduce fat intake<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>; additionally, other research has found the degree of ED reduction to be associated with the amount of weight loss<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup>. In the present trial, ED instruction was provided only to the Portion Selection Group, but dietary recalls showed that at three months all groups reported similar decreases in intake of medium-ED and high-ED foods, resulting in substantial reductions in dietary ED. Although the Portion Selection Group additionally reported increased intake of very low-ED foods and maintained the total weight of food eaten, this was insufficient to further reduce dietary ED compared to the other groups. Across the groups, there was also considerable overlap during the later months in the reported use of specific dietary strategies associated with reductions in ED. In this population, the women&#x02019;s familiarity with various weight-loss strategies probably decreased fidelity to the assigned diet programs<sup><xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> and contributed to convergence in dietary intake patterns. It is likely that the comparable weight loss across groups was related to these similarities in eating behaviors as well as the common instruction on physical activity and self-monitoring.</p><p id="P39">In this group of experienced dieters, standard advice to eat less was as successful for weight loss as more specific portion-control strategies. Recently published data suggest that including a rigorous usual-care condition in weight loss trials results in substantial attenuation of treatment effects<sup><xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup>, which may have contributed to the similarity of weight change across groups. The convergence of weight change over the trial may relate to participants&#x02019; adherence to the program<sup><xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup>, since frequency of attendance and self-monitoring did not differ across groups and were related to rates of weight loss and regain. It seems likely that the regular individual meetings and the accountability they encouraged were an important driver of weight change; similarly, one commercial program found that participants with &#x0003e;85% attendance had the highest weight loss<sup><xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup>. The frequency of instructional sessions was reduced over the trial, and this could account in part for declining rates of weight loss. The trajectories of weight change were also influenced by participant characteristics. Across the programs, weight loss was greater for those with lower baseline restraint scores, which may indicate greater opportunities for beneficial behavior changes.</p><p id="P40">The Portion-Control Strategies Trial is the first longitudinal comparison of the efficacy of different portion-control strategies for weight management. A strength of the trial was evaluating specific approaches to portion management, accompanied by frequent weight measurement that allowed modeling of trajectories of weight change using an intention-to-treat analysis; however, the generalizability of the findings is limited by the lack of diversity in the sample. The results showed that within a behavioral program, a variety of portion-control approaches can be effective in promoting weight loss, but that over a year strategies such as use of portion-control tools and pre-portioned meals were not well maintained. A goal of future studies should be to find improved techniques for maintaining adherence to dietary programs that incorporate portion-control strategies into sustainable lifestyle changes. Modifications to the eating environment that make it easier to manage large portions of energy-dense foods are needed to support such programs<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS830048-supplement-1.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e565" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S21"><p id="P41">This research was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (R01DK059853).
