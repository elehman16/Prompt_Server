anomaly due to its anatomical closeness to the sciatic nerve. Moreover, it is difficult to
differentiate from other diseases related to the spine, making diagnosis difficult. Piriform
muscle syndrome is a disease that causes pain and allesthesia in the hip, thigh, calf, and
foot as a result of pressure on the sciatic nerve from the piriform muscle<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The cause of piriform muscle syndrome includes pelvis or hip injury, an anatomical anomaly
of the piriform muscle or the sciatic nerve, a difference in leg length, and myositis in the
piriform muscle<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among these, the most
general cause is myofascial pain that is related to the pain trigger point of the piriform
muscle in reaction to a change or increase in muscle action<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Medicinal treatment including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and local injection of an anesthetic or corticosteroid and diverse physiotherapies
are being implemented as therapy methods aimed at reducing such myofascial pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Piriform muscle stretching is a physiotherapy method that is generally used for patients
who are diagnosed with piriform muscle syndrome<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of stretching is to increase the length of the
shortened piriform muscle and reduce pressure on the sciatic nerve. Piriform muscle
stretching, which is performed in a standing or prone position, is performed with
complicated motions, including flexion of the knee and coxal articulation, coxal
articulation adduction, and the internal and external rotation of the thigh<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In recent years, the muscle energy technique (MET), which has the same effects as
stretching, has been widely used for reducing pain and enhancing range of motion. MET is a
therapy that corrects asymmetry by inducing muscle relaxation through low intensity isotonic
contractions of the antagonistic and agonistic muscles aiming at the maintenance or recovery
of the free mobility of joints<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Ultrasonography that can measure asymmetry has the advantages that it is low-cost and
non-invasive, and that real time observation and repeated tests are possible without
concerns about radiographic exposure<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite these advantages, very few
studies have quantitatively measured changes in the thickness of the piriform muscle using
ultrasound. This study applied three kinds of stretching methods and measured the change in
the thickness of the piriform muscle in real time using ultrasound images and compared the
medial rotation angle of the coxal articulation. We aimed to discover the most effective
stretching method for the piriform muscle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Normal male students in their twenties who were enrolled in University B located in Cheonan
City, Chungnam, Korea were selected as research subjects for this study. The exclusion
criteria included those with surgical experience in the spine or pelvis, orthopedic or

groups: stretching with flexion of coxal articulation over (SFCO) 90&#x000b0;, stretching with
flexion of coxal articulation under (SFCU) 90&#x000b0;, and MET application.</p><p>For the SFCO, the subjects bent two legs in a supine position and put the leg of one side
on the opposite side knee that would be measured. The subjects bent their knee over 90&#x000b0;
until they felt tension in the direction toward the shoulder on the same side as the leg
that was being stretched and then maintained the position for 30 seconds. This was repeated
twice with a 30-second resting time in between<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the SFCU, the leg that would be stretched was crossed over the opposite side knee in a
supine position. The subjects touched the outside of the knee of the leg that was being
stretched with the opposite side hand and pressed the knee toward the ground for 30 seconds.
This was repeated twice with a 30-second resting time in between<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For MET, the subjects bent the coxal articulation and knee joint of the leg that was being
tested in a supine position and placed their testing side foot outside the opposite side
knee so that the foot touched the ground. Here, the flexion angle of the coxal articulation
did not exceed 60&#x000b0;. The researcher restricted the movement of the pelvis by putting one hand
on the anterior superior iliac spine on the opposite side. The researcher put the opposite
side hand outside the bent knee to implement abduction for 10 seconds and applied pushing
resistance during the contraction of the piriform muscle. After contraction, the researcher
implemented adduction until the range that the resistance on the leg that was being tested
could be felt and maintained the adduction for 20 seconds. This was repeated twice with a
30-second resting time in between<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>We used LOGIQ e (GE Inc., USA), which is an ultrasound image device for diagnosis, to
measure the thickness of the piriform muscle. First, we drew a virtual line that connected
the posterior superior iliac spine and the sacral hiatus and then drew another virtual line
that connected the center of the previously drawn line and the greater trochanter. After
placing the transducer probe parallel to the virtual line, passive medial rotation and
external rotation of the coxal articulation was performed to clearly distinguish the
piriform muscle before measurement<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The change in the thickness of the
piriform muscle was measured at a point 1&#x02005;cm from the ilium.</p><p>As for the medial rotation angle of the coxal articulation, the test was conducted while
the subjects were in a prone position on the side with the smaller measured angle. The test
was conducted on the chosen leg in a sitting position. Using the Image J (National
Institutes of Health, USA) program, we measured an angle formed by a vertical axis from the
center of the patella and a line that connects the malleolus on both sides<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study used SPSS ver. 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) for Windows for statistical
analysis. We conducted a paired t-test to compare piriform muscle thickness and the medial
rotation angle of the coxal articulation before and after each stretching stretching method.
For the comparison of piriform muscle thickness and the medial rotation angle of the coxal
articulation between each stretching method, we conducted a one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA). The statistical significance level for all data was set at p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The AHF group had a mean age of 23.13 &#x000b1; 2.20&#x02005;years, weight of 64.47 &#x000b1; 12.77&#x02005;kg, and height

to improve the prevention and rehabilitation of lower back pain and piriform muscle
syndrome. We aimed to discover the most effective stretching method by examining their
effects on piriform muscle thickness and the medial rotation angle of the coxal
articulation.</p><p>In this study&#x02019;s results, the application of diverse stretching methods resulted in a
decrease of piriform muscle thickness and a significant increase in the medial rotation
angle of the coxal articulation. There was no difference among the stretching methods.</p><p>Stretching improves physical performance ability, prevents injury, reduces muscle pain, and
increases flexibility<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general,
static stretching exercise is implemented more than other types of stretching methods in
many sports. Murphy et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that
static stretching exercise harms isometric and isokinetic power, balance, reaction time, and
agility. Avela et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> argued that these
side effects are related to mechanic and neuromuscular factors such as tendon relaxation,
decreased activation of the exercise unit, and change in reflexion sensitivity. Donti et
al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> attributed these side effects to
the duration and intensity of stretching. Bandy et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> who investigated effects according to duration, reported that
30-second or 60-second stretching is more effective than 15-second stretching. Ogura et
al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> emphasized the importance of the
duration of stretching, reporting that 60-second stretching decreased muscle strength while
30-second stretching did not affect muscle function. This study chose the 30-second duration
considering the results of these previous studies.</p><p>Hashemirad et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> applied taping to the
trigger point of the piriform muscle in a stretched position and reported that pain
decreased from 6.5 points to 3.9 points and the medial rotation angle increased from 39.5&#x000b0;
to 46.2&#x000b0;. Their study attributed the increase of the medial rotation angle to the increased
flexibility of the soft tissue of the piriform muscle following pain reduction. Similar to
the previous study, decreased piriform muscle thickness and an increased medial rotation
angle after applying diverse stretching methods in this study can be attributed to the
improved flexibility of the soft tissue. The differences in the medial rotation angle
between the two studies come from the fact that Hashemirad et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> measured the rotation angle in a prone position, while this
study measured it in a sitting position.</p><p>Gulledge et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> investigated an
effective stretching method by applying piriform muscle stretching in the order of 90&#x000b0;
flexion, adduction, and the external rotation of the coxal articulation and in the order of
90&#x000b0; flexion, external rotation, and adduction, and they reported that there was no
significant difference between the two orders. In this study, the comparison of thickness
change and the medial rotation angle by applying three different kinds of stretching methods
did not produce a difference. We conclude that stretching in diverse postures can be applied
for stretching the piriform muscle.</p><p>MET is a therapy method that can effectively provide positive neuro-physiological and
mechanical influences for the strengthening of a shortened or contractured muscle, edema
reduction, and the treatment of joints that have a restricted range of motion or a
functionally fixated joint<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Choi and Yoon<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> applied MET to women in their twenties who complained about buttock
and lower extremity pain due to piriform muscle syndrome. Their study reported that pain
decreased from 4 points to 2 points and the passive flexion angle of the coxal articulation
increased from 90&#x000b0; to 120&#x000b0;. Based on these results, we conclude that it is more appropriate
to implement MET when pain has been reduced to a certain level, rather than during an acute
phase where patients cannot properly perform exercise due to severe pain because the method
uses force by patients. This supports the usability of stretching using MET.</p><p>This study has limitations in that only normal male adults in their twenties participated
in the experiment, instead of more diverse subjects, including patients. In addition, the
number of subjects was not large. Hence, it is difficult to generalize the results of this
study to subjects in other age groups. Moreover, the stretching time applied to all subjects
was short, producing temporary effects, and we could not control the minor motion of
subjects during the ultrasound measurement. We also could not measure the change in medial
rotators in addition to the piriform muscle. Further studies will be required to address
these limitations. We expect that this study will be used for recommending diverse
stretching postures to those who have a restriction of the medial rotation of the coxal
articulation due to the shortening of the piriform muscle.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>TA</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The diagnosis and management of Piriformis Syndrome: myths
