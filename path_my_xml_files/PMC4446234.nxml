The hippocampal MR is involved in cognitive aspects of the initial stress response, in selection of behavioral responses to novel situations, in maintenance of a stable excitatory tone, and in regulation of limbic neuronal proliferation and apoptosis in response to corticosteroid exposure.

Task order (i.e. whether items or pairs were shown first) was fixed between participants. Subjects were instructed to remember the people without houses, the houses without people, and the people and houses they lived in. During two encoding runs, each picture was presented centrally on a laptop computer for 1.5 seconds, and participants viewed each stimulus 7 times randomly distributed across the entire duration of encoding runs. Pictures were presented in blocks of either items or pairs, with the order of presentation fixed between participants. Directly following the encoding period, a recognition test was administered. During the test, subjects were shown subject-house pairs previously presented during the encoding period, as well as three types of pair foils: novel pairs where neither the houses nor faces had been seen before, re-paired items where houses and faces previously presented alone were presented in combination with each other; and rearranged pairs where person A, previously seen in house A, was now presented in house B. Subjects were shown randomly ordered interleaved old pairs and pair foils for two seconds each. They were instructed to press a button only to indicate the occurrence of an old pair (&#x0201c;press a button if you see someone in <italic>their</italic> house&#x0201d;). Stimuli presented at visit 2 were distinct from those presented at visit 1.</p><p id="P12">To assess performance, each subject's responses to correct, old picture pairs (hit rate) and responses to incorrect, new picture pairs (false alarms) were normalized and subtracted from each other (d-prime). In this analysis, d-prime was calculated separately comparing memory for previously learned (old) pairs to each of the three types of foils: novel stimuli, newly paired items, and re-arranged pairs. For the purposes of specifically assessing hippocampal memory, we report on d-prime for <italic>previously viewed pairs</italic> relative to <italic>re-arranged pairs</italic>. This metric is the strictest assessment of hippocampal memory because correctly rejecting previously re-arranged pairs specifically requires binding together of two previously unrelated items<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Hereafter in this paper, we refer to this metric simply as &#x0201c;hippocampal memory.&#x0201d; However, d-prime calculated in this fashion may also capture variance related to memory that is unrelated to hippocampal function, such as alertness, working memory, or attention. Therefore we additionally examined the effect of treatment on a variable that assessed non-hippocampal specific memory processes: d-prime for <italic>previously viewed pairs</italic> relative to <italic>completely novel stimuli.</italic> If treatment affected non-hippocampal memory processes, we would expect to see an effect on both our hippocampal memory and non-hippocampal memory metrics.</p><p id="P13">The maximal hippocampal memory d-prime attainable with our test was 6.2, while the minimum attainable score was -6.2. If a subject correctly pressed a button every time a previously viewed pair appeared during the test, and additionally took no action when viewing re-arranged pairs, they would have received the maximum score. If a subject failed to take any action when a previously viewed pair appeared during the test, and additionally pressed a button every time they saw a re-arranged pair, they would have received the minimum score. A score of 0 would have represented a subject taking absolutely no action during the test or pressing a button for every single stimulus they saw. Similarly, the maximal non-hippocampal memory d-prime attainable with our test was 6.2, while the minimum attainable score was -6.2.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p id="P14">Group data were summarized as means &#x000b1; SD, unless noted otherwise.

Since spironolactone treatment had no effect on non-hippocampal memory, we conclude that the effects observed are due to spironolactone's effect on hippocampal function rather than on alertness, working memory, attention, or other non-hippocampal functions. These results suggest that MR modulates hippocampal function in human obesity.</p><p id="P23">Our results are consistent with preclinical data showing that MR activation mediates hippocampal dysfunction in obese rodents. Numerous studies, in which hippocampal MR activity was manipulated through use of pharmacological and transgenic approaches, have shown that the MR regulates hippocampal neuronal activity and hippocampal associated learning.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> For example, in a study by Dorey et al., hippocampal administration of the MR antagonist RU-28318 fifteen minutes before hippocampal corticosterone injection significantly improved glucocorticoid-induced memory impairment.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p id="P24">Differing effects of MR blockade in obese versus lean rodents provide further insight into the role of excess MR activity in hippocampal memory modulation.

The increase in MR activation appears to be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including increased MR levels<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, altered 11-&#x003b2;HSD-1 activity leading to tissue-specific increases in cortisol levels<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>, increased aldosterone levels<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>, and increased activity of Rac1 GTP (which induces the actions of MR independently of ligand-binding).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> While not clearly established, it is possible that obesity is also associated with increased MR action in the in the brain, where cortisol, not aldosterone, is the primary ligand for MR. This could be via increased MR levels<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, increased activity of Rac1 GTP<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> (which mediates the rapid, nongenomic actions of MR [as assessed by the slope of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials] in rat hippocampal neurons<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>), or altered activity of 11-&#x003b2;HSD-1 activity resulting in increased cortisol availability.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> MR blockade additionally reduces obesity-related cardiometabolic abnormalities such as insulin resistance, inflammation, lipid disturbances and excess hepatic fat.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p id="P26">The finding that MR blockade improved hippocampal function only in obese rodents in the aforementioned studies suggests that there is increased activity of the MR in obesity (but not the lean state) possibly mediated through effects on neurons, vasculature, and/or the neuronal microenvironment, and that this activation mediates hippocampal dysfunction in animals. We show for the first time that the relationship between MR activation and hippocampal function also holds in humans with obesity.</p><p id="P27">Our results lend support to a growing body of evidence regarding the cognitive benefits of MR antagonism in disease states characterized by increased basal MR activation. In a recent study of hypertensive subjects, increased plasma aldosterone concentration was associated with significantly worse performance on a mini-mental state examination (MMSE; which was used as a measure of general cognitive function). Notably, treatment with the MR antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone improved MMSE scores.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Our findings supplement the latter results by suggesting that MR blockade counteracts the deleterious cognitive effects of excess MR activation specifically in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, a 2006 observational study of almost 3,300 patients age 65 years and older showed that use of potassium-sparing diuretics, including spironolactone, was associated with a significantly lower incidence of developing Alzheimer's, a disease characterized by hippocampal dysfunction.<sup><xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> We provide further support for the concept that MR activation affects brain function by demonstrating the hippocampal memory benefits of MR antagonism in a randomized, controlled setting.</p><p id="P28">A few previous studies in humans failed to show a positive effect of MR antagonist treatment on cognitive function, but these studies differed significantly from the current study as they did not specifically assess hippocampal memory, used large doses of spironolactone, and examined acute, not chronic, effects of spironolactone. Specifically, Otte et al. reported that administration of 900 mg spironolactone over 5.5 hours impairs selective attention, visuospatial memory, and mental flexibility/set shifting in healthy young men.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Cornelisse et al. showed that a single dose of 400 mg spironolactone impairs selective attention in a trial of 64 young, healthy men.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Rimmele et al. demonstrated that administration of 400 mg of spironolactone (split across two 200 mg doses) to young healthy men in the nine hours before testing impaired free recall of texts and pictures.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The aforementioned studies also differed from ours in that they were conducted in healthy subjects who are not thought to have increased MR activation. In contrast we studied obese subjects, and obesity is thought to be associated with increased peripheral and possibly central MR activity.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p id="P29">Our study has several strengths. We used spironolactone doses (50 mg daily) that are similar to the clinically relevant doses used in studies showing beneficial effects of spironolactone on hypertension.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Blood pressure and aldosterone were measured under conditions in which environmental factors that could affect these parameters (posture, dietary sodium, stress) were carefully controlled. The decreases in blood pressure and increases in aldosterone seen in our study suggest that subjects successfully took their medications, and that spironolactone effectively blocked the MR in those subjects assigned to it. Finally, the hippocampal memory task we used, a paired-associate learning task, has been shown to selectively activate the hippocampus in fMRI studies.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> One potential drawback of our study is that the variance of our groups' baseline hippocampal memory scores differed significantly. This difference in variance was attributable to one subject in the placebo group whose baseline performance was two standard deviations above the mean. Concerned by whether this subject was driving our significant effect, we excluded him from the analysis for exploratory purposes. We found that when this subject was excluded, the variance of baseline hippocampal memory no longer differed significantly between groups. Moreover, our model (in which treatment significantly predicts the between-visit change in hippocampal memory when adjusting for hippocampal memory at visit 1, age, and race) still holds, suggesting that the effect of treatment on hippocampal memory is a true one not driven by outliers.</p><p id="P30">There are also limitations to the applicability of our findings. Firstly, we studied healthy, obese subjects, so our results cannot be extrapolated to other populations, for example those with diabetes or hypertension. Similarly, our study population was relatively young so the results may not apply to an elderly population. Because our study looked at the effects of six weeks of spironolactone treatment, we cannot determine whether longer treatment would or would not have resulted in further improvements in hippocampal memory. Since cortisol occupies both the MR and GR, it is possible that the effects in our study are due to a change in the relative amounts of MR versus GR activation in the setting of MR blockade (prior studies have shown that decreasing the functional balance between MR and GR in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus by inhibiting MR and/or increasing GR activity leads to deleterious changes in memory and cognition, among other parameters).<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Additionally, spironolactone is not selective for the MR, but can block the progesterone and androgen receptors as well (although much less effectively than the MR), with possible associated effects on memory; both androgen and progesterone receptors are expressed in the hippocampus.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Thus, future larger studies should stratify results by gender and use a more selective MR antagonist. Although our data does indicate a selective effect of treatment on hippocampal vs. non-hippocampal function, since we did not use a comprehensive cognitive battery we cannot specifically assess which non-hippocampal functions (working memory, attention) were unaffected by MR blockade. Furthermore, given that MR blockade is known to improve cerebral vascular remodeling<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup>, it is possible that the beneficial memory effects of MR antagonism seen in our study involve beneficial effects on brain vasculature. Finally, we tested the effects of spironolactone on hippocampal memory in a relatively small number of subjects. However, our treatment groups were well matched at baseline and we observed a significant effect of spironolactone treatment even after adjusting for baseline characteristics, which argues for the strength of our effect.</p><p id="P31">Overall, we have shown that chronic, low-dose MR blockade with spironolactone improves hippocampal memory in obese subjects. Our findings suggest that MR activation modulates hippocampal memory in humans, and thus represent an important advancement in the understanding of the role of the MR in human hippocampal memory regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S15"><p>GA, MS, and RG conceived of and carried out the study.
