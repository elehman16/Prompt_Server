The sample size was 115 patients in each group. The main variables for the safety analysis were the measurement of the brachial diameter, the appearance of basic injuries at the vaccine administration site, the appearance of pain and systemic reactions. The variable used for the efficacy analysis was a significant increase in the titres of anti-tetanus toxoid antibodies.</p><p>An Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed.

As a measure of association, relative risk will be estimated; the reduction of relative risk will also measured. For safety and to control the confounder effect, a logistic regression analysis will be carried out.

The annual register of cases has slowly been descending over the last 10&#x000a0;years, with an average of 25 cases/year in Spain (incidence of 0.06 cases per 100,000 population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In Galicia (Spain) during the last 5&#x000a0;years, on average, there have been 3 cases reported per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Tetanus is a disease that can be fully controlled, as it can be prevented by vaccination. However, it cannot be eradicated, because <italic>Clostridium tetani</italic> is a widely distributed microorganism in the environment. Immunization is highly effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], providing long-term protection and is recommended for the whole population in general, even though booster doses are required to maintain immunity, after the first vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Most cases of tetanus occur in previously unvaccinated adults, especially among those over 60&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Seroprevalence studies demonstrate that immunity from tetanus is higher than 95% in Spanish cohorts born after 1982, decreasing progressively in cohorts born prior to this date; for example, in the 1957&#x02013;1966 cohort immunity is only around 55% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies of the elderly have reported seroprevalence of 7.7% in those over 70&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Spain, the fact that most adults of over 50&#x000a0;years of age have not been vaccinated or have only been incompletely vaccinated is probably because the immunization calendar for the five-dose course of tetanus vaccine was not introduced until the early 1970s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>With any wound, the need to administer active immunization (tetanus toxoid) alone or jointly with passive immunization (tetanus immunoglobulin) depends on the type of wound, the probability of contamination with tetanus bacillus, and also on the knowledge of the patient&#x02019;s vaccination history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The current recommended treatment is the combined tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (presentation for adults) or intramuscular Td vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Most anticoagulated patients in primary care consultations are seen due to auricular fibrillation and, on average, they are over 56&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence, vaccination coverage is probably low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In anticoagulated patients, because of the hypothetical risk of bleeding after injection, use of the intramuscular route has been traditionally discouraged, with the subcutaneous route being recommended, even for vaccines that are routinely administered intramuscularly, as for tetanus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Indeed, in the literature, a few cases of major bleeding complications have been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Yet, although there is no uniformity of results in studies comparing the effectiveness of the two routes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], vaccine efficacy studies have used the intramuscular route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and subcutaneous administration may be less effective compared to intramuscular administration. Moreover, for most vaccines, local adverse reactions are more frequent with subcutaneous administration than with the intramuscular route [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The safety of the intramuscular route for the hepatitis B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and influenza vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], which are also administered intramuscularly, has been demonstrated in patients with alterations in coagulation and, consequently, the 2006 CDC guidelines recommend intramuscular injection for the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine depending on medical criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>We have not found any study in the literature that assesses the safety and efficacy of intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration for the Td vaccine in patients treated with oral anticoagulants.</p><p>The objective of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of the intramuscular and subcutaneous routes of administration for tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine in patients treated with oral anticoagulants, and to verify the hypothesis that IM administration is safer and has greater efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>We present a prospective, double-blind, phase IV clinical trial with two parallel groups and layered randomized assignment. Each one of these parallel groups was given doses of the corresponding tetanus vaccine, either intramuscularly (Group 1) or subcutaneously (Group 2), as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

A random allocation is made within a 3-tiered stratification based on the number of doses of vaccine required for successful immunization (1, 2 or 3 doses).

The researcher then had to obtain written, informed consent from patients before they could be included in the study.</p><p>The highest levels of confidentiality and professional conduct were always maintained and the existing national legislation on data protection was respected. The patients&#x02019; identities were encoded in the study documents and only duly authorized personnel had access to identifiable personal data, when data verification procedures required that this information had to be inspected.</p><p>It was the responsibility of the researcher to inform the patients in a clear and concise way that their data would be incorporated into a computerised database, which would only be used for clinical research purposes, and that the patient could not be identified in that database. In the database, the patients were each assigned an internal code number by the randomization centre, which remained unknown to the researcher, so that their clinical data could not be associated to the identified or identifiable person.</p><p>Likewise the CRF data were treated confidentially. The name of the patient was hidden and could only be identified through a number corresponding to the researcher code and the patient code.</p><p>This project respected ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, as set out in the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, together with the clinical research rules of the Spanish Research Act Regulations, and was granted permission by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee with approval obtained on 07/06/2007 with number 2007/089 (N&#x000b0; EudraCT 2007-001073-29), which was subsequently modified and extended on 13/04/2009, 10/09/2009 and 13/12/2010 by successive expansion in the number of participating health centres (from the initial 6 to 15), to improve recruitment of patients.</p><p>During the development of the study, there was regular monitoring that the information contained in each patient&#x02019;s CRF was complete and regularly updated, and that the required good clinical practice was being maintained in adherence with the Protocol and the follow-up procedures.</p><p>The original documents of each participating patient in the study, consisting of annotations made during each visit and the signed original of informed consent forms, were maintained by the researchers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This present clinical trial was designed to demonstrate that the administration of tetanus vaccine via the intramuscular route is safe and has greater efficacy than the subcutaneous route in anticoagulated patients, which would make it possible to routinely recommend this route in these patients. This is relevant because the prevalence of patients treated with oral anticoagulants is increasing, even at younger ages, and anti-tetanus vaccine, the only one with universal indication, is still the only measure with proven efficacy for preventing new cases of tetanus.</p><p>There are inherent difficulties in conducting clinical studies, with a variety of possible eventualities that affect researchers, patients and the actual structure and organization of the centres. To these handicaps, must be added the following particular characteristics of primary care: the extra effort required for coordination given the scattering of the centres and researchers; the accessibility of care at this level, at least in Spain, which causes great pressure on health and welfare services with little control over the distribution of daily work, with a resulting conflict regarding the space and time available for research activities.</p><p>In addition, there are problems relating to the study itself. For example, as the number of anticoagulated patients with vaccination criteria is low, to obtain a viable study population sample size required the participation of a large number of centres, which hindered the monitoring and coordination of the project. Finally, the large number of participating centres increased the need for special care in keeping doctors and patients blind to the route of vaccination.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>Td</term><def><p>Tetanus-diphtheria (vaccine)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IM</term><def><p>Intramuscular</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>Subcutaneous</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INR</term><def><p>International normalized ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRF</term><def><p>Case report form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NNT</term><def><p>Number (of patients) Needed to be Treat to prevent an event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intention-to-treat (analysis)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAR</term><def><p>Reduction of absolute risk.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>FILD and MVMM participated in the conception and design of the protocol.
