Various mind-body therapies are being embraced by patients as they are considered safe and potentially effective, yet little is known regarding the effectiveness of such therapies to improve LLD symptoms. Among the mind-body therapies currently in practice, the results of our pilot study have shown that a particular meditation technique called <italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> Meditation, which belongs to the category of meditation termed automatic self-transcending meditation (ASTM) may have some promise in improving cardiovascular autonomic disturbances associated with LLD as well as ameliorating symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Patients between the ages of 60 and 85 with LLD will be randomized either to ASTM plus treatment as usual (TAU) or TAU alone to assess changes in cardiovascular autonomic parameters<bold>,</bold> neuropsychological symptoms of depression and anxiety as well as quality of life. The instructional phase of the intervention consists of 4 consecutive days of meditation training, after which participants are encouraged to meditate twice daily for twenty minutes each time at home. The intervention also includes once weekly follow up sessions for the subsequent 11 weeks. The planned study has one and a half year recruitment period.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], thus compelling appropriate treatment.</p><p>Depression in general, and LLD in particular, is increasingly recognized as a dysfunction in multiple underlying biological processes with an increased prevalence of comorbid cardiovascular autonomic disturbances compared to age-matched controls
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], as reported by us previously
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other studies conducted on depression across the human life span have reported similar results
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], suggesting there may be an etiological link between autonomic dysfunction and LLD. This potential relationship necessitates further evaluation as it could provide invaluable insight into understanding the neurobiology of LLD and new treatment strategies.</p><p>Evidence shows that in a naturalistic setting, the response rate to an antidepressant trial of adequate dose and duration is often inadequate and can be as low as 30-40% in LLD
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, antidepressant use is often associated with a number of adverse events which lead to frequent discontinuation of such treatment
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Hence there remains the need for additional safe and effective interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Recently, various forms of non-pharmacological therapies loosely defined as mind-body therapies such as biofeedback, energy healing, meditation, guided imagery, and yoga
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] are being increasingly embraced by patients. Such therapies have negligible side effects, are easy to administer and display beneficial effects on quality of life as well as comorbid anxiety. Unlike antidepressants that classically alter neurotransmitter levels
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], mind-body therapies target multiple organ systems and offer an added advantage over anti-depressant treatment alone by ameliorating both depression and cardiovascular health when offered in combination with antidepressants therapy.</p><p>Various forms of meditation have been employed as mind-body treatments. Automatic self-transcending meditation (ASTM) is a category of meditation that helps quiet the mind and induce physiological and mental relaxation while the eyes are shut. It utilizes relaxed attention to a specific sound value (<italic>mantra</italic>) according to specific criteria, in order to draw attention inward. This permits the mind to experience a restful but alert state of consciousness
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. ASTM specifically improves autonomic dysfunction among elderly with and without cardiovascular disease and has a positive impact on depressive symptoms and stress
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In a randomized controlled trial of elderly retirement home residents comparing ASTM with two other meditative techniques and treatment as usual (TAU), ASTM produced significantly greater improvements in cognitive function, cardiovascular function and quality of life than all other treatment conditions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Studies of ASTM in adults with cardiovascular disease further demonstrated improvements in cardiovascular function including heart rate variability (HRV)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], an easily measurable cardiovascular autonomic variable. A subsequent meta-analysis of all-cause mortality rates among hypertensive elderly who had participated in stress reduction interventions found that ASTM practitioners had a 30% lower cardiovascular mortality rate than four other meditative or relaxation interventions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>These studies suggest that ASTM may be particularly well suited to elderly populations. However, it has not yet been shown if the benefits offered by ASTM would translate to elderly depressed subjects. We found through a pilot study that ASTM led to an improvement in HRV and was associated with reductions in symptoms of both depression and anxiety. The data also showed that the ASTM intervention did not induce any form of distress in participants, adding to the utility of this practice as a therapeutic tool. However, given that this was a pilot study, further investigation is required. Therefore we aim to assess ASTM in a large-sample randomized, controlled, longitudinal trial to confirm its effectiveness. In this paper, we provide a description of the protocol, participants&#x02019; inclusion/exclusion criteria, as well as cardiovascular and neuropsychological assessments that will be employed during the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to examine whether or not <italic>Sahaj Samadhi</italic> Meditation, a form of ASTM leads to increased HRV in patients with LLD.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] indicate that a sample size of 80 (4 in each of 20 groups) yield power estimates of 0.99 for both the interaction and the main effect of time. We intend to test a total of 96 participants to cover a conservative estimate of 20% loss to follow up. Based on the data obtained from the pilot study we consider these figures to be feasible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Treatment effect</title><p>The power estimate for relevant simple main effects of time for the ASTM treatment condition is 0.93 (or 0.83 Bonferroni once adjusted). Simple main effects of treatment at each level of time are not expected for early time periods, but could be present at 24 weeks with a significant linear by linear interaction of time and treatment. This contrast is estimated to have a power of 0.72 assuming a medium effect, but the effect might well be stronger with the cumulative effects of time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>An upward deflection in an ECG is referred to as R wave and R-R is the interval between successive Rs. The HRV will be calculated by the standard deviation of all normal R-R intervals (SDNN) on the ECG, the root-mean square of successive differences (RMSSD), as well as the number of R-R intervals differing by &#x0003e;50 milliseconds from adjacent intervals (NN50) according to time-domain analysis that are based on beat-to-beat or NN intervals. Time-domain analysis will be preferred over spectral density analysis as it treats the NN interval sequence as an unordered pairs of intervals
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], whereas spectral density analysis presents information on the power distribution (variance) of the ordered NN intervals across frequencies

Individual patients will be withdrawn from the study if there is reason to believe that continuation with the program would be deleterious for their mental health or safety. Particularly, participant involvement will be terminated if there are notable increases in the total HAMD score and/or suicidal ideation. In case of imminent risk, the patients will be referred to the Centralized Emergency Psychiatry Service at London Health Sciences Centre. All scientific instruments and the therapeutic modality have been previously shown to cause minimal to no discomfort. All sites have access to first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the event of an emergency. Participants will also be asked to indicate any discomfort, at which time the appropriate adjustments will be made, including discontinuation of the experiment for that participant if necessary. While participants are practicing ASTM techniques at their own homes, there are no additional perceived risks to their physical or mental health. As per the inclusion criteria, only patients at low risk for suicide will be recruited into the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the protocol of an innovative and, to the best of our knowledge, the first randomized controlled longitudinal trial that aims to examine the efficacy of a non-pharmacological mind-body intervention (ASTM) to improve cardiovascular autonomic function, quality of life, and symptoms of depression and anxiety in an older adult population suffering from depression. This study has now received all necessary approvals. Recruitment has commenced and it is aimed to be completed by December 2015. Methods have been put in place to ensure participants recruitment as per protocol. An extensive recruitment strategy has been devised to engage primary care practitioners and general public through radio talk shows, web, print and electronic advertisements.</p><p>Autonomic disturbance has been reported in patients with late life depression
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The primary outcome measure assessing cardiovascular health (HRV) is a well-established autonomic measure that has been used in other trials
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It can be conveniently and quickly collected. To collect the primary outcome measures collaboration has been set up with a neurovascular research laboratory at Western University.</p><p>The secondary outcome measures (HAMD, PASE, GDS, GAI, QOLPS, and TSES) will yield information on expected improvements in depression, physical activity, anxiety and quality of life. We shall be able to monitor any side effects due to antidepressant use and to feed this back to the participants for further discussion with their treatment provider, if needed.</p><p>There is currently limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of mind-body therapies in the elderly population. We have designed a robust randomized controlled trial which would allow us to confirm if one such mind-body therapy, ASTM improves cardiovascular autonomic imbalance and improves severity of depression and quality of life.</p><p>Heart rate variability can be seen as a manifestation of the interplay of the central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system on a beat-by-beat basis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. If there are positive effects of ASTM on HRV, then this form of meditation could potentially improve cardiovascular outcomes including myocardial infarction as well as mortality in patients with LLD. Patients with depression at the tested age range (60-85 years) usually develop a number of comorbidities, such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, and often have a history of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events for which they require appropriate medications (e.g. beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmics) which could influence the autonomic variables being measured. Hence, it would be impossible to completely exclude patients either with a history of cardiovascular episode or currently on cardiovascular medications that might affect the primary outcomes of our study. However, the randomization procedure will enable us to control these variables by placing the participants in one of the two treatment arms (ASTM&#x02009;+&#x02009;TAU and TAU alone) with equal likelihood, which will also make the findings of this naturalistic study more applicable to the population seen in the clinic routinely.</p><p>This study is a practitioner-administered program. Such programs tend to have higher rates of adherence and engagement than self-practice programs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Based on the evidence from previous studies conducted by one of the co-investigators (RN), we have found that older adults without depression have a very low attrition rate when subject to ASTM
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The authors expect that the combination of participant observation of improvements in their psychological and physical health, as well as the steps (described above) taken to make study assessments non-cumbersome will help to maintain the retention rate of participants.</p><p>The ASTM program is highly transferable to other practitioners through training and is easy to implement in routine clinical care. As much of the cost of such an intervention is associated with the development and initial testing, once evaluated it has the potential to be adapted and rolled out with ease at relatively little cost to a large number of elderly. We suspect that ASTM can make LLD treatment cost effective by reducing both direct (i.e. hospitalization, physician visits, and medication) and indirect medical costs (including home care by informal caregivers and loss of productivity by the caregiver). This would be consistent with previous findings that ASTM reduces medical care utilization
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and costs
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Although, there are no known direct risks of ASTM, some reported adverse effects include relaxation-induced anxiety, boredom, feeling addicted to the technique, and mild dissociation. However, such effects have been found mostly in individuals who practice meditative techniques for several years; no other short-term adverse events have been reported. Primary and secondary outcomes that will be measured via minimally invasive tests have also shown no direct risks. Prolonged use of finger and arm cuffs may cause numbness and discoloration, which resolve upon removal of the cuffs. ECG testing may cause some discomfort when electrodes are removed and the adhesive may cause some redness on the skin that would dissipate quickly at the end of the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It is proposed that ASTM augmentation is an effective intervention that may ameliorate the autonomic disturbance associated with LLD, reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improve quality of life compared to TAU.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Ronnie Newman is an employee with The Art of Living Foundation, USA.
