Very few studies have examined the effectiveness of pulse alfacalcidol therapy in comparison to daily oral alfacalcidol therapy in suppressing serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in hemodialysis patients. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to replicate the findings of prior studies comparing effectiveness of pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy versus daily oral alfacalcidol therapy in suppressing PTH after 13 weeks of therapy using a Palestinian sample of hemodialysis patients, and to identify demographic and biomedical characteristics of patients that are independently associated with PTH levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred and sixty-seven patients completed the study, 88 in the daily group and 79 in the pulse group. The pulse group had more clinically significant reduction in mean PTH level by 75 pg/dL at 13 weeks than the daily group, but this was not statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The effect of alfacalcidol therapy on metabolism of phosphate and corrected calcium levels was comparable in both groups, and pulse therapy was not associated with increased risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Serum PTH levels were independently and inversely associated with older age and diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Switching daily alfacalcidol therapy to thrice-weekly alfacalcidol pulse therapy seems safe and convenient, especially for hemodialysis patients with poor compliance with treatment. This study also highlights the importance of monitoring and preventing malnutrition in hemodialysis patients and maintaining optimal glycemic control in diabetic hemodialysis patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>end-stage kidney disease</kwd><kwd>hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>alfacalcidol</kwd><kwd>parathyroid hormone</kwd><kwd>hyperparathyroidism</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trials</kwd><kwd>pulse therapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Secondary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), autonomous secretion parathyroid hyperplasia, is a common complication of chronic kidney disease.<xref rid="b1-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Progression of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease is attributed to a combination of factors, including reduction in vitamin D synthesis, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and PTH skeletal resistance.<xref rid="b3-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This state of mineral metabolism imbalance is independently associated with increased risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease and morbidity, such as bone disease and fractures, among patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis.<xref rid="b5-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Vitamin D replacement therapy with alfacalcidol (1&#x003b1;-hydroxyvitamin D3) is widely used in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in hemodialysis patients. Prior studies have shown that alfacalcidol, whether administered orally or intravenously, is effective in suppressing PTH secretion without significant increase in the risk of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia.<xref rid="b10-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Additionally, prior studies have demonstrated that pulse alfacalcidol therapy is effective in suppressing PTH as daily oral alfacalcidol therapy.<xref rid="b12-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, some studies recommend the use of pulse oral alfacalcidol in hemodialysis patients for its ease of administration during hemodialysis sessions, treatment compliance, and cost-effectiveness advantages.<xref rid="b14-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Until now, only very few studies have compared the effects of pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy versus daily oral alfacalcidol therapy in suppressing PTH among hemodialysis patients.<xref rid="b12-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> One study only included a relatively small number of hemodialysis patients (16 patients in the daily group and 18 patients in the pulse group). Also, the findings of these studies regarding the effectiveness of pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy versus daily oral alfacalcidol therapy in suppressing PTH were unadjusted and did not account for the independent effects of various demographic and biomedical characteristics of hemodialysis patients on PTH levels (for example, age, duration on hemodialysis, diabetic status), which were reported as significant predictors of PTH levels among hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.<xref rid="b16-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Identifying demographic and biomedical characteristics that independently affect PTH levels among hemodialysis patients is important. Such information can be used in clinical practice in developing individualized treatment plans for hemodialysis patients, which may help in achieving optimal target ranges for PTH and maintain mineral metabolism balance. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to replicate the findings of previous studies comparing effectiveness of pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy versus daily oral alfacalcidol therapy in suppressing PTH using a Palestinian sample of hemodialysis patients, and to identify demographic and biomedical patients&#x02019; characteristics independently associated with PTH levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design, population, and setting</title><p>This randomized controlled study was conducted in the hemodialysis unit at An-Najah National University Hospital, Nablus, Palestine. The study lasted for 13 weeks (October 1, 2016, to January 1, 2017). The Institutional Review Board of College of Medicine and Health Sciences at An-Najah National University granted ethical approval for this study under ethical approval archive number 101/OCT/2015. All patients signed informed consent for participation in the study. Subjects had to meet the following eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study: age &#x02265;18 years old and with mean values from three consecutive readings of &#x0003c;10.5 mg/dL for serum corrected calcium, &#x0003c;8.5 mg/dL for serum phosphorus, and &#x0003e;180 pg/mL for PTH (more than three times the upper normal limit of PTH [60 pg/mL]). Subjects who did not meet the inclusion criteria and those with any concomitant chronic or malignant liver disease were excluded. All patients were on regular three hemodialysis sessions per week (4 hours per session) using a dialysate calcium concentration of 1.25 mmol/L.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment groups</title><p>We used the random number generation function in the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) to randomize patients to receive either daily oral dose of alfacalcidol (daily group) or thrice-weekly oral dose of alfacalcidol (pulse group). The alfacalcidol oral tablets preparations available in the unit were 0.25 mcg and 1.0 mcg. The alfacalcidol dosage for every patient in both treatment groups was based on baseline serum PTH levels and was adjusted monthly based on laboratory findings as described by KDIGO criteria.<xref rid="b23-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The thrice-weekly alfacalcidol for each patient in the pulse group was calculated using the following formula: thrice-weekly dose = (daily dose &#x000d7;7)/3. Then the resulting dosage of alfacalcidol was rounded to the multiples of 0.25 mcg. Patients in the daily group received their individualized dosage of alfacalcidol as usual (7 days per week), while patients in the pulse group received their individualized alfacalcidol dosage at the end of each hemodialysis session. Phosphate binders used in the study for all patients were calcium carbonate (600 mg tablet), calcium acetate 700 mg tablet, and Sevelamer hydrochloride 800 mg tablet.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Corrected serum calcium and phosphate were measured at baseline and were repeated on monthly basis, while serum PTH was measured at baseline and at the end of the study. However, any extremes values for corrected serum calcium or phosphate and for serum PTH were repeated after 2 weeks and 1 month, respectively. The alfacalcidol dosage was discontinued if the PTH reading was less than 150 pg/mL, and the serum PTH was repeated next month. Corrected serum calcium level was determined using the formula: albumin-adjusted serum calcium concentration (mg/dL) = measured serum calcium concentration (mg/dL) + 0.8 &#x000d7; [4 &#x02212; serum albumin concentration (g/dL)].<xref rid="b24-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> All blood samples from patients were drawn from the dialyzer line before starting hemodialysis session.

There were no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups in baseline demographic and biomedical characteristics. Both groups had decreased mean PTH levels at the end of the study. The pulse group had more clinically significant reduction in mean PTH level at 13 weeks than the daily group, but this reduction was not statistically significant. The effect of alfacalcidol therapy on metabolism of phosphate at the end of the study, characterized by slight reduction in mean phosphate levels, was similar in both groups. The mean corrected serum calcium increased slightly in the pulse group and dropped slightly in the oral group at the end of the study, but remained within normal range in both groups. These findings are consistent with prior studies and provide further support that pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy is as effective in suppressing PTH levels as daily oral alfacalcidol therapy without significant increase in the risk of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia, with the additive advantage of ensuring complete compliance with therapy.<xref rid="b12-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ijnrd-11-025" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>This study showed that mean PTH levels were inversely associated with older age and being diabetic.

Additionally, compliance with alfacalcidol therapy in the pulse group was complete during the study as patients received their pulse dose of alfacalcidol at the end of each dialysis session and this was given by nursing staff in the hemodialysis unit.</p><p>One of the limitations of this study is that we were unable to use a precise measurement for compliance with alfacalcidol therapy in the daily group. However, all patients in the daily group were instructed to intake their medications as usual 7 days a week. So, it is unlikely that noncompliance with medications in the daily group has affected the magnitude and direction of alfacalcidol effects on mean PTH levels significantly as our findings are very consistent with the findings of prior studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study adds further evidence that pulse oral alfacalcidol therapy is as effective in suppressing PTH levels as daily oral alfacalcidol therapy, without the significant increase in the risk of hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia. For clinicians treating hemodialysis patients with alfacalcidol, switching daily alfacalcidol therapy to thrice-weekly alfacalcidol pulse therapy seems safe and convenient, especially for hemodialysis patients with poor compliance with treatment. This study also suggests that monitoring and prevention of malnutrition with optimal glycemic control in diabetic patients may help in minimizing the risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease in patients with lower levels of serum PTH.</p></sec><sec><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data are all contained within the article.
