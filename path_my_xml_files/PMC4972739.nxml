Clinical characteristics include primary features (transient erythema or flushing, fixed/non-transient erythema, inflammatory papules/pustules, telangiectasia) and secondary features (burning, plaque, edema) in various combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As it is readily visible on the face, rosacea has a considerable impact on a patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Until recently, patients with severe inflammatory lesions were often treated with antibiotics. However, a European Commission action plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and World Health Organization global action plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have been implemented in recent years to tackle the ever-increasing problem of antimicrobial resistance, including reducing antibiotic use in non-infectious diseases.</p><p>Current topical treatments for inflammatory lesions of rosacea (papulopustular) include metronidazole 0.75% and 1% topical formulations and azelaic acid 15% gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Topical ivermectin 1% cream (IVM 1%; Soolantra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1% cream, Galderma, Lausanne, Switzerland) was approved across Europe in 2015 based on 2 pivotal Phase 3 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and 1 supportive Phase 3 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], involving a total of over 2300 subjects.

The 10 questions cover 6 domains and DLQI subscale scores were calculated for symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work and school, personal relationships, and treatment. The changes from baseline were analyzed by analysis of covariance, including baseline DLQI as a covariate.

It is important to determine whether changes in physical symptoms interpreted by the clinician translate into measurably significant changes in QoL for the individual. This was the case since mean difference in DLQI scores and EQ-5D scores were consistently statistically significantly better for patients with treatment success than for those with treatment failure. Since the extent of improvement in QoL total scores lack a direct clinical meaning, the concept of MCID (defined previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]) was used to confirm clinically relevant treatment effectiveness.</p><p>More subjects in the IVM 1% group had an MCID in DLQI score compared with the MTZ 0.75% group at week&#x000a0;16 (65.4% vs. 39.2%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). As all patients who continued into Part&#x000a0;B had been treated successfully in Part&#x000a0;A whatever the treatment group (i.e., all were IGA 0 or 1 at week&#x000a0;16), it may be expected that the subjects in both groups would be equally satisfied with the treatment in Part&#x000a0;B. However, this was not the case since at week 52, the improvement in proportion of subjects with an MCID in DLQI score (68.8% IVM 1% vs. 40.4% MTZ 0.75%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003) was again significantly greater in the IVM 1% group, reflecting the clinical superiority of IVM 1% over the long-term. These results were corroborated with the results obtained using the generic EQ-5D questionnaire, with which the mean change from baseline at week&#x000a0;16 and week&#x000a0;52 were significantly higher in the IVM 1% group than the MTZ 0.75% group. The EQ-5D is a very widely used generic questionnaire and it is unusual to observe a statistically significant difference in scores for dermatological diseases, especially with a small sample size.</p><p>QoL data collected at week&#x000a0;32 could not be directly compared between the IVM 1% and MTZ 0.75% groups as the level of exposure to the two drugs was heterogeneous at this time point. In fact, more subjects in the MTZ 0.75% group had already been re-treated at week&#x000a0;32 compared to the IVM 1% group due to the longer remission time for the IVM 1% group, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In this subanalysis of severe patients, the success rate at week 16 was higher in the IVM-treated group than in the MTZ-treated group (82.5% vs. 63% IGA 0 or 1; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005). The superiority of IVM 1% was more pronounced in this subpopulation of severe subjects (between-group difference of 19.5%) than in the overall population of moderate-to-severe subjects, in which the success rate was reported to be 84.9% IVM 1% vs. 75.4% MTZ 0.75% at week&#x000a0;16 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001; between-group difference of 9.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Archive photographs are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> to illustrate a severe subject (IGA of 4 at baseline) who had an IGA of 1 after 14&#x000a0;weeks treatment with IVM 1% cream QD. As the IGA is a composite score including both inflammatory lesions and erythema, it is difficult to obtain a score of 0 (clear) since a combination treatment may be required. Of the successfully treated subjects (IGA score of 0 or 1), the proportion of severe subjects with complete healing of both inflammatory lesions and erythema lesions (an IGA score of 0) at week&#x000a0;16 was 27.5% in the IVM 1% group compared to 12.3% in the MTZ 0.75% group. The difference between an IGA score of 0 and 1 is clinically relevant to the patients since they want a full reduction of lesions and erythema.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Photographs of a severe subject with <bold>a</bold> an IGA of 4 before treatment and <bold>b</bold> an IGA of 1 after 14&#x000a0;weeks treatment with ivermectin 1% cream once daily. <italic>IGA</italic> investigator's global assessment.

The results in this group of severe subjects are consistent with a previous long-term safety study on IVM 1% cream in moderate-to-severe subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Severe inflammatory lesions of rosacea are often treated with oral antibiotics, particularly tetracyclines, despite a poor safety profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, antibiotic resistance is now a major threat to public health causing people to be sick for longer and increasing the cost of health care with lengthier stays in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Dermatologists contribute to overall antibiotic use and tend to prescribe antibiotics chronically, particularly for acne and rosacea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Hence, there is a need to find effective alternatives to antibiotics or sub-anti&#x02013;microbial dosage forms. One such example is the use of a sub-anti&#x02013;microbial dosage of doxycycline (40&#x000a0;mg modified-release doxycycline), which has anti-inflammatory rather than anti-microbial effect, that has been reported to be as effective as 100&#x000a0;mg with significantly fewer gastrointestinal side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Since ivermectin is a member of the avermectin class of compounds (with anti-inflammatory and anti-parasitic effects) and is not an antibiotic, it is thus an effective alternative treatment for papulopustular rosacea, even in severe patients.</p><p>Limitations of this subanalysis include the small number of subjects. However, despite the small sample size, statistical significance was reached for the efficacy endpoints. Another limitation was the absence of double-blind due to the fact that IVM 1% is QD, whereas MTZ 0.75% is BID, as well as the obvious difference in appearance of the two creams. However, a QD treatment has the advantage of being more appealing to patients, especially when it is more efficacious.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with severe papulopustular rosacea, better efficacy with IVM 1% cream compared to MTZ 0.75% cream contributes to an improved QoL with significantly more patients achieving an MCID in DLQI score and higher mean EQ-5D score. IVM 1% cream QD is thus a better alternative than MTZ 0.75% cream BID for severe papulopustular rosacea patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>On behalf of the Ivermectin Phase III study group.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/A1E4F0604AFDF282">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/A1E4F0604AFDF282</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Sponsorship and article processing charges for this study were funded by Galderma R&#x00026;D (Sophia Antipolis, France).
