Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis), are a significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause mortality are 46% higher among neonates with omphalitis than in those without. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have examined the effect of multiple cord stump applications with 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) for at least 7&#x000a0;days on the risk of omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies, all community-based, show that multiple CHX applications reduced the risk of omphalitis. Of these trials, only one study from South Asia (the Bangladeshi study) and none from Africa examined the effect of a single application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this Bangladeshi trial, CHX led to a reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an African setting, to explore the effect of a single application among health-facility births. A single application is programmatically much simpler to implement than daily applications for 7&#x000a0;days. Therefore, our study compares umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% CHX at birth with dry cord care among Ugandan babies born in health facilities, on the risk of omphalitis and severe neonatal illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The CHX study is a facility-based, individually randomized controlled trial that will be conducted among 4760 newborns in Uganda.

Nearly a third of these neonatal deaths are associated with infections and this proportion is higher in areas and countries where nearly half of the births occur at home, such as Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Infection of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis) is a significant contributor to these infections in newborn babies in LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In a Nepalese study, the odds of all-cause mortality were 46% (95% CI 8&#x02013;98%) higher among infants with umbilical cord infection than in those without [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The umbilical cord is cut after birth and the remaining cord stump generally dries and falls off within 5&#x02013;15 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Before it detaches, the stump provides necrotic tissue suitable for bacterial colonization, and can act as an entry point for pathogenic microorganisms into the newborn. Newborns are particularly prone to infection, such as omphalitis, for a number of reasons including an immature immune system, exposure to maternal vaginal organisms during birth and unhygienic practices after birth. These practices include cutting of the cord with unsterile instruments, inadequate hand-washing by birth attendants and other caretakers and topical application of harmful substances such ash and cow dung. The increased risk of infection among newborns is even greater for those born preterm who have a more immature immune system and more vulnerable and thinner skin compared to their term counterparts. Several interventions have been recommended in the past to combat newborn infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These include: full-body skin cleansing with antiseptics like chlorhexidine (CHX); hand-washing with soap and water and use of clean birth kits. But the effects of these interventions on the incidence of infection and death in neonates have been mixed and two systematic reviews did not unequivocally conclude that any of these interventions reduced the risk of either serious infection or death. The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes that cord care is a crucial component of immediate newborn care. It currently recommends dry cord care for babies born in health facilities in low-income countries while noting that antiseptics could be used in settings where harmful cord practices are rife [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Nonetheless, this WHO recommendation of dry cord care for LMIC facility births is questionable given the inadequate evidence on which it is based. The WHO&#x02019;s recommendation was based on a Cochrane review by Zupan et al. that found no difference in the incidence of umbilical cord infection when topical antiseptics were compared to placebo. With the exception of one study in Thailand, the rest of the 22 trials included in this review were from high-income countries. It would be problematic to generalize these findings to LMICs. There are several potential topical applications that could be used to lower the risk of neonatal infections and death through appropriate cord care in LMICs, such as CHX, povidone iodine, ethanol, gentian violet, silver sulfadiazine and others. Of these, CHX shows the most promise for the following reasons: (1) low cost, (2) broad-spectrum activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, (3) strong tissue-binding potential with residual effectiveness and (4) a wide safety record. Several studies have shown that CHX reduces cord stump colonization by bacteria and the WHO recommends it as the preferred agent if an antiseptic is to be used on the cord. In addition, CHX is included in the WHO Essential Drug List and is also identified as one of the commodities in the UN commission&#x02019;s report on life-saving commodities for women and children.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>State of the existing academic literature on topical application of chlorhexidine to the umbilical cord stump</title><p id="Par20">CHX has been used for decades in various health care settings as an antiseptic and, in most of these cases, it has been shown to reduce bacterial colonization and the risk of infection. With respect to newborn cord care in LMICs, two randomized trials in the 1990s of vaginal and newborn washing with 0.25% CHX showed promise but two more recent studies, one in South Africa using 0.5% and the other in Pakistan using 0.6% CHX, did not find a lower neonatal mortality in the intervention group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A more recent approach has been to apply 4% CHX directly to the umbilical cord stump. We found five published reports of large randomized trials, all community-based, that have been done in LMICs; three in Asia and two in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These studies showed that multiple CHX applications may lead to a marked reduction in the incidence of omphalitis but effects of CHX on neonatal mortality vary considerably (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>State of the existing academic literature on topical application of chlorhexidine on the umbilical cord stump</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="2">Risk of omphalitis/1000</th><th/><th colspan="2">Neonatal mortality/1000</th><th/></tr><tr><th>Author, Year</th><th>Country</th><th>Intervention</th><th>Control</th><th>Adjusted RR</th><th>Intervention</th><th>Control</th><th>Adjusted RR</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Mullany, 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]</td><td>Nepal</td><td>30.1</td><td>62.7</td><td>0.46 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;36, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;59)</td><td>14.6</td><td>19.3</td><td>0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;76 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;55, 1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;04)</td></tr><tr><td>Soofi, 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]</td><td>Pakistan</td><td>31.7</td><td>75.9</td><td>0.58 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;41, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;82)</td><td>22.8</td><td>36.1</td><td>0.62 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;45, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;85)</td></tr><tr><td>Arifeen, 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]</td><td>Bangladesh</td><td>14.7</td><td>26</td><td>0.55 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;31, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;95)</td><td>26.6</td><td>28.3</td><td>0.94 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;78, 1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;14)</td></tr><tr><td>Sazawal, 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</td><td>Tanzania</td><td>78.4</td><td>115.5</td><td>0.65 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;61, 0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;70)</td><td>10.5</td><td>11.7</td><td>0.90 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;74, 1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;09)</td></tr><tr><td>Semrau, 2016 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]</td><td>Zambia</td><td>4.43</td><td>6.1</td><td>0.73 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;47, 1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;13)</td><td>15.2</td><td>13.6</td><td>1.12 (0&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;88, 1&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;44)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p><p id="Par21">With the exception of the Bangladeshi study, all these trials compared at least 7&#x000a0;days of daily CHX application to placebo or dry cord care. The trial in Bangladesh compared a single application of CHX to dry cord care and reported an efficacy of 20% on neonatal mortality (risk ratio 0.80; 95% CI 0.65&#x02013;0.98) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There was, somewhat surprisingly, no effect of daily cleansing with CHX for 7&#x000a0;days on neonatal mortality.</p><p id="Par22">There is strong evidence for the effect of 7-day CHX application on the risk of omphalitis but the results from the large trial in Bangladesh and the two African trials question whether this translates into a mortality reduction. Daily CHX applications for 1&#x000a0;week have been associated with delayed cord falling which in turn could increase the probability of infection via the cord, and possibly explain the lack of an effect of daily cleansing for 7&#x000a0;days in some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A single CHX application could mitigate the reported delay in cord falling when multiple applications are used. There is no data from Africa, and only one study from Asia, that examined the effect of a single application as soon as possible after birth. It is important, in an African setting, to explore the effect of a single application which is also programmatically much simpler to implement than daily application for 7&#x000a0;days. Our study will, therefore, embark on a head-to-head comparison of a single CHX application to dry cord care in birth facilities on omphalitis and severe illness during the neonatal period.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par23">

The watery solution was obtained from Galentic Pharma in India (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.galentic.com">http://www.galentic.com</ext-link>) and came in packages of 10-ml dropper bottles. The application is provided by a trained health worker (nurse or midwife) at the health facility as soon as possible and no later than 12&#x000a0;h after birth. The solution is applied using the dropper bottle onto the tip of the infant&#x02019;s umbilical cord stump, its base and the area of skin surrounding it. A CHX-moistened cotton ball is then used to gently cleanse the base of the stump and the surrounding skin. Health workers have been trained by general physicians and pediatricians to correctly, consistently and safely apply CHX. Five CHX containers will be randomly chosen early, during and towards the end of the trial to check for CHX concentration and antibacterial activity. The chlorhexidine stock is securely kept below 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, away from light in tightly closed/sealed bottles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Comparator</title><p id="Par38">Participants in the comparison arm of the trial will be given the standard of care (dry cord care).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Measurements</title><p id="Par39">The main outcomes of this study are clinically diagnosed omphalitis and severe illness. Assessment for these outcomes is scheduled on days 1, 3, 7, 14 and 28 after birth. Further, the mothers are encouraged to visit our clinics if they observe any signs of umbilical cord stump infection or if they are worried that their child is otherwise ill. Severe illness is defined as illness that is associated with any of the following danger signs observed or verified by a study clinician: inability to feed or vomiting of all intake, lethargy or unconsciousness, severe lower chest in-drawing, axillary temperature of &#x02265;37.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;35.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, grunting, cyanosis, convulsions or a history of convulsions, and/or results in hospitalization and/or results in death. The data collection team records the presence or absence of omphalitis at each clinic visit. Signs for omphalitis include: pus, redness (inflammation) and swelling (edema) of the cord stump and the surrounding skin at its base. Swelling and redness is further broken down into four groups: none, mild, moderate and severe. No swelling or redness is defined as absence of visible swelling or redness; mild swelling or redness as that which is limited to the cord stump only; moderate swelling or redness as that extending less than 2&#x000a0;cm onto the abdominal skin at the base of the stump and severe swelling or redness as extending at least 2&#x000a0;cm or more around the abdominal skin at the base of the stump. Pus is characterized as being either present or absent. Cord infection is then defined based on combinations of these signs and their severity into four categories as follows: (1) redness extending to skin or pus, (2) moderate or severe redness, (3) moderate or severe redness with pus, or severe redness alone and (4) severe redness with pus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Given the necessity of the comparison arm to receive advice and education on dry cord care (the standard of care), this is an unblinded study.

For enrolled infants, data will be collected using questionnaires on day 1, and on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 after birth (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Time schedule for study procedures (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) figure)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2050_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

Participating women will be invited to bring their children to the study clinics on the scheduled dates for data collection. Home visits will be conducted for women unable to come to the health facilities for the scheduled interviews (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p id="Par46">To capture severe illness, mothers and other caregivers will be informed about its symptoms and signs, and will be encouraged to contact the study clinic in case the baby develops any of the symptoms. Each mother is provided with a durable note book in which she or an attending health care worker are requested to note down all relevant events for the child. A child who comes to a clinic with such symptoms or signs will be examined by a study nurse/midwife and will receive the appropriate treatment. If the child does not attend after the mother/caregiver has informed the study team of such symptoms/signs or for a scheduled visit, the study nurse/midwife will make a visit to the child&#x02019;s house. If the nurse/midwife classifies the condition as possible severe illness, a study physician will be called to examine the child. If the physician classifies the child as having severe illness, they will collect a blood specimen for blood culture (using BACTEC) and for a septic screen (C-reactive protein (CRP), total lymphocyte count, differential count, band cell: neutrophil count ratio) as soon as possible. A repeat specimen will be collected again for CRP between 24 and 48&#x000a0;h. The study team will do its utmost to obtain specimens for such a septic screen from as many infants with signs of severe illness as possible. With the consent of the parents, all children with neonatal sepsis are admitted to the National Referral and Teaching Hospital (Mulago Hospital) where they are managed according to the national guidelines. In the event of a neonatal death, it is our experience that a mother may call spontaneously to inform the study team of why she is not coming to the next scheduled visit. However, in most cases, she will simply not turn up; in that case, the death will be captured when she is contacted because of a missed visit. A &#x0201c;verbal autopsy&#x0201d; for all neonatal deaths will be conducted as soon as it is socially acceptable to maximize recall without socially offending the participants. We will assess the cause of death using a standard World Health Organization (WHO) Verbal Autopsy Questionnaire that has been validated in Uganda. The questionnaire has both open-ended questions (for verbatim narratives) and closed-ended questions, and we will employ a standard algorithm to determine the likely cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Two independent reviewers will examine the verbal autopsies and assign a likely cause of death. In event of divergent conclusions, a third reviewer will be requested to provide a third review.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Project management</title><p id="Par47">The study will be conducted as a collaboration between the College of Health Sciences, Makerere University and the Center for International Health, University of Bergen. The study will be guided by a Steering Committee which will include the principal investigator (PI) and the co-principal investigator (Co-PI) supported by the other co-investigators and a newly established Participatory Scientific Advisory Group (PSAG). The Steering Committee (VN and HS) is responsible for the conduct and coordination of the study. The Steering Committee will be the decision-making body for all scientific and administrative aspects. It will send reports to the funding agency, ethical committees and regulatory bodies. The SC will meet on regular conference calls with at least two face-to-face meetings annually. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02606565).</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Quality control</title><p id="Par48">All data is collected using standardized questionnaires and forms on an ODK platform using Android cell phones. The study nurses were trained extensively in all the routines and how to fill the questionnaires and Case Report Forms before study implementation. In particular, they received training on the assessment and grading of omphalitis using audio-visual aids and pictorials by faculty members at the College of Health Sciences, Makerere University. Newborns with moderate to severe omphalitis or severe illness are immediately referred to the nearest government health unit. At least one scientist/medical officer is employed by the project to supervise the field team and ensure good-quality data. To minimize losses to follow-up, the following measures are taken: (1) careful screening of study participants for eligibility before enrollment, (2) consenting participants are provided with a transport refund that covers their costs to and from the health facility, (3) contact telephone numbers are obtained from each consenting participant and reminders are made prior to each scheduled date and (4) each study site has a dedicated tracer with good knowledge of the study site geography. Importantly, detailed information on the physical location/address of the participants&#x02019; homes is collected at enrollment to help with tracing mothers who do not attend for study visits. Research assistants (who are licensed nurses or midwives) have been, and are being, rigorously trained to obtain informed consent from study participates. They also receive training on all study tools which have been pretested and standardized to minimize information biases. The capture of digital images of the umbilical cord stump and surrounding skin will enhance the diagnostic specificity of reported omphalitis cases.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data analyses</title><p id="Par49">Baseline characteristics of the mothers, their households and the newborns will be compared between the intervention and comparison arms to check for comparability and identify potential confounders.

Multivariable analysis will be used to take into account potential confounding. Only confounders whose inclusion in the model results in a substantial (&#x0003e;5%) change in the estimate of the main outcome will be maintained in the final model.

If substantial stratum-specific differences in effects are observed, we will proceed with analyses to identify effect measure modification.

There is a sufficient state of equipoise in Sub-Saharan Africa to justify this study because this intervention has never been tested, and only one study in Asia shows the effect of a single CHX application. Furthermore, two African trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] that did not report on severe illness, found no effect of CHX on neonatal mortality, unlike the three Asian trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par61">Four percent CHX has been found to be safe in community settings in Asia and Africa.

If the intervention is found effective and safe, we will, in collaboration with local leaders and other interested stakeholders, participate in the generation of health education materials, such as posters, that can be used to raise awareness and increase demand for the intervention. Similarly, officials at the Ugandan Ministry of Health, policy-makers and relevant NGOs will be apprised of the project and its results through meetings, reports, policy briefs, and other communication channels like email and telephone. We have interacted with the Department of Maternal, Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (MCA) at the WHO from the conception to the start of this trial. Such strong collaborations between the research team and decision and policy-makers will hasten the translation of research findings at the end of the study into policy and programs, locally, nationally and globally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par63">The current situation in which approximately 2.7 million children, mostly in LMICs, die within 28&#x000a0;days of birth is unconscionable. Uganda has one of the highest neonatal death rates in the world. Nearly 29 out of 1000 live-born children die within the first month of life. Sadly, this high risk of death in the first month of life in Uganda and in many other LMICs has been stagnant for decades and has not seen the same decline as for deaths of children aged between 1 and 5&#x000a0;years of age. Importantly, many of the neonatal deaths could possibly be prevented with affordable interventions such as 4% CHX. But results of the effect of 4% CHX applied to the umbilical cord stump on neonatal mortality in the three Asian trials are incongruent with findings in the two African trials. While all studies report an effect of 4% CHX on omphalitis, the African trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] did not find an effect on neonatal mortality, unlike the Asian trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, none of these studies, particularly the African trials report on the potential effect of CHX on severe illness. It is, therefore, unclear whether the observed effect on omphalitis in the African trials translates into a protection from severe illness, an outcome that may be less prone to the Hawthorne effect than mortality. With multiple, sometimes daily, CHX applications and study visits by community health workers, the likelihood of obtaining a null finding because of this effect with a mortality outcome cannot be overlooked. This is particularly so in settings where frequent study visits have a high likelihood of coinciding with severe illness events which, in turn, result in interventions by the study team that likely lead to a reduction in mortality for all study arms. In addition, the effect of a single application of CHX has not been evaluated in SSA. If found effective in SSA, a single topical application of 4% CHX on the newborn umbilical cord stump has the potential to prevent hundreds of thousands of neonatal infections and deaths each year. This study is of particularly high relevance and benefit to societies in SSA where it will yield novel information because the effect of a single topical application of 4% CHX in birth facilities has not been studied, and where awareness and demand of this potentially life-saving intervention is nearly nonexistent among women, caregivers and health practitioners. Information produced from our trial will inform scale-up of the intervention if found effective in this setting.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par64">Recruiting since July 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec31"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par75">
