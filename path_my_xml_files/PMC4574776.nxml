In a US-based survey that analysed healthcare providers&#x02019; attitudes to providing IUC, more than 60% of providers reported they infrequently provided IUC to nulliparous women [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Bayer HealthCare has developed two low-dose levonorgestrel intrauterine contraceptive systems (LNG-IUSs); total content 13.5 mg (average approx. 8 &#x003bc;g/24 hours over the first year; hereafter referred to as LNG-IUS 8) and total content 19.5 mg (average approx. 13 &#x003bc;g/24 hours over the first year; hereafter referred to as LNG-IUS 13), designed to be potentially more suitable for women with either a tighter cervical canal or a smaller uterine cavity. Compared with LNG-IUS total content 52 mg (average approx. 20 &#x003bc;g/24 hours over the first year; hereafter referred to as LNG-IUS 20; Mirena), LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 have smaller T-frames (28 &#x000d7; 30 mm vs 32 &#x000d7; 32 mm) and smaller hormone reservoirs, allowing them to be placed using a smaller diameter placement tube (3.80 mm vs 4.75 mm or 4.4 mm, with the recently marketed EvoInserter).</p><p>In a Phase II study, LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 demonstrated good contraceptive efficacy over 3 years with no apparent dose&#x02013;response, were well tolerated and were significantly easier and less painful to place compared with placement of LNG-IUS 20 using the 4.75 mm diameter placement tube [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 subsequently underwent further evaluation in a Phase III study; the overall results of this study have been reported previously [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on the results of these two studies, LNG-IUS 8 was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (as Skyla) for up to 3 years of contraceptive use. In addition, LNG-IUS 8 was deemed &#x02018;approvable&#x02019; by the Decentralized Procedure in the EU and was subsequently approved (as Jaydess) in most European countries, Canada and some countries in Latin America [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analyses of Phase III data that evaluate the effect of age, parity and body mass index (BMI) on the efficacy of LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13; the effect of age and parity on safety outcomes, continuation rates, reasons for discontinuation and user satisfaction; and the effect of parity on the ease and pain of placement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This open-label, randomized Phase III study (clinical trials.gov; NCT00528112; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00528112">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00528112</ext-link>) was conducted at 138 study centres across 11 countries between August 2007 and June 2011. The protocol (see <xref rid="pone.0135309.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>) and its amendments were reviewed and approved by the independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site and the study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before study entry.</p><p>The methodology and overall results have been published previously [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The pertinent elements of the protocol were as follows: Healthy nulliparous and parous women aged 18&#x02013;35 years (inclusive) with regular menstrual cycles (21&#x02013;35 days) requesting contraception were recruited. Women were required to have uterine conditions considered by the investigating physician to be suitable for placement of an LNG-IUS, although no maximum or minimum uterine dimensions were specified and no screening failures were reported to be due to an investigator considering the uterus too small.</p><p>Subjects were randomized 1:1 to 3 years of treatment with either LNG-IUS 8 or LNG-IUS 13. Treatment assignment was blinded to participating women. However, it was not possible to blind investigators to randomization because of visible differences between LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 in the length of the hormone reservoir.</p><p>LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 were placed during the first 7 days of the woman&#x02019;s menstrual cycle. Two placement attempts were permitted per woman and if both attempts failed, the subject was withdrawn from the study. The use of local anaesthesia, oral analgesics and cervical dilation was permitted at the discretion of individual investigators. After placement, ultrasound was used to confirm the &#x02018;compliant&#x02019; positioning of the system (i.e. completely within the uterine cavity).</p><p>At the LNG-IUS placement visit, investigators rated the ease of placement (from their own perspective) as &#x02018;easy&#x02019;, &#x02018;slightly difficult&#x02019; or &#x02018;very difficult&#x02019;, based on their own perception of what these terms meant. In addition, women rated their pain on placement as &#x02018;none&#x02019;, &#x02018;mild&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;severe&#x02019;, again based on their own perception of what these terms meant.</p><p>All uterine perforations and ectopic pregnancies were to be reported as serious adverse events (SAEs). Complete or partial expulsions were to be reported as AEs. During the study, a protocol amendment in 2009 clarified the definition of a partial expulsion (LNG-IUS at least partially located in the cervical canal by ultrasound and/or partially visible in the vagina on clinical examination) and confirmed that it was not necessary to remove an LNG-IUS that was completely within the uterine cavity (not in the cervical canal) even if it was not in the fundal position.</p><p>Another protocol amendment in 2009 required that participating women were asked to complete a user satisfaction questionnaire either at the end of 3 years (those who completed 3 years of treatment) or at their final study visit (those who discontinued prematurely). Women rated their overall satisfaction with study treatment as: &#x02018;very satisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;somewhat satisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;neither satisfied/dissatisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;dissatisfied&#x02019; or &#x02018;very dissatisfied&#x02019;. For women who experienced bleeding while on treatment, satisfaction with their menstrual bleeding pattern was rated as: &#x02018;very satisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;somewhat satisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;neither satisfied/dissatisfied&#x02019;, &#x02018;dissatisfied&#x02019; or &#x02018;very dissatisfied&#x02019;. For women who did not experience bleeding while on treatment, their satisfaction with their menstrual bleeding pattern was recorded as &#x02018;not applicable&#x02019;. When asked about their preference for use of contraception after the study, women answered from the following options: &#x02018;continue with study treatment&#x02019;, &#x02018;use a different hormonal contraceptive&#x02019;, &#x02018;use a different contraceptive method&#x02019;, &#x02018;discontinue use of all types of contraception&#x02019; or &#x02018;don&#x02019;t know&#x02019;.</p><p>The pregnancy rate was expressed as the Pearl Index (number of pregnancies per 100 woman-years; the primary efficacy variable). Pearl Index and the corresponding confidence interval (CI) calculations assumed that the number of pregnancies followed a Poisson distribution. The cumulative failure rate was also calculated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method. Exposure calculations were based on the time from LNG-IUS placement until expulsion/removal of the system, or the end of 3 years of use. Months during which women used concomitant contraception (e.g. condoms) or prohibited medications such as sex steroid hormones were subtracted from respective exposure times. If a pregnancy occurred during such a month, the pregnancy would have been considered but the month would have been subtracted from the exposure time. Women who had a failed placement attempt were assumed to have an exposure time of 1 day (because they were considered to have been briefly exposed during the placement attempt) and were included in the efficacy analysis. Pregnancies that occurred after LNG-IUS removal or known expulsion were not included in Pearl Index calculations.</p><p>Analyses included data from all randomized women for whom LNG-IUS placement was attempted (full analysis set), with the exception of the analysis of expulsion rates, which included only women who had had a successful placement. Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of age, parity and BMI on the efficacy of LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13; the effect of age and parity on safety outcomes, continuation rates, reasons for discontinuation and user satisfaction; and the effect of parity on the ease and pain of placement. P values for differences in outcomes between the subgroups were calculated using log rank tests and Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. All statistical tests were performed using SAS software.</p><p>As previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the sample size for the study was calculated so that sufficient women were recruited to give, in both treatment groups, a Pearl Index (primary endpoint) with a two-sided 95% CI, such that the difference between the upper limit of the CI and the point estimate (expressed in pregnancies per 100 woman-years) did not exceed 1 for each considered year of treatment. However, it is difficult to evaluate power for <italic>post hoc</italic> subgroup analyses because this would require the determination of what constitutes a relevant difference for each outcome variable under consideration, before performing a power calculation for each of the subgroup analyses. Power analyses for the <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses were therefore not performed.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study protocol and its amendments were approved by the following ethics committees and institutional review boards (IRB):</p><sec id="sec009"><title>Argentina</title><p>Comit&#x000e9; Independiente Etica para Ensayos Farmacologia Clinica "Prof. Dr. Luis Maria Zieher", Buenos Aires; Comit&#x000e9; de &#x000c9;tica Julio Cesar Maiztegui, Santa Fe; Hospital Bernardino Rivadavia Comit&#x000e9; de Bio&#x000e9;tica, Buenos Aires.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Canada</title><p>Biomedical Research Ethics Board, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg; Ethics Review Board, Queens University, Kingston; Office of Research Ethics, University of Western Ontario; Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board, University of Calgary, Calgary.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Chile</title><p>Comit&#x000e9; de Etica Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Norte, Santiago; Servicio de Salud Metropolitano Oriente Comit&#x000e9; Etico Cientifico, Providencia.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Finland</title><p>Ethics Committee of HUS (University Hospital District of Southern Finland), Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>France</title><p>Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes Sud M&#x000e9;diterran&#x000e9;e III, Nimes.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Hungary</title><p>Medical Research Council EC for Clinical Pharmacology, Budapest; Regional Human Medical Research Ethical Committee, University of Szeged; Institutional Ethics Committee, B&#x000e1;cs-Kiskun County Hospital, Kecskem&#x000e9;t; Institutional Research Ethics Committee, Bekes County Hospital &#x0201c;Rethy Pal&#x0201d;, Bekescsaba.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Mexico</title><p>Comit&#x000e9; de Bio&#x000e9;tica de la Facultad de Medicina de Torre&#x000f3;n, Torre&#x000f3;n; Comit&#x000e9; de Etica, Hospital Integral de la Mujer del Estado De Sonora, Hermosillo; Comit&#x000e9; Bio&#x000e9;tico para la Investigaci&#x000f3;n Clinica S.

However, a limitation of the analysis according to BMI was that there were relatively few women (n = 494) in the higher BMI (&#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) subgroup, hence the wide 95% CIs for the first year and 3-year Pearl Indices and cumulative failure rates for this subgroup.</p><p>There is the perception among some healthcare providers that IUC is much more difficult to place in nulliparous women than in women who had already had a child [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, parous women who have had elective Caesarean section deliveries only (and not laboured at all) may be considered to be similar to nulliparous women with regard to the tightness of their cervical canals. Investigators rated the placement of LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 as &#x02018;easy&#x02019; in most women, regardless of parity. However, placement was rated by investigators as &#x02018;easy&#x02019; in a higher percentage of women who had previously had a vaginal delivery (94.5%) compared with those who had had Caesarean section deliveries only (87.7%; it was not known when during the course of pregnancy or labour Caesarean section deliveries were performed) or nulliparous women (84.2%). However, a placement that is rated as &#x02018;easy&#x02019; the investigator is not necessarily considered &#x02018;easy&#x02019; or &#x02018;pain-free&#x02019; by the woman. Investigators rated placement as &#x02018;very difficult&#x02019; in only 2.1% of nulliparous women and 1.4% of women who had had Caesarean section deliveries only.</p><p>In total, 41.8% and 84.5% of nulliparous women reported their pain on placement as no more than &#x02018;mild&#x02019; and no more than &#x02018;moderate&#x02019;, respectively. However, parous women generally reported less placement-related discomfort than their nulliparous counterparts and, among parous women, those who had had a vaginal delivery generally reported less discomfort than those who had had Caesarean section deliveries only: no more than &#x02018;mild&#x02019; pain was reported by 41.8% of nulliparous women, 72.8% of parous women who had had Caesarean section deliveries only, and 81.9% of parous women who had previously had a vaginal delivery.</p><p>The analysis of placement-related pain did not take into account that more nulliparous women received pre-placement local anaesthesia (14.5%) and analgesia (48.6%) compared with the parous subgroups. However, these interventions are readily available and commonly used in routine medical practice [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, the reporting of ease of placement and pain of placement was subjective; investigators may have varied in what they considered an &#x02018;easy&#x02019; placement and women may have varied in what they considered to be &#x02018;mild&#x02019;, &#x02018;moderate&#x02019; or &#x02018;severe&#x02019; pain.</p><p>Placement was performed without cervical dilation in 90.8% of nulliparous women, 93.8% of women who had had Caesarean section deliveries only and 97.6% of women who had previously had a vaginal delivery. In a retrospective study evaluating ease of placement and clinical performance of LNG-IUS 20 (Mirena) in nulligravid women, a similar proportion of nulligravid women (92.3%) underwent placement without cervical dilation [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The incidences of at least partial expulsion, uterine perforation, PID and ectopic pregnancy were low across all age and parity subgroups. Concern exists in the literature regarding an increased risk of expulsion in nulliparous women [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. However, the results from this study reinforce evidence from other studies showing that nulliparous women are at no higher risk of expulsion than parous women [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Younger women are generally considered to be at higher risk of contracting sexually transmitted infections compared with older women and therefore might be expected to have a higher risk of developing PID, particularly in this study, in which condom use was not encouraged. However, no difference in the incidence of PID between the older and younger women was observed.</p><p>The absolute incidence of ectopic pregnancy was low across all age and parity subgroups in both treatment arms. Furthermore, the absolute incidence of ectopic pregnancy for the LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 groups combined (0.13&#x02013;0.22 per 100 woman-years across all age and parity subgroups) was within the reported range for oral contraceptives (absolute incidence: 0.07&#x02013;1.99 per 100 woman-years for combined oral contraceptives; 0.3&#x02013;2.0 per 100 woman-years for progestogen-only pills) [<xref rid="pone.0135309.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>One-year and 3-year completion rates were favourable for both LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 regardless of age or parity, reflecting high levels of satisfaction with study treatment across all subgroups. The 3-year completion rates for LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 also compare favourably with 3-year continuation rates for combined oral contraceptives. The number of women who prematurely discontinued owing to a desire for pregnancy was similar across all age and parity subgroups. Importantly, few women discontinued because of changes in menstrual bleeding patterns, regardless of age or parity. The percentages of women who discontinued because of AEs were favourable in both treatment groups and across all age and parity subgroups. However, in the LNG-IUS 8 group, significantly more nulliparous women than parous women and significantly more women aged 18&#x02013;25 years than women aged 26&#x02013;35 years discontinued because of AEs, whereas no significant difference by parity or age was observed in the LNG-IUS 13 group. The reason for this dose difference is unclear; however, it could be a chance finding between non-randomized parity and age subgroups.</p><p>Overall, these subgroup analyses demonstrate that LNG-IUS 8 and LNG-IUS 13 are highly effective, safe, well tolerated and associated with high levels of user satisfaction and favourable continuation rates, regardless of age or parity. These data refute the misconceptions held by some healthcare providers that IUC is not suitable for younger women or nulliparous women and add to the scientific evidence supporting the more widespread use of IUC among these groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135309.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135309.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135309.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Demographics, Efficacy and Safety.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135309.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135309.s003"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>
