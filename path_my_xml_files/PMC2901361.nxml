The tested intervention consisted of two soft gelatine capsules per day, containing either the dietary supplement (active group) or olive oil (placebo group) for a month. Subjects could also volunteer for two ancillary studies on melatonin and actigraphy. Evaluation criteria included i) perception of the quality of sleep at the end of treatment using the LSEQ questionnaire, ii) sleep efficiency measured by one-week actigraphic movement measurement performed before and during the treatment in a subsample of subjects, iii) night melatonin and 6 sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6S) urine rates in a subsample of subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average of Leeds score was similar in both groups (p = 0.95).

The consequences of this disorder are an impaired quality of life, an increase in medical consultations and in hypnotic drug consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Increase in drug consumption reinforces the risk of work accident and absenteeism, resulting in a decrease in productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. It can also leads to adverse cognitive and psychomotor effects, daytime sleepiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], loss of memory, increased risk of falling in old subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and impaired driving abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Alternative therapeutics would therefore be welcome.</p><p>Melatonin, a hormone produced mostly during the night by the pineal gland, displays the role of an endogenous synchronizer, especially on the sleep-wake cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Melatonin receptors are present at the level of the endogenous circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei.</p><p>The study product is a dietary supplement composed of natural components. It contained a specific ratio of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA, linolenic and linoleic acids), in association with <italic>Humulus lupulus </italic>extract. PUFA were claimed to favor melatonin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The short half-life of melatonin requires the administration of high doses to balance its quick metabolism. Recently, a controlled release melatonin preparation has been shown effective in insomnia in aged patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. <italic>Humulus lupulus </italic>extract has been shown to decrease the hepatic metabolism of drugs which are metabolised by the CYP1A2, a cytochrome that also allows melatonin transformation into its main metabolite: 6 sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This combined action could increase melatonin bioavailability and is likely to reset the endogenous biological clock. Besides, <italic>Humulus lupulus </italic>extract could directly act on sleep by enhancing the melatonin-mediated effects on the sleep-wake cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the dietary supplement on the quality of sleep using the Leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire (LSEQ) in adult subjects with moderate to severe primary insomnia in a prospective double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Overall, 101 patients were enrolled between September 2006 and June 2007.

This is a standardized self-reporting instrument comprising ten 100-mm visual analogue quetions that pertain to four items: i) the ease of getting to sleep (GTS, items 1-3), ii) the quality of sleep (QOS, items 4, 5), iii) awakening from sleep (AFS, items 6, 7) and iv) behaviour following wakefulness (BFW, items 8-10). The LSEQ is a sensitive indicator of subjectively felt changes in sleep latency, and sleep quality. For each question, the subject responds by placing a vertical mark on the line (0-100 mm) to indicate his/her present self-evaluation. The position of the mark indicates the nature and extent of the change, i.e. the middle of the line indicates no change, and the larger the changes the closer to the end of the line (improvement on the left, and impairement on the right). The score has been used in acute and chronic regimens. LSEQ was measured at day 30, and day 46 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Secondary criteria included the LSEQ at day 46 (D46).</p></sec><sec><title>Other measurements</title><p>A daily sleep diary was recorded by the participants to obtain information on total sleep duration, duration of first sleep (i.e. duration of sleep till the first awakening), number and duration of night wakes, number and duration of day sleep. Sleep efficiency (duration of sleep/time spent in bed) was then computed.</p><p>The patients' evolution was rated by the investigator, using the Clinical Global Impression at entry and the Clinical global impression change (from very much better to very much worse) between inclusion, D30 and D46. Safety was measured by recording adverse events.</p><p>Screening characteristics measured only at baseline included medical history,` the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaires, a MINI questionnaire for psychiatric disorders screening, results, the Beck Depression Index 17, sleep characteristics, Epworth Sleepness Scale,), and the morningness-eveningness questionnaire of Horne and Ostberg which evaluates diurnal preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Follow-up included questionnaires on D30, evolution of symptoms and compliance to treatment (number of pills used assessed by pill count/number of study days). A follow-up visit was performed on D46 to assess a potential persisting treatment effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Melatonin sub-study</title><p>The night melatonin and aMT6s urine rates were measured before and at the end of the treatment. Night urines were collected from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM. Total urine volume was measured and a 5 ml-sample was frozen. Melatonin and aMT6s concentrations were determined using radio-immunoassays (RIA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Briefly, melatonin RIA was performed on urine extract using an I125tracer and a rabbit melatonin antibody. The aMT6s RIA assay was performed on diluted urine using an I125tracer and a rabbit melatonin antibody. Results were expressed in nano-gramme (ng) or pico-gramme (pg) per hour for aMT6s and melatonin respectively.

Using a mixed model, we studied the effect of the treatment on these scores considering them as repeated measurements in each subject [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The objective was to compare the mean of each score in the control group to the corresponding mean in the treatment group, taking into account the high correlation between the four scores. For example, an individual with a high QOS would probably have a high BFW too. This correlation should be taken into account to allow statistical inference about the means of theses variables.</p><p>When analysing such repeated measurements or longitudinal data, the mixed model is the method of reference because it models explicitly the correlation between the outcome variables and provides correct statistical inference. Furthermore, this method allows a simultaneous testing of the effects of the treatment on the four dimensions through a single test with an alpha risk of 5% (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The effect of the treatment on sleep efficiency was also assessed using a mixed model.</p><p>The effect on other variables of interest was tested using Student's test for all continuous variables and Fisher's exact test for categorical variable.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Overall, 101 subjects were enrolled and randomly assigned to the active dietary supplement or placebo.

Furthermore, no significant change of melatonin or aMT6S urinary excretion was observed, suggesting that the dietary supplement had no effect on the melatonin metabolism.</p><p>Potential limitations of the study are first the type of placebo used. The placebo capsules contained olive oil. However, it is unlikely that olive oil could have any activity to improve sleep. No bibliographic references with both sleep disorders and olive oil have been found. In their meta-analysis, Mc Call et al. observed a mean diminution of subjective sleep latency of 13 min, a mean diminution of polysomnographic latency of 2.5 min, a mean increase in the total sleep duration of 13 min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These figures are close to those observed in our placebo group: 15 min and 9 min reduction in the subjective sleep latency in actigraphic and diary measurements, an 11.5 and a 17 min increase in the total sleep duration measured by actigraphy and by the sleep diary respectively. This suggests that our placebo group was a true placebo group. It is well known that cognitive and compartmental therapies are effective in mild insomnia. In the present study, patients had a close follow-up, and were asked to record a sleep diary. The type of care and follow-up given during a clinical trial is likely to improve sleep in mild insomnia, and is an extra justification of the need for placebo-controlled trials.</p><p>The LSEQ questionnaire allowed to measure subjective ratings of the drug effects on the quality of sleep, early morning behaviour, and both direction and magnitude of behavioural changes by using a series of 10 cm line analogue scales. Although the questionnaire was first constructed to assess the change after one night, it has been extensively used for assessing drugs. Zisapel and col. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] identified 83 studies that reported the use of the LSEQ for psychopharmacological investigations of drug effects on self-reported aspects of sleeping in studies involving a variety of psychoactive agents in healthy volunteers, depressed and insomnia patients. The authors concluded that the LSEQ is a robust and reliable instrument for psychopharmacological evaluations and can provide consistent and meaningful measures for estimating the effectiveness of sleep modulators and sedative-hypnotic drugs with various drug regimens, from one day to 24 week-treatment durations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Finding mild therapeutic agents to improve sleep and to avoid hypnotic drug consumption would be very useful. Very few studies with adequate methodology have been performed to assess the impact of dietary supplement therapies on sleep improvement. In a meta-analysis including 16 randomised trials and 1093 patients and summarizing evidence of the effect of valerian, sleep was improved in significantly more patients (RR: 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.9), without side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the authors found many methodological problems, publication bias, and considerable variation in valerian doses and preparations, and treatment duration that led them to conclude the need for further studies. Melatonin has also shown clinically meaningful improvements in sleep quality, morning alertness, sleep onset latency and quality of life in primary insomnia patients aged over 55 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A fixed combination of valerian and hops was shown to favourably influence sleep in a similar way as melatonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The present study was adequately sized and well conducted, since there are very few missing data. It included clinical and explanatory endpoints, such as melatonin/aMT6S ratio and actigraphic measurement of sleep parameters. The study targeted middle age (25-65 years) subjects with moderate to severe insomnia, who had never been treated regularly. The age limit was fixed at 25 years, since in younger patients, approximately 10% of patients with primary insomnia may have delayed sleep phase syndrome which is sensitive to melatonin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Our results cannot be extended to other types of population, e.g. elderly patients who might benefit from such supplements. Clinical trials specifically designed for these objectives are warranted.</p><p>Recommendations for prescribing hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia are to advise short period (one week) use of drugs only if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, long-term treatment of insomnia is sometimes needed. Hypnotic drugs currently available remain unsatisfying in many cases, because of their insufficient efficacy and excess of side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The dietary supplement was not found effective in any of the tested outcomes. New and emerging anti-insomnia agents may prove useful in the long-term treatment of chronic insomnia. Further research is needed to establish the benefit of such treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The study was funded by PERSEE MEDICA, the manufacturer of the product.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CC, FNB, BK conceived the study, participated in its design and coordination, drafted and reviewed the manuscript.
