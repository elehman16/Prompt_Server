Because of an increase in mortality due to pneumonia and a decrease in mortality due to stroke in recent years, mortality from pneumonia exceeded that of stroke in 2012, to become the third leading cause of death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Among deaths from pneumonia in the elderly, aspiration pneumonia accounted for about 70%, and it was reported to account for about 90% of such deaths among those aged 90&#x02005;years or older.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Because of these facts, efforts to prevent aspiration pneumonia have arisen in a variety of health-related areas (ie, fields of nursing, dentistry, oral care, rehabilitation, etc). In general, the local approach is often used for rehabilitation of dysphagia, such as with ice massage to the perioral area,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> movement of the tongue and stretching of the neck. In addition, the Pushing exercise<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> to strengthen the glottal closure function and the Shaker exercise<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> for strengthening the suprahyoid muscle group as special exercise therapy have been applied. However, even with these approaches, evidence is lacking on prevention of aspiration pneumonia and improvement in the swallowing function. Because the normal swallowing process is basically performed involuntarily by the pharyngeal phase of the swallowing reflex, it is not easy for exercise therapy to improve this reflex. On the other hand, it was shown that the risk of aspiration was increased by insufficient lung capacity and decreased laryngeal elevation due to poor posture.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, activity of abdominal muscles is important for the cough function, which is an important defense reaction to prevent aspiration.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Unlike an approach to improve the swallowing reflex itself, it is considered that improvement in these factors can be expected through a therapeutic exercise programme using the whole body.</p><p>Whole body movements such as for trunk muscle strengthening and posture improvement can be combined with exercise for lower limb muscle strengthening and improvement in important balance functions for fall prevention. We have developed a new home-based exercise programme (Goen-ni Naran Taiso) for the purpose of preventing falls and aspiration pneumonia, as part of the Nara Prefecture Healthy Long Life Joint Venture.</p><p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of implementation, on a regular basis, of &#x02018;Goen-ni-Naran-Taiso&#x02019; on the balance and swallowing functions of frail community-dwelling elderly women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in this study were 266 community-dwelling elderly women whose condition corresponded to the definition of &#x02018;frail elderly&#x02019; in the &#x02018;Kihon checklist&#x02019;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In Japan, because of the extension of a healthy life expectancy, a number of home-based exercise programmes have been developed.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Many of these are focused only on the improvement of motor function, such as lower extremity muscle strength or whole body balance. On the other hand, oral exercises aimed at improvement in swallowing function, such as oral diadochokinesis,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> do not contain elements of a whole-body exercise programme that combines oral movement and whole body motion. In addition, since the effects of general oral exercises have not been demonstrated using objective measures, their effectiveness has not been clarified. The home-based exercise programme used in this study is comprised of general oral exercise and neck and thorax stretching, breathing exercise, balance exercise and whole body movements such as those to strengthen the lower extremities and trunk muscles.</p><p>Results showed significant improvement in VPCF in the intervention group. We believe that the reason for this result is the combined effect of trunk rotation movement with the aim of strengthening many breath movements (Pushing exercise and Tai-chi component) and the abdominal oblique muscle in this programme. A previous study indicated the necessity of at least 240&#x02113;/min or more voluntary cough force for sufficient expectoration.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Among the 39 participants who had VPCF values below the reference value at baseline, 11 participants had VPCF values above the reference value after the intervention. This indicated the possible therapeutic value of exercise in reducing pneumonia risk. There was no significant change before and after the intervention in the LCF, which reflects the swallowing function. The reason might have been that none of the study participants had a lower value than the reference LCF at baseline so an effect of the intervention was not shown explicitly. Improvements in walking speed, TUG-T, knee extension strength and CS-30, reflect the dynamic balance function and improvements in lower limb muscle strength. Therefore, the programme was effective in improving whole body motor function. The dynamic balance function plays an important role in fall prevention and its improvement possibly contributed to the reduction in the incidence of falls in the intervention group.</p><p>In the intervention period of 6&#x02005;months, adherence to the exercise programme was high: 93.2% of participants performed the exercise at least twice a week. The reason for this could be supported by the fact that participants in the intervention group were provided with the original exercise DVD and a leaflet describing the exercise programme, free of charge, and they could easily perform the exercise at home and without supervision. In addition, each exercise item in the DVD was accompanied by music to match the respective motion. Also, so that the participant could perform only parts of the programme at a given time, the leaflet was divided into chapters. We believe that these support materials affected adherence to the programme.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>This study had several limitations. First, this study design was not a randomised controlled trial. The introduction of the home-based exercise programme in this study was not designed for a clinical study, since it was proposed to municipalities as a support programme for community-dwelling elderly people, which may result in a selection bias. In addition, since the participants in the present study were women who were independent in the activities of daily living, generalisation of the study results to apply to elderly men is limited. Second, although VPCF and LCF were principal outcomes of this study, they were surrogate end points that indirectly indicated the swallowing and cough function. In order to directly investigate changes in the swallowing function, it would be necessary to consider the introduction of video endoscopic examinations of swallowing and a simple repetitive saliva swallowing test.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> To reach the final goal of this research for a reduction in the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, there is a need for a long-term survey of the participants in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, comparisons in physical functioning were made between a control group that underwent no specific exercise programme and an intervention group that was asked to undertake a 5&#x02005;min home-based exercise regimen three times weekly for 6&#x02005;months. Participants were community-dwelling frail older women. We developed this programme to prevent falls and aspiration pneumonia. Results showed that cough force, balance function and lower limb muscle strength were improved in the intervention group, indicating the efficacy of this simple regimen for preventing falls and aspiration pneumonia. That it can be performed rapidly and at home is an advantage to this ageing population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Ichiro Takeda, Tatsuya Noda and Misuzu Matsuzaki, for promoting the study and for their help with participant recruitment.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KT conceived of the study.
