The prevalence is even higher within special populations for example, some minority groups or the elderly.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Although the annual increases observed over the previous two decades may be leveling off,<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> diabetes and its downstream consequences remain a serious and costly public health problem. Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are a frequent and serious complication of diabetes mellitus with an annual incidence rate of 1%&#x02013;4% and a lifetime risk of 15%&#x02013;25%.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref></sup> DFU are often difficult to heal, and may become chronic, substantially increasing the risk that they become infected leading to hospital admissions and, too frequently, lower limb amputations.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>The goal of DFU management is to promote rapid and complete reepithelialization to minimize the risk of ulcer complications and to restore the patient's quality of life to a &#x0201c;pre-ulcer&#x0201d; status. Successful management of DFU must address several deficits inherent to these ulcers. These factors may include any or all of the following: poor blood glucose control, necrotic tissue, infection, poor or no off-loading, chronic inflammation, and inadequate perfusion. Many ulcers fail to make progress toward healing despite the best efforts made to address these contributing problems. Good standard care (SC), that is, debridement of necrotic tissue, infection control, off-loading, and maintenance of a moist wound environment has been reported to result in the healing of about one-fourth to one-half of DFU by 20 weeks.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Some gains have been made through the use of approaches such as &#x0201c;living skin equivalents&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;dermal substitutes,&#x0201d; for example, Marston;<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> however, the cost of these therapies can be a barrier to widespread use and the incremental benefit above SC have generally been modest. Clearly, an alternative method of ulcer management that leads to superior outcomes and at a reasonable cost would be highly desirable.</p><p>One such alternative is tri-layer porcine small intestine submucosa (SIS) (OASIS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Ultra; Cook Biotech, Inc., West Lafayette, IN; exclusively marketed by Smith and Nephew, Inc., Fort Worth, TX). SIS is a three-dimensional biomaterial &#x0223c;0.30&#x02009;mm thick consisting of a biocompatible, acellular, collagen-based (predominantly types I, III, and V) extracellular matrix (ECM). The material possesses several advantages including relative low cost, long shelf life, storage at room temperature, low risk of immunological reaction, and the retention of the natural ECM architecture.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Single-layer porcine SIS has been successfully used for the management of many types of cutaneous wounds including venous/arterial ulcers and DFU.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A reasonable hypothesis for the efficacy of the product is that the three-dimensional natural architecture provides an appropriate environment for infiltrating cells,<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> however, it is also likely that the SIS composition, including collagen, proteoglycans, and glycoproteins, closely mimics normal skin ECM function.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>Tri-layer SIS has not been previously evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that superior outcomes are possible when DFU are managed with tri-layer SIS. The results presented below provide support for this objective.</p></sec><sec id="s002"><title>Clinical Problem Addressed</title><p>DFU pose several challenges for the practitioner. Contributing factors will very likely remain ongoing as various therapies are employed in the effort to heal. It is critically important for the well-being of the patient not only to heal these ulcers, but to heal them rapidly to avoid the pernicious sequelae of amputation and, in some cases, death. This trial demonstrates that management of these ulcers with SIS can provide outcomes significantly better than obtained with usual SC in terms of both closure and time to closure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s003"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s004"><title>Study participants</title><p>Eligible patients were 18 years or older with a diagnosis of type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus requiring medications to control blood glucose levels.

The study was carried out at 11 sites in California, Indiana, Louisiana, Texas, and Virginia. The study was conducted between May 2013 and July 2014. Randomization to treatment was centralized using a computer-generated sequence with treatment assignment made by the electronic data capture system at the randomization visit. Subjects were thus randomized to treatment in the order they qualified across all study sites. Randomization was stratified by wound size (0.5&#x02013;2.0&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>, and &#x0003e;2.0&#x02009;cm<sup>2</sup>) to prevent dissimilar ulcer size distributions between the two treatment groups.

Basic demographic information included self-reported race, ethnicity, and gender. Eligible patients reported for the baseline/randomization visit from 1 to 8 days later. Ulcers were surgically debrided and callus was removed as appropriate followed by baseline wound area measurement. All patients were provided with an offloading device (Darco, Huntington, WV) that they were required to wear. Patients were then randomly assigned to treatment in an equal allocation ratio to either the SIS group or to the control group.</p><p>Patients returned weekly for 12 weeks for ulcer assessment/measurement, recording of any adverse events (AE) that may have occurred, debridement (for SC patients only, sharp debridement was not allowed in the SIS group), and application of SIS or the assigned SC. At the end of 12 weeks, or at any other visit for a patient achieving closure, patients entered a follow-up period returning after an additional 4 weeks. For ulcers not closed during the treatment period, there were no restrictions on permissible ulcer treatments. The follow-up period was designed to assess durability of closures achieved during the treatment period, record additional closures, and to follow any ongoing AE.</p><p>SIS was applied once each week to ulcers following cleansing with sterile saline. The matrix was cut so that there was an approximate 1/8 inch overlap on the wound edge, secured with adhesive tape (Steri-Strips&#x02122;), moistened with saline, and covered with a non-adherent dressing (Mepitel&#x02122;), a foam dressing (Allevyn&#x02122;), and maintained in place with a self-adherent wrap bandage (Coban&#x02122;).

Ulcer closure was defined as 100% reepithelialization, no drainage, and no need for a dressing. Neuropathy was confirmed at screening by subject inability to perceive 10&#x02009;g pressure using a nylon monofilament on five plantar areas of the foot: great toe, the first, third, and fifth metatarsal heads, and the fourth digit. A subject's foot was considered neuropathic if at least three of the tested areas had no sensation. Adequate perfusion to the affected foot was confirmed by ankle/brachial index &#x0003e;0.7, or alternatively, a transcutaneous oxygen pressure &#x0003e;40&#x02009;mm Hg, a great toe pressure of &#x0003e;40&#x02009;mm Hg, or a Doppler waveform consistent with adequate blood flow.</p><p>Safety was assessed through analysis of AE, both volunteered and elicited.

Hypothesis testing was performed at the 5% significance level. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population, defined as all of the randomized subjects, was used for primary inference. Proportion of subjects with complete ulcer closure over the 12-week treatment period was evaluated using the non-parametric Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test with adjustment for site. The primary endpoint was also analyzed for the per protocol (PP) population and for race, age, and gender subgroups; results for PP and these subgroups were found to be similar to the ITT results presented below.</p><p>Time in days to complete ulcer closure over the treatment period was analyzed using the Cox regression/proportional hazards model. Treatment was included as the main predictor, whereas subject baseline wound size and duration were included as covariates. Percent change in ulcer area from baseline for each visit was compared for between-group differences using a two-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The ANCOVA model included treatment group, pooled site, and baseline ulcer size as covariates. The CMH test was used to examine treatment effects on the proportion of subjects with complete ulcer closure at each visit and to evaluate durability of closure/additional new closures recorded at the 16-week follow-up visit (4 weeks post-treatment).</p><p>The overall treatment effect on proportion of ulcers closed over the entire 12 weeks and the interaction of treatment by week was evaluated using the general estimation equation model.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Missing data due to either missed visits or because of ulcer closure or exit from the study before week 12 were imputed by the method of last observation carried forward.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s011"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 82 patients provided informed consent and were randomized to treatment; 41 in each treatment group.

ECM proteins also bind and sequester growth factors, functioning as a depot.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Given the importance of the ECM it is not surprising that non-healing diabetic ulcers have a generally aberrant ECM in which the component proteins have been modified by glycation, oxidation, and proteolytic attack from endogenous matrix metalloproteinases.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> There is also a deficit in the formation of new ECM in DFU due to both diminished synthesis and an increased rate of removal resulting from the highly proteolytic environment.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>It is an accepted tenet that for a wound to close inflammation must subside and healthy granulation tissue must be formed.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> It may be that application of an ECM material such as SIS helps to address this imbalance between formation and destruction of ECM in the wound bed. SIS may tip the balance away from the proinflammatory, proteolytic <italic>status quo</italic> of the chronic wound to an environment more supportive of vascular ingrowth and, ultimately, epithelium formation. The clinical data of this study are consistent with this hypothesis. As early as 1 week following randomization, there was a significant difference in the percent reduction in ulcer area for the ulcers managed with SIS and those managed with SC (33% vs. 13%, <italic>p</italic>=0.017) while closure was first achieved for three ulcers at week 3, all in the &#x0201c;SIS managed&#x0201d; group. Indeed, the group managed with SIS had consistently better outcomes throughout the study in terms of proportion closed, reduction in size, and time to closure. The populations randomized to either SIS or to SC were not found to significantly differ in any of the baseline demographic or ulcer characteristics measured. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to conclude that it was the different management methods employed that led to these disparate outcomes. This is not to say that wounds managed with passive SC methods primarily aimed at maintenance of a moist wound environment will not close; in fact 32% did achieve closure by week 12 and although this percentage was unchanged at week 16, given sufficient time additional closures may have occurred. The important point is that as long as a DFU remains open, it is at risk of becoming infected and the patient is at risk of complications that may be as serious as loss of a limb and even death. Patients whose DFU were managed with SIS were, on average, more rapidly closed, and more likely to close than their counterparts managed with SC.</p><p>A limitation of this study is the unblinded design. This was chosen intentionally to allow clinically relevant SC in the control group. Treatment allocation bias was controlled through randomization and bias in outcomes through the use of objective endpoints (<italic>e.g.</italic>, closure) or measurements made with a digital wound measurement device (ARANZ Medical). Post-treatment follow-up was limited to 4 weeks, which may not be of sufficient length to fairly evaluate durability of closure. However, this, in our view, affects both groups equally. The authors are unaware of any biological differences in reepithelialization attributable to the management regimen and therefore do not feel that the short follow-up provides an advantage to either treatment group. The diversity of SC therapies allowed in the control group could be considered a weakness; however, the fact is that there is not a single accepted SC treatment consistently employed even among those considered expert in the wound-healing field. Allowing the study Investigators to choose the SC they believed to be most appropriate was, in our view, the most relevant and &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; control group possible.</p><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Key Findings</label><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;More DFU were closed with tri-layer SIS than with SC chosen by the Investigators.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;Of the ulcers that closed, the median time to closure was 2 weeks earlier for ulcers managed with tri-layer SIS.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02022;&#x02002;The chance of DFU closure was two times greater when tri-layer SIS was applied compared to SC.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><p>This study provides Level I evidence<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> regarding the outcomes that can be achieved in the management of DFU with tri-layer SIS, outcomes found to be significantly better than those associated with investigator-selected SC.
