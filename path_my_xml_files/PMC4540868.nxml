strengthening exercises combined with motor imagery training and those of ankle
strengthening exercises alone in stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty stroke
patients were randomly assigned to one of the following two groups: experimental group (15
patients) and control group (15 patients). The experimental group underwent motor imagery
training for 15 minutes and ankle joint strengthening exercises for 15 minutes, while the
control group underwent only ankle joint strengthening exercises for 30 minutes. Each
session and training program was implemented four times a week for 4 weeks. The timed up
and go (TUG) test score, affected-side weight bearing ratio, and affected-side front/rear
weight bearing ratio were assessed. [Results] Both groups demonstrated improvement on the
TUG test, and in the affected-side weight bearing ratios, affected-side front/rear weight
bearing ratios, and balance errors. The experimental group demonstrated greater
improvement than the control group in all variables. [Conclusion] Motor imagery training
is an effective treatment method for improving static balance ability in stroke
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Motor imagery training</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients present with motor disturbances, impaired cognition, and a speech
impediment. Approximately, 74% of stroke patients are not independent in daily activities;
50% experience sustained hemiplegia symptoms; and 30% are unable to walk without aid<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients have a right-left imbalance and an asymmetric posture due to decreased
mobility. The center of mass in these patients shifts toward the affected lower extremity,
which worsens balance ability and has a negative impact on balance control in the standing
position as well<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Moreover, the foot center of pressure has a noticeable front and lateral tendency during
balance control in static conditions. A compensatory ankle strategy is used to maintain
balance such that the ground reaction force acts largely on the non-paralyzed foot; this
along with diminishing muscle strength on the paralyzed side lead to an asymmetric posture.
Limitations in ankle movement are explained by the lack of weight-supporting ability due to
the muscle control disorder in the paralyzed lower limb<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. This results in changes in muscle recruitment and delayed
contraction of paralyzed muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ankle joint is important for the balancing strategy of the body. During walking, the
ankle joint absorbs the impact of the ground reaction force, supports body weight, and
propels the lower limb<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to Lin, in hemiplegic patients, the plantar pressure on the affected side
increased laterally and decreased in the front and back; the walking velocity and step
length tended to increase following enhanced mobility of the ankle<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance control ability is important in stroke rehabilitation as it enables independent
participation in the program and predicts recovery<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therapeutic interventions such as feedback training using a force plate and rhythmic
auditory stimulation training are diverse methods, which enhance balance ability in stroke
patients. However, these methods have time and space limitations and also require many
therapists. Several new interventions using imagery training have been introduced to address
these issues<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Motor imagery training is a cognitive process which refers to the mental performance of a
specific movement without any kind of muscular activity; it accelerates exercise function
learning using information processing activities that are similar to the task to be
performed<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study investigated the effects of ankle strengthening exercises combined with motor
imagery training on balance ability in stroke patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>This study included 30 hemiplegic stroke patients who were hospitalized in Hospital B

The final number of subjects included in the study was 26; they were
assigned to the experimental group (n=13) and control group (n=13). The research period
was from July 2014 to August 2014. Prior to the therapeutic intervention, data were
collected on the clinical characteristics of the subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The ankle strengthening exercise program used in this study was a modified version of the
original program for elderly patients, and it was tailored to the functional abilities of
hemiplegic patients<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. A balancing pad
(Balance pad, Airex, Swiss) was used for 2 weeks, and this was followed by application of
a balancing board (Dynair allkissen, Togu, Germany) for the next 2 weeks. The exercises
were performed with the assistance of a therapist and considering the difficulty level of
the training as well as the patient&#x02019;s safety awareness. Motor imagery training was
performed in the room for improving concentration on the task. The patient was comfortably
seated in a chair with armrests and a back support, with eyes closed to decrease stress
and anxiety<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor imagery training
was performed for 15 minutes. During the training, the subject imagined feeling the
sensation of the ankle joint, knee joint, hip joint, and their surrounding muscles moving
and maintaining balance during this movement.</p><p>To assess the patient&#x02019;s pre- and post-intervention balance ability, the timed up and go
(TUG) test score<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, weight bearing
ratio and front/rear weight bearing ratio were assessed. The weight distribution on both
soles in the standing position was assessed using the Gaitview System (AFA-50, Alfoots
Inc., Korea), which is equipped with a 0.15-cm-thick, 2,304 (48&#x000d7;48) pressure sensor. The
subject was verbally instructed to maintain an erect posture, and the weight bearing ratio
from the pressure on both lower limbs was measured for 10 sec. The ratio was measured
three times, and the average of the three measurements was used<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The experimental group underwent ankle strengthening
exercises and motor imagery training times a week for weeks. The control group underwent
ankle strengthening exercises times a week for weeks. Two patients from the experimental
group were excluded; the final number of participants included in this group was 13. An
independent t-test was used for analysis of data between the groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Both groups showed improvement on the TUG test and in the weight bearing ratio and

imagery training on balance ability was assessed in hemiplegic stroke patients.</p><p>The TUG test score was significantly decreased after the exercises in both groups, and the
difference between the groups was not significant.</p><p>A study by Saito<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that motor
imagery training could improve balance ability in the sitting position, and Lee<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported significant improvement in
walking velocity following motor imagery training of the paralyzed side.</p><p>Another previous study reported significant improvement in walking velocity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, but in this study, there are any
significant difference between groups in the TUG. Since the subjects in this study were
chronic hemiplegic patients, the treatment was less effective in terms of balance
improvement.</p><p>It is relevant to the fact that in order to maintain balancing ability and body stability,
the ankle usually acts in case of small disturbance which results in a faster walking
velocity and a shorter TUG time<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Nyberg and Gustafson<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that due
to the asymmetric weight support on the left and right sides among hemiplegic patients,
excess energy is required for overall body movement and walking. Decreased weight support on
the paralyzed side increases the frequency of falls in patients. Hence, they argued that it
was important for both lower limbs to have the same weight-support ratio. Their study
suggested that this could be achieved in the standing position or during walking by
increasing the ratio of weight support on the paralyzed lower limb. In this study, we
calculated the weight bearing ratio and the front/rear weight bearing ratio in the standing
position. According to the study results, the weight bearing ratio increased significantly
and the front/rear weight bearing ratio of the affected side decreased significantly in the
experimental group. The results of this study were consistent with those of a previous
study, which reported that prior practice through motor imagery for changing movement has
sustained effects in improving balance and posture control ability in the standing
position<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, ankle strengthening exercises combined with motor imagery training improved
the weight-bearing ratio and the front/rear weight bearing ratio in hemiplegic patients.</p><p>In a previous brain imagery study, similar responses showed in premotor, parietal lobe,
basal ganglia and cerebellum after motor imagery training, which compared to actual
movement<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Motor imagery training
build a nerve network, therefor motor images enhance dynamic balancing ability by
facilitation the proprioceptive sense, kinesthesia and coordination capability<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Based on previous literature,
strengthening exercises had an impact on balance ability, as the activation of cerebrum and
cerebellum during motor imagery training affects the proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular
senses, which affect balance ability, especially in terms of detection of movement and joint
position.</p><p>This study has limitations that should be considered; generalization of our study results
is difficult due to the small sample size and except for the training time. Future
systematic and continuous studies on the effects of motor imagery training on balance
ability in hemiplegic stroke patients are needed.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lloyd-Jones</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Brown</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>WRITING GROUP MEMBERSAmerican Heart Association Statistics Committee and
