Attempts to identify molecular biomarkers predicting response have met with mixed success. This may be attributable, in part, to the variable and subjective disease assessment endpoints with large placebo effects typically used to classify patient response. Sixty-one patients with active RA despite methotrexate treatment, and with MRI-documented synovitis, were randomized to receive infliximab or placebo. Blood was collected at baseline and genome-wide transcription in whole blood was measured using microarrays. The primary endpoint in this study was determined by measuring the transfer rate constant (K<sub>trans</sub>) of a gadolinium-based contrast agent from plasma to synovium using MRI. Secondary endpoints included repeated clinical assessments with DAS28(CRP), and assessments of osteitis and synovitis by the RAMRIS method. Infliximab showed greater decrease from baseline in DCE-MRI K<sub>trans</sub> of wrist and MCP at all visits compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Statistical analysis was performed to identify genes associated with treatment-specific 14-week change in K<sub>trans</sub>. The 256 genes identified were used to derive a gene signature score by averaging their log expression within each patient. The resulting score correlated with improvement of K<sub>trans</sub> in infliximab-treated patients and with deterioration of K<sub>trans</sub> in placebo-treated subjects. Poor responders showed high expression of activated B-cell genes whereas good responders exhibited a gene expression pattern consistent with mobilization of neutrophils and monocytes and high levels of reticulated platelets. This gene signature was significantly associated with clinical response in two previously published whole blood gene expression studies using anti-TNF therapies. These data provide support for the hypothesis that anti-TNF inadequate responders comprise a distinct molecular subtype of RA characterized by differences in pre-treatment blood mRNA expression. They also highlight the importance of placebo controls and robust, objective endpoints in biomarker discovery.</p><p>

Variability in response is incompletely understood. It has been linked to smoking status, concomitant treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and other DMARDs, disease severity, and patient disability <xref rid="pone.0113937-Hyrich1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Hypothesizing that inadequate responders constitute a distinct molecular subtype, several blood gene expression studies have been undertaken to identify gene expression-based biomarkers predicting response to anti-TNF <xref rid="pone.0113937-Bienkowska1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113937-vanBaarsen1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Such gene signatures consist of characteristic patterns of mRNA expression distinguishing responders and non-responders. A recent study attempted to replicate the reported association of eight pre-specified signatures with response status and reported that a single signature was validated with modest predictive value <xref rid="pone.0113937-Toonen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The generally poor validation of published signatures is perhaps not surprising since the signatures tested were not derived from consistent patient populations or blood cell fractions. In addition, in these studies response was assessed using composite disease activity scores like the DAS28 or American College of Rheumatology (ACR) response criteria. Since these endpoints are known to be subject to large placebo effects <xref rid="pone.0113937-Strand1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, inclusion of appropriate placebo controls may be particularly crucial for successful biomarker discovery. Unfortunately none of these studies included a placebo control, confounding true responders and patients with flaring disease that subsequently subsides in a treatment-independent manner.</p><p>Given the limitations of the DAS28 and similar measures, biomarker discovery using objective disease assessments, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is attractive. Uniquely, MRI is able to evaluate the inflammation of synovium and bone, which are thought to ultimately result in articular cartilage loss and bone erosion, respectively. It is most frequently monitored using the RAMRIS method <xref rid="pone.0113937-Ostergaard1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a semi-quantitative scoring system where bone erosion, osteitis, and synovitis are evaluated by MRI. Dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI), is an alternative quantitative method to measure synovitis by administering gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCA) intravenously and collecting sequential images of the joint in a time course <xref rid="pone.0113937-Workie1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The enhancement curve generated by DCE-MRI can be used to estimate physiological parameters, such as K<sub>trans</sub>, the volume transfer constant of GBCA between blood plasma and the synovium. This endpoint is related to capillary permeability and vascularity in the synovium, and correlates strongly with histological measures of inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113937-Hodgson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Both RAMRIS and DCE-MRI are valid measures for detecting treatment effect, but they are not interchangeable and may reflect somewhat different biological processes related to joint inflammation.</p><p>In the present study, we measured pre-treatment gene expression in whole blood and employed DCE-MRI of the wrist to monitor disease progression in a randomized, controlled, multi-site trial of infliximab plus MTX versus placebo plus MTX. Analysis of these data identified a 256 gene signature associated with disease activity measured by K<sub>trans</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>This analysis was conducted as part of a 14-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, methodology study (Study Protocol PO8136, ClinicalTrials.gov registration: NCT01313520) conducted from April 6, 2011 to March 29, 2012 in 4 clinical centers in Europe.

The mean change from baseline to a given time point was estimated and tested from this model. A log transformation of the DCE-MRI parameters was performed to better meet the assumption of normality that is necessary for the cLDA. For RAMRIS, the average of the two readers' scores was used (except in one case for which scores from only one reader were available), and statistical significance was determined using non-parametric van Elteren and Wilcoxon rank sum tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>RNA extraction and microarray data generation</title><p>RNA was isolated from PAXgene blood samples (2.5ml) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated total RNA samples were assayed for quality (Agilent Bioanalyzer) and yield (Ribogreen) metrics prior to amplification. Fifty-nine samples passing quality control (QC) were then amplified using the NuGEN Ovation WB protocol and hybridized to Rosetta/Merck Human RSTA Custom Affymetrix 2.0 microarrays. Microarray data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus archive (GEO accession GSE58795).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Microarray QC and normalization</title><p>QC analysis was performed in the absence of treatment allocation information. QC metrics, including average background signal, scale factor, beta-actin and GAPDH 3' to 5' ratios, and the number of genes called 'present' using the MAS5 algorithm, were examined to assess potential technical quality issues related to amplification and RNA degradation. No problematic samples were identified. Array probe intensity normalization was performed using the RMA algorithm in R/Bioconductor. Gene expression patterns and their principal components of variation were checked against the principal components of sample quality and process parameters (QC). The first two QC principal components were observed to correlate significantly with several principal components of variation in the expression data. Therefore, prior to further analysis, the RMA-normalized expression data was detrended by regressing the log2 intensity of each probe set against the first two QC principal components.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Gene Expression analysis</title><p>Detectably expressed probe sets were defined as those with a MAS5 &#x02018;present&#x02019; call in at least 25% of all samples. Log expression values of probe sets mapping to the same gene were averaged. Signature scores were used to summarize the expression of the genes comprising pre-specified signatures and were calculated by averaging the log expression intensity values for each gene within a subject. Since signatures may comprise genes both correlated and anti-correlated with treatment response, the mean log expression values for anti-correlated genes was multiplied by -1 to preserve the effect of directionality.</p><p>To identify genes whose baseline expression correlated with treatment effect, we modeled the 14-week change in each disease activity endpoint as a function of treatment and gene expression at baseline. For each detectably expressed gene, we performed ordinary least squares regression with terms for log expression intensity, treatment allocation, their interaction, and baseline disease activity. Q-Q plots of interaction term p-values vs. the uniform distribution were generated for DAS28, RAMRIS osteitis, RAMRIS synovitis, and K<sub>trans</sub> to identify deviation from random expectation. For K<sub>trans</sub>, we defined a 256 gene signature associated with 14-week treatment response by identifying genes with a nominally significant gene expression by treatment interaction term (p&#x0003c;0.01). The Pearson correlation matrix for all 256 genes in the predictive signature was calculated and used to cluster the genes into four groups. Details on clustering are provided in the supplemental methods.</p><p>The value of gene expression for predicting 14-week change in disease activity was assessed using a random subsampling strategy. In each round of sampling a training set of 40 subjects was randomly selected, and genes with a significant (p&#x0003c;0.01) expression by treatment interaction term were identified in this training set. Expression of these genes was averaged into a score for each subject. Using only the subjects in the training set, we then fit two linear models of disease activity: the first included terms for baseline disease activity, treatment, signature score, and signature score by treatment interaction, the second included only terms for treatment and baseline disease activity. Each of these models was then used to predict 14-week change in disease activity for the held-out test subjects, and the resulting mean squared prediction errors over ten rounds of sampling were compared.</p><p>To evaluate the statistical association between signature score and other disease activity endpoints, we fit a linear model of change from baseline data including terms for baseline disease activity, treatment allocation, signature score and the signature by treatment interaction, and examined the effect size and p-value associated with the gene signature main effect and interaction term.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty-one adults with moderate to severe RA were enrolled into the study.

Additionally, RA patients have a fluctuating disease course, and enrollment of patients at the apogee of disease activity may account for up to a third of the total DAS28 improvement in response to TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0113937-Greenwood1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, no prior anti-TNF biomarker study has examined blood mRNA from placebo-treated patients, potentially confounding treatment-dependent and independent disease improvement. Indeed, the single signature reported to be validated by Toonen et al. <xref rid="pone.0113937-Toonen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>
<xref rid="pone.0113937-Okada1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>showed the highest correlation with baseline DAS28 of any signature examined in this study (R<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.137, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004) suggesting that its reported correlation with response may be explained, in part, by enriching for patients with flaring disease. More objective measures of RA disease activity and progression could aid in the identification of predictive biomarkers <xref rid="pone.0113937-American1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113937-Peterfy1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, and objective measures of joint inflammation are expected to associate more robustly with molecular predictors of response to a TNF blocker like infliximab.</p><p>In this study, we propose a path forward by profiling gene expression in both placebo and treatment arms and by employing a sensitive, quantitative, and objective DCE-MRI endpoint: K<sub>trans</sub> of synovium in the wrist. In contrast to the standard clinical endpoint DAS28, DCE-MRI showed no improvement with placebo. Using DCE-MRI we derived a pre-treatment whole blood gene expression signature correlating with change in the imaging biomarker K<sub>trans</sub>. The signature was associated with K<sub>trans</sub> improvement in infliximab-treated patients but with worsening K<sub>trans</sub> in the placebo arm. A similar association was seen with K<sub>trans</sub> summed from the metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand in each treatment arm.</p><p>We observed no correlation between the gene expression signature and 14-week change in RAMRIS synovitis or osteitis. This observation is potentially unexpected, because RAMRIS synovitis scores and K<sub>trans</sub> both represent gadolinium contrast transfer to synovium, and both have been validated as inflammation biomarkers through clinical association with joint swelling and with inflammatory pathology on biopsy <xref rid="pone.0113937-American2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, histological inflammation of cellular infiltration has in several studies been more strongly associated with dynamic measures of gadolinium transfer (e.g. K<sub>trans</sub> and the rate of early enhancement) as opposed to static images obtained at the peak of contrast enhancement used for RAMRIS methodology <xref rid="pone.0113937-Ostergaard1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113937-Axelsen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Further, several studies have suggested that DCE-MRI is a more sensitive biomarker of joint inflammation than RAMRIS, demonstrating better correlation with clinical and laboratory markers of active disease and response to treatment <xref rid="pone.0113937-Hodgson2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113937-Orguc1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Although RAMRIS and DCE-MRI correlate and are valid measures for detecting treatment change, they are not interchangeable and the more direct link between dynamic MRI and the pathophysiology of vascularity and joint inflammation may make it more suitable for the identification of blood gene expression markers of treatment response.</p><p>Interestingly, evaluation of the effect of 1 month of infliximab treatment on the genes in the signature revealed evidence of infliximab-induced gene expression changes for many genes. In particular, genes whose expression correlated with K<sub>trans</sub> improvement after infliximab treatment were highly enriched for genes reported to be down-regulated by treatment. This observation provides confidence that the genes in our predictive signature are related to the biology of anti-TNF treatment in rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Unfortunately, prior gene expression studies have not employed DCI-MRI as an endpoint. DCE-MRI is infrequently used in studies of RA patients, and so independent validation of our signature and K<sub>trans</sub> response in other patients will need to await the availability of other datasets. However, in both studies we examined EULAR responders had significantly higher signature scores than non-responders, consistent with expectation. Although the higher signature score observed in EULAR responders is interesting, the poor discrimination achieved using the signature to distinguish responders and non-responders indicates it would be of limited use in clinical practice. Nevertheless, to the extent that the signature genuinely defines molecular subtypes in RA it could serve as an interesting endpoint in future biomarker or genetic studies of the disease. One potentially interesting avenue would be to examine the association of genetic variants with gene signature score to identify genetic drivers of the putative patient subtypes reported here. In addition, by combining all genes into a single score representing an average log expression level, we have ignored the possibility that individual genes identified in this study may have greater predictive value than others. It would be interesting to explore predictive modeling approaches that take this into account.</p><p>Unsupervised clustering of the genes making up the predictive signature described here suggests that they broadly reflect three sources: 1) myeloid lineage cells 2) B-cells, and 3) reticulated platelets. High expression of myeloid cell markers and low expression of genes down-regulated by recombinant G-CSF in peripheral blood is associated with response to infliximab in RA. Although <italic>in vitro</italic> TNF inhibits hematopoiesis, chronic inflammation in RA can be associated with monocytosis and granulocytosis <xref rid="pone.0113937-Coulthard1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0113937-Oduro1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, and TNF induces production of pro-myelopoietic factors like G-CSF <xref rid="pone.0113937-Leizer1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> and GM-CSF <xref rid="pone.0113937-Kaushansky1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. High expression of platelet and platelet activation markers also correlates with good infliximab response. Whole blood mRNA profiling can detect transcripts from reticulated platelets whose level in blood is indicative of the level of thrombopoiesis and platelet turnover. Platelets have a well-characterized role in RA pathogenesis by promoting vascular permeability in the inflamed joint, releasing prostaglandins, and shedding IL1-containing vesicles that promote inflammation <xref rid="pone.0113937-Boilard1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. TNF impacts platelet function by enhancing their activation <xref rid="pone.0113937-Pignatelli1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> and promoting megakaryocytopoiesis <xref rid="pone.0113937-Dan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Further, TNF has been demonstrated to shorten platelet life <xref rid="pone.0113937-Meany1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0113937-TacchiniCottier1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Finally, high expression of B-cell and plasma cell markers correlates with poor response to infliximab. Interestingly, TNF is reported to mediate loss of B-cell lymphopoiesis <xref rid="pone.0113937-Ueda1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. It is also notable that one report has suggested that RA patients who fail on a TNF blocker show better response to the B-cell depletion therapy Rituximab than to a second anti-TNF <xref rid="pone.0113937-Kekow1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that infliximab responders have higher levels of inflammatory processes driven by TNF than non-responders. In this model, anti-TNF responders may show increased induction of pro-myelopoietic factors which mobilize granulocytes and monocytes from the bone marrow, and collaborate with TNF to inhibit B-cell lymphopoiesis and increase megakaryocytopoiesis, platelet turnover, and hence the fraction of reticulated platelets in whole blood. These effects would be reflected in the myeloid, B-cell, and platelet components of the baseline whole blood gene expression signature we report here.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides evidence that a whole blood gene expression signature correlates with response to infliximab as assessed by DCE-MRI. High signature score associated with improvement in infliximab-treated patients but not in placebo-treated patients, however the ability of the signature to stratify EULAR responders and non-responders was poor. Additional studies should attempt to validate this finding and explore the molecular underpinnings of the gene signature and its relationship to anti-TNF response, in particular the hypothesis that anti-TNF inadequate responders comprise a distinct molecular subtype in RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0113937.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><p>
