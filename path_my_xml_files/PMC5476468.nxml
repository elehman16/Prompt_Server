As shown computationally, acoustic coordinated reset (CR) neuromodulation causes a long-lasting desynchronization of pathological synchrony by downregulating abnormal synaptic connectivity. In a previous proof of concept study acoustic CR neuromodulation, employing stimulation tone patterns tailored to the dominant tinnitus frequency, was compared to noisy CR-like stimulation, a CR version significantly detuned by sparing the tinnitus-related pitch range and including substantial random variability of the tone spacing on the frequency axis. Both stimulation protocols caused an acute relief as measured with visual analogue scale scores for tinnitus loudness (VAS-L) and annoyance (VAS-A) in the stimulation-ON condition (i.e. 15&#x000a0;min after stimulation onset), but only acoustic CR neuromodulation had sustained long-lasting therapeutic effects after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment as assessed with VAS-L, VAS-A scores and a tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) in the stimulation-OFF condition (i.e. with patients being off stimulation for at least 2.5&#x000a0;h). To understand the source of the long-lasting therapeutic effects, we here study whether acoustic CR neuromodulation has different electrophysiological effects on oscillatory brain activity as compared to noisy CR-like stimulation under stimulation-ON conditions and immediately after cessation of stimulation. To this end, we used a single-blind, single application, cross over design in 18 patients with chronic tonal subjective tinnitus and administered three different 16-minute stimulation protocols: acoustic CR neuromodulation, noisy CR-like stimulation and low frequency range (LFR) stimulation, a CR type stimulation with deliberately detuned pitch and repetition rate of stimulation tones, as control stimulation. We measured VAS-L and VAS-A scores together with spontaneous EEG activity pre-, during- and post-stimulation. Under stimulation-ON conditions acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation had similar effects: a reduction of VAS-L and VAS-A scores together with a decrease of auditory delta power and an increase of auditory alpha and gamma power, without significant differences. In contrast, LFR stimulation had significantly weaker EEG effects and no significant clinical effects under stimulation-ON conditions. The distinguishing feature between acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation were the electrophysiological after-effects.</p><p>Acoustic CR neuromodulation caused the longest significant reduction of delta and gamma and increase of alpha power in the auditory cortex region. Noisy CR-like stimulation had weaker and LFR stimulation hardly any electrophysiological after-effects. This qualitative difference further supports the assertion that long-term effects of acoustic CR neuromodulation on tinnitus are mediated by a specific disruption of synchronous neural activity. Furthermore, our results indicate that acute electrophysiological after-effects might serve as a marker to further improve desynchronizing sound stimulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Acute effects and acute after-effects of dedicated tinnitus sound therapy are studied with EEG.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Sound therapy causing long-lasting, sustained effects causes pronounced acute after-effects.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Acute EEG after-effects might serve as marker to develop desynchronizing sound therapy.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alpha band activity</kwd><kwd>Coordinated reset neuromodulation</kwd><kwd>Delta band activity</kwd><kwd>Electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>Gamma band activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>A widely accepted consensus guideline (<xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">Tunkel et al., 2014</xref>) provides current tinnitus definitions. Secondary (objective) tinnitus is defined as tinnitus associated with an identifiable organic condition other than sensorineural hearing loss. In contrast, primary (subjective) tinnitus is an idiopathic symptom that may or may not be associated with sensorineural hearing loss. However, primary tinnitus is typically initiated by damage to the peripheral hearing system (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Irvine et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Lockwood et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Norena et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2006</xref>) that leads to a sequence of structural and functional changes in the central hearing system (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Lockwood et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Moller, 2003</xref>). The latter give rise to a phantom auditory perception, i.e. a conscious awareness of an internally generated sensory percept when no corresponding auditory stimulus is present (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Snow, 2004</xref>). In recent years, there is a growing body of evidence for a critical role of pathological neuronal synchronization in the auditory system in tinnitus pathophysiology (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Tass, 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Shore et al., 2016</xref>). An increase of neuronal synchrony has been described both in animal studies after noise trauma (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Norena and Eggermont, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Ochi and Eggermont, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Seki and Eggermont, 2003</xref>) and in tinnitus patients (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Norena and Eggermont, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Ochi and Eggermont, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Seki and Eggermont, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>). Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies revealed specific alterations of oscillatory power in particular frequency bands (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>) in patients with chronic subjective tinnitus. Specifically, increase of the oscillatory power in the delta, theta, and gamma frequency ranges as well as reduction of alpha power in the auditory cortex region were associated with the presence of tinnitus and its intensity (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Adamchic et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Adjamian et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Elgoyhen et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Van der Loo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>). An increase of oscillatory EEG power is typically interpreted as an increase in neuronal synchronization in terms of coincident firing within neuronal populations (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Hamalainen et al., 1993</xref>, <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Klass and Daly, 1979</xref>, <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Niedermeyer and Da Silva, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Nunez, 1981</xref>).</p><p>Studies in cortical primary sensory areas have revealed that neuronal plasticity is not restricted to periods early in life, but is present and can be reactivated in the mature brain, too [for review see (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;bener and Bonhoeffer, 2014</xref>)]. The neuronal timing pattern plays a key role in shaping synaptic connectivity (<xref rid="bb1000" ref-type="bibr">Hebb, 1949</xref>, <xref rid="bb2000" ref-type="bibr">Bliss and Lomo, 1973</xref>). Neurons adapt the strength of their synapses to the relative timing of their action potentials according to the fundamental mechanism of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gerstner et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Markram, 1997</xref>). Computationally it was shown that in networks with STDP stable synchronized states with up-regulated strength of synaptic connectivity and stable desynchronized states with down-regulated synaptic connectivity may generically coexist (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2007</xref>). Along the lines of a computational approach (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2002</xref>) coordinated reset (CR) stimulation (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>) was developed to specifically counteract abnormal neuronal synchrony by desynchronization. To this end different neuronal subpopulations of a target population are stimulated through different stimulation sites sequentially at different times in order to reset the phases of the different subpopulations equidistantly in time (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>). CR stimulation causes a desynchronization and, hence, a reduction of the strength of the synaptic connections, which ultimately results in an anti-kindling, i.e. an unlearning of abnormally up-regulated synaptic connectivity and neural synchrony (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2009</xref>). The network is shifted from a pathological model state with abnormally strong synapses to a desynchronized state with weaker synapses, and the stimulation effect outlasts the cessation of stimulation (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2009</xref>).</p><p>CR stimulation was first developed computationally for electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>), computationally studied in networks with (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2009</xref>) and without (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Lysyansky et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Lysyansky et al., 2013</xref>) STDP and later on successfully applied in pre-clinical (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and clinical (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Adamchic et al., 2014b</xref>) proof of concept studies. In addition, the CR concept was extended to sensory stimulation (<xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Popovych and Tass, 2012</xref>), especially acoustic CR stimulation for the treatment of chronic primary tinnitus (<xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Popovych, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). In a prospective, randomized, single blind, placebo-controlled proof of concept study in 63 patients acute and long lasting clinical effects of a 12-week treatment with CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation were assessed with visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for loudness (VAS-L) and annoyance (VAS-A) as well as with the TF score (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). The TF (&#x0201c;Tinnitus-Fragebogen&#x0201d;) (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Goebel and Hiller, 1993</xref>) is the German adaptation of the tinnitus questionnaire (TQ) (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Hallam et al., 1984</xref>). Acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation share the basic rhythmic CR pattern and employ tones that are tailored to the patient's dominant tinnitus frequency. <italic>Acoustic CR neuromodulation</italic> uses a template of four stimulation tones with fixed frequency ratios with respect to the tinnitus frequency. In contrast, <italic>noisy CR</italic>-<italic>like stimulation</italic> is characterized by randomly selecting the actual four stimulation tones during each stimulation cycle from a larger set of tones, sparing the tinnitus-related pitch range and including substantial random variability of the tone spacing on the frequency axis where all stimulation tones were defined by frequency ratios with the tinnitus frequency (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). In the proof of concept study CR stimulation turned out to be safe and well-tolerated and led to a significant decrease of tinnitus symptoms as assessed by VAS and TF scores (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). EEG recordings performed before and after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with acoustic CR neuromodulation revealed a significant reduction of pathologically elevated delta and gamma activity together with an increase of pathologically reduced alpha activity in a network of brain areas comprising auditory as well as non-auditory cortices (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Adamchic et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Silchenko et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>The starting point of this paper is the significant difference of the clinical effects of the two stimulation protocols: Acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation both had acute effects (with respect to baseline) as assessed with VAS-L and VAS-A scores in the <italic>stimulation</italic>-<italic>ON condition</italic> (i.e. 15&#x000a0;min after turning on stimulation), but only acoustic CR neuromodulation had sustained long-lasting effects as assessed in the <italic>stimulation</italic>-<italic>OFF condition</italic> (i.e. after having turned off stimulation for at least 2.5&#x000a0;h) after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). As yet, electrophysiological effects during and shortly after cessation of acoustic CR neuromodulation have not been studied. Accordingly, we here set out to study acute effects and acute after-effects of both stimulation protocols with VAS scores and, in particular, with EEG recordings. This is to elucidate acute electrophysiological stimulation responses and mechanisms that might lead to therapeutic sustained long-lasting effects. Specifically, based on computational studies (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Popovych, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) we hypothesize that acoustic CR neuromodulation causes a desynchronization of delta oscillations followed by a desynchronizing after-effect, provided the stimulation duration is sufficient. Since our computational predictions are based on qualitative rather than quantitative models, it remains to be tested, whether the selected 16&#x000a0;min stimulation duration is appropriate. We have selected a 16&#x000a0;min duration, since in a previous proof of concept study (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) this dose was sufficient to at least induce acute clinical CR effects. Note, based on previous clinical (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) and computational (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Popovych, 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) findings, we would hypothesize acutely delivered acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR stimulation to differ with respect to EEG parameters rather than clinical scores. Objective, EEG-based features underlying acute effects and after-effects of acoustic CR neuromodulation might enable to further optimize treatment parameters and delivery.</p><p>In addition, we want to study whether the observed EEG effects are specific to appropriately calibrated acoustic CR neuromodulation. Accordingly, as additional stimulation control condition we use a systematically and deliberately detuned acoustic CR neuromodulation protocol that we hypothesize to be ineffective &#x02013; both clinically and electrophysiologically. To this end, we use CR with tones in the low frequency range (pitch) and at significantly reduced stimulus repetition rate with respect to the target delta rhythm, in order to stimulate the tonotopically organized auditory system spatially off-target and at the wrong pace. If proven to be ineffective under acute conditions, such a detuned CR protocol, in what follows denoted as <italic>low frequency range stimulation</italic>, might be a candidate for a sham/placebo stimulation for a controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty participants with primary chronic tonal tinnitus participated in the study. Two patients were excluded from the analysis because of excessive muscle and movement artifacts in the EEG recordings. Subjects with pulsatile, ringing, buzzing, roaring, or hissing tinnitus and subjects with a history of auditory hallucinations, M&#x000e9;niere's disease, middle ear disorders and diagnosed neurological or mental disorders as well as subjects taking CNS-acting medication or using hearing aids were not included. Data of eighteen participants with subjective bilateral chronic tonal tinnitus (14 males and 4 females) was analyzed. Regarding laterality of tinnitus loudness, 10 reported bilaterally equal, 3 subjects reported left dominant and 5 right dominant tinnitus. The mean age was 45.89 (12.97; standard deviation, SD), and the mean tinnitus duration was 9.83 (7.08) years. Otoscopic examination was performed in all participants. The extent of the hearing loss was investigated in a soundproof and electromagnetically shielded chamber (Desone Modulare Akustik, Berlin, Germany) by determining pure-tone air-conduction hearing thresholds from 0.125&#x000a0;kHz to 16&#x000a0;kHz (<xref rid="f0055" ref-type="graphic">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) using Type AT900 audiometer with HDA200 (Sennheiser GmbH, Wedemark, Germany) and B71 headphones (Auritec Medizindiagnostische GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). A pure tone matching procedure was used to determine the best matching tinnitus pitch (from 0.5 to 13&#x000a0;kHz). Subjects were instructed to match the frequency of a pure tone to the perceived pitch of their tinnitus. During this procedure intensity and frequency of the matching tone were controlled by the participant using a custom-made tone generator that allowed continuous frequency adjustment. The tinnitus matching started either well below or well above the subject's tinnitus frequency. The participant had to adjust the matching tone to his/her tinnitus. The matching tone was repeatedly interrupted to facilitate the comparison between matching tone and tinnitus. The tinnitus pitch matching was performed until patient confirmed the best matching pitch twice (difference between two matched tones &#x0003c;&#x000a0;100&#x000a0;Hz). All participants were comprehensively informed about the scope, aim, benefits and risks of the study participation, and a written informed consent was obtained from all subjects according to the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice.

EEG recordings were obtained in a soundproof and electromagnetically shielded chamber. EEG data were collected from 128 surface electrodes (HydroCel Geodesic Sensor Net, Electrical Geodesis Inc., Eugene, USA). All electrodes were referenced to Cz. The EEG signals were amplified with a Net Amps 200 amplifier (Electrical Geodesis Inc., Eugene, USA), digitized at 1&#x000a0;kHz and band-pass filtered from 0.1 to 400&#x000a0;Hz. Photogrammetry was performed for all subjects using the Geodesis Photogrammetry system (Electrical Geodesis Inc., Eugene, USA) and the individual head shape was modeled for each subject and EEG session.</p><p>The first part of each experimental session consisted of a 10&#x000a0;min period of silence (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A). The participants sat still and listened to their tinnitus (baseline period; during this period recordings were performed in alternating two minute intervals with eyes closed and with eyes open as orally instructed, and the eyes closed EEG data was selected for further analysis; the alternating two minute intervals were selected to prevent excessive drowsiness as well as to prevent participants from falling asleep). At the end of this resting period, the participants were asked to indicate the mean tinnitus loudness and annoyance during the baseline resting period on a 100&#x000a0;mm long visual analogue scale verbally anchored at the endpoints (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Adamchic et al., 2012</xref>). VAS for loudness (VAS-L; tinnitus is not audible&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0, tinnitus is extremely loud&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) and annoyance (VAS-A; tinnitus is not annoying&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0, tinnitus is extremely annoying&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;100) were obtained. After the rating, acoustic CR neuromodulation, the noisy CR-like stimulation or the LFR stimulation were presented for exactly 16&#x000a0;min (during this period recordings were performed in alternating two minute intervals with eyes closed and with eyes open as orally instructed, and the eyes closed EEG data was selected for further analysis). At the end of this stimulation period, the participants were asked to indicate the mean tinnitus loudness and annoyance during the stimulation period on the VAS-L and VAS-A. The stimulus presentation was followed by 2&#x000a0;min long resting period (eyes closed), VAS-L and VAS-A rating between 2 and 4&#x000a0;min after the stimulation followed by another 2&#x000a0;min (eyes closed) of rest EEG recording. Subjects were asked to listen to their tinnitus. Transitions between eyes open and eyes closed conditions were guided by oral instruction. Acoustic CR neuromodulation, the noisy CR-like stimulation and the LFR stimulation were each presented one time in one of the three experimental sessions. The order of the experimental sessions was pseudorandomly counterbalanced across subjects.

(B) Experimental session: during the first 10&#x000a0;min of silence, the baseline EEG was recorded and the baseline VAS-L and VAS-A scores were obtained. Thereafter one of the three stimulation paradigms, i.e. acoustic CR neuromodulation, noisy CR-like stimulation or LFR stimulation, was performed for 16&#x000a0;min. VAS-L and VAS-A were obtained during stimulation at the end of this stimulation period. During the next period of silence EEG recording was obtained for 2&#x000a0;min followed by the VAS-L and VAS-A evaluation (2&#x000a0;min) and another 2&#x000a0;min of rest EEG recording. After each session participants received a pause during which tinnitus returned to the normal level. Thereafter the next session was started.

While in the case of acoustic CR neuromodulation the gap between adjacent tones increases from lower to higher tones, for noisy CR-like stimulation the gap of the inner sets of tones is greatest. Furthermore, the gap between the inner sets of tones of the noisy CR-like stimulation is on average approx. 64% greater than the gap between the inner CR tones <italic>f</italic><sub>2</sub> and <italic>f</italic><sub>3</sub>.

This was done under the assumption that tones not targeting the direct tinnitus frequency range will have minimal or no effect on the tinnitus intensity or on oscillatory brain activity.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.3.3</label><title>Tone duration</title><p>Tone duration was 150&#x000a0;ms for all three stimulation protocols.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.3.4</label><title>Cycle repetition rate</title><p>Cycle repetition rate should optimally be adapted to the targeted abnormal synchronized oscillation. Hence, cycle repetition rate was 1.5&#x000a0;Hz (in the delta range) for acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation whereas for the LFR stimulation the repetition rate was deliberately detuned by setting it to 0.3&#x000a0;Hz. For acoustic CR neuromodulation a cycle repetition rate of 1.5&#x000a0;Hz, i.e. in the lower delta frequency range was selected because the primary target for desynchronization was the pathological delta band activity. Cycle repetition rate of the noisy CR-like neuromodulation was matched to the cycle repetition rate of the acoustic CR neuromodulation. The 4 tones per cycle were played in a random order. For the acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation one cycle consisted of two tones below and two tones above the tinnitus frequency. For the LFR stimulation one cycle consisted of four tones in the 0.5 to 4&#x000a0;kHz range. Each tone of the cycle was presented separate from the other tones with interstimulus interval 0.167&#x000a0;s for the acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation.

Firstly, it did not overlap with the assumed synchronized tinnitus focus (see <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec">Selection of tones</xref>). Secondly, its repetition rate was significantly detuned so that, based on computational studies (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>) we expected the desynchronizing effect of CR neuromodulation to be significantly reduced. Thirdly, the low repetition rate significantly reduced the acoustic input and accordingly decreased the possibility of effects caused by forward inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s0050"><label>2.3.5</label><title>Cyclic stimulation/pause pattern</title><p>During acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation three stimulation cycles were followed by two silent cycles (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Lysyansky et al., 2011</xref>).

In addition, acoustic CR neuromodulation caused a longer (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A,E) and stronger (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>F) increase in <italic>alpha</italic> band auditory cortex activity as revealed with the time resolved BESA analysis. Accordingly, the time-averaged alpha band CSD, determined with sLORETA in the 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;s after stimulation offset, was significantly greater after acoustic CR neuromodulation as compared to the noisy CR-like stimulation, with spatial peak differences in the temporal cortex (BA 41) (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>E). <italic>Gamma</italic> power of the auditory cortex source activity (BESA) was significantly reduced compared to baseline after acoustic CR neuromodulation in a longer post-stim time window (20&#x02013;240&#x000a0;s) as opposed to after noisy CR-like stimulation (40&#x02013;100&#x000a0;s) (<xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A,G). In a relatively short time window, between 80 and 90&#x000a0;s after stimulation offset, noisy CR-like stimulation caused a significantly greater reduction of auditory cortex gamma power compared to acoustic CR neuromodulation (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>I). This short-duration difference did not show up in the comparative time-averaged sLORETA current source density analysis, covering the time period 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;s after stimulation offset (<xref rid="f0045" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>G, H, J, K). Finally, in the theta and beta band no sLORETA CSD related differences were found between acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation bands.</p><p>In summary, we found no significant differences between acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation with respect to the acute clinical and the acute electrophysiological effects. Accordingly, our current study replicates the results of a previous proof of concept study in that both stimulations have similar acute effects on tinnitus loudness and annoyance (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). However, in that proof of concept study acoustic CR neuromodulation caused a long-lasting reduction of both tinnitus loudness and annoyance, as assessed in the off stimulation condition after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment as well as after a subsequent, preplanned 4-week treatment pause (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). In contrast, noisy CR-like stimulation did not cause any long-lasting clinical effects (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>In the present study the two stimulation protocols differed significantly only concerning their acute after-effects. While both stimulation protocols caused a significant after-effect of the VAS-L, only noisy CR-like stimulation led to a significant reduction of VAS-A after the end of the stimulation. However, the acute electrophysiological after-effect was more pronounced after acoustic CR neuromodulation than after noisy CR-like stimulation: Acoustic CR neuromodulation caused (i) a significantly longer and stronger decrease of the delta band power, (ii) a significantly longer and stronger increase of the alpha band power and (iii) a significantly longer decrease of the gamma band power, with spatial peaks in the auditory cortex. Only in a narrow, 10&#x000a0;s time window the gamma band after-effect was significantly greater after noisy CR-like stimulation than after acoustic CR neuromodulation.</p><p>Based on the results presented here, acute electrophysiological after-effects, e.g. a significant decrease of the delta band power or combined effects, such as decrease of delta and increase of alpha, might be used as candidate markers for the further optimization of parameters of acoustic CR neuromodulation. Our results are in accordance with a pre-clinical study with CR-DBS in Parkinsonian monkeys where CR-DBS was delivered at optimal and less appropriate intensities (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>). In that study it was shown that long and pronounced acute therapeutic after-effects coincide with long-lasting, sustained after-effects. Ultimately, the predictive power of acute electrophysiological after-effects has to be investigated by means of a clinical study comprising EEG recordings and long-term clinical assessment.</p><p>Acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation are similar in several respects, but differ in two relevant features that might cause the EEG results reported here: (i) <italic>Fixed set</italic> vs. <italic>random selection of subset of stimulation tones</italic>: A fixed set of four tones is used for acoustic CR neuromodulation for all stimulation cycles. In contrast, for noisy CR-like stimulation four stimulation tones are randomly selected from a larger set of 12 tones for each stimulation cycle. In fact, a variant of CR stimulation designed for electrical brain stimulation selects m out of n stimulation contacts for each stimulation cycle, where <italic>m</italic>&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;2 and <italic>m</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;<italic>n</italic> (<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2006</xref>). The motivation behind this &#x0201c;<italic>m</italic> out of <italic>n</italic>&#x0201d; CR variant is to avoid stereotypical reverberations of the network's activity (<xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2006</xref>), see also (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>). However, the stimulation sites have to be arranged in a spatially balanced way to ensure stimulation of sufficiently separate neuronal subpopulations (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2006</xref>). For the noisy CR-like protocol <italic>m</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4 and <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12. In fact, the <italic>m</italic> out of <italic>n</italic> CR selection mode should not compromise the desynchronizing effect of CR stimulation, provided the different subsets of stimulation sites share the same or at least similar topological characteristics (spatial relation and mutual overlap of stimulated sub-populations) (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0360" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2006</xref>). (ii) <italic>Spacing of stimulation tones</italic>: Compared to acoustic CR neuromodulation the noisy CR-like stimulation avoids stimulation of the frequency range adjacent to the tinnitus frequency <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub>. In principle, however, the latter is the very target of CR stimulation. In addition, for the noisy CR-like stimulation the distance between adjacent tones varies considerably, especially for the outer pairs of tones, where the spacing variability amounts to a factor of up to 4.77. Based on computational studies (<xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Lysyansky et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Lysyansky et al., 2013</xref>) and pre-clinical studies (<xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) in the field of CR-DBS such a spatially unbalanced stimulation will very likely undermine desynchronizing effects of DBS. We used the term noisy CR-like stimulation because of these two major, distinguishing features: avoiding the tinnitus target and high spacing variability of relatively remote stimulation sites. Due to its particular tone arrangement noisy CR-like stimulation noisy CR-like stimulation might predominantly inhibit tinnitus-related activity (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>). In computational studies with different types of neural networks it was shown that blocking and/or inhibitory stimuli typically do not cause long-lasting desynchronizing effects, and excessive neuronal synchrony re-increases more quickly after cessation of blocking/inhibitory stimulation as compared to after desynchronizing stimulation, even in the absence of STDP (<xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann and Tass, 2007</xref>). The quick re-increase of neuronal synchrony may, e.g., be caused by neurons being held close to the same phase during inhibitory or blocking stimulation, see e.g. (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Pyragas et al., 2013</xref>), in this way enabling a quick restart in synchrony.</p><p>The spatial resolution of our EEG study is not sufficient to determine the exact localization of the stimulation-induced changes in oscillatory activity. However, LFR stimulation which differed from CR neuromodulation by the frequency range of the auditory stimuli did not induce any relevant after-effects on oscillatory brain activity. This indicates, that the changes induced by CR neuromodulation depend on the relationship between the tinnitus frequency and the auditory stimulation and may thus occur predominantly in neuronal assemblies coding for the tinnitus frequency.</p><p>If CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation had similar mechanism of action then similar electrophysiological changes after the two acoustic stimulation types should be observed. However, the reduction of delta band power after the end of acoustic CR neuromodulation lasted markedly longer and was more pronounced than after the end of noisy CR-like stimulation, suggesting that the two stimulation forms exert their tinnitus reducing effect by different mechanisms. The shorter reduction of the delta band power after the end of the noisy CR-like stimulation would be compatible with the notion that tinnitus masking exerts a tinnitus-suppressing effect by feed forward inhibition, acting on the affected frequency regions (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>) and disrupting the abnormal synchronous neural activity that is believed to underlie tinnitus perception (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Seki and Eggermont, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007a</xref>). This disruption of the abnormal synchronous neural activity subsided within 120&#x000a0;s after the end of the noisy CR-like stimulation. Accordingly, the short term reduction of the delta band power after the noisy CR-like stimulation might reflect a short-term suppression of the abnormal synchronous activity, a phenomenon that is thought to underlie the residual inhibition observed after the use of noisers or maskers and that usually extends seconds or minutes beyond the duration of the stimulation (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Terry et al., 1983</xref>). However, as we mentioned above, noisy CR stimulation differs acoustically from the usually used maskers, specifically, sound generators for tinnitus often present a broadband noise containing energy across all frequencies in the spectrum and these are presented continuously. Specifically, the noisy CR-like stimulus consists of the multiple tones that cover tinnitus spectrum around the matched tinnitus pitch. Thus, various implications for the underlying neural effects cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The increase of the alpha oscillatory activity was more pronounced and lasted longer (up to 330&#x000a0;s) after acoustic CR neuromodulation as compared to noisy CR-like stimulation (up to 120&#x000a0;s). Our results are in agreement with studies demonstrating that alpha and delta/theta oscillations tend to be reciprocally related to each other (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev and Slobodskaya, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev et al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Robinson, 2001</xref>). As was already mentioned above, recent evidence suggests that enhancement of lower frequency (delta) oscillations along the tonotopic axis is caused by deprivation, i.e., by deafferentation due to hearing loss (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0330" ref-type="bibr">Steriade, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>). However, it is currently debated how the increase of delta synchronization is connected to the reduction of alpha rhythms in tinnitus. Different explanations are conceivable: (1) According to the Synchronization-by-Loss-of-Inhibition-Model model, proposed by Weisz and colleagues, input deprivation caused by hearing loss leads to reduced activity and therefore to an enhancement of delta power in the affected regions along the tonotopic axis (<xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007a</xref>). As a consequence of deprived input the activity of inhibitory neurons, normally reflected by alpha activity is also suppressed. (2) Other studies suggested that delta and alpha oscillations may be linked to and generated by two different systems with both systems mutually inhibiting each other (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Harmony, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev and Slobodskaya, 2003</xref>). A certain degree of incompatibility was also reported between spindles and delta rhythms (<xref rid="bb0250" ref-type="bibr">Nunez et al., 1992</xref>). Therefore, the increased alpha power in the tinnitus free condition may indicate that a more powerful alpha system exerts a stronger inhibition over the delta system (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev and Slobodskaya, 2003</xref>). The pathologically enhanced synchronization of low frequencies in tinnitus that may occur as a result of deafferentation or deprivation (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Llinas et al., 1999</xref>, <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2006</xref>) thus may tip the system toward the low frequency (delta/theta) oscillations that will override usually stronger alpha (<xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Knyazev and Slobodskaya, 2003</xref>). These explanations require further investigation in longitudinal studies by investigating, e.g., changes of the hierarchical cross-frequency coupling during and after manipulating the tinnitus sensation by application of various stimulation types.</p><p>Gamma activity that could be associated with tinnitus perception on the behavioral level (<xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Van der Loo et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>) was significantly decreased after acoustic CR neuromodulation (20&#x02013;240&#x000a0;s) and noisy CR-like stimulation (40&#x02013;100&#x000a0;s). The increase of gamma band power during and shortly after stimulation is in line with previous observations of physiological increases of gamma band power during the presence of external sounds (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Crone et al., 2001</xref>, <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Joliot et al., 1994</xref>). After the end of stimulation a significant reduction of the gamma power persisted longer after acoustic CR neuromodulation (0&#x02013;260&#x000a0;s) as compared to the noisy CR-like stimulation (0&#x02013;110&#x000a0;s). However, between 60 and 120&#x000a0;s after the end of both acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation the amount of the gamma band power reduction was similar. This is an interesting finding as the amount of the alpha power increase (alpha oscillations are assumed to be related to the ongoing functional inhibition that prevents cell assemblies from spontaneous synchronization) between 60 and 120&#x000a0;s was significantly greater after acoustic CR neuromodulation. Since in tinnitus the increased gamma synchronization is assumed to be related to the chronically decreased level of alpha oscillations and thus reduction of inhibition (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2011</xref>), it is conceivable that after more pronounced restoration of the alpha activity (observed after acoustic CR neuromodulation) and accordingly a normalization of cortical excitability the gamma activity will also normalize to a greater degree. However, after a long history of pathological synchronization, it is likely that the synaptic strength between neurons in the affected auditory cortex region that underlies tinnitus percept increases (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Gerstner et al., 1996</xref>, <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Markram, 1997</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>) stabilizing to a certain degree the synchronous gamma band activity. The similar reduction of gamma power between 60 and 120&#x000a0;s after the acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation thus may indicate that a complete propagation of desynchronization into the gamma band might require longer stimulation using acoustic CR neuromodulation than used in this study. The longer lasting reduction of the gamma power after acoustic CR neuromodulation as compared to the noisy CR-like stimulation nevertheless may have resulted from longer and stronger restoration of the functional inhibition exerted by alpha on the synchronous gamma band activity. This important issue has to be addressed in further studies by investigating the cross-frequency interactions between alpha and gamma bands after application of various stimulation types of different duration.</p><p>Parallel to the stimulation-induced changes of oscillatory brain activity, described above, acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation significantly reduced tinnitus loudness and annoyance during stimulation and 2&#x000a0;min after cessation of stimulation. No significant changes of the tinnitus intensity were recorded during and 2&#x000a0;min after the end of the LFR stimulation. In this study the reduction of the tinnitus intensity was similar 2&#x000a0;min after the end of both acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation. This finding is consistent with a previous proof of concept study (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>) where noisy CR-like stimulation had only a shorter lasting off&#x02013;stimulation effect resembling the typical short term effects of noisers or maskers (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">Terry et al., 1983</xref>). Reduction of the tinnitus intensity 2&#x000a0;min after acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation is consistent with the notion that an amelioration of the pathological condition, i.e., a disruption of the abnormal synchronous neural activity, that is believed to underlie tinnitus, leads to a normalization of abnormal cortical rhythms in the tinnitus networks diminishing perceptual salience of tinnitus (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Adamchic et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Adjamian et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Dohrmann et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Kahlbrock and Weisz, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">Weisz et al., 2007b</xref>). The findings presented here are also consistent with studies that reported a reduction of initially enhanced delta/theta and gamma activity and enhancement of initially decreased alpha activity after the induced tinnitus reduction (Adamchic et al., 2013; <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Adjamian et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">De Ridder et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Kahlbrock and Weisz, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In a previous proof of concept study, no significant (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;h) acoustic placebo induced changes of the oscillatory brain activity, tinnitus loudness or annoyance were observed (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). In consistence with these results, no lasting effects of LFR stimulation were observed in this study, even though the placebo stimulation used in <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al. (2012a)</xref> and LFR stimulation used in the presented study differ. Both of the above mentioned stimulation types, i.e., the acoustic placebo stimulation (<xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>) and the LFR stimulation have in common that the stimulation tones of both stimulation types were shifted away from the center of the assumed synchronized tinnitus focus (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Norena et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Seki and Eggermont, 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>). The LFR stimulation, used in this study, led to a significant reduction of the delta oscillatory activity for up to 30&#x000a0;s after the end of the stimulation. The short-term reduction of the delta band power after the end of the LFR stimulation, observed in our study, can likely be ascribed to some degree of overlap between the spectra of the used LFR stimulation and tinnitus (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Norena et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2006</xref>). In this case a certain amount of excitation might have been induced in the affected tonotopic regions of the auditory cortex by the LFR stimulation tones (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Eggermont and Roberts, 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Roberts, 2007</xref>). This disruption of abnormal synchronous neural activity subsided within 30&#x000a0;s after the end of stimulation.</p><p>It is plausible to assume that the degree to which frequency specific synchronized neural activity is interrupted by a feed-forward inhibition affecting the tone specific region of the auditory cortex is related to the unit time for which that tone at this specific frequency is presented to the participant. Specifically this may be relevant for the comparison of the noisy CR-like stimulation and acoustic CR neuromodulation as they differ in this dimension. For the noisy CR-like stimulation there is a reduced likelihood that any one specific tone is presented as within each cycle only 4 out of 12 tones are presented. In our study we cannot assess to which degree synchronized neural activity was interrupted at each specific location related to the single stimulation tones, as we assess compound EEG power changes in the selected cortex region. However, taking into account that changes of the EEG power during both stimulation types, i.e., acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation, were almost indistinguishable from each other, it is unlikely that different changes of the EEG power after stimulation were simply a result of the different repetition rate of each specific tone in both stimulation types.</p><p>Another relevant aspect of the stimulation protocols refers to the temporal pattern of stimulus delivery. To which extent is the sequential rather than e.g. coincident application of stimulation tones required to induce clinical and/or electrophysiological acute effects, acute after-effects and long-term effects? To address the specificity of the temporal features of the stimulation pattern, in a forthcoming study one should use an appropriate control condition e.g. with the same tones, but different temporal stimulation pattern, such as coincident periodic stimulation, see (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results presented here, mechanisms primarily employing lateral inhibition and, hence, a short-term suppression of the tinnitus-related neuronal synchronization cannot be completely ruled out for acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation. However, even if acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation covered similar frequency ranges around the matched tinnitus pitch and induced similar changes of oscillatory brain activity during stimulation, they differed in the electrophysiological changes after the end of stimulation, which almost rules out that these two forms of stimulation act by a common mechanism. The functional changes after noisy CR-like stimulation, which are distinct from those induced by acoustic CR neuromodulation, indicate that the exact spatiotemporal pattern of stimulation tones matters, even if stimulation tones span similar ranges around the matched tinnitus pitch. In this context it is remarkable that changes of the oscillatory brain activity during acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation did not differ significantly from each other. These findings are in accordance with recent studies in animals and humans (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">Tass et al., 2012b</xref>) and the theoretical studies on which the CR neuromodulation concept is based (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0270" ref-type="bibr">Popovych et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0350" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003a</xref>, <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">Tass, 2003b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Popovych, 2012</xref>). Specifically, in computational studies it was shown that CR neuromodulation induces a long-lasting desynchronization mediated by an unlearning of synaptic connectivity (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Hauptmann et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Hauptmann, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Majtanik, 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">Tass and Popovych, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0110"><label>4.4</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The changes of the oscillatory brain activity induced by noisy CR-like stimulation differed both in strength and in time course from the changes caused by acoustic CR neuromodulation. Thus, similar acute reductions of tinnitus intensity induced by acoustic CR neuromodulation and noisy CR-like stimulation were not associated with similar electrophysiological acute after-effects. These findings suggest that although the tinnitus reduction resulting from acoustic CR neuromodulation and the noisy CR-like stimulation may be subjectively similar, the two stimulations may not be physiologically equivalent. This qualitative difference casts new light on the assertion that CR specific disruption of synchronous neural activity in auditory structures lies at the basis of the long-term effects produced by acoustic CR neuromodulation. With its similar auditory characteristics but the lacking desynchronizing effect both LFR stimulation and noisy CR-like stimulation may represent appropriate control conditions in future clinical studies investigating clinical effects of acoustic CR neuromodulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Potential conflict of interest</title><p>Ilya Adamchic was an employee at J&#x000fc;lich Research Center during this study.
