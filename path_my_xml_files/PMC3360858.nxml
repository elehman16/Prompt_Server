Despite the fact that these persons have been cured from cancer, many cancer survivors still face distressing consequences as a result of their illness and/or treatment, like postcancer fatigue. Fatigue persists for months or years after completion of curative treatment in about a quarter of the cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], with major effects on the quality of life of these patients.</p><p>A previous RCT of our research group demonstrated that cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) especially designed for postcancer fatigue is highly effective in reducing fatigue severity in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In clinical practice, physical exercise is seen as a promising strategy for treatment of fatigue during and after cancer treatment. Because an important element in CBT for postcancer fatigue is a physical activity program, the current study aimed to test a treatment model in which the effect of CBT on fatigue is mediated by an increase in physical activity.</p><p>The existing literature is ambiguous about the effects of activity on postcancer fatigue. In total, six systematic review studies have been conducted on the topic of exercise intervention studies in cancer patients. Three systematic reviews concluded that exercise is beneficial for individuals with postcancer fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], while three other systematic reviews did not find an effect of exercise on fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The differing results seen arise from differing methodologies. The systematic reviews of McNeely et al. and Jacobsen et al. did not evaluate intervention efficacy in the posttreatment period separately from the active treatment phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Four systematic reviews were focused on numerous outcome measures and only limited studies on postcancer fatigue were evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; the systematic review of Schmitz et al. included also non-randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In conclusion, there is a need to establish the extent to which physical activity is helpful in the reduction of postcancer fatigue in cancer survivors.</p><p>In CBT for postcancer fatigue, an increase in the level of physical activity is stimulated. The fatigued cancer survivor selects a simple physical activity that can be performed every day (e.g., walking or cycling) and increases gradually and systematically the duration of this particular activity. The directive for a patient is to perform an activity twice a day, starting at a level of which is certain that symptoms do not aggravate. Mostly this is 5 to 10&#x000a0;min. The activity level is increased with 1&#x000a0;min a day for each time the activity is performed and will end at a maximum of 60&#x000a0;min twice a day (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Illness-related cognitions are also targeted during the physical activity program. In particular, patients' preoccupation with their condition and their belief that they have little control over their symptoms are challenged. By the time patients are active 2&#x000a0;h a day, most patients will have become aware of the fact that they are capable of doing more without experiencing extreme fatigue and that they recover faster than before. Gradually, walking or cycling is now being replaced by other activities. One might choose to systematically expand mental and social activities, preparing the patient for a return to work or other personal targets.</p><p>In the present study, the data of the previous RCT on the efficacy of CBT for postcancer fatigue will be reanalyzed to determine whether the treatment effect of CBT on fatigue is mediated by an increase in physical activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample</title><p>Cancer survivors with severe fatigue were recruited from outpatient clinics of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre for participation in a RCT on the efficacy of CBT for postcancer fatigue. Patients were screened by their physician on clinically relevant systematic diseases (e.g., malnutrition, hemoglobin level, presence of hypothyroidism, and other physical comorbidities). If a physician was certain that the fatigue had no somatic cause, the patient was invited to participate. Patients completed curative treatment for cancer at least 1&#x000a0;year previously and had no evidence of disease recurrence at the time of participation. The minimum age at disease onset was 18&#x000a0;years; patients were no older than 65&#x000a0;years and had no current psychological or psychiatric treatment when participating in the study. The ethics committee of the hospital approved the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and procedure</title><p>We gave patients verbal and written information about the study and obtained informed consent before randomly assigning them to either the intervention condition (CBT) or the waiting list condition. Both conditions were assessed two times, at baseline and 6&#x000a0;months later. Patients in the waiting list condition were informed beforehand that, if desired, they could start therapy after the second assessment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>CBT for postcancer fatigue</title><p>In understanding postcancer fatigue, it is important to make a distinction between precipitating factors and perpetuating factors. The assumption is that cancer itself and/or cancer treatment may have triggered fatigue (precipitating factors), but that other factors are responsible for persistence of fatigue complaints (perpetuating factors). CBT is focused on six perpetuating factors of postcancer fatigue. They involve insufficient coping with the experience of cancer, a heightened fear of disease recurrence, dysfunctional fatigue-related cognitions, dysregulatory sleep&#x02013;wake cycles, dysregulatory activity patterns, and insufficient social support and interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Because of the existence of large differences within the group of fatigued cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], therapy was adapted to each individual. To determine the perpetuating factors for each patient, in addition to an interview, each factor is assessed with specific questionnaires (more details on these questionnaires are described in Gielissen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]). Based on the tools' norm scores, it is determined whether the patient has a deviant or problem score. Subsequently, founded on the outcomes of the assessment instruments and the patient-therapist interview, a custom-built treatment plan is drawn up comprising only patient-relevant modules. However, for all patients, the physical activity program was part of their tailored treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>A mean of 12.5 sessions were given (SD 4.7) with a duration of 1&#x000a0;h during a 6-month period. Patients were offered a maximum of two sessions during a 6-month follow-up period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment</title><p>Patients were assessed prior as well as subsequent to the treatment and waiting list period.</p><sec id="Sec7"><title>Fatigue</title><p>The subscale fatigue severity of the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS) was used to indicate the level of fatigue experienced by patients. The subscale consists of eight items, each scored on a 7-point Likert scale (range, 8&#x02013;56 points), in which the patient is asked about fatigue in the 2&#x000a0;weeks preceding the assessment. A score of 35 or higher indicates severe fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The CIS is a reliable and valid instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and has been used for the assessment of fatigue in cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Objective physical activity</title><p>Actigraphy was used to measure a patient's level of objective physical activity. The actometer is a motion-sensing device developed to assess the actual level of physical activity and is worn at the ankle for 12 consecutive days prior each assessment. An average daily level of physical activity was computed over this period with higher scores indicating more physical activity. The actometer is a reliable and valid instrument [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has been used in cancer survivors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. All patients who missed actigraphy at the second assessment were excluded from the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analyses</title><p>We conducted one-way ANOVAs to test whether patients who were excluded from the present study due to missing actigraphy at the second assessment differed on baseline characteristics from those patients who were included. A chi-square test was used in case of dichotomous dependent variables. In addition, one-way ANOVAs were used to compare the CBT and waiting list condition on baseline, second assessment, and change scores concerning fatigue severity and physical activity.</p><p>Testing mediation is a strategy to identify variables which intervene in the relationship between treatment and outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the current study, we want to determine whether the treatment effect of CBT on fatigue is mediated by an increase in physical activity. The mediation hypothesis is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>, a change in fatigue is simply explained by receiving CBT (path c). This model is usually tested when the efficacy of an intervention is of primary interest to the investigator. In Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, the effect of CBT on fatigue (path c&#x02032;) is mediated by an increase in physical activity (path a) which is responsible for the reduction in fatigue (path b). A macro expansion for SPSS introduced by Preacher and Hayes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] was used to test this mediation hypothesis. The macro consisted of a syntax file which enabled SPSS to examine the mediation hypothesis according to guidelines of Baron and Kenny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Paths a, b, c, and c&#x02032; of Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> were analyzed using regression analysis. To examine path a, changes in physical activity were regressed on treatment. Path b was examined by regressing changes in fatigue on changes in physical activity. In the case of path c, changes in fatigue were regressed on treatment, while path c&#x02032; was examined by regressing changes in fatigue on treatment, this time correcting for the mediator changes in physical activity. The size of the mediation effect was computed by multiplying path a with path b.

In this approach, population parameters are generated empirically instead of relying on normal theory. This procedure leads to more power to detect significant differences even in small, non-normally distributed samples. The observed dataset was randomly resampled in 5,000 samples with mediation effect. The mean of this mediation effect was used as a population parameter. The null hypothesis was rejected when the 95% confidence interval (CI) did not include zero.</p><p>All change scores were computed by subtracting second from baseline assessment.

There were no differences on baseline characteristics between participants and nonparticipants (data not shown). Fifty-six patients were allocated to both conditions. After random assignment, 14 ineligible patients were excluded from the trial, resulting in 50 patients participating in the CBT condition and 48 in the waiting list control condition. Due to missing actigraphy at the second assessment, nine patients in the CBT condition and six in the waiting list condition could not be used in the mediation analyses.

CBT did not cause an increase in physical activity at the end of treatment (path a) nor was an increase in physical activity associated with a reduction in fatigue (path b). The finding that there was no effect of the interventions on physical activity already showed that mediation was absent, but as mediation analyses require a large power, a bootstrap analysis was performed. The formal test of the mediation effect confirmed that CBT yielded its effect independent of a change in physical activity. These results are in line with Wiborg et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], who demonstrated that the effect of CBT on fatigue in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome was also not mediated by an increase in physical activity following treatment.</p><p>There are several potential alternative explanations for the fact that we did not find support for our mediation hypothesis. One reason could be that the actometer was not obtained from all participants, and it is possible that we introduced a bias through exclusion. Also, by excluding patients, the sample size became smaller. However, no difference on baseline characteristics was found between completers and non-completers, and the effect of CBT was still significant in the smaller group. Additionally, the bootstrap approach is sensitive to detect differences in small samples.</p><p>Gradual increase of physical activity is an important part of the treatment protocol; however, no increase was found assessed with actigraphy at the end of treatment. Our study is limited by not documenting the level of physical activity during therapy. Therefore, we do not know whether the patients became temporarily physically more active during CBT.

This temporary increase in physical activity during therapy might have been sufficient to facilitate a persistent change in illness-related cognitions and reduce fatigue. The gradual increase of physical activity can help the patient to feel (more) confident that he or she is actually capable of achieving these activities despite his or her symptoms, thereby enhancing his or her sense of control and bringing about a positive self-efficacy. This would be an interesting hypothesis to explore in future research.</p><p>In addition, CBT for postcancer fatigue is also focused on five other perpetuating factors of severe fatigue. It seems logical to assume that the positive effect of CBT on postcancer fatigue was mediated by change in the other perpetuating factors. Future research should therefore be focused on examining the exact mechanisms of change in CBT by monitoring illness-related cognitions and physical activity repeatedly during therapy and on determining the exact role of each perpetuating factor.</p><p>The association between fatigue and depression is complex. Fatigue can occur as a symptom of depression or may precipitate feelings of depression because of its interference with mood, work, and leisure activities. However, it is important to realize that in most patients, postcancer fatigue occurs independently from depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The current study sample does not reflect the incidence and types of cancer in the Dutch population, and the sample is quite young compared to the general oncological population. Therefore, a positive effect of physical activity on fatigue cannot be ruled out, and replication is necessary in survivors matching the general oncological population.</p><p>In the literature, there is a lack of consistent evidence whether a physical activity program reduces postcancer fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Because in the current study we did not find an increase in physical activity, it remains unclear if there is a positive effect of an increase in physical activity for reducing postcancer fatigue.</p><p>However, even without an increase in physical activity, CBT was highly effective in reducing postcancer fatigue. Therefore, a persistent increase in physical activity seems not to be a requirement in reducing postcancer fatigue, and a change in illness-related cognitions is likely to play a more crucial role in CBT for postcancer fatigue.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d29e1722"><title>Statement</title><p>The current study is based on a previous RCT (Current Controlled Trials: ISRCTN: 44562532, Grant Dutch Cancer Society) investigating the efficacy of CBT especially designed for postcancer fatigue.
