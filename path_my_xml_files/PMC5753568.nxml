Although resistance training is effective in preventing and reversing sarcopenia, many older people are sedentary and either cannot or do not want to exercise. This trial examines the efficacy of supplementation with the amino acid leucine and/or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition to potentially improve muscle mass and function in people with sarcopenia. Promising preliminary data exist from small studies for both interventions, but neither has yet been tested in adequately powered randomised trials in patients with sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Leucine and ACE inhibitors in sarcopenia (LACE) is a multicentre, masked, placebo-controlled, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial randomised trial evaluating the efficacy of leucine and perindopril (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)) in patients with sarcopenia. The trial will recruit 440 patients from primary and secondary care services across the UK. Male and female patients aged 70&#x000a0;years and over with sarcopenia as defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia (based on low total skeletal muscle mass on bioimpedance analysis and either low gait speed or low handgrip strength) will be eligible for participation. Participants will be excluded if they have a contraindication to, or are already taking, an ACEi, angiotensin receptor blocker or leucine. The primary clinical outcome for the trial is the between-group difference in the Short Physical Performance Battery score at all points between baseline and 12&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include appendicular muscle mass measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, muscle strength, activities of daily living, quality of life, activity using pedometer step counts and falls. Participants, clinical teams, outcomes assessors and trial analysts are masked to treatment allocation. A panel of biomarkers including microRNAs, neurohormones, genetic polymorphisms and markers of inflammation relevant to muscle pathophysiology will be measured to explore predictors of response and further elucidate mechanisms underlying sarcopenia. Participants will receive a total of 12&#x000a0;months of either perindopril or placebo and either leucine or placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The results will provide the first robust test of the overall clinical and cost-effectiveness of these novel therapies for older patients with sarcopenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN90094835">ISRCTN90094835</ext-link>.

The mechanisms behind the development of sarcopenia are not fully understood, but accumulating evidence suggests that the condition is multifactorial in aetiology. Some of the factors involved are an altered turnover of muscle protein with a reduction in muscle protein synthesis and a relative increase in muscle protein breakdown, chronic inflammation with increased cytokines including TNF and IL-6, inactivity, mitochondrial dysfunction and altered neuromuscular junction structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Currently, the intervention with the most evidence for efficacy in preventing and reversing sarcopenia is resistance exercise training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, many older people are sedentary, and either cannot exercise or do not want to exercise.</p><p id="Par24">Non-exercise interventions to prevent or counter the effects of sarcopenia are thus required. A range of potential interventions have been proposed, including protein supplementation, myostatin inhibitors, testosterone and selective androgen receptor modifiers, growth hormone and novel interventions including activin ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Many of these approaches have either suffered from frequent side effects (e.g. testosterone, growth hormone) or are under evaluation in early-phase studies by the pharmaceutical industry. The LACE trial studies the efficacy of two promising interventions (leucine and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition) that can potentially improve muscle mass and function in people with sarcopenia as defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia (EWGSOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Promising preliminary data exist from small trials for both interventions, but neither has yet been tested in adequately powered trials enrolling people with established sarcopenia.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Potential benefits of leucine therapy</title><p id="Par25">Muscle protein synthesis in response to protein ingestion is attenuated in older people compared to younger people (i.e. there is anabolic resistance to protein supplementation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Increasing the amount of protein ingested is one way of overcoming this issue, but older, frail people typically already have sub-optimal protein intakes and increasing their protein intake may be challenging in practice.</p><p id="Par26">Leucine, a branched-chain amino acid, is known to have important regulatory actions, mediated at least in part via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Leucine affects protein turnover, both&#x000a0;by reducing proteolysis and enhancing protein synthesis in vitro. Studies in healthy older people confirm that addition of leucine to a protein meal enhances muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; previous studies suggest that approximately 2.5&#x000a0;g of leucine per meal is sufficient to generate the effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In addition, leucine stimulates insulin release by pancreatic beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; insulin signalling not only improves glucose uptake by skeletal muscle, but is also an important anabolic signal for skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Potential benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy</title><p id="Par27">The renin&#x02013;angiotensin&#x02013;aldosterone system activity has been implicated in skeletal muscle dysfunction via multiple biological pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Angiotensin II impairs endothelial function and hence muscle blood supply, is associated with increased levels of inflammation and suppression of IGF-1, and has important effects on mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Aldosterone also has deleterious effects, including lowering serum potassium, impairment of endothelial function and promotion of fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Conversely, ACEi drugs have been shown to have multiple potentially beneficial effects on skeletal muscle function. ACEi drugs improve endothelial function and angiogenesis and reduce inflammation. They improve mitochondrial function, enhance IGF-1 levels, promote skeletal muscle glucose uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] thought to have important effects on skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Existing trial evidence</title><p id="Par28">Leucine-enriched amino acid supplements have been shown to improve muscle strength and function in healthy older people, although one study of leucine alone failed to replicate this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, no studies to date have examined the effect of leucine supplementation alone specifically in people with diagnosed sarcopenia. This is precisely the group, with lower IGF-1 signalling, lower protein intake and poor anabolic response to protein loading, who are most likely to demonstrate a response to intervention. Small trials of protein loading in frail older people show improvements in physical performance measured using the Short Physical Performance Battery test (1.0-point improvement at 24&#x000a0;weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] but no improvement in skeletal muscle mass over this short follow-up period. In contrast, in older participants undergoing resistance training, protein supplementation enhanced muscle mass, but not muscle strength or performance compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], suggesting that it is the non-exercising majority of older, frail people who are most likely to benefit from nutritional efforts to enhance muscle protein synthesis.</p><p id="Par29">There is some evidence that multiple biological functions of ACEi drugs may translate into clinical benefit. The ACEi perindopril produces a significant improvement in physical function (31-m improvement in 6-minute walk; improvement in quality of life of 0.09 points on the EQ5D tool) in functionally impaired older people with a mean age 79&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Observational studies report better muscle strength and larger lower extremity mass in older people taking an ACEi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, studies of ACEi use in fitter older people have not shown positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], which suggests that the effects of ACEi drugs may be more relevant in frailer people. Similar to studies with leucine, combining an ACEi with exercise training also had no effects beyond those evident from exercise training; no additional improvement in 6-minute walk was seen with perindopril in our previous trial in which all participants were undertaking an exercise programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, the existing evidence suggests that frail older people not engaged in exercise training are the target population most likely to benefit from ACEi therapy. ACEi drugs have not yet been studied specifically in people with sarcopenia who have both poor muscle mass and function, and providing evidence of efficacy in this group with a well-defined specific deficit in muscle physiology is key to testing whether ACEi drugs really have clinically relevant benefit in the target population for this commissioned call (i.e. people with sarcopenia).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Why the LACE trial is needed now</title><p id="Par30">Sarcopenia underlies two of the most important medical syndromes affecting older people&#x02014;falls and immobility. It is a major underlying cause of physical frailty in older people, and is associated with a range of adverse outcomes, including increased need for care, increased risk of admission to care home, prolonged hospital stay and increased mortality. As such, sarcopenia is a major cause of morbidity in older people; hence, ways of preventing or treating sarcopenia need to be tested.</p><p id="Par31">To date, few large trials have been conducted of treatments in trial populations selected explicitly to have sarcopenia. Thus our knowledge of how best to conduct such trials, as well as our knowledge of the best treatments to use, is limited. It is against this background that the Efficacy and Mechanisms Evaluation programme, funded by the UK National Institute for Healthcare Research and the UK Medical Research Council, released a commissioning call in 2013 which led to the funding of this trial.</p><p id="Par32">A key problem in pharmacotherapy for older people is the issue of polypharmacy. The use of increasing numbers of different medications (often to treat several co-existing diseases) is a major cause of drug&#x02013;drug interactions and adverse events&#x02014;which potentially outweigh any benefit of adding new drugs. The choice of perindopril and leucine as agents to test in this trial was informed in part by the opportunity to use an agent present in the diet already with a low risk of side-effects (leucine) and a medication already commonly used in older people to treat conditions including heart failure and hypertension (perindopril). Using agents with multiple beneficial effects across a range of disease states (pleiotropic agents) is one potential way to maximise the benefit of pharmacotherapy in older, multimorbid patients whist avoiding the pitfalls of polypharmacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial objectives</title><p id="Par33">The primary objective of the LACE trial is to determine the efficacy of leucine and perindopril in improving physical function in older people with sarcopenia diagnosed using the EWGSOP definition. Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of leucine and perindopril on muscle mass in older people and to evaluate biomarkers that can predict response to leucine and perindopril in patients with sarcopenia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par34">LACE is a multicentre, placebo-controlled, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 factorial randomised controlled trial analysed as randomised.

Where local patient registries are kept these are exploited to search for potentially suitable participants. High numbers of patients need to be screened, as patients cannot be identified by diagnosis (sarcopenia is only rarely diagnosed in clinical practice at present) and primary and secondary care electronic systems in the UK do not hold data on physical function that would facilitate identification of those who are more likely to have sarcopenia. A telephone pre-screening phase is therefore included (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This allows rapid, efficient selection of participants most likely to pass a screening visit, and represents the best available strategy for practical screening in sarcopenia trials. Pre-screening is based on a brief telephone conversation conducted by the research nurse exploring any contraindications (e.g. heart failure, taking ACEi) and on administration of the SARC-F tool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The SARC-F tool consists of five questions about physical function, giving a score between 0 (best) and 10 (worst); the score has been developed to assist with screening for sarcopenia and functional impairment. A threshold score is used to denote a high probability of having sarcopenia, and prompts progression to a screening visit. The threshold score was initially set at 4 points or above (out of 10) but is reviewed regularly in the light of screening information, and is adjusted up or down to maximise efficiency of recruitment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participant flow through the trial.

This approach minimises the need to perform large numbers of DEXA scans for trial screening, thus reducing costs, enhancing participant convenience and improving recruitment efficiency. The Akern BIA (Bioimpedance Analyser) 101 machine is used at all sites, and appendicular muscle mass is calculated using the equation developed by Sergi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; this equation was developed in a white, older European population using the BIA 101 machine. Thresholds for muscle mass are derived from the UK Biobank cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and are stratified by body mass index for each sex; such an approach ensures that participants with sarcopenic obesity are represented in the trial and is consistent with the more recent Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) consensus guideline on diagnosing sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]</p><p id="Par38">Primary care recruitment is carried out with the assistance of the primary care research networks in Scotland (SPCRN) and England (CRN).

The perindopril/placebo is administered as oral capsules. Placebo and active capsules are identical in external appearance. Perindopril tablets are over-encapsulated with a hard gelatin capsule and backfilled with lactose. The placebo capsules are identical in appearance and packed with lactose. The starting dose of perindopril is 2&#x000a0;mg daily which is up-titrated to 4&#x000a0;mg after 2&#x000a0;weeks if tolerated and renal function, serum potassium levels and blood pressure remain within defined limits (potassium&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L, creatinine&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;180&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L and &#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L rise from baseline, systolic blood pressure&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;mmHg). Participants in the placebo group also undergo a &#x02018;mock&#x02019; up-titration. If the 4&#x000a0;mg daily dose is not tolerated, participants are down-titrated to the original 2&#x000a0;mg daily. If 2&#x000a0;mg is also not tolerated, medication is withdrawn.</p><p id="Par40">The leucine/placebo is administered as a powder. A 1.5-ml scoop is provided and participants are instructed to take three scoops (4.5&#x000a0;ml equivalent to 2.5&#x000a0;g of leucine/placebo) three times per day. The placebo is matching lactose powder. Participants are instructed that they should mix the powder with food or drink. Exploratory work with our local Older People&#x02019;s Advisory Group indicated that mixing the leucine powder with food or drink was palatable, particularly if mixed with foods such as yoghurt or orange juice.</p><p id="Par41">Randomisation is conducted via a centrally controlled, web-based Good Clinical Practice-compliant randomisation system, run by Tayside Clinical Trials Unit. Investigators at each site access the web-based system to randomise each participant at the end of the baseline visit. Randomisation is stratified by site. To ensure balanced assignment across critical variables, a minimisation algorithm is employed, using baseline age (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80 vs&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;80&#x000a0;years), sex, SPPB score (&#x0003e;&#x02009;8 vs&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;8), grip strength (&#x0003e;&#x02009;25 vs&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;kg for males; &#x0003e;&#x02009;15 vs&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;kg for females) and Charlson co-morbidity score (&#x0003e;&#x02009;3 vs&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;3) to balance allocation across trial arms.</p><p id="Par42">Participants are asked to return all unused study medication including empty bottles/containers. Adherence to medication will be recorded by capsule count of the perindopril/placebo capsules and by the weight of the container for the leucine/placebo powder. Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is measured to assess adherence to the perindopril/placebo capsules. To ensure that medication adherence is maximised, we employ a combination of written information about the study medication and why taking it is important, together with aide memoirs including LACE-branded mugs and fridge magnets. At each visit, participants are reminded about the importance of medication adherence. Interventions incorporating these components have been shown in a Cochrane review to enhance adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. If one of the study drugs needs to be stopped or the participant wishes to stop, they are encouraged to continue with the other study drug. Participants stopping both study drugs are encouraged to remain in the study in order to facilitate analysis as randomised.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par43">The primary outcome for the trial is the Short Physical Performance Battery, measured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months. The between-group difference in the SPPB across the whole follow up will be reported as the primary outcome, calculated using generalised estimating equations to incorporate repeated measures and missing data. The SPPB is a validated measure of lower limb function that reflects everyday activity. It is a powerful predictor of subsequent disability, institutionalisation and death in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and has more data validating its use in older people than any other measure of physical function. Secondary outcomes include between-group differences in muscle mass measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry, other measures of physical function, instrumental activities of daily living and quality of life. We also measure blood pressure, insulin resistance, hip bone mineral density and a panel of biomarkers to explore both mechanisms of disease and predictors of response to treatment.

To look at the activity of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system we will measure circulating levels of ACE and renin as well as two truncated forms of angiotensin (ang(1&#x02013;7) and ang(1&#x02013;9)) that have been shown to alter muscle mass and are likely to be modified by an ACEi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There are a number of different processes through which activation of the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system is thought to contribute to muscle loss, including increased inflammatory cytokine production, reduced IGF-1 production and increased myostatin production in signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. We will therefore quantify IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and myostatin. We will also quantify circulating levels of GDF-15, another member of the TGF-&#x003b2; family of cytokines, as it is a marker of all-cause mortality and is associated with muscle mass in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and with muscle loss following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The influence of specific polymorphic variation in the renin&#x02013;angiotensin system will also be analysed.</p><p id="Par49">To identify changes in muscle protein turnover in the absence of direct measurements, which are expensive and invasive, we will quantify pro-collagen III N-terminal peptide as a measure of new collagen synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] and levels of circulating muscle restricted miRNAs (myomiRs) that are increased in the circulation of patients with diseases associated with muscle wasting including Duchenne muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Finally, we will examine circulating levels of a set of imprinted miRNAs that may reflect the regenerative capacity of the individual.

In addition, multivariable analysis for baseline values including age, sex, SPPB, grip, muscle mass, albumin, creatinine, all measured biomarkers and treatment group will be conducted to examine whether baseline values or change at 3&#x000a0;months predicts the SPPB change and muscle mass change at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p id="Par52">We have taken a deliberately conservative approach and used the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) for the SPPB to ensure we have proof of efficacy.

Since changing to the screening thresholds described in this article, the screening pass rate now approaches 50% and recruitment has consequently accelerated.</p><p id="Par59">Because sarcopenia is not a diagnosis commonly made in clinical practice (it received an ICD-10 code only in September 2016), case-finding for sarcopenia trials is challenging and few centres in the UK have experience recruiting to trials for sarcopenia. A supplementary aim of the LACE trial programme is therefore to determine efficient ways of finding and screening potential participants for sarcopenia trials. We will evaluate the success of recruitment from primary versus secondary care; the best threshold on the SARC-F to identify eligible participants on telephone pre-screening; the best combination of search terms to use in primary care electronic system searches; and the best ways of engaging participants from a range of secondary care clinics. Initial experience suggests that primary care recruitment is much more successful than recruitment from geriatric medicine secondary care services. Although one might expect patients with sarcopenia to be concentrated in such secondary care clinics, this patient group has multiple exclusion criteria, particularly use of ACEi drugs and the presence of dementia. The overall number of patients in geriatric medicine clinics is small compared to the volume of potential participants in primary care; the lower percentage of eligible patients in primary care makes efficient searches, mailshots and telephone pre-screening essential. We are setting up a centralised telephone facility to manage the large volume of telephone pre-screening required by this approach.</p><p id="Par60">A final aim is to build capacity across a network of UK sites to recruit to and deliver sarcopenia trials. We anticipate that the experience gained by UK sites in the trial, along with other initiatives such as the British Geriatrics Society Sarcopenia and Frailty Research Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], will aid in the establishment of this UK Sarcopenia Trials Network. This network, and the expertise developed by centres through LACE, should accelerate clinical trial activity in this emerging and important area of medicine.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par61">The trial started recruitment in July 2016, and results are expected towards the end of 2020.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
