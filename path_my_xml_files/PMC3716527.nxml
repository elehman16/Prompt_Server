Barriers to detecting mental health problems include lack of screening tools, limited appointment times and young people&#x02019;s reluctance to report mental health symptoms to GPs. The <italic>mobiletype</italic> program is a mobile phone mental health assessment and management application which monitors mood, stress and everyday activities then transmits this information to general practitioners (GPs) via a secure website in summary format for medical review. The current aims were to examine: (i) <italic>mobiletype</italic> as a clinical assistance tool, ii) doctor-patient rapport and, iii) pathways to care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted a randomised controlled trial in primary care with patients aged 14 to 24&#x000a0;years recruited from rural and metropolitan general practices. GPs identified and referred eligible participants (those with mild or more mental health concerns) who were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (where mood, stress and daily activities were monitored) or the attention-comparison group (where only daily activities were monitored). Both groups self-monitored for 2 to 4&#x000a0;weeks and reviewed the monitoring data with their GP. GPs, participants and researchers were blind to group allocation at randomisation. GPs assessed the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program as a clinical assistant tool. Doctor-patient rapport was assessed using the General Practice Assessment Questionnaire Communication and Enablement subscales, and the Trust in Physician Scale (TPS). Pathways to care was measured using The Party Project&#x02019;s Exit Interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of the 163 participants assessed for eligibility, 118 were randomised and 114 participants were included in analyses (intervention n&#x02009;=&#x02009;68, attention-comparison n&#x02009;=&#x02009;46). T-tests showed that the intervention program increased understanding of patient mental health, assisted in decisions about medication/referral and helped in diagnosis when compared to the attention-comparison program. Mixed model analysis showed no differences in GP-patient rapport nor in pathways to care.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conducted the first RCT of a mobile phone application in the mental health assessment and management of youth mental health in primary care. This study suggests that <italic>mobiletype</italic> has much to offer GPs in the often difficult and time-consuming task of assessment and management of youth mental health problems in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00794222">NCT00794222</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Seventy-five percent of major mental disorders and alcohol or other substance misuse disorders have their onset prior to the age of 25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Adolescence is therefore clearly an ideal time for prevention and early intervention for mental illnesses. As General Practitioners (GPs) are the gatekeepers of mental health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and most adolescents see a GP at least once a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], GPs are in an ideal position to identify young people at need or those who would benefit most from early intervention. Nevertheless, it is estimated that GPs are only identifying 50% of patients with mental health disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Research suggests that this low rate of detection is most likely due to a lack of systematic approach to identifying at-risk patients and providing evidence-based treatments rather than a lack of skills on the part of the GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The majority of young people prefer to seek help from family and friends for mental health problems rather than general practitioners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The main deterrents to seeking help from a GP were embarrassment or concern about what the GP might think of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Patient-doctor rapport plays a large role in a young person&#x02019;s willingness to discuss general and mental health concerns with their GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and necessarily better detection rates of youth mental health problems are associated with this rapport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The high prevalence of mental health symptoms amongst young people, as well as their reluctance to raise these subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggests a need for routine screening for mental health symptoms, as is standard practice for physical health symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to improving the rate of detection of mental health symptoms, systematic measures increase a sense of partnership between patient and clinician, empower the patient to take control of their health, reduce feelings of helplessness and encourage patients to recognise early warning signs of relapse and to seek earlier intervention for future episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Despite this need, GPs have only a limited amount of time to spend with their patients, with most appointments in Australia lasting only 15&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We recently developed and trialled a mobile phone application, called &#x0201c;Mobile Tracking Young People&#x02019;s Experiences&#x0201d; (<italic>mobiletype</italic>). The aim of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program is to support doctors and provide information about young people&#x02019;s general and more specific mental health functioning to assist in determining appropriate treatment approaches and management plans. It is a youth-friendly, time-saving mental health assessment which can be used at any time point within the patient care trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Mobile phones are ideally suited to the busy primary care environment as they are ubiquitous (over 95% of young people own one), ownership crosses socioeconomic and geographic boundaries, and have the ability to capture a large amount of information with minimal outlay of GP time. Furthermore, young people often report feeling more able to disclose sensitive information via technological means rather than face to face communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>mobiletype</italic> program monitors a young person&#x02019;s mood, stress, coping strategies and daily activities a number of times per day, and their eating, sleeping, exercise patterns and alcohol and cannabis use once per day. This information is then uploaded to GPs, via a secure website and displayed in summary reports for review, in a manner similar to a pathology or radiology report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our studies suggest that young people will monitor their mental health symptoms for the purpose of reviewing this data with their doctor, that both doctor and young person find this a beneficial way of communicating information about mental health, and that the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program assisted the doctor to understand the young person better [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>The overall aim of this study was to investigate, via a randomised controlled trial, a number of suggested benefits found in our pilot studies of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], being the collection of clinically useful data in a time efficient manner, increased doctor-patient rapport, and subsequently, better pathways to care due to more thorough assessment of patient. In this RCT we were interested in testing the utility of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program in the real world primary care setting and therefore sought to have broad inclusion criteria such that the findings may best approximate the nature of the primary care setting. This paper reports on the health service outcomes of the RCT (mental health outcomes can be found in BMC Family Practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]), the following questions were investigated: i) To what extent does the <italic>mobiletype</italic> function as a clinical assistance tool for GPs in their assessment and management of mental health symptoms in young people compared with an attention-comparison (described in Methods), ii) does the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program enhance doctor-patient rapport compared to an attention-comparison, iii) and does the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program assist in leading young people into pathways to care for mental health symptoms compared to an attention-comparison?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>As the present reports on the secondary outcomes of a larger RCT, a full description of methodology is reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The data presented here are the secondary outcome data from the <italic>mobiletype</italic> randomised controlled trial conducted from 2009 to 2011.

This measure requires GPs to rate how confident they were in their diagnosis, communication, maintaining trust, understanding patients&#x02019; specific medical problem, understanding patient&#x02019;s mental health problems, knowledge about the patient (i.e. lifestyle, behaviours, etc.) on a series of 4-point Likert scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;Not confident, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;Lacking confidence, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;Confident, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;Very confident). These items were summed into a GP Confidence scale, and internal consistency was tested by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha [&#x003b1;] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and was 0.93. GPs completed these questionnaires for each participant after their post-test medical review regardless of group allocation, and the questionnaires did not specify which group the patient was allocated to.</p></sec><sec><title>Doctor patient rapport</title><p>Doctor-patient rapport was measured from the patients&#x02019; perspective with the General Practice Assessment Questionnaire (GPAQ) Communication and Enablement subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and the Trust in Physician Scale (TPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] which were completed at pre-test, post-test and 6&#x000a0;weeks post-test. Internal consistency was again confirmed by Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha (GPAQ Communication &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.96; GPAQ Enablement &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88; TPS &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71).</p></sec><sec><title>Pathways to care</title><p>The Party Project&#x02019;s Exit Interview [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was completed by the participants and assessed pathways to care being if the participant was i) prescribed medications, ii) referred to a health professional, ii) referred for further testing, scans and/or X-rays, or iv) provided other advice and psychoeducation regarding mental health during the most recent medical review. These dichotomous items were summed into a Pathways to Care scale (range: 0&#x02013;4).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Recruitment of 200 participants was anticipated from 10 general practices. This sample size was based upon Cohen&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] statistical testing for multiple regression with two independent variables (to account for the mediating variable and the outcome) to detect a medium effect with 80% power and a probability of a type I error of .05. A medium effect size was selected as this was thought to be clinically significant. The anticipated sample size of 200 was not met due to delays in recruitment during school holidays and the H1N1 influenza pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. As a result, a deadline was set for cessation of recruitment, and a total of 118 participants were recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants were randomised to either i) the <italic>mobiletype</italic> monitoring intervention program group or ii) the comparison program group; both groups also received care as usual. Randomisation was carried out by an in-house computer programmer who had no research or recruitment role in the study using random seed generation at the individual-level and stratified according to area (Melbourne, Goulburn Valley, and Albury/Wodonga). Study mobile phones were allocated ID numbers within areas (i.e. Melbourne01, Melbourne02) and either the intervention or comparison <italic>mobiletype</italic> program was loaded consecutively in a blinded fashion according to the programmer&#x02019;s concealed randomisation list. The randomisation list was constructed for 100 Melbourne, 50 Goulburn Valley and 50 Albury/Wodonga participants. Researchers, participants, and GPs were blind to randomisation pre-test. GPs and participants became aware of the group allocation at the post-test when the summary reports were reviewed. This study had Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee approval (HREC: 28113), was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (Reference: NCT00794222) and adhered to ethical guidelines for data collection, storage and reporting.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>Recruitment</title><p>In addition to treatment as usual, GPs screened their patients for eligibility to the study, organised an appointment for interested participants with a research. Participants met with a <italic>mobiletype</italic> research assistant within five days of referral to learn the study process, complete consent forms, the pre-test questionnaire package, review the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program and other features of the phone and complete a practice entry of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program. Participants were provided with a study manual that described the research procedure and offered trouble-shooting tips.</p></sec><sec><title>Mobile phone monitoring period</title><p>All participants borrowed a Sony Ericsson Z750i mobile phone containing the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program for the study period. Information regarding the development and testing of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Participants were requested to complete at least two <italic>mobiletype</italic> entries a day until they returned for their medical review in 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks; participants and GPs were advised that 2&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks was the ideal monitoring period. Participants were given a SIM card containing $30 in credit as partial reimbursement for their time and phone credit used.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-test review, 6-week post-test, and 6&#x000a0;month post-test assessments</title><p>Upon completion, participants reviewed the self-monitoring data with their GP on the <italic>mobiletype</italic> website. Young people completed a post-test assessment immediately following this appointment, again at six weeks and six months after this post-test review (six month post-tests not included in the current analysis). GPs completed a post-test questionnaire immediately after the appointment. Questionnaires were completed online, over the phone with a research assistant, or via a mailed hardcopy survey. Participants were given a $20 gift card for each follow up survey completed (maximum of $60 for all questionnaires completed).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>Demographic data and missingness (to satisfy the MAR assumption for random-effects modeling) are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For data measured at one time point (the GP Clinical assistance items) independent t-tests were employed to compare mean differences of complete cases between groups. For data measured at two time points (GP Confidence scale) regression analyses were conducted, in which the difference between groups were explored after adjusting for pre-test scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>Finally, for data measured at three timepoints (GPAQ scales, TPS and Pathways to Care scale), mixed model analysis was employed, using the MIXED procedure in SPSS (consistent with methodology carried out in the primary outcomes article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Contrary to repeated measures analysis of variance, mixed model methods analyse all available data without any data loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. All mixed model analyses employed a restricted maximum likelihood estimation method, included subject id as a random effect and survey time to create individual random slopes.</p><p>Clustering at the GP level was considered and tested, but due to the number of GPs involved and the relatively small clusters within GPs, clustering at the GP level did not significantly contribute to the model or provide a better approximation of the intraclass correlation coefficient than at the individual level.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In sum, the mean participant age was 18.1&#x000a0;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.2), and the majority were female (71.9%), students (66.7%) and did not identify with an ethnic background (87.3%). No significant demographic differences were found between groups, and the MAR assumption was upheld. Rural areas were purposefully overrepresented in this study with 26 different practices in the three recruitment areas: 12 in greater Melbourne, 7 in Wodonga and 7 in the Goulburn Valley.</p><p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program, independent <italic>t</italic>-tests compared responses of GPs&#x02019; with participants in the intervention group to those with patients in the comparison group.

GPs reported that the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program assisted them to understand their patients&#x02019; current functioning, mental and physical health problems and assisted them with diagnoses, communication, medication, referrals and significantly more than the attention comparison. These findings suggest that a mobile phone monitoring program which captures and summarises detailed, specific mental health and more general health information in a time-efficient manner may assist GPs in their management of youth mental health problems. Interestingly, whilst there was reasonably high compliance with the monitoring protocol both in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and our previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and our pilot study suggested that young people thought that using the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program was a useful way of transferring information between patient and doctor, there was no significant effect of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program on doctor-patient rapport from the young person&#x02019;s perspective when tested across time and compared to an attention comparison program. Finally, there was no significant effect of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program on pathways to care, rather as reported in the mental health outcomes paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] it appeared that GPs conducted a mental health intervention at pre-test, implementing on average two pathways to care for most participants.</p><p>Assisting GPs in the assessment and management of youth mental health problems is critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program via its design offers a solution to a number of the doctor and patient barriers in detecting and managing mental health. <italic>mobiletype</italic> is systematic in assessment, time-efficient, provides detailed mental and general health information, generally well-received by patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], low-cost, and uses a communication technology that crosses traditional geographic and socioeconomic barriers. The finding that GPs found it of assistance in overall assessment, determining diagnoses, medications and referrals, and assisted in communication between GP and patient is further support for the utility of the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program as clinical assistance tool and adds to the growing literature on the acceptability and benefits of computerised screening in primary care to assist GPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>It was surprising, given our pilot study findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] that using the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program did not assist doctor-patient rapport significantly more than attention comparison program. Nevertheless, both the <italic>mobiletype</italic> and the attention comparison program included monitoring and provision of feedback for doctors and participants to review. The review of personal monitoring data was the process that we hypothesised would lead to increased doctor-patient rapport, and hence a wait-list control group who did not monitoring may have been more appropriate comparison group to test this hypothesis. In addition, the participants ratings at pre-test of their satisfaction with their doctors was quite high, and anecdotally we found that many of the doctors volunteering for this study were experienced in working with young people and/or had an interest in mental health. Thus a ceiling effect may have occurred in terms of the ratings of doctor patient-rapport.</p><p>Finally, we did not find that the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program lead to a difference in the pathways to care compared to the attention comparison group. The significant main effect for time, suggested that GPs were unexpectedly acting to manage mental health during the pre-test review in two ways for the majority of participants, without waiting for further information from the <italic>mobiletype</italic> monitoring data, summary report and recommendations, and then were less likely to implement further pathways to care at post-test and 6-week post-test. As discussed in the mental health outcomes paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] participating GPs may have felt the need to manage mental health symptoms when they first present rather than wait for further data as the general rate of return to follow up review appointments can be unpredictable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Whilst the GPs rated the <italic>mobiletype</italic> program as of greater clinical assistance than the attention comparison program, these results came from a onetime measurement point. The current study failed to find changes across time in GP confidence or doctor-patient rapport, and it is possible that our measures of GP confidence and doctor-patient rapport were insensitive to the changes that may have occurred. Moreover, our pre-test rapport and GP confidence scores were relatively high, also suggesting a possible ceiling effect that decreased the likelihood of improving these scores. An alternate reason for the lack of significance could be that study may have failed to attract doctors who are most in need of clinical assistance tools for the detection and assessment of mental health in young people. Research trials relying on volunteer participation tend to attract those who are interested and motivated by the topic of the research, in this case youth and mental health.</p><p>The inclusion of a wait-list control or &#x0201c;usual medical care only&#x0201d; group in this study would have allowed for comparison and testing of the doctor-patient rapport hypothesis, nevertheless, this was not the main hypothesis of the study. Finally, further limitations are detailed in the mental health outcomes paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], which include: a cluster randomised controlled trial in which GPs rather than patients were randomised may have been more appropriate but was rejected as it would be logistically impossible for GPs and participants to remain blinded in the current study; participant heterogeneity in illness type, severity and familiarity with their GP due to broad inclusion criterion needed in an effectiveness trial is likely to have reduced the overall power of the study; and the random outcomes of uneven groups due to early cessation of recruitment is also likely to have reduced the power of study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conducted the first RCT of a mobile phone application in the mental health assessment and management of youth mental health in primary care.
