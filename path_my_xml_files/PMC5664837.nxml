In laboratory studies, lotilaner was shown to be safe and to produce a rapid flea and tick knockdown, with a sustained speed of kill for at least a month post-treatment. A study was undertaken to demonstrate the efficacy, safety and palatability of three monthly doses of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets (Credelio&#x02122;, Elanco) in controlling fleas under field conditions in Europe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Dogs were enrolled at 17 veterinary clinics across Germany, Hungary and Portugal. Qualifying households having no more than three dogs and one primary dog with at least five fleas was randomised 2:1 to a lotilaner (minimum dose rate 20&#x000a0;mg/kg) or a topical fipronil group (administered per label). There were 128 and 64 households allocated to the lotilaner and fipronil groups, respectively. Treatments were dispensed to owners on Days 0, 28 and 56; supplementary household dogs received the same treatment as the primary dog. Post-enrollment flea counts and flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) assessments were made on primary dogs on Days 14, 28, 56 and 84. Efficacy calculations were based on geometric mean percent reductions of live flea counts <italic>versus</italic> pre-treatment counts on Day 0. The safety and palatability of lotilaner tablets were also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Lotilaner efficacy was 99.1, 99.5, 99.9 and 99.8% on Days 14, 28, 56 and 84, respectively. Corresponding reductions for fipronil were 93.4, 91.2, 94.4 and 97.0%. Lotilaner was superior to fipronil at all post-Day 0 assessments (<italic>t</italic>

At every post-treatment assessment, at least 90% of lotilaner-treated dogs were flea-free (98.4% on Day 84); fewer than 90% of fipronil group dogs were flea-free on the same time points. Lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets were palatable, and both products were well tolerated. Lotilaner alleviated or eliminated clinical signs of FAD, including pruritus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Under field conditions in Europe, lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets were greater than 99% effective in eliminating fleas from dogs at the first post-treatment assessment (Day 14).

Lotilaner tablets were palatable and safe and provided superior flea control to fipronil.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13071-017-2479-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Lotilaner</kwd><kwd>Credelio</kwd><kwd>Fleas</kwd><kwd>Fipronil</kwd><kwd>Frontline</kwd><kwd>Field</kwd><kwd>Dog</kwd><kwd>Efficacy</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Europe</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Elanco</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par12">The European release of spinosad in 2011 as a monthly orally administered flea adulticide for dogs heralded a trend away from topical products to oral formulations to control fleas. That trend was recently accelerated by the release of a novel family of compounds, the isoxazolines, that target distinct binding sites on &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid- and glutamate-gated chloride channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Laboratory and field studies of the three isoxazolines - afoxolaner, fluralaner and sarolaner - that were granted initial approvals for oral administration to dogs in 2014 and 2015, demonstrated that these compounds were safe and effective, and provided 1 month (afoxolaner and sarolaner) to two to 3 months (fluralaner) activity against fleas and ticks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Lotilaner is a novel isoxazoline that was selected for development from a library of over 500 structures emerging from a research program to identify compounds that would be effective against ectoparasites of pets. Laboratory testing in dogs demonstrated that the minimum lotilaner dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg rapidly began to kill fleas and the tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic>, with efficacy demonstrated from two and 4 h after treatment, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. This early onset of action aligned with expectations from pharmacokinetic work which showed that lotilaner achieves peak blood levels in dogs within approximately 2 h after treatment, and has a half-life of approximately 30&#x000a0;days, thereby sustaining flea and tick activity for at least 1 month after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A study involving repeated monthly administrations of lotilaner to puppies from 8&#x000a0;weeks of age at doses of up to 5 times the upper limit of the product dose range demonstrated that lotilaner has a wide safety margin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These promising laboratory data needed translation into real-world clinical benefits, and the study reported herein was initiated to assess the performance of lotilaner in client-owned dogs naturally infested with fleas.</p><p id="Par14">The main objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets (Credelio&#x02122;) against flea infestations on dogs in Europe. Lotilaner was administered orally by owners once every 4 weeks for a total of three treatments at the minimum dose rate of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight to dogs naturally infested with fleas in three countries, Germany, Hungary and Portugal. A topical formulation of fipronil (Frontline&#x000ae; Spot-on) was used as a positive control comparator. The effect of treatment on clinical signs (pruritus, erythema, scaling, papules, alopecia, and pyoderma) associated with flea allergy dermatitis (FAD) and the palatability of the oral product was also evaluated; dogs were also observed for any adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par15">This assessor-blinded, positive controlled, randomised, multicentre, non-inferiority clinical field study was conducted in compliance with the principles of Good Clinical Practices and with the guidelines of the World Association for the Advancement of Veterinary Parasitology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p id="Par16">To qualify for inclusion, a household could have no more than three dogs and two cats provided that dogs and cats did not contact each other or did not share resting places for the duration of the study. At least one household dog was required to have an infestation of at least five fleas, and all household dogs were required to be at least 8 weeks of age and weigh at least 2&#x000a0;kg. The first household dog presenting with an infestation of at least five fleas was the primary dog on which all study assessments would be used for effectiveness calculations. All household dogs were required to be healthy or to have conditions judged by the investigating veterinarian as not likely to interfere with the objectives of the study. The owner or authorised agent was required to provide informed consent as a condition of enrolment.</p><p id="Par17">A household was excluded from the study if it contained dogs that were convalescent, or if there were dogs that were pregnant or lactating, or that were intended for breeding until 4&#x000a0;months following the last treatment administration. Households would be removed from the study at any time at the discretion of the investigator or study sponsor for reasons that included protocol non-compliance (for instance, treatment with a study-proscribed product such as one that had any effectiveness against fleas), the appearance of concomitant disease, or development of a serious adverse event that was incompatible with continuation in the study.</p><p id="Par18">Non-primary dogs in each household were treated with the same product as the primary dogs, and data from these supplementary dogs were included for assessments of palatability (for lotilaner) and safety. Cats and other non-study animals in enrolled households were treated during the study with a commercial ectoparasiticide, efficacious against fleas, provided by the enrolling clinic. These animals were not involved in any efficacy, palatability or safety evaluations.</p><p id="Par19">All dogs were kept with their owners under their usual housing conditions before, during and after the study. Because one of the study products was applied topically, bathing/immersion in water within 2 days after application and more frequent bathing than once a week was to be avoided. Dogs were not allowed to swim in watercourses for 2 days after application, and any water contact was to be documented by the owner.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Randomisation and treatment</title><p id="Par20">Within each clinic, dogs were randomised per household to the treatment groups in the sequence of inclusion designated by the randomization plan, using a block design and a 2:1 ratio (lotilaner:fipronil), with a targeted total enrolment of 180 households. The first household dog presenting with an infestation of at least five fleas was the primary dog on which all study assessments would be used for effectiveness calculations. All dogs, including supplementary household dogs, were observed for any adverse events.</p><p id="Par21">All dogs from any household were randomised to the same treatment group: Group 1 households were dispensed lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets (Credelio&#x02122;, Elanco, Basel, Switzerland), available in five tablet sizes (56.25&#x000a0;mg, 112.5&#x000a0;mg, 225&#x000a0;mg, 450&#x000a0;mg and 900&#x000a0;mg), to be administered on the basis of each household dog&#x02019;s body weight to achieve a minimum dose of 20&#x000a0;mg/kg. At the initial visit and at the second and third visits, the dispenser in each clinic provided the appropriate number of tablets for each household dog to be treated on a single occasion on each of Days 0, 28 (&#x000b1; 2) and 56 (&#x000b1; 2). Owners were instructed to feed their dogs within 30&#x000a0;min prior to treatment. Group 2 households were dispensed a formulation of fipronil 10% (Frontline&#x000ae; Spot on, Merial), available in three sizes (0.67&#x000a0;ml, 1.34&#x000a0;ml or 2.68&#x000a0;ml), for at-home application on each of Days 0, 28 (&#x000b1; 2), and 56 (&#x000b1; 2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study assessments</title><p id="Par22">Whole-body flea counts were completed on primary dogs on Days 0, 14 (&#x000b1; 2), 28 (&#x000b1; 2), 56 (&#x000b1; 2) and 84 (&#x000b1; 2). Each primary dog was combed thoroughly, according to a specific sequence, for at least 10&#x000a0;min, continuing until at least 5&#x000a0;min after the last flea was found. Flea counts were censored at 101; i.e. all counts above 100 were recorded as &#x0201c;more than 100&#x0201d;. In the statistical analysis, these values were treated as 101. There were very few such values (all but one occurring at baseline; one occurred in the fipronil group at the Day 28 assessment, so any bias caused by treating these values as 101 should be in favour of fipronil). Fleas that were retrieved were placed into sealable plastic bags, stored deep-frozen at approximately minus 18&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and forwarded to a laboratory for speciation using established morphological keys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Physical examinations, body weight measurements and FAD assessments were completed on each primary dog at each visit. Blood and urine samples were collected for clinical pathology evaluations on Days 0 and 84 (or earlier for dogs prematurely exiting the study).</p><p id="Par24">The three study populations for assessments were: the safety population, consisting of all dogs, primary and supplementary, that were randomised to a treatment group and that received at least one dose of either study product; the intent-to-treat (ITT) population consisting of all primary dogs in each treatment group; and the per-protocol (PP) population, consisting of all primary dogs without major protocol violations. The analyses of efficacy were based on the ITT population, and assessments were also conducted to compare with the results of the PP population.</p><p id="Par25">The effectiveness of each treatment was assessed by comparing baseline flea comb counts on Day 0 with those scheduled at 14 (&#x000b1; 2), 28 (&#x000b1; 2), 56 (&#x000b1; 2), and 84 (&#x000b1; 2) days after the first treatment administration. Efficacy was determined on the basis of the percent reduction in flea counts from pre- to post-dosing within each treatment group.

Calculation of geometric means involved taking the logarithm of the flea count of each dog. If any of the flea counts were equal to zero, a one was added to the count for every animal in the group and then subtracted from the resultant mean prior to calculating percent effectiveness.</p><p id="Par28">For flea counts, treatment groups were compared by analysis of (co)variance (AN(C)OVA) methods if the assumption of normal distribution was satisfied on the original scale or after possible log transformation. In the ANCOVA, the number of dogs per household was used as a covariate. Non-inferiority was claimed if the two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of flea counts (or FAD scores) for lotilaner, divided by the same value for fipronil, lay completely within the interval (0, 1/0.85) or (0, 1.17), providing 97.5% confidence that flea counts (or FAD scores) from lotilaner treatment were not higher than flea counts (or FAD scores) from fipronil treatment, up to a non-inferiority margin of 15%. Superiority was claimed if the 95% CI lay completely within the interval (0, 1), providing 97.5% confidence that flea counts (or FAD scores) from lotilaner treatment were lower than flea counts (or FAD scores) from fipronil treatment. FAD scores were also compared to baseline with the Wilcoxon test for paired samples.</p><p id="Par29">Each primary dog was graded for six clinical signs of FAD - pruritus, erythema, scaling, papules, alopecia, and dermatitis/pyodermatitis - using a 4-point scale: 0 (absent); 1 (mild); 2 (moderate); and 3 (severe) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For pruritus, the scoring was: 0, none/no scratching; 1, occasional scratching; 2, frequent scratching and/or self-biting; and 3, intense scratching/biting. The FAD score calculated for each primary dog at each time point was the sum of the clinical sign scores and when data were adequate, total FAD scores were to be analysed within treatment group over time and/or at each time point, and between the treatment groups.</p><p id="Par30">For sex, age, body weight, breed, hair length, husbandry, animal spends time indoor/outdoor, summary statistics and/or frequencies were calculated.

Palatability was determined according to the guideline of the European Medicines Agency, Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use, based on acceptance when the lotilaner flavoured tablet was offered to the dog in an empty bowl or trough, or on the ground during 60&#x000a0;s, or if the tablet was accepted when offered by hand for an additional 60&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Translation</title><p>French translation of the Abstract is available in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. </p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Animals and treatments</title><p id="Par32">One hundred and ninety-two primary dogs (households) were enrolled into the study, 128 in the lotilaner group and 64 in the fipronil group, at five clinics in Germany, five clinics in Hungary, and seven clinics in Portugal. Clinics were geographically dispersed across each country. Including supplementary dogs in each household, the safety population comprised 180 dogs treated with lotilaner and 91 with fipronil. Owners reported administering treatments per schedule, and all treatments were successfully administered by owners. Across the safety population, the administered lotilaner dose rate ranged from 20.1 to 40.7&#x000a0;mg/kg. Eighty percent of lotilaner treatments were voluntarily accepted either from an empty food bowl or on the ground, or from the hand.

Whether for one, two or three consecutive treatments at four-week intervals, the results demonstrate that not only was lotilaner non-inferior to fipronil, as shown by the lower 97.5% confidence interval at all post-Day 0 assessments, but in fact was significantly more effective (<italic>t</italic>

The effectiveness of lotilaner treatment against flea burdens was evident at the first post-treatment assessment on Day 14 when over 90% of treated dogs were free of fleas, arithmetic mean flea counts were reduced by 99%, and there were substantial improvements in signs of FAD.</p><p id="Par43">Improvements in FAD were observed at the first post-treatment assessment, with an overall reduction in mean total FAD scores of 80.8% by Day 14, increasing to 99.0% on Day 56 and 98.6% on Day 84. The Day 0 prednisolone treatments dispensed at one clinic to alleviate the signs of FAD in eight dogs allocated to the lotilaner group would likely have contributed to the improvement seen at Day 14. The absence of FAD relapse in these dogs and the ongoing reductions in FAD in all study dogs, with similar reductions in pruritus scores, indicate the dog health benefits of lotilaner administered as part of a treatment strategy to control FAD signs.</p><p id="Par44">Lotilaner has been shown to have sustained activity against fleas for at least 5 weeks post-treatment, consistently killing 100% of newly infesting fleas within 12&#x000a0;h, before fleas would have begun egg-laying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Thus by quickly killing fleas, lotilaner rapidly eliminates a source of irritation, while at the same time causing a progressive depletion in the biomass of developing flea stages in the dog&#x02019;s environment.</p><p id="Par45">The continued presence of fleas in nine of 64 primary dogs that received fipronil, including four dogs in which final flea counts were higher than at baseline, one of which had a flea count of 53 fleas, is consistent with a similar failure of fipronil efficacy reported from a study completed in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Reasons for the failure of fipronil (or any topical product) have been attributed to difficulties in extruding the entire dose from the package, ensuring that entire contents are deposited on the skin and not just superficially on the hair, and restraining the treated dog sufficiently to ensure there is no product run-off. Alternatively, the possibility of emerging resistance to fipronil cannot be ignored, given the widespread use of this compound over the last 20&#x000a0;years, identification of resistance in the brown dog tick <italic>Rhipicephalus sanguineus</italic>, and the well-established recognition of resistance in agricultural pests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Further investigation is therefore warranted to determine the cause of fipronil treatment failures in client-owned dogs.</p><p id="Par46">The ongoing findings of fleas in fipronil-treated dogs and the clinic reports of non-study dogs presenting with flea infestations during the study period indicate that the reductions in flea burdens in the lotilaner-group dogs were due to the effectiveness of treatment in conditions that were conducive to flea challenge. The identification of both <italic>C. felis</italic> and <italic>C. canis</italic> at enrollment and the elimination of these fleas during the course of the study demonstrate that lotilaner is effective against both these flea species. The very few transient adverse events observed in lotilaner-treated dogs, none of which were directly attributed to treatment, verify the safety of lotilaner when administered by clients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">The results of this study, undertaken in a diverse range of client-owned dogs, demonstrates that under a wide range of real-world conditions in Europe, lotilaner flavoured chewable tablets are palatable and well tolerated by dogs. A single treatment resulted in a 99.1% reduction from baseline in geometric mean (arithmetic mean 99.0%) flea counts, and three consecutive treatments at 28-day intervals sustained that level of reduction, significantly outperforming a topical fipronil product administered according to the same schedule. The high efficacy shown by lotilaner resulted in a substantial reduction in, or elimination of signs of flea allergy dermatitis, including reductions in pruritus.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par54">
