Avulsion injury is associated with compromised esthetic.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The reported incidence of tooth avulsions ranges from 1% to 16% of all traumatic injuries occurring in permanent dentition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Avulsion injury, one of the most severe forms of dental trauma, is characterized by complete displacement of the tooth from its alveolar socket. Because of the complexity of avulsion, neurovascular supply is severely compromised and usually results in loss of pulp vitality. A vital periodontal membrane (PDM) has been found to be of ultimate importance for the successful healing of replanted teeth.</p><p>Two of the most critical factors affecting the prognosis of an avulsed tooth after replantation are extra oral dry time and the storage medium in which the tooth is placed.

Usually, avulsion involves single tooth, and the most frequently avulsed tooth is maxillary central incisor.</p><p>The healing pattern of an avulsed tooth after replantation will depend upon the healing potential of each cellular component of the tissues involved. Prognosis of a replanted tooth will depend on minimal damage to the PDL, which is critical for regeneration of the attachment apparatus and also to protect root from resorption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Extra oral time and storage conditions are the most crucial factors in determining the viability of the remaining PDL cells, and thus the survivability of the avulsed tooth. Studies have shown that an avulsed tooth can be replanted without complications after 1-3 hours of being placed in suitable storage conditions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>An ideal storage medium would be one that is capable of preserving the viability, mitogenicity, and clonogenic capacity of the damaged PDL in order to facilitate repopulation of the denuded root surface thereby preventing further root resorption.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The storage medium should have a physiological osmolarity and pH and should be maintained at an appropriate temperature to allow optimal cell growth or survival. Finally, the ideal storage media should be readily available for use in emergency situations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>This study focused on evaluation and comparison of efficacy of three different storage media-ORS, coconut water and propolis in maintaining the viability of PDL cells by using a collagenase-dispase assay.</p><p>The biologically pure, tender coconut water is readily accepted by the body because it is sterile and thus used as a blood plasma substitute. It also helps to replace fluids, electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and magnesium), and sugar lost from the body during heavy physical exercise. Gopikrishna <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] found that coconut water was superior to HBSS or milk in terms of maintaining PDL cell viability after avulsion and storage. It has high potassium content and contains antioxidants linked to a variety of health benefits. Cytokinins in coconut water may be among its most beneficial components.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>Propolis is a multifunctional material used by bees in the construction and maintenance of their hives. Recently, it has attracted much attention as a useful substance applied in medicine and cosmetics because of its antibacterial and antifungal activities. In general, propolis is composed of 50% resin and vegetable balsam, 30% wax, 10% essential and aromatic oils, 5% pollen, and 5% various other substances.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Also Ozan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] evaluated the effect of propolis on survival of PDL and found propolis to be a superior transport medium to HBSS or milk in terms of maintaining PDL cell viability after avulsion and storage.</p><p>ORS is an easily available rehydration solution. It contains sodium 75 mmol [1725 mg], glucose 75 mmol [13.5 gm, 1.35%], potassium 20 mmol [782 mg], chloride 65 mmol [2801 mg], and base (citrate) 10 mmol. It is a hypotonic solution with osmolarity between 270 and 300 mOsm/L.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>Various techniques have been used to quantitate the number of viable PDL cells like a stepwise by Reinholdt <italic>et al</italic>., Chromogenic stain by Soder <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>In the current study to minimize the exposure of cells to active trypsin and to preserve maximum cell viability, the root surface was treated with collagenase and dispase grade II as was performed in the work by Pileggi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p><p>This procedure allowed rapid cell retrieval and maintained maximum cellular integrity, as was demonstrated by the positive control samples. This method is more representative of the actual clinical situation because the cells are not subjected to long processing times to determine their viability status. Collagenase and dispase assay provides a combination of collagenolytic and proteolytic enzymes required for tissue disaggregation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p><p>Also, we used fetal bovine serum as growth supplement for cell culture media because of its high content of embryonic growth promoting factors. When used at appropriate concentrations, it supplies many defined and undefined components that have been shown to satisfy specific metabolic requirements for the culture of cells <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The trypan blue exclusion staining technique was used because it is quick, easily performed, and distinctively differentiates nonviable cells from viable cells. It is based on the principle that live cells possess intact cell membranes that exclude certain dyes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>In this test, a cell suspension is simply mixed with dye and then visually examined to determine whether cells take up or exclude dye. In the protocol presented here, a viable cell will have a clear cytoplasm whereas a nonviable cell will have a blue cytoplasm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]</p><p>The results of the prevailing study indicated that coconut water group demonstrated a significantly higher number of viable PDL cells than propolis 50%, and ORS. There was no significant difference between coconut water and propolis 50% groups.</p><p>Ideal requirements for a storage media as suggested by Blomof[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] are 290-330 mOsm/L and a pH of 6.6 to 7.8. Even though the osmolarity of ORS is comparable the pH is significantly less than the ideal which may be the reason for the comparatively lesser number of viable PDL cells in this study.</p><p>It remains to be explored, whether the modification of ORS by addition of common day to day product could increase its pH to the required level to optimize its efficacy as storage media.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>JY</given-names></name><name><surname>Vann</surname><given-names>WF</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Sigurdsson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of avulsed permanent incisors: A decision analysis based on on changing concepts</article-title><source>Pediatr Dent</source><year>2001</year><volume>23</volume><fpage>357</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11572500</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bloml&#x000f6;f</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindskog</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Hedstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hammarstr&#x000f6;m</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Storage of experimentally avulsed teeth in milk prior to replantation</article-title><source>J Dent Res</source><year>1983</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>912</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6575041</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gopikrishna</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Baweja</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Venkateshbabu</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomas</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kandaswamy</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparision of coconut water, propolis, HBSS, and milk on PDL cell survival</article-title><source>J Endod</source><year>2008</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>587</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18436040</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Wesley</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of infant rehydration solutions; product evaluation</article-title><year>2004</year><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2011 Jul 08</date-in-citation><fpage>1</fpage><lpage>4</lpage><comment>Available from:
