The block meets the axillary and musculocutaneous nerves at the level of the cords before these nerves leave the brachial plexus sheath. In contrast to interscalene and supraclavicular blocks, the infraclavicular approach carries minor risks of intravertebral, intrathecal, or epidural injection, phrenic nerve paralysis or stellate ganglion block. However, it carries the risk of pneumothorax, nerve injury, or hematoma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The use of ultrasound enhances the practitioners&#x02019; ability to view the surrounding anatomy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and adenosine mediate many biological processes in the body as neurotransmission, transduction of signals, cardiac function, vasodilatation, and platelet function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Both are released from variable cell types to interact with purinergic receptors present on the surface of the cells. Inside the body, ATP is metabolized rapidly to adenosine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Variable types of purinergic receptors mediate <italic>in vivo</italic> signal transmission by ATP and adenosine. These purinergic receptors determine the different and final effects induced by ATP and adenosine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Adenosine has an important role in the central and peripheral mediation of pain. Adenosine A1, A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors were detected in the spinal cord. The A1 receptor plays an important role in spinal antinociception, whereas the role of the A2A, A2B, and A3 receptors is still vague. A2A and A3 receptors mediate pain transmission peripherally, whereas the A1 receptor seems to have a central antinociceptive effect. Analgesia was achieved in animals by raising the levels of extracellular adenosine through inhibition of adenosine kinase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>This study was aimed to determine the analgesic efficacy of adenosine in combination with a local anesthetic solution for ICB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was carried out in Minoufiya University Hospital on 60 adult patients undergoing minor orthopedic surgeries in the hand and forearm after a written informed consent was obtained from the patients and institutional review board approval was obtained.</p><p>Careful history taking, thorough clinical examination and biochemical analysis, was performed to ensure that patients were ASA I or II physical status.</p><p>All patients underwent the ICB (the coracoid approach) by a continuous infusion. The patients were randomly allocated to receive bupivacaine (<italic>n</italic>=30) or bupivacaine + adenosine (<italic>n</italic>=30) by random numbers (Microsoft EXCEL). Randomization was done centrally by an independent statistician to ensure appropriate concealment. Allocation of study management was concealed from patients, primary investigators, and all coinvestigators until the release of the final statistical analysis. The placebo vs. adenosine mixture injectates were supplied by the pharmacy.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>The exclusion criteria are patient refusal, peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain, chronic analgesic use, coagulopathy, history of brachial plexus injury, known allergy to the study drugs, systemic infection, and sepsis at the site of injection or operations in the shoulder.</p><p>The patients were instructed to avoid taking adenosine antagonist as theophylline, other methylxanthines, and beverages such as coffee and tea the day before surgery and for 2 days postoperatively. In addition, the patients were instructed preoperatively in the use of the visual analogue scale for pain evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>The technique</title><p>The patient was in the supine position with the head facing away from the side to be anesthetized. The premedication of the patient was 1&#x02013;2 mg of midazolam i.v. In addition, 50&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl i.v. was administered just before insertion of the needle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] This typically produced tranquil and analgesic patients for the procedure and no cases of respiratory depression were reported. Local injection of 4 ml lidocaine 1% was done at the puncture site. The patient was continuously monitored during the technique and thereafter (continuous ECG, pulse oxymetry, and noninvasive blood pressure).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Equipment</title><p>An ultrasound machine + 8&#x02013;12 MHz probe was used. The ultrasound probe (8&#x02013;12 MHz) of a Hewlett-Packard 77020A ultrasound monitor (Andover, MA, USA) was applied in the parasagital plane close to the coracoid process and directed to best visualize the axillary artery.</p><p>A 10-cm long 18-G nontraumatic insulated needle (Plexolong; Pajunk, Geisingen, Germany) attached to a nerve stimulator was applied immediately next to the ultrasound probe at approximately 60&#x02013;70&#x000b0; angle and in line with the longitudinal axis of the probe. The needle insertion angle was in parallel to the long axis of the probe to be capable of seeing the path of the needle on the ultrasound screen.</p><p>A nerve stimulator (Stimuplex<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ; Braun, Melsungen, Germany) was combined with the ultrasound to make sure that what is seen on the ultrasound screen reflects the brachial plexus. Initial stimulating current was 0.6&#x02013;0.8 mA. Brachial plexus was reached at the depth of 6&#x02013;8 cm. The stimulating current was then gradually decreased until the sought response was still present at 0.3 mA or less. Twitches from biceps muscle were not accepted, since the musculocutaneous branch may be outside the brachial sheath and the needle was redirected inferiorly and slightly medially to get stimulation of the median nerve. Stimulation of the axillary nerve (deltoid muscle twitch) was not accepted as the axillary nerve is often outside the brachial sheath at this level, and the needle was redirected more superiorly. Twitches from triceps, forearm, and hand muscles were accepted for the successful block.</p><p>The needle was withdrawn leaving the cannula. A 20-gauge multiperforated (epidural-type) catheter was inserted through the cannula. The cannula was withdrawn, leaving the catheter in place. The catheter was secured by sutures to the skin and covered with a bioocclusive dressing.</p><p>Aspiration through the catheter was performed to detect unintentional intravascular placement. A single test dose of 4 ml 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 5 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>-1</sup> was administered, followed by the loading dose of local anesthetic given incrementally. The injectate was 30 ml of 0.325% bupivacaine alone in group I or 30 ml of 0.325% bupivacaine + 12 mg adenosine in group II. The block was maintained with an infusion of 10 ml hr <sup>-1</sup> of local anesthetic solution with the same content and concentration as the initial injectate. The infusion was stopped 2 h after surgery. Adenosine injection (Adenocard<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) was supplied as a sterile nonpyrogenic solution in normal saline; 6 mg 2 mL<sup>-1</sup> (3 mg mL <sup>-1</sup> ) in 2 mL (fill volume Ansyr<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> plastic disposable syringe), manufactured by Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, IL 60045, USA. The 12 mg adenosine dose was used as it is a safe dose regarding the effect on hemodynamics if inadvertent intravascular injection occurred. Doses higher than 12 mg are not recommended.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The pH of the injectate was 4.5 in both groups and the injectate had the same osmolarity and volume in both groups.</p><p>Attention was given to signs and symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity and catheter migration. Oral 1 g paracetamol tablet was given regularly every 6 h starting at 12 h postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Parameters and recordings</title><p>

Adenosine 80 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup> or saline (control) was infused intravenously in a double-blind manner for 1 h. The time to pain feeling was significantly longer in the adenosine group compared to the control group (438 &#x000b1; 387 vs. 290 &#x000b1; 227 min, <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). Whereas, the pain scores, time to first rescue analgesic, and total analgesic requirements showed no difference.</p><p>The effects of subarachnoid administration of adenosine analogs on substance P concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid were investigated in rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The authors reported that subarachnoid injection of adenosine analogs reduces the substance P in cerebrospinal fluid and produces behavioral effects that denote antinociception in rats.</p><p>In another study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] on a rat model of neuropathic pain, the effect, mechanisms of action, and interaction with noradrenergic systems of subarachnoid adenosine was studied. The authors concluded that, after nerve injury, adenosine reduces hypersensitivity through spinal norepinephrine release and recommended its use in the treatment of chronic pain states.</p><p>In contradiction with our findings, some studies reported that adenosine has no analgesic effect. Habib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] reported that i.v. adenosine had no analgesic effect in major gynecologic surgery. The patients were randomly allocated to receive four different doses of adenosine (25, 50, 100, or 200 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> min<sup>-1</sup>) or matching placebo. Opioid use during the initial 24-h period after surgery was not significantly different between groups. The groups showed no differences regarding the cumulative anesthetic use, pain scores, patient satisfaction with pain control, intraoperative opioid requirements, sedation, opioid-related symptom distress scores, time to readiness for discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, time to readiness for discharge from the hospital, and occurrence of adverse events.</p><p>In addition, Rane <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] stated that intrathecal adenosine had no analgesic effect in 25 healthy parturients requesting labor analgesia. Patients received 10 &#x003bc;g of sufentanil + 500&#x003bc;g of adenosine or 10 &#x003bc;g of sufentanil intrathecally. Pain scores showed no difference between groups.
