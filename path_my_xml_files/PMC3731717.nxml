<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> The major reasons for the decreased effect of interventions in clinical practice are delayed intervention for prodromal depressive and manic episodes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> as well as decreased medical adherence.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13 R14 R15">13&#x02013;15</xref></p><p>During the last decades, there has been an organisational shift in paradigm from inpatient to outpatient treatment in healthcare, and in bipolar disorder there is an emerging shift in illness paradigm from a focus on mood episodes to a focus on the interepisodic mood instability.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> However, current monitoring of bipolar disorder illness activity is based on the identification and analysis of mood episodes at different intervals of time, often on a monthly basis during outpatient facility visits.</p><p>Recently, electronic self-monitoring of affective symptoms using cell phones to prompt patients to respond to weekly text messages was proposed as an easy and inexpensive way to monitor and identify early signs of emerging affective episodes so that providers could intervene shortly after prodromal symptoms appeared.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> However, the used electronic devices have been rather simple, not including a bidirectional feedback loop between patients and providers and without electronic data on &#x02018;objective&#x02019; measures of the affective psychopathology. It has never been tested in a randomised trial whether the continued use of an electronic device, including a feedback loop, improves affective symptoms and other outcomes in bipolar disorder.</p><p>In the MONitoring, treAtment and pRediCtion of bipolAr disorder episodes (MONARCA) study, we developed and are currently testing in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) the software for Android Smartphones to monitor the subjective and objective activities of bipolar disorder alongside with treatment adherence in a bidirectional feedback loop between patients and providers. The software system includes the recording of subjective items such as mood/irritability,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> sleep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and alcohol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> that may reflect or correlate with illness activity in bipolar disorder. As the ability of these subjective measures to detect prodromal symptoms of depression and mania may not be sufficient, we have also included objective measures such as speech, social and physical activity in the software system. Decreased activity in speech (paucity of speech) seems to be a sensitive and valid measure of prodromal symptoms of depression<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> and conversely increased speech activity (talkativeness) predicts a switch to hypomania.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>

Recruitment started in September 2011. The Clinic for Affective Disorders is a specialised outpatient clinic that covers a recruitment area of the Capital Region, Denmark, corresponding to 1.4 million people. The staff consists of full-time specialists in psychiatry with specific clinical experience and knowledge about the diagnosis and treatment of bipolar disorder as well as certified psychologists, nurses and a social worker with experience in bipolar disorder. Patients with bipolar disorder are referred to the clinic from secondary healthcare when a diagnosis of a single mania or bipolar disorder is made for the first time<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> or in the case of occurrence of treatment resistance, that is, persistent affective symptoms or recurrences despite treatment in standard care. The physicians at the clinic follow the patients with evidence-based pharmacological treatment and regular appointments depending on their clinical status and needs. Treatment at the clinic comprises combined psychopharmacological treatment and supporting therapy for a 2-year period.</p><p>Bipolar patients are referred to the clinic after the first, second or third admission and asked to participate after initial assessment by a psychiatrist. Following referral to the clinic, the clinicians make the diagnosis of bipolar disorder and subsequently introduce the MONARCA study to all patients except those who are either pregnant, older than 60&#x02005;years or have a lack of Danish language skills.</p><p>Inclusion criteria: bipolar disorder diagnosis according to ICD-10 using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Hamilton Depression Rating scale score (HDRS), 17 items &#x02264;17<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> and Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score &#x02264;17<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> at the time of inclusion and age between 18 and 60&#x02005;years.</p><p>Exclusion criteria: significant physical illness, schizophrenia or other F2 diagnoses according to the SCAN interview, unwillingness to use the project Smartphone as the primary cell phone, inability to learn the necessary technical skills for being able to use the Smartphone, lack of Danish language skills and pregnancy.</p><p>Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and having none of the exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study procedure</title><p>Following referral to the MONARCA trial, potential participants were screened and if they met the criteria for participating in the trial, they were included.

The primary outcome was differences in the level of affective symptoms based on the HDRS score and YMRS score respectively. The clinical relevant difference is defined as the minimum of three scores and the SD was set to four with a mean score of 10 vs 7 in the two groups. The statistical power to detect a three score difference in the areas under the curves between the intervention and the control groups on the HDRS score or the YMRS score, respectively, was 80% with &#x003b1;=0.05 for a two-sample comparison of means including 28 patients in the intervention group and 28 patients in the placebo group. The dropout rate is estimated to be around 25%.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomisation</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Sequence generation</title><p>A computer-generated list of random allocation numbers was carried out by an independent researcher (KM) using randomisation.com. Since the course of illness and effect of the intervention could be influenced by age and previous hospitalisation, stratification is carried out on age (18&#x02013;30 vs &#x0003e;30) and previous hospitalisation (yes or no). Stratification is carried out to ensure good balance of these patient characteristics in each randomisation group so that the number of patients receiving the intervention MONARCA Smartphone or placebo MONARCA Smartphone was balanced within each stratum. Allocation was 1:1. Within each stratum, a fixed block randomisation size of 10 is used. The block size was unknown to all the clinicians recruiting patients to the trial and the study nurse allocating participants to their correct randomisation arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Allocation concealment and implementation</title><p>The allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher (MFJ and ASJ) enrolling and assessing patients. Allocation was concealed in numbered, opaque and sealed envelopes stored in a securely locked cabinet by a secretary until the moment of randomisation. Allocation was identified by the letter A or B written on the paper in the envelopes and this indicated the type of intervention. The translation of allocation as A or B was made and known only to LVK and the study nurse. A paper with this translation was kept in a securely locked cabinet unknown to others than LVK. The secretary gave the envelope to the study nurse. Corresponding envelopes were opened only after all baseline assessment was performed and the patient&#x02019;s name was written on the envelope. The study nurse assigned patients to their allocation of intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Blinding</title><p>Owing to the type of intervention in this trial, the patients and the study nurse were aware of the allocation arm. The researchers responsible for outcome assessments (MFJ and ASJ) and data analysis (MFJ) were kept blinded to allocation at all times during the trial. The trial was therefore single-blinded. The study nurse did not collect any kind of outcome measures. All patients were thoroughly and repeatedly instructed not to mention anything about allocation to intervention at each visit with the researcher. The risk of unblinding due to simply seeing the type of mobile phone in the patient&#x02019;s hands was minimised since all patients received the same type of mobile phone.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data will be managed by MFJ and entered using Epidata. All analyses will be done using <italic>Statistical Package for the Social Sciences</italic> (SPSS). Data from all randomised patients will be collected until dropout or the end of the study period. The outcome is changes in affective symptoms measured as HDRS and YMRS during the 6-month study period. We will employ a linear mixed effects model with random intercept for each participant. Differences between outcomes of the interventions during the 6&#x02005;months study period will be analysed, first unadjusted and then adjusted for age, previously psychiatric hospitalisations (yes/no) and sex, if these variables present with a p&#x02264;0.1 in univariate analyses. Analysis will be carried out with intention-to-treat (ITT). The statistical threshold for significance is p&#x02264;0.05 (two-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>Ethical permission for the MONARCA study has been obtained from the Regional Ethics Committee in The Capital Region of Denmark (H-2-2011-056) and The Danish Data Protection Agency (2013-41-1710). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01446406.

This left 123 patients to be assessed for eligibility for the trial. Of these, three patients had an HDRS score &#x02265;17 for a prolonged period of time and two were unable to speak Danish. Thus, so far a total of 118 patients have been eligible, but 32 declined to participate, four were unwilling to use our Smartphone as their primary Smartphone and we could not contact four patients. Until the time of submission, the participation rate was 66.1% and the dropout rate during the 6&#x02005;months follow-up period was 12.8%. Until the time of submission, a total of eight patients dropped out at baseline before knowledge of their allocation to intervention and two patients dropped out during the 6-month study period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomised trial to test whether electronic monitoring may improve long-term outcome in mental illness, in this case bipolar disorder. A major advantage in the MONARCA trial is that the system is developed and tested in a pilot study in a close collaboration between patients suffering from bipolar disorder, clinicians (specialists in psychiatry and nurses with specific clinical expertise within bipolar disorder) as well as clinical researchers within bipolar disorder and IT researchers.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><sec id="s4a1"><title>The intervention</title><p>We decided to investigate the effect of a total system combining electronic self-monitoring and a feedback system between patients and clinicians in order to help patients acknowledge illness activity and identify and react more adequately on early warning signs and triggers of affective episodes. The study is designed to investigate the total effect of this intervention versus placebo intervention and, consequently, we will not be able to address more specifically the effect of the individual elements of the intervention, such as for example, the effect of subjective self-monitoring on its own.</p></sec><sec id="s4a2"><title>Control group</title><p>It is a major challenge in any non-medical trial to define a proper control group. We decided to include a control group of patients who received the same Smartphone but without the MONARCA software system, that is, a placebo Smartphone. Patients in the placebo group did not make any subjective electronic self-monitoring of symptoms or behaviour and they were not monitored with the feedback loop, but their illness activity was monitored &#x02018;objectively&#x02019; in the same way as for the intervention group using Smartphone data to monitor speech duration, social activity and physical activity and they followed treatment as usual in the clinic.</p></sec><sec id="s4a3"><title>Objective measures of illness activity?</title><p>Possible electronic objective measures of illness activity have never been studied, as electronic monitoring in healthcare is a new and unstudied area. If successful, this may be a major breakthrough for treatment of bipolar disorder and for research in bipolar disorder. We will be able to validate Smartphone generated data of speech duration, social activity and physical activity against repeated measures of HAM D-17 and YMRS score over a 6-month period. Anyhow, as this is the first trial to investigate electronic monitoring, we were not able to provide feedback to the patients allocated to the active intervention arm on these objective data. We are currently transferring the Smartphone-generated data on these objective items into useful simple information that can be provided to the patients in a future revised MONARCA application.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalisability</title><p>The study was carried out in a tertiary specialised mood disorder clinic. However, the trial has a pragmatic design with few exclusion criteria and few patients were excluded. The majority of patients entering the trial are in an early course of the illness with a newly diagnosis of single mania or bipolar disorder. Further, as the MONARCA system is easy to use for both patients and clinicians with a high appeal and low dropout rate, we believe that the findings of the trial can be generalised to patients with bipolar disorder in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Perspectives</title><p>If the Smartphone self-monitoring system proves to be effective in preventing mood symptoms and improving psychosocial functioning and quality of life in the present study, there will be a basis for extending the use of the system to treatment of patients with bipolar disorder in clinical practice in other clinical settings (eg, community psychiatric centres) and on a larger scale. Using electronic self-monitoring may improve patient empowerment in relation to bipolar disorder and treatment. Potentially, electronic self-monitoring may be applied in relation to patients suffering from other psychiatric disorders with development of other software systems. In this way, it is possible that outpatient treatment can be optimised in general and that the frequency of physician and other clinical visits can be decreased.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e179" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003353.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the clinicians and specialists in psychiatry Rie Lamb&#x000e6;k Mikkelsen and Ulla Knorr for participating in the recruitment of patients, the patients for participating in this trial, Anne Sophie Jacoby (ASJ) for helping with the assessments and Hanne Steenberg Nikolajsen for running the feedback loop intervention.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LVK, MV, EMC and MFJ conceived the trial and authored the first draft of the trial protocols.
