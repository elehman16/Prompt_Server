Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as well as unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) are dynamic blood constituents whose involvement in age-associated diseases is largely unexplored. To our knowledge, there are no published studies integrating all three parameters, especially in individuals of advanced age. Here we present a secondary analysis from the Vienna Active Aging Study (VAAS), a randomized controlled intervention trial in institutionalized elderly individuals (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;101). Using an exploratory approach we combine three blood-based molecular markers (TL, UCB and cfDNA) with a range of primary and secondary outcomes from the intervention. We further look at the changes occurring in these parameters after 6-month resistance exercise training with or without supplementation. A correlation between UCB and TL was evident at baseline (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and both were associated with increased chromosomal anomalies such as nucleoplasmatic bridges and nuclear buds (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Of the three main markers explored in this paper, only cfDNA decreased significantly (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) after 6-month training and dietary intervention. No clear relationship could be established between cfDNA and either UCB or TL. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01775111).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Ageing is accompanied by an accumulation of macromolecular damage, leading to cellular dysfunction and ultimately, tissue and organ malfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In humans the ageing process appears to be a mixture of stochastic events leading to a high variability of phenotypical outcomes between individuals of the same age.</p><p>Telomere length is one of the most commonly used markers of ageing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Telomere shortening is a result of the mitotic activity of a cell, and in humans it roughly corresponds to the age of the organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. On the other hand, telomere length has a limited power as an age biomarker due to a very high inter-individual variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. While a clear decline is visible when comparing healthy individuals throughout a broad age range, this difference is often negligible over a more narrow range. This is especially the case when comparing individuals at a more advanced age, when telomeres appear to shorten at a reduced rate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>. Moreover, studies in humans often use blood cells as a test material for measuring telomere length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>. As blood cells comprise a mixture of different individual cell types with different mitotic history, telomere length measured in these samples can additionally show a large intra-individual variability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>. Therefore, there is an increased need for identifying reliable and clinically accessible molecular markers of ageing, which would complement telomere length as a marker<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>.</p><p>It has been previously shown<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> that chromosomal abnormalities arise more frequently in the elderly population. The increased chromosomal instability, in absence of malignancy, will ultimately lead to increase in cell death. Dying and dead cells release their content extracellularly, and a portion of the genomic DNA can be found circulating in the bloodstream before final excretion as a waste product<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. A recent review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> suggests the possibility of cell-free genomic-derived DNA (cfDNA) integration into the genome of living cells, leading further to increased genome instability.</p><p>Breitbach <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> proposed that this circulating cfDNA can be additionally excreted in an active manner from living cells and could play a role in cell signalling. Circulating concentrations of cfDNA have been shown to increase rapidly after strenuous exercise, and return to normal within hours or days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, much of the physiological and pathophysiological relevance of cfDNA remains unknown, so far.</p><p>Jylhava <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> have investigated cfDNA as a possible ageing biomarker in healthy individuals. In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) a potential involvement of the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase UGT1A1 in the excretion of cfDNA was revealed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. This enzyme is highly specific for metabolising unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) into water-soluble products that can be easily excreted from the organism<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. However, there is no published data looking at a potential relationship or interaction between UCB and cfDNA in humans.</p><p>Unconjugated bilirubin has been suggested to play an important role in human disease prevention, especially in relation to age-associated diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. A number of epidemiological studies have found an inverse relationship between increased serum bilirubin and age-associated disease incidence<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. We have recently identified a relationship between mildly increased UCB, characteristic for a condition called Gilbert&#x02019;s Syndrome, and telomere length<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. These individuals present with serum bilirubin levels above 17.1&#x02009;umol/L whereas non-affected individuals range between 3 and 17.1&#x02009;umol/L. There are indications that even in non-Gilbert&#x02019;s Syndrome individuals concentrations higher than 10&#x02009;umol/L can be indicative for a reduced disease risk<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, it is not clear whether this intermediately increased UCB concentration is linked to longer telomeres in non-affected individuals.</p><p>The Vienna Active Ageing Study (VAAS) has been investigating different aspects of the ageing process in institutionalized elderly individuals, and the effects of resistance training and nutritional supplementation intervention on overall fitness and health-related parameters. Published data on this study have shown an improvement in physical performance in individuals undergoing an exercise training intervention, compared to sedentary controls<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>, as well as a trend for a decreased chromosomal and DNA damage in the entire study population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The main aim of this paper was to investigate a potential relationship between blood telomere length, cfDNA and unconjugated bilirubin at baseline and after a 6-month training intervention. We further conducted an exploratory analysis in order to identify relationships between cfDNA, UCB and TL on one side and chromosomal damage endpoints, physical performance measures, CVD markers and oxidative damage end products on the other. Based on previous knowledge we hypothesized that there is an inverse relationship between TL and UCB on one side, and cfDNA and markers of chromosomal instability on the other.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Baseline characteristics of the entire cohort</title><p>The baseline study characteristics have been described elsewhere<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>.

Increased liver enzymes were important indicators for liver abnormality which might influence bilirubin levels, a key variable in this analysis. As the percentage of males in this study population was too low to achieve statistical relevance, we carried out all further analyses on a pooled population of both genders. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> shows that no clear distinction and clustering can be seen between males and females using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA).</p><p>Five individuals fitted the criterion for Gilbert&#x02019;s Syndrome (UCB concentration &#x02265;17.1&#x02009;&#x003bc;M), corresponding to an incidence of about 5% in our study population.

To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the interplay between these parameters within elderly individuals. Moreover, the novelty of these data is in linking these markers in response to a prolonged intervention involving exercise training with and without a dietary supplementation.</p><p>Telomere length and circulating cell-free DNA at baseline were not affected by age in this study population. The possible reason for this finding is the advanced age of the study participants leading to a relatively broad variance in most baseline parameters. All study participants were between 65 and 98 years of age, where the discrepancy between biological and chronological age is the greatest. Additionally, it is very plausible that individuals that have reached a more advanced age in good health have a more favourable molecular ageing pattern than their slightly younger peers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>.</p><p>We hypothesized that telomere length at baseline would be inversely associated with markers of chromosomal instability and oxidative DNA damage. In contrast, we expected cell-free DNA to increase with the levels of chromosomal damage. Contrary to our hypothesis, longer telomeres were associated with increased chromosomal instability at baseline, measured by an increase in nucleoplasmatic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (NBuds). Nucleoplasmatic bridges are formed as a result of erroneous DNA repair and telomere fusion of two chromosomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. This process is triggered by critical telomere shortening and uncapping. However, to our knowledge, there is no indication that NPBs formation can lead to telomere elongation. Some evidence suggests that in a case of folate deprivation NBuds might contain a larger amount of telomeric DNA, leading to an abnormal increase in telomeric content<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The present study participants indeed had an inadequate baseline level of folate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> in erythrocytes, which might partly explain our results.</p><p>Baseline concentrations of cfDNA did not reflect the extent of DNA or chromosomal damage in PBMCs occurring simultaneously, measured by the CBMN assay end-points such as micronuclei frequencies, NPBs and NBuds formation. Notably, cfDNA levels in plasma did not appear abnormally high for any of the study participants. For cfDNA integration into healthy cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>, it is likely that much higher levels of cfDNA would be required.</p><p>There was a weak positive correlation between telomere length and UCB at baseline. This is in agreement with our recent results suggesting an occurrence of longer telomeres in individuals with Gilbert&#x02019;s Syndrome, a condition of mild chronic hyperbilirubinaemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Approximately 5% of our study population matched the criterion for GS diagnosis, showing increased UCB levels over the diagnostic minimum for GS. Interestingly none of the potential GS showed a tendency for short telomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4a</xref>). However, it this setting, the group size was too small to make a statistically sound conclusion. It should be taken in consideration that the present study was conducted using a different starting material for DNA extraction (i.e. whole blood instead of isolated PBMCs) which excludes the possibility for direct comparison between the studies.</p><p>The relationship between UCB levels and cfDNA appears to be more complex. Even though there was no direct significant relationship between the two, the levels of cfDNA were consistently higher in individuals suspected for GS. These individuals have distinctly higher UCB levels and appear as outliers to the entire group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 4b</xref>). As we have no information on the UGT1A1 genotype of participants in the present study, we could only assume that the ones showing an increased UCB concentration indeed carry a mutation in their UGT1A1 gene which additionally slows down the excretion of circulating cfDNA entities. Another possibility is that the free UCB fraction in plasma is binding to the free DNA fraction. A study has reported that bilirubin can bind DNA in presence of Cu(II)-ions, which could promote oxidative DNA damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. However, more research is needed in order to get an insight if UCB and cfDNA are directly interacting, or are merely targets of the same metabolic pathway.</p><p>The main outcomes of the Vienna Active Ageing Study related to improvement in physical fitness parameters have been described earlier<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Briefly, functional parameters have been found to improve over time and related to the training intervention. In addition, chromosomal damage, such as micronuclei frequencies or NPBs showed a trend to decrease in all three groups<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. The supplementation group acquired improvements in plasma vitamin B12 and folate status in erythrocytes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. While acute exercise increases the concentration of cfDNA within hours post-exercise, it is being quickly eliminated and returns to normal values within a few days<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. However, the effect of regular moderate exercise on long-term cfDNA levels has not been reported so far. We observed a significant decrease in cfDNA levels in the RTS group after 6 months. There was no association between cfDNA and B12 or folate or the changes occurring in these parameters between the two time-points (data not shown). It is possible that there was an indirect effect of the latter two on the reduced cfDNA in plasma. As the role of circulating cfDNA is not yet well defined, we cannot exclude that the observed reduction in the training and supplementation group might not be beneficial at all as cfDNA could potentially play a role in the training adaptation.</p><p>Mean telomere length has not changed drastically throughout the course of 6 months. It has been shown previously that telomeres shorten at a rate of only about 30&#x02009;bp/year which is difficult to detect with any standard telomere measurement method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. However, there have been reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> of telomere length fluctuations with time in whole blood samples, which occurs due to a shift in cell populations throughout the intervention period. Similar to the observations from <italic>Svenson et</italic>
<italic>al</italic>., there was an inverse correlation between telomere length measured at baseline and the 6-month change, independently from the training intervention. These intra-individual fluctuations in blood telomere length should be considered carefully when using telomere length as a marker, which is its main limitation.</p><p>Similarly to the outcomes at baseline, the change in measured intracellular damage parameters in the training group is closely followed by a change in TL and UCB. Additionally, and contrary to our expectations, telomere shortening correlated with higher improvement in the chair rise test. It is unclear from our results if there is any causal relationship between these parameters.</p><p>Taken together, we have shown a relationship between telomere length, unconjugated bilirubin and chromosomal anomalies in an elderly population, in the light of a lifestyle intervention. On the other hand, cfDNA showed no connections to any of the tested parameters. Perhaps, due to the very transient nature of cfDNA, a study dealing with acute outcomes would be more appropriate.
