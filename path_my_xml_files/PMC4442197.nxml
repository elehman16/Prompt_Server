Centre-based childcare services represent a promising setting to provide children with opportunities to improve healthy eating and physical activity. Evidence to inform implementation of childcare obesity prevention guidelines into routine practice in childcare, however, is lacking. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of an intervention, delivered to childcare staff, aiming to increasing service implementation of healthy eating and physical activity-promoting policies and practices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A pragmatic parallel group randomised controlled trial will be undertaken with 165 childcare services in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Services will be randomised to receive either a 10-month evidence-based performance review intervention with other resources to support practice change, or to a waitlist control group. The primary trial outcome is the proportion of services implementing all of the following recommended healthy eating and physical activity promoting practices: written nutrition, physical activity and small screen recreation policies; providing information to families regarding healthy eating (including breastfeeding), physical activity and small screen time; providing twice weekly healthy eating learning experiences to children; providing water and only plain milk to children; providing fundamental movement skills activities for children every day; and limiting and using electronic screen time more for educational purposes and learning experiences. Effectiveness will be assessed using a telephone interview of practice implementation with childcare staff at baseline and 12&#x02005;months following baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by the Hunter New England Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee.

In the state of New South Wales, preschools provide centre-based care for 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;h/day and enrol children between 3 and 6&#x02005;years.

Services catering solely for special needs populations, such as children with vision or hearing impairment, will be excluded from participating in the trial, given the specialist care required for such children and the likelihood of a differential effect of the intervention in this population group, and those participating in other intervention trials targeting children's diet or physical activity will be excluded. Furthermore, we will use local health service data to exclude services already identified as comprehensively implementing healthy eating and physical activity practices. Eligibility of the remaining services will be confirmed with the Nominated Supervisor (manager) of the service during phone contact as part of the recruitment process. Nominated Supervisors (service managers) at eligible services will be invited to provide consent for their service to participate in the data collection procedures of the study (see online supplementary appendix 1 for information statement).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Random allocation of childcare services</title><p>Childcare services eligible for the trial will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control wait list group in a 1:1 ratio using a computerised random number function in Microsoft Excel.

Subgroup analyses of the primary trial outcome will be reported by service geographic and socioeconomic classification. The Australian Standard Geographical Classification will be used to classify service postcodes as urban (regional cities and inner regional classifications) or rural areas. Postcodes ranked in the top 50% of New South Wales, according to the Socioeconomic Indices for Areas, will be classified as &#x02018;higher socioeconomic services&#x02019;. All statistical tests will be two tailed with an &#x003b1; of 0.05.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper presents the design and rationale for a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of a multicomponent review and feedback intervention, to facilitate policy and practice implementation to promote healthy eating and physical activity by centre-based childcare services. This trial will advance the currently limited evidence in this field and contribute important information regarding the effectiveness of intervention strategies to facilitate the translation of best practice recommendations into routine practice of childcare services.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the trial's randomised, pragmatic design, the use of theoretical framework and broad set of intervention strategies, the long duration of the intervention (10&#x02005;months), the implementation of procedures to reduce potential threats to internal validity, such as the blinding of data collection interviewers and computer-based randomisation of groups.</p><p>The study will contribute to evidence regarding the effectiveness of obesity prevention implementation interventions delivered under pragmatic conditions in centre-based childcare settings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MF led the development of this manuscript and is responsible for protocol updates and revisions.
