New regional anesthesia technique, like combined spinal epidural (CSE) anesthesia and analgesia have introduced in the recent past.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The CSE technique has attained widespread popularity for patients undergoing major surgery below the umbilical level who require prolonged and effective post-operative analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Both spinal and epidural techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Spinal anesthesia is simple to perform and require small dose of local anesthetic to provide reliable and intense block and at the same time high incidence of nausea, vomiting, hypotension, post-operative headache are common after spinal analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Epidural anesthesia, though less reliable and predictable than spinal anesthesia, it provides a better control of analgesia by using an epidural catheter. Epidural anesthesia requires higher doses of local anesthetic and associated with significant systemic absorption, chance of toxicity and slower onset of action.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>However, combined technique has eliminated the many disadvantages to a significant extent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Subarachnoid block provides rapid onset of reliable block with low dose of local anesthetic agent and desired level of sensory block achieved by epidural injection of local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Drug used bupivacaine, like other local anesthetic, blocks nerve conduction by decreasing the entry of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) ions during the upstroke of action potential. It is highly lipid soluble. Thus, it has got higher potency, 3-4 times as potent as lignocaine. It has got a high protein binding capacity of about 95%. High protein binding is associated with prolonged duration of action. The total duration of effect is between 5 and 16 h.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study design utilized following inclusion criteria.</p><p>A total of 60 adult patients of either sex or age ranging between 18 and 60 years and belonging to American society for Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1 and 2, scheduled for lower abdominal, gynecological and urological operation to be carried out under regional anesthesia were selected. An informed consent was taken from patient.</p><p>ASA 1-The patient has no organic, physiological, biochemical or psychiatric disturbance. The pathological process for which operation is to be performed is localized and does not entail a systemic disturbance.</p><p>ASA 2-Mild to moderate systemic disturbance caused by the condition to be treated surgically or by other pathophysiological processes such as mild organic heart disease, diabetes, mild hypertension, anemia, old age, obesity, anemia, mild chronic bronchitis</p><p>The study design was prospective in nature and was conducted over 18 months.</p><p>The exclusion criteria of this study were known allergy or contraindication to any of the test drug or spinal analgesia (for example, coagulation defect, infection at the puncture site and pre-existing neurological deficit in the lower extremities). Patient with evidence of major cardiovascular pulmonary, hepatic, renal, hematological, endocrine or metabolic disorder or history of motion sickness were also excluded.</p><p>Patients were divided into three broad groups, A, B and C, (each consisting of 20 patients).

An epidural needle, Tuohy needle (16G), was administered at Lumber 2-3(L2-L3) interspace and catheter (18G) was threaded on through the needle. Bupivacaine and normal saline administered through the catheter after removal of the needle. Lumbar puncture was done at L3-L4 interspace with 25G spinal needle.
