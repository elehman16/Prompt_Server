The goal of the concept is to optimize the perioperative management of the patient in order to reduce morbidity, to enhance recovery of the patient after a surgical procedure, to reduce hospital stay, and to reduce costs.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>After major gastric surgeries a stay of 1 week is the minimum that can be expected. This prolonged post-operative stay is not only due to the morbidity associated with the disease and the operative procedure but also due to the conventional perioperative care. Inadequate pain management, intestinal dysfunction, and immobilisation have been recognized since at least 1997 as among the main factors delaying post-operative recovery in patients subjected to major surgery.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] So this ERAS is advanced perioperative care for better outcome of the patient.</p><p>The implementation of this concept relies upon hospital policies developed and applied in all departments and services involved in the management of the surgical patients. The team approach includes a lot of medical personnel, but the main actors are the surgeon and the anesthetist, who have the most constant and direct contact with the patient.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The ERAS refers to all phases of perioperative care: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative strategies. The results that can be achieved with ERAS(FTS)-reductions in postoperative morbity, average length of hospital stay and the consumption of resources-are, however, significant.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The concept of ERAS (FTS) allowing accelerated post-operative recovery is accepted in colorectal surgery, but efficacy data are only preliminary for patients undergoing total gastrectomy for carcinoma stomach.

Nasogastric tubes were routinely used. In general, one drain was placed in the oesophagojejunostomy site. Postoperatively, oral intake was prohibited, and standard intravenous fluid was set at 2-2.5 L/24 h. Patients received 4000 mg of paracetamol (in four separate doses of 1000 mg).

The results of this study show that preoperative education of patients, epidural anesthesia or regional anesthesia, early ambulation and early postoperative oral nutrition are the important predictors for the rehabilitation of patients after total gastrectomy.</p><p>Preoperative education of patients is regarded as one of the crucial factors for fast-track rehabilitation. It is necessary to explain the detailed treatment plan, different stages of fast-track rehabilitation program and relevant measures for recovery for the patients in order to make them better understand the importance of fast-track rehabilitation program. Generally, since the gastric emptying time of solid meal and fluid is 6 and 2 h, respectively,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] the patients should be encouraged to have liquid meal 2 h before operation instead of fasting. It has been shown that preoperative oral carbohydrate is safe and can efficiently reduce complications.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Nasogastric tube: The rationale for using prophylactic nasogastric decompression tubes has been a reduction of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a decrease of abdominal distension, less chance of pulmonary aspiration, reduced risk of wound separation and infection, earlier return of bowel function and shorter duration of hospital stay.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] A more recent systematic review of 28 randomized controlled trials (RCT) by Nelson <italic>et al.</italic>, in 2005 showed that patients without or selective nasogastric tubes experienced earlier bowel movements, a decrease in pulmonary complications and a marginal increase in wound infection and ventral hernia formation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] They conclude that nasogastric decompression does not achieve the intended goals and should therefore be abandoned as a routine technique and only applied in selected cases.</p><p>The role of epidural anesthesia or regional anesthesia in fast-track rehabilitation program should be stressed. Postoperative epidural analgesia can avoid stress-induced neurological, endocrinological and homeostatic changes or the blocking of sympathetic nerve-related surgical stress response, reduce complications such nausea, vomiting and enteroparalysis after operation, early ambulation, improve the intestinal function and shorten the hospital stay time of patients after resection of gastric cancer.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical bowel preparation prior to abdominal surgery is aimed at cleaning the large bowel of feces and thereby reducing the probability of abdominal infections and postoperative complications. For decades the practice of bowel preparation has been considered as an essential part in the prevention of postoperative complications induced by bacterial contamination. Although the use of mechanical bowel preparation has been generally accepted, a mandatory correlation between prepared bowels and a reduction of postoperative morbidity was not clearly shown. On the contrary, studies evaluating the outcome of patients with filled bowels undergoing emergency surgery found no increase in anastomotic complications as might have been expected.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] These data suggest that the use of bowel cleansing may be unnecessary. Additionally, mechanical bowel preparation causes significant discomfort due to nausea, abdominal bloating, and diarrhea in almost all patients.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Physiological changes include electrolyte imbalance and dehydration. In view of the possible disadvantages and the evidence of several randomized studies, mechanical bowel preparation in the classic way should be abandoned. A preoperative enema appears to be sufficient to remove solid parts of feces.</p><p>Early postoperative oral nutrition also plays an essential part in fast-track rehabilitation program. Food intake can stimulate gastrointestinal peristalsis, and early feeding during the first 24 h after surgery promotes the recovery of ileus. It has been illustrated that early postoperative oral nutrition attenuates catabolism and potentially decreases infectious complications.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Animal trials have shown that starvation reduces collagen content in anastomotic scar tissues and impairs the healing process while feeding increases collagen deposition and strength.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Regarding these findings, several trials on humans undergoing gastrointestinal surgery were performed to evaluate differences between both concepts. A meta-analysis of 11 randomized trials by Lewis <italic>et al.</italic>, showed that early enteral feeding may be beneficial for patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Enforced postoperative mobilization of patients can reduce protein loss due to long-term bedridden, pulmonary infection and venous thrombosis. In this study, complete analgesia, control of nausea and vomiting, early postoperative oral nutrition and early ambulation efficiently reduced the postoperative complication of ileus and improved the recovery of intestinal function.</p><p>In this study, the early removal of gastric tube and urethral catheter decreased not only the infectious complications in cardiopulmonary and urinary systems but also the symptoms of patients. The shortened fasting time, preoperative carbohydrate load, and intraoperative fluid restriction effectively protected against homeostasis in patients after total gastrectomy. The outcome of fast-track rehabilitation program was better than that of conventional care.</p><p>Recently, laparoscopic surgery, applied in treatment of colorectal and early gastric cancer, can significantly reduce trauma and speed up the rehabilitation of patients after surgery. It was reported that the hospital stay time is shorter and the morbidity and readmission rate are lower after laparoscopic surgery.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, these studies only compared open surgery with laparoscopic surgery rather than laparoscopic surgery with fast-track rehabilitation program.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Therefore, we in this study have focused on the potential influence of laparoscopy assisted surgery with or without fast-track rehabilitation program on the recovery of patients after total gastrectomy. Laparoscopic surgery and fast-track rehabilitation program can effectively promote the recovery of patients after resection of gastric cancer.</p><p>We believe that laparoscopic surgery in combination with ERAS program is significantly advantageous over other procedures for patients after resection of gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In
