There is now an abundance of research demonstrating that mindfulness training has beneficial effects across a wide range of clinical conditions, making it an important tool for clinical intervention. One area of extensive research is on the beneficial effects of mindfulness on experiences of pain. However, the mechanisms of these effects are still not well understood. One hypothesis is that the relaxation components of mindfulness training, through alterations in breathing and muscle tension, leads to changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system functioning which influences pain circuits. The current study seeks to examine how two of the relaxation subcomponents of mindfulness training, deep breathing and muscle relaxation, influence experiences of pain in healthy individuals. Participants were randomized to either a 10 minute deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or control condition after which they were exposed to a cold pain task. Throughout the experiment, measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity were collected to assess how deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation alter physiological responses, and if these changes moderate any effects of these interventions on responses to pain. There were no differences in participants&#x02019; pain tolerances or self-reported pain ratings during the cold pain task or in participants&#x02019; physiological responses to the task. Additionally, individual differences in physiological functioning were not related to differences in pain tolerance or pain ratings. Overall this study suggests that the mechanisms through which mindfulness exerts its effects on pain are more complex than merely through physiological changes brought about by altering breathing or muscle tension. This indicates a need for more research examining the specific subcomponents of mindfulness, and how these subcomponents might be acting, to better understand their utility as a clinical treatment.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="0"/><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Relaxation interventions, such as deep breathing or muscle relaxation, have demonstrated efficacy in treating pain symptoms in patients suffering from chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and there is some evidence that they are also effective in treating clinical disorders, including anxiety [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and depression [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. These techniques are similar to what are termed mindfulness techniques. While there are a range of definitions, the key distinction made between relaxation and mindfulness is that there is an intentional focus to relax during the practice of relaxation methods while mindfulness involves the cultivation of a non-judgmental, moment-to-moment awareness [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, it is not clear how different the two types of interventions are in terms of efficacy. Studies which have directly compared them have found relatively similar effects on anxiety and mood [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Indeed, there has been a trend towards interventions which incorporate both mindfulness and relaxation techniques in combination, often broadly referred to as &#x0201c;mindfulness based&#x0201d; interventions [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These interventions have demonstrated efficacy for treating a wide range of disorders, including many debilitating clinical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], leading to their increasing use within clinical populations. Given the often substantial efficacy of mindfulness interventions across a wide range of clinical conditions, many of which historically have been resistant to treatment, they offer an exciting new treatment tool within the clinical community.</p><p>One area in which there has been substantial research on the efficacy of mindfulness interventions is in individuals suffering from chronic pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Numerous anecdotal reports and case studies on long-term meditation practitioners have reported a significant reduction in self-reported pain symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Because of this, there has been a wealth of research examining the utility of mindfulness interventions for alleviating chronic pain symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. As with other clinical areas, this work suggests there are positive effects of mindfulness interventions for chronic pain patients. However, this evidence is mixed, and indeed a recent systematic literature review found that there were no added benefits of mindfulness based pain interventions compared to cognitive and behavioral therapy alone [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, there is a range in what aspects of pain experiences are positively influenced by mindfulness based interventions, with the largest effects often seen for depression or negative mood associated with pain, while effects for self-reported pain are more mixed, with studies often finding no change in measures asking generally about participants&#x02019; current level of pain (i.e. How much pain are you in at the moment?) [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This suggests that these interventions have varying effects on different aspects of pain, and indicates a need for elaboration of what these aspects are and the mechanisms through which they are influenced. In order to better understand the mechanisms through which mindfulness produces symptom relief in chronic pain patients, it is important to examine how these types of activities affect acute experiences of pain in healthy participants, both at the level of nociception and self-reported experiences of pain, as well as any changes in general perceptions of stress or mood in response to the pain.</p><p>Compared to the literature on chronic pain, there are very few studies looking at the efficacy of mindfulness interventions on experiences of pain in healthy individuals [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Those studies that do look at the efficacy of mindfulness interventions on experiences of pain in healthy individuals have found mixed results [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Often these studies focus on current practitioners of mindfulness [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], making it difficult to compare how effective these interventions might be with novices or even how much training is necessary to see the observed effects. Additionally, it is possible that people who have higher tolerances for pain initially are more likely to practice mindfulness. However, there is some evidence that short one-time interventions may have beneficial effects in novices on nociception, or the response of the sensory nervous system to a noxious stimulus that leads to the subjective experience of pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This evidence is mixed though, with some research finding mindfulness increases both pain tolerance and self-reported pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], some finding changes in only the nociceptive response but not self-reported pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and some finding no effects in novice participants at all [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The lack of consistent results for the effects of mindfulness interventions on experiences of pain is partially due to the variability across studies in the type of mindfulness or mindfulness subcomponent employed. Mindfulness is commonly defined as the quality of awareness that arises through intentionally attending to present moment experience in a non-judgmental and accepting manner [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the procedures used to achieve mindfulness in the literature include quite disparate practices ranging from deep breathing exercises [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and muscle relaxation [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] to massage [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and teaching full meditation traditions [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This variability in methodology across studies has made it difficult to determine which aspects of these interventions are associated with positive effects. Given this, it is important to investigate different components of mindfulness separately in order to better understand the mechanisms through which specific components may be producing positive effects. One approach to disentangling these mechanisms is to focus on the different subcomponents of these interventions and their specific mechanisms of action.</p><p>This study aims to provide insight into the effects of different mindfulness subcomponents, specifically focusing on two common relaxation components often employed within the context of mindfulness interventions: modulating breathing through a deep breathing task and gradual muscle relaxation through a progressive muscle relaxation task. These aspects were chosen because they are most common across the mindfulness intervention literature, with all practices involving some sort of instruction about slowing or attending to breathing, and many also incorporating a type of muscle relaxation task, often in the form of a body scan. Additionally, both of these tasks have been employed with and shown efficacy in novices [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, these tasks have never been directly compared, and, while they appear to be effective at alleviating pain, the specific mechanisms through which this occurs are still unclear. These tasks are also easier to convey to individuals unfamiliar with the techniques as compared to more abstract aspects of mindfulness such as developing a state of nonjudgmental awareness of cognitions and streams of thoughts. Lastly, each of these tasks involves explicit instructions for modulating aspects of physiological function, which could influence both nociceptive and central experiences of pain. For example, changes in breathing modulate baroreceptor activity, stretch receptors which regulate blood pressure through alterations in sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac control [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and have been related to differences in pain sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Additionally, muscle relaxation is thought to exert its effects through decreased afferent neural impulses from the skeletal musculature resulting in decreased sympathetic activity and reduced activity of neuromuscular circuits involved in the experience of pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These provide a concrete mechanism through which these types of interventions may influence individuals&#x02019; pain sensitivity.</p><p>The goal of this study was to assess how different relaxation aspects of mindfulness influence individuals&#x02019; experiences of acute pain and if they have differential effects. Additionally, this study aimed to examine the potential mechanisms through which the different relaxation aspects of mindfulness act. To do this, we compared the effects of a deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and an active control condition on individuals&#x02019; pain tolerance as assessed by a cold pressor task. Throughout the study, we collected measures of cardiac parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity to assess whether changes within these systems moderate any observed effects. We expect that both breathing and progressive muscle relaxation interventions will result in higher pain thresholds, We also expect that these increases will be related to physiological changes induced by the intervention. However, in contrast with deep breathing, we expect progressive muscle relaxation might produce a dissociation between pain tolerance and self-reported pain, with pain tolerance increasing without comparable changes in self-reported pain as previously observed [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>63 (24 male) University of Chicago undergraduates, ages 18&#x02013;23 years (mean 20) participated in the study (22% Asian American, 11% African American, 0.02% Middle Eastern/Arab American, 41% Caucasian, 19% Multiple Ethnicities, 0.05% Other Ethnicity).

During the deep breathing condition, participants were instructed to match their breathing to a moving dot on the presentation&#x02014;inhaling with the dot as it moved up, pausing as the dot remained flat, and exhaling as the dot moved down. This task was modeled upon previous deep breathing tasks [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and was designed to reduce breathing to 5 breaths per minute.

The amount of time (mm:ss) the participants kept their foot in the water was used as a measure of pain tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Additionally, participants were asked to rate the amount of pain they were experiencing every 30 seconds using a Visual Analogue Scale (from no pain to the worst imaginable pain), as has been employed previously [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The cold pressor task was only conducted once, post experimental condition, to avoid any potential habituation effects to the paradigm and to avoid inducing a state of stress in participants, via exposure to pain, prior to completing the experimental task.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Physiological measures</title><p>Cardiovascular measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiac control were derived from impedance cardiography (pre-ejection period (PEP)) and an electrocardiogram (high (respiratory) frequency (0.12&#x02013;0.42 Hz) heart rate variability (HF HRV)). Data were scored minute by minute and then collapsed for each task.</p><p>PEP, derived from impedance cardiography, is the period between the electrical stimulation of the ventricular myocardium (Q wave of ECG) and the opening of the aortic valve. As PEP depends on the time development of intraventricular pressure, it is used as an index of cardiac contractility. Given variations in contractility are primarily under sympathetic control, PEP is used as a noninvasive measure of sympathetic influence of the heart [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Lower PEP values (in ms) represent higher levels of sympathetic activity. HF HRV is a rhythmic fluctuation of heart rate in the respiratory frequency band (respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and has been demonstrated to be a relatively pure index of parasympathetic cardiac control [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>The impedance cardiogram was collected using a four spot electrode configuration [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The electrocardiogram (ECG) was collected using the standard lead II configuration. The ECG and basal thoracic impedance (Z0) were measured using a Bionex system (MindWare Technologies LTD, Gahanna, OH). MindWare software was used to visually inspect all physiological data and to analyze the dZ/dt waveforms to obtain PEP from impedance. HR HRV was derived from ECG using spectral analysis of the interbeat interval series. The interbeat interval series was time sampled at 4 Hz (with interpolation) to yield an equal interval time series. This time series was detrended (second-order polynomial), end tapered, and submitted to a fast Fourier transformation. HF HRV spectral power was then integrated over the respiratory frequency band (0.12&#x02013;0.42 HZ) and HF HRV is represented as the natural log of the heart period variance in the respiratory band (in ms<sup>2</sup>).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To examine changes in the physiological measures and state anxiety and perceived stress over the course of the study by condition, repeated measures (time X condition) ANOVAs were run for each outcome measure.

Post-hoc analyses suggested that these effects were driven by a significant increase between intervention (M = 74.64) and cold pressor (M = 83.03; Fisher-Hayter p &#x0003c; 0.001) for heart rate, a significant decrease between baseline (M = 6.66) and cold pressor (M = 6.31; Fisher-Hayter p &#x0003c; 0.01) for HF-HRV, and a significant increase between intervention (M = 16.52) and cold pressor (M = 18.26; Fisher-Hayter p &#x0003c; 0.001) for respiration. For all physiological measures, there was no main effect of condition (HR: F(2,50) = 2.28, p = 0.112; HF-HRV: F(2,50) = 2.39, p = 0.102); Respiration: F(2,50) = 0.79, p = 0.461; PEP: F(2,48) = 1.51, p = 0.231). For HF-HRV, however, there was a significant condition by time interaction (F(4,100) = 4.44, p &#x0003c; 0.01). Post hoc analysis indicated this was due to a significant decrease (Fisher-Hayter p &#x0003c; 0.05) in HF-HRV between intervention (M = 6.70) and cold pressor (M = 5.87) for the breathing group, while both for the control and PMR groups there were no significant post-hoc comparisons, indicating they remained stable across all tasks.

This model did indicate a significant effect of perceived pain on pain tolerance (Hazard Ratio = 1.04, p &#x0003c; 0.01), suggesting participants with higher perceived pain are more likely to remove their foot from the water earlier, but this model did not change the effect of condition (Hazard Ratio = 1.52, p = 0.503), and there was no interaction effect (Hazard Ratio = 0.993, p = 0.507).

In contrast to previous research [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], we found no evidence for two relaxation subcomponents of mindfulness, in the form of deep breathing and PMR, altering individuals&#x02019; pain tolerance or self-reported pain. We also did not find any support that these types of interventions, at least within the context of a brief intervention, have physiological effects which contribute to individual differences in responses to the intervention. Overall, this suggests that a short term relaxation or focused breathing is not sufficient to influence participants&#x02019; experiences of pain.</p><p>There are several potential reasons why this study did not find expected differences in pain tolerance due to relaxation based manipulations. One explanation is that changing breathing and muscle relaxation simply do not influence experiences of pain. There is some evidence that deep breathing tasks that require attention (e.g. matching breaths to a visual stimulus, as employed in this task) do not significantly change pain thresholds, while those described as more relaxing, having individuals internally pace their breaths with audio instruction but no visual attention required, do significantly alter pain thresholds [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, this does not explain the lack of difference across conditions in pain ratings, anxiety, and perceived stress changes, as the same study found both the attentive and relaxing intervention induced similar mood changes [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nor does this explain the lack of effect for PMR, which rather than focusing on just changing breathing, focuses on changing muscle tension with brief reminders throughout the audio about to remember to breath but no specific instruction on how to alter breathing. Additionally, PMR has been demonstrated to be more reliably effective than other relaxation interventions in the context of chronic pain and injury pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], significantly influence nociceptive responses in novices [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], and modulate sympathetic responsivity [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Importantly, however, it is difficult to generalize and compare the findings in this study to those with chronic pain patients who experience long-term persistent pain in a naturalistic setting which has real threat value for these patients. This study employed a short term intervention in the context of an acute laboratory pain stimulus with no real threat value to healthy volunteers. Nonetheless, this still does not explain the lack of consistency in findings with studies that looked at nociceptive responses in novices [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>A more likely explanation is that the intervention time period was too short to have an effect. While there have been a few studies which examined similarly short one-time interventions with novices and found some significant effects [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], the majority of studies addressing the question of whether relaxation interventions or mindfulness based training incorporating these aspects of relaxation influence experiences of pain have been conducted with long-term repeated intervention over the course of several weeks (most common 8 week intervention) [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is likely that even in the case of the most basic type of relaxation, i.e., a focus on breathing, this initially requires effort and attention on the part of the individual, making it less relaxing, and after practice it becomes more automatic. Indeed, while there was a pattern towards decreased breathing rates in the breathing task condition, the fact there is not a significant condition by time interaction for respiration, suggests that the intervention was not as effective as expected.</p><p>It is also possible that relaxation tasks alone are not sufficient to induce changes in pain tolerance. Many of the mindfulness based interventions that have demonstrated effects on experimentally induced pain focus on changes in breathing in combination with teaching acceptance and awareness exercises [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These aspects may be key to modulating individuals&#x02019; experiences with pain. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that many of the effects of mindfulness/meditation interventions act through a cognitive restructuring, changing attention and self-regulatory processes [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. However, more research is necessary to better understand the underlying neurobehavioral mechanisms through which these changes may be occurring [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Additionally, it is the case that these relaxation interventions alone, especially PMR, have previously demonstrated efficacy in altering perceptions of pain [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], making it more likely that the lack of effects are due to length of the intervention. Given the lack of consistency of activities across mindfulness interventions and their efficacy, it is important for future research to elucidate which aspects of these interventions are most important to achieving changes in not only pain, but also in other areas in which they are employed. Lastly, it is possible that the lack of effect was a result of a small sample size. However, our sample was comparable to that of previous studies that have found effects [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and when analyses were re-run using a 3-way ANOVA comparing mean pain tolerance times, for which we had sufficient power (0.80) to detect a medium effect with our sample size, we still found no differences across conditions for participants pain tolerance. Despite this, future work should replicate and extend these findings with a larger sample size.</p><p>Overall this study provides no evidence for the hypothesis that changing breathing, common to most mindfulness interventions, is the key mechanism through which these interventions modulate individuals&#x02019; experiences of pain. Indeed we were unable to replicate any previous effects of either deep breathing or PMR on pain tolerance [<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0177228.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, despite this, this study provides several important contributions to the understanding of relaxation interventions in the context of mindfulness. First, we have demonstrated that this brief of an intervention, 10 minutes, is not likely to have any large effects on novices&#x02019; experiences of pain, establishing a lower bound for efficacy of these types of interventions. Additionally, it suggests that the mechanisms involved in the beneficial effects of mindfulness interventions, are likely more complex than simply focusing on breathing or muscle tension thereby exerting physiological changes which then act to influence nociception and perceptions of pain. Given that these types of interventions are employed in treatment for a wide range of ailments, ranging from acute pain to depression to borderline personality disorder to supporting children experiencing early childhood trauma, it is important that more work focuses on what aspects of different mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation interventions, through direct comparison in a randomized control setting, actually contribute to observed effects on acute pain, as well as how long and how much practice is necessary to achieve these effects, in order to better understand the utility of different aspects of mindfulness as an intervention for experiences of pain, and more broadly their utility for treatment of a wide range of disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177228.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Cox regression models.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177228.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177228.s002"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>Data set used in manuscript.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177228.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0177228.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Cox regression model results: No significant effects of intervention, but pain ratings demonstrated a significant effect for people with higher pain ratings having faster time to removal of food from the water.</title><p>Model A: Included only intervention as predictor; Model B: Included only pain ratings as predictor; Model C: Included intervention and pain ratings as predictors; Model D: Included intervention, pain ratings, change in PEP, RSA, HR and respiration from baseline to intervention, and baseline RSA as predictors. *p &#x0003c; 0.05, **p &#x0003c; 0.01, ***p &#x0003c; 0.001.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0177228.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0177228.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kwekkeboom</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Gretarsdottir</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>Systematic review of relaxation intervention for pain</article-title>. <source>J Nurs Scholarsh</source>. <year>2006</year>;<volume>38</volume>: <fpage>269</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>277</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17044345</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0177228.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Manzoni</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pagnini</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Castelnuovo</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Molinari</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name>. <article-title>Relaxation training for anxiety: A ten-years systematic review with meta-analysis</article-title>. <source>BMC Psychiatry</source>. <year>2008</year>;<volume>8</volume>: <fpage>41</fpage>
