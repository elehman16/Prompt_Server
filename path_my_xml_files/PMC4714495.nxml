Cetuximab manufactured by ImClone (US commercial cetuximab) potentially results in higher systemic exposures than cetuximab manufactured by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI-manufactured cetuximab). This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compared the safety profiles of the two cetuximab formulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients with previously untreated locoregionally recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN were randomly assigned to receive the same dose of US commercial cetuximab (Arm A) or BI-manufactured cetuximab (Arm B), each in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-FU.

Treatment options for patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) are limited. Currently, the standard of care (category 1 evidence) for recurrent/metastatic SCCHN is the regimen used in the EXTREME study (Erbitux in First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer), consisting of cetuximab in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Historically, median survival with chemotherapy is approximately 6&#x000a0;months and the 1-year survival rate is approximately 20&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The addition of cetuximab, an anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody, to cytotoxic agents has shown a significant increase in response rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and a significant survival benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in recurrent/metastatic SCCHN.</p><p>In the EXTREME study, conducted in 17 European countries, 442 patients with previously untreated recurrent/metastatic SCCHN were randomized to receive chemotherapy alone (cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-FU) or in combination with cetuximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There were statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in all efficacy endpoints (overall survival [OS], progression-free survival [PFS], and overall response rate [ORR]) in the cetuximab plus chemotherapy group compared with the chemotherapy-alone group. Overall, the safety data from the EXTREME study indicated that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy did not affect tolerability and that the adverse event (AE) profile for this cetuximab-chemotherapy regimen was consistent with that expected for the agents used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Adverse events of interest for cetuximab include acneiform rash, cardiac events, infusion reactions, and hypomagnesemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Based on the results of the EXTREME study, cetuximab was approved by the European Union (EU) for the treatment of patients with SCCHN in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for recurrent and/or metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and later by the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic SCCHN in combination with platinum-based therapy with 5-FU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The cetuximab clinical supply for the EXTREME study was manufactured by the Europe-based company Boehringer Ingelheim (BI-manufactured cetuximab). Population pharmacokinetic data indicate that cetuximab manufactured by the US-based company ImClone (US commercial cetuximab) is associated with approximately 22&#x000a0;% higher systemic drug exposure relative to BI-manufactured cetuximab, due to decreased clearance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to the potential for increased exposure and the possibility of a greater incidence and severity of adverse reactions with US commercial cetuximab compared with BI-manufactured cetuximab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], a prospective study of the two cetuximab formulations was conducted. This study compared the safety profiles of US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab, each in combination with cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-FU (the regimen used in the EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]), in patients with locoregionally recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>The patient eligibility criteria were similar to those of the EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed locoregionally recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN not suitable for local therapy were eligible for this study. Other eligibility criteria included: age &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years; measurable or evaluable disease, as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0; Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score of at least 70; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic function. Patients were excluded from the study if they had: previous systemic chemotherapy, unless required as part of multimodal treatment for locally advanced head and neck cancer that was completed more than 4&#x000a0;months before study entry; previous treatment with monoclonal antibody therapy, other signal transduction inhibitors, or EGFR targeting therapy, except for previous cetuximab treatment given as part of a multimodal treatment for locally advanced head and neck cancer that was completed more than 4&#x000a0;months before study entry; nasopharyngeal carcinoma; or other concomitant anticancer therapies.</p><p>The study was conducted in hospital-based clinics in North America.

The 30-patient lead-in phase was requested by the FDA to assess the safety of US commercial cetuximab before starting the randomized phase of the study.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to US commercial cetuximab plus chemotherapy (Arm A) or BI-manufactured cetuximab plus chemotherapy (Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio (first patient enrolled: 08 June 2010). Randomization was carried out using a computer-generated random sequence and a centralized interactive voice response system (IVRS). To maintain the blinding of patients and the personnel involved in patient evaluations and data collection, an unblinded third party was designated. The investigator provided the necessary information to the unblinded designee who then called the IVRS to obtain the patient&#x02019;s treatment assignment.</p><p>A minimization principle was used to balance patient assignment between treatment arms, using a probability factor of 0.75, based on the following factors: primary tumor site (oral cavity/oropharynx vs other); previous chemotherapy (yes vs no); previous cetuximab treatment (yes vs no); KPS (&#x0003c;80 vs &#x02265;80); intention to give cisplatin or carboplatin; measurable vs evaluable disease; and participating center.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Study drugs were administered intravenously in 21-day cycles, with a 1-hour observation period between cetuximab and cisplatin/carboplatin, in the following order: (i) cetuximab 400&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (2-hour infusion) on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and 250&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (1-hour infusion) weekly thereafter; (ii) cisplatin 100&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup> (1-hour infusion) or carboplatin area under the concentration curve (AUC) 5&#x000a0;mg/mL/min (1-hour infusion) on Day 1 of Cycles 1 to 6; (iii) 5-FU 1000&#x000a0;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day as a continuous infusion on Days 1 through 4 of Cycles 1 to 6. Patients enrolled in the safety lead-in phase and patients randomized to Arm A received US commercial cetuximab; patients randomized to Arm B received BI-manufactured cetuximab. Patients received cisplatin or carboplatin at the discretion of the investigator. Dose modifications of cetuximab and chemotherapy were permitted according to protocol-specified criteria. Patients who completed six cycles of combination therapy continued to receive cetuximab monotherapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or any other withdrawal criterion was met. If clinically indicated, patients who discontinued chemotherapy prior to completing six cycles of combination therapy were permitted to continue with cetuximab until a withdrawal criterion was met. Patients who discontinued cetuximab were permitted to continue with chemotherapy up to six cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Assessments</title><p>Adverse events were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE; Version 4.0) and the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; Version 16.0).</p><p>Tumor response was assessed using RECIST version 1.0. Tumor measurements were performed at baseline and every two cycles by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; chest x-ray was acceptable for clearly defined lesions surrounded by aerated lung.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary objective of the study was to prospectively compare the safety profiles of US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab with respect to individual all-grade, all-cause treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurring at any time during the treatment period. A TEAE was defined as an event that first appeared or an event already present that worsened in severity following the first dose exposure and up to 30&#x000a0;days after the last dose of study treatment. Secondary objectives included overall safety, OS, PFS, and ORR.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Planned enrollment was approximately 230 patients: 30 patients for the safety lead-in phase and 200 patients for the two-arm, randomized, double-blind phase. The sample size was based on practical and clinical considerations to ensure that the safety profile could be appropriately compared between the two treatment arms and was not based on any statistical assumptions or hypotheses.</p><p>For the safety lead-in phase, the safety and efficacy analyses were conducted on the safety lead-in population, which consisted of all patients enrolled in this phase of the study. For the randomized phase, the safety and efficacy analyses were conducted on the randomized and treated (RT) population, which consisted of all patients in the two-arm, randomized, double-blind phase of the study who received at least one dose of any of the study drugs (cetuximab, cisplatin/carboplatin, and 5-FU).</p><p>The primary outcome was all-grade, all-cause TEAEs in the RT population. The risk difference for the occurrence of each AE was calculated and the 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval (CI) and <italic>p</italic> value were generated using normal approximation. The false discovery rate method of multiplicity adjustment was applied to control the type I error (the false positive rate) when comparing individual AEs. Adverse events of special interest were hypomagnesemia and the composite terms acneiform rash, cardiac event, and infusion reaction. Exposure to cetuximab and chemotherapy was reported as median duration plus 25<sup>th</sup> and 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles and relative dose intensity (actual dose delivered as a percentage of planned dose). Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death; PFS was defined as the time from randomization to the first objective progression of disease or death. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate median OS and PFS. Log-rank and Wilcoxon statistics were calculated to provide between-treatment comparisons unadjusted for covariates for OS and PFS. The ORR was calculated as the percentage of patients with a confirmed (within 28&#x000a0;days) best response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The disease control rate (DCR) was calculated as the percentage of patients with a confirmed best response of CR, PR, or stable disease. Analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).</p><p>Because of manufacturing process changes, Boehringer Ingelheim stopped manufacturing the cetuximab formulation used in the EXTREME study. The supply of BI-manufactured cetuximab expired during the study period; upon expiration, ongoing patients in Arm B were switched to US commercial cetuximab. For the primary safety analysis, the data analysis cut-off date was the earliest date that a patient in Arm B was switched from BI-manufactured cetuximab to US commercial cetuximab (23 January 2013). For the efficacy analyses, the data analysis cut-off date was the date that the reporting database was locked for analysis (27 September 2013). For any patient in Arm B who was switched from BI-manufactured cetuximab to US commercial cetuximab, OS and PFS were censored at the time of the switch.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Patient disposition</title><p>A total of 33 patients were enrolled in the safety lead-in phase of the study and constituted the safety lead-in population.

In the same study, the incidence of hypomagnesemia was 14&#x000a0;% and 6&#x000a0;% in the subset of patients receiving cetuximab plus cisplatin and 5-FU and the subset of patients receiving cisplatin and 5-FU alone, respectively; the incidence of grade 3/4 hypomagnesemia was 7&#x000a0;% and 2&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Compliance and study treatment exposure to cetuximab, as assessed by median duration of treatment and cumulative dose of cetuximab, were similar in the two arms. The relative dose intensity was more than 85&#x000a0;% for both US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab during the combination chemotherapy period. The relative dose intensities of cisplatin, carboplatin, and 5-FU were also high in both treatment arms, ranging from around 80&#x000a0;% to 95&#x000a0;%, suggesting that the various combinations of agents used in this study were well tolerated. These results are consistent with the observation in the EXTREME study that the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin/carboplatin plus 5-FU did not affect the tolerability of the chemotherapy regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the EXTREME study, the median (interquartile range) duration of cisplatin and carboplatin treatment in the cetuximab arm was 15&#x000a0;weeks (6 to 19) and 18&#x000a0;weeks (10 to 19), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The relative dose intensity of cisplatin was &#x02265;80&#x000a0;% in 89&#x000a0;% of patients and the relative dose intensity of carboplatin was &#x02265;80&#x000a0;% in 93&#x000a0;% of patients in the cetuximab arm in the EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>There were no clinically meaningful differences in OS, PFS, ORR, or DCR between patients receiving US commercial cetuximab and those receiving BI-manufactured cetuximab. While it should be noted that the current study was not designed or powered to assess efficacy, the efficacy results of this study are consistent with those reported in the EXTREME study. Median OS with US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab was 9.23&#x000a0;months and 9.46&#x000a0;months, respectively, in the current study and 10.1&#x000a0;months with BI-manufactured cetuximab in the EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Median PFS with US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab was 4.70&#x000a0;months and 5.65&#x000a0;months, respectively, in the current study and 5.6&#x000a0;months with BI-manufactured cetuximab in the EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ORR with US commercial cetuximab and BI-manufactured cetuximab was 29.9&#x000a0;% and 36.6&#x000a0;%, respectively, in the current study and 36&#x000a0;% with BI-manufactured cetuximab in the EXTREME study.</p><p>A strength of the current study was analyzing the safety of two formulations of a drug in a randomized controlled trial. A limitation of the study was that the sample size was based on practical and clinical considerations. This was done to ensure that assessment of the safety profile could be appropriately compared between the two treatment arms, rather than on any statistical assumptions or hypotheses. However, the planned sample size was not met because the supply of BI-manufactured cetuximab under evaluation expired during the study. In addition, not all patients in Arm B received BI-manufactured cetuximab for the duration of the study: 9/71 patients in Arm B were switched to US commercial cetuximab when the supply of BI-manufactured cetuximab expired. The potential bias that this may have introduced was addressed by choosing the earliest date that a patient on Arm B was switched from BI-manufactured cetuximab to US commercial cetuximab as the cut-off date for the primary safety analysis. However, this early cut-off date also limited the duration of the safety period for this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The safety profile of US commercial cetuximab in patients with locoregionally recurrent and/or metastatic SCCHN is consistent with the safety profile of BI-manufactured cetuximab in the current study and that reported in the previously published EXTREME study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The combination of US commercial cetuximab with cisplatin or carboplatin plus 5-FU did not result in any unexpected safety signals; the AEs reported in this study are consistent with the known safety profile of cetuximab, cisplatin/carboplatin, or 5-FU, or with the underlying disease. In addition, there were no clinically meaningful differences in OS, PFS, or ORR between patients receiving US commercial cetuximab and those receiving BI-manufactured cetuximab. These results indicate that, despite potentially higher systemic exposures with US commercial cetuximab relative to BI-manufactured cetuximab, the safety profile of US commercial cetuximab is consistent with the safety profile of cetuximab in the current US prescribing information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC</term><def><p>area under the concentration curve</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>Boehringer Ingelheim</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CR</term><def><p>complete response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DCR</term><def><p>disease control rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EGFR</term><def><p>epidermal growth factor receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EU</term><def><p>European Union</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EXTREME</term><def><p>Erbitux in First-Line Treatment of Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Cancer</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p>Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>5-FU</term><def><p>5-fluorouracil</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IVRS</term><def><p>interactive voice response system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KPS</term><def><p>Karnofsky Performance Status</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MedDRA</term><def><p>Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ORR</term><def><p>overall response rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PFS</term><def><p>progression-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PR</term><def><p>partial response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RECIST</term><def><p>Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>randomized and treated</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCCHN</term><def><p>squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAE</term><def><p>treatment-emergent adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>KB, SH, CKO, S-CC, and SC are employees of Eli Lilly and Company, and HL was an employee of Eli Lilly and Company at the time the study was conducted.
