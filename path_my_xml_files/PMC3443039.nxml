COPD was originally a disease more commonly seen in men, but now the disease affects men and women almost equally, as observed in international data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Furthermore, women seem to be more sensitive to the negative effects of tobacco smoke, and develop very severe COPD to a larger extent compared to men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Female COPD patients also demonstrate lower quality of life (QoL), more severe dyspnea and more sensitive airways than men with the same degree of airway obstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Exercise intolerance is the key disabling factor in COPD, with decreased exercise capacity, increased leg fatigue and dyspnea among the most frequently reported symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Peripheral muscle weakness has been shown to contribute to exercise intolerance in COPD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, Serres and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] argued that muscle weakness alone does not explain the decreased peripheral muscle performance seen in patients with COPD. Decreased capacity of local muscle endurance in both the upper and the lower limbs has been shown in COPD patients compared to healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Different training modalities have been evaluated to uncover the most effective way of training patients with COPD. The primary methods of exercise training within pulmonary rehabilitation have traditionally been different types of exercises incorporating a large amount of muscle mass. However, increased dyspnea during these whole body/large muscle mass exercises cause many COPD patients to stop exercising before their cardiovascular system or skeletal muscles are maximally stressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Training using a reduced muscle mass is a way of dealing with this issue. This has been found to achieve a higher metabolic rate due to less stress being placed on the respiratory system as ventilation is decreased compared to whole body exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For example, three recent studies have shown positive effects of single limb training (SLT) (that is, one-legged cycling/knee extensor training) in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Two of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] focusing on one-legged cycling concluded that it was superior to two-legged cycling regarding aerobic capacity for COPD patients. Bj&#x000f8;rgen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] also demonstrated that the total amount of work was larger in the group working with one leg at a time compared to the group working with both legs simultaneously. This could be somewhat explained by an increased capacity of local muscle endurance due to increased oxygen uptake and increased maximal mitochondrial respiration in working muscles, as demonstrated in the one-legged knee extensor training study by Br&#x000f8;nstad and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>High-repetitive SLT (that is, exercising only one arm or one leg at a time) using elastic resistance bands on the upper and lower extremity muscles within an exercise regimen have previously been used with success in patients with chronic heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Elastic bands as resistance have also been used in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], however the concept of incorporating upper as well as lower extremity muscles within an SLT regimen has not been tested in patients with COPD. A goal-based multiple repetitions maximum (RM) test to obtain the accurate load using elastic bands has previously been used, though this is time consuming and could be anticipated to take between three and six attempts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] for each separate exercise. As far as we know, there are no published studies investigating the effect of local high-repetitive single limb exercises in patients with COPD. In addition, because of the enhanced number of women affected by COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], a better understanding of the effects of training in women is of importance. Previous studies on SLT have only incorporated the leg muscles (quadriceps in particular) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. To be able to optimize training for all COPD patients while focusing on local muscle endurance, a clinical trial incorporating upper as well as lower extremity muscles is essential. In addition, if the starting resistance is accurate for each targeted muscle the amount of time exercising with adequate resistance will increase.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a prospective, assessor-blind, block randomized controlled, parallel-group multicenter trial constructed in accordance with consolidate standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] guidelines (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1 </label><caption><p><bold>Consolidate standards of reporting trials</bold> (<bold>CONSORT) flow diagram of trial design.</bold></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-13-114-1"/></fig><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The aim of the current randomized controlled multicenter trial (RCT) is to determine the effects of high-repetitive single limb exercises (HRSLE) in combination with COPD-specific patient education, compared to the COPD-specific patient education alone in patients with moderate to very severe (stage II-IV) COPD.</p><sec><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>1.

Exercises have been identified for each of the relevant muscle groups. Execution of each exercise is standardized to optimize activation of targeted muscles (for specific details see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). The exercise regimen will consist of eight exercises, of which six single arm/leg exercises (primary muscle focus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] - latissimus row (m. latissimus dorsi), chest press (m. pectoralis major, m. deltiod anterior), leg extension (m. quadriceps), straight arm shoulder flex (m. deltoid anterior), leg curl (m. hamstrings) and elbow flexion (m. biceps brachii) - are performed with elastic resistance bands, so-called Thera-Bands (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH, USA). The elastic bands are fastened at the lowest and highest levels of wall bars present in training facilities. Eight different Thera-Bands with increasing resistance will be used in this trial: tan (extra thin)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;yellow (thin)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;red (medium)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;green (heavy)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;blue (extra heavy)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;black (special heavy)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;silver (super heavy)&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;gold (maximum resistance). This allows suitable resistance for each individual and a graded increase in work load during exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A change from one color to another results in an increased resistance of 20 to 30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The two other exercises, single leg heel raise (m. triceps surae) and single leg step-up (m. quadriceps, m. iliopsoas), are performed with body weight as the primary resistance. Elastic resistance is incorporated when progression occurs.</p></sec><sec><title>Volume and load</title><p>Unilateral exercises with high repetitions are selected for this trial in line with recommendations of the ACSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Unilateral exercises are chosen to minimize the involved muscle mass to customize the intervention for the patients with COPD. High-repetition exercises are also recommended both by Ebben and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], for untrained individuals to improve endurance, and by Campos and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], who found significant increases in aerobic power and time to exhaustion after high-repetition exercises (20 to 28 repetitions, 1 minute rest).</p></sec><sec><title>Rest periods</title><p>The rest period chosen in this trial is 1 minute, as previously used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and recommended when the number of repetitions exceeds 15 for local muscle endurance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Frequency</title><p>The exercise regimen will be performed 3&#x02009;days per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Repetition velocity</title><p>Moderate to fast velocities are recommended when performing a larger number of repetitions (that is, at least 15 repetitions). In this trial, we will execute 25 repetitions with 1 second in the concentric contraction phase and 1 second in the eccentric contraction phase. This means that we can keep the rest intervals within 1 minute as recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Progression</title><p>The resistance for each exercise will be individually determined and progressed to optimize individual tailoring of the exercise regimen. Progression will be done separately for the six exercises using elastic resistance, the single leg-heel raise and the single leg step-up. Progression will be executed with the use of individual ratings of muscle fatigue and dyspnea according to the Borg CR10 scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] following a specified protocol: if a patient rates&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;4 on muscle fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and performs&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 repetitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] in at least three of six elastic resistance exercises it will result in an increase in resistance. However, irrespective of muscular fatigue, a rating of at least three out of six exercises&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5 on dyspnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] will result in a decrease in resistance. The same principle will be used on the single leg step-up and single leg heel raise individually. The Borg scale has previously been used on COPD patients after single leg exercises to measure dyspnea and muscular fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and when rating exercise intensity using elastic resistance tubing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To progress, the criteria for rating should be fulfilled in two subsequent sessions or two out of three following sessions. Progression in the six exercises with elastic resistance band is executed by increasing the tension of the elastic band (for example, tan&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;yellow&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;red&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;green&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;blue&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;black&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;silver&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;gold). Progression of single leg heel raise is as follows: (1) heel raises on flat surface, (2) heel raises on step-up board (allowing larger range of motion), (3) heel raises on step-up board with tan elastic resistance (fastening resistance band under step-up board stretched to the lowest position on the side of the exercising leg), and (4) heel raises on step-up board with increased elastic resistance as described above. Progression of step-up is as follows: (1) 15&#x02009;cm step-up board, (2) 20&#x02009;cm step-up board, (3), 25&#x02009;cm step-up board, (4) 25&#x02009;cm step-up board with tan elastic resistance (fastening resistance band under step-up board stretched to the lowest position on the side of the exercising leg), and then (5) heel raises on step-up board with increased resistance as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Initial load</title><p>To be able to enhance the accuracy of each individual patient receiving adequate initial resistance for each separate exercise we aim to use a three-step approach:</p><p>1 A pilot study was performed on 30 healthy individuals, in a similar age group as the patients within this study. The results of the pilot study showed a strong relationship between elastic resistance maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and isokinetic peak value during shoulder flexion with no significant difference in weight (kg). Based on this pilot study, the peak value obtained from the isokinetic tests at baseline within the present study will be used to determine MVC (that is, 1 RM) using elastic resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Fifty-five per cent of the isokinetic peak value will be used as 25 RM as recommended by Page and Ellenbecker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, the choice of standardizing the training load from a MVC using elastic resistance has been questioned. Therefore, a goal-based 25 RM test will also be performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The number of attempts needed to reach 25 RM will be recorded.</p><p>2 Based on a literature search the following percentage strength relationships between involved muscles for COPD patients during the movements that are involved in this HRSLE were identified (described as weight at end position if knee extension is seen as maximal): knee extension (100%), chest press (85%), leg curl (65%), elbow flexion (50%), latissimus row (35%), shoulder flexion (30%). For example, if 10&#x02009;kg is considered 55% of 1 RM for knee extension, 3&#x02009;kg would be considered 55% of 1 RM for shoulder flexion.</p><p>3 According to the strength relationship between involved muscles and information obtained regarding the weight properties of elastic resistance at a given length (Thera-Band values provided by the manufacturer; The Hygenic Corporation), the distance from insertion for each exercise using elastic resistance is determined (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><p>By using different starting positions for each exercise (that is, the elastic tubing is stretched to different lengths resulting in different resistances at every position) we hope to be able to optimize the resistance for the involved muscle during each separate exercise.

Holding each stretch for 30 seconds to mild discomfort, with two repetitions for each limb (that is, 2 minutes active stretching for each muscle), targeting the pectoralis major, biceps brachii, hamstrings, quadriceps and triceps surae, is in accordance with recommendations of the ACSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Selection of muscles is based on involvement in the HRSLE regimen. In addition, the intervention group receives standardized patient education on four occasions during an 8-week period.

Since a subject's motivation may determine attainment of maximal effort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], both pre- and post-tests are performed using standardized information and encouragement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. No additional follow-up apart from directly after the end of the intervention period is used within this trial.

The sample size calculation was made with the following assumptions: a relevant mean difference of 50 meters walked in 6 minutes with a standard deviation (SD) of 52, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20 (80% power); and a two-tailed test of significance, based on a study by Costi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] (a RCT published in 2009 on unsupported training in patients with COPD). For QoL, the sample size calculation was made with these assumptions: a relevant mean difference of 1 unit (SD 1.07) on the Swedish version of the CRQ, &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, &#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20 (80% power); and a two-tailed test of significance, data based on CRQ values obtained in the study by Lacasse and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>] gave 17 patients in each group. Multicenter trials involve a correlation in data - subjects from the same center are likely to be more similar than subjects from other centers. Because such a correlation potentially affects the power of the data within the trial, the sample size needs to be adjusted, often increased, to account for the design of the study - in other words, the design effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Several considerations have been made to minimize the effect of using different centers: the same inclusion criteria for participants at all locations; specified and similar inclusion criteria for physiotherapists at all locations; standardized training for all physiotherapists to uniformly deliver the intervention; all aspects of the intervention regimen are standardized; a standardized exercise protocol will be given to both physiotherapists leading interventions and participants; physiotherapists give informed consent to follow the standardized instructions regarding the standardized patient education material; and exercise protocol and primary outcome measures are measured by the same (blinded) outcome assessor at all centers during pre- and post-tests. In addition, in an individually randomized trial, stratified for centers, the design effect is estimated to be&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1 which involves a gain in power, allowing a reduction in sample size rather than an increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. With regard to the design of the study and the considerations taken to minimize the effect of using different centers, no adjustment of sample size will be made due to design effect. Nevertheless, the sample size is adjusted for potential drop-outs. We expect a drop-out rate of 20% based on a previous systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].

Correlation between changes in physical variables and changes in health variables will be measured by Pearson correlation. A pre-specified subgroup analysis of participants randomized to the intervention group will be performed to investigate differences in BORG CR10 rating between elastic resistance exercises to evaluate the strength relationship between involved muscles/movements.

Therefore, we aim to compare primary and secondary outcome measures for males versus females in pre-specified subgroup analyses to gather information for future studies. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used for all outcome measurements and involve all patients who are randomly assigned. Mixed models will be used to handle missing outcome data. In addition, within the main analysis, an on-treatment analysis will be executed. On-treatment is defined as at least 80% compliance - in other words, at least 20 training sessions or three education sessions depending on group allocation.

This is a well designed study in strict accordance with CONSORT guidelines, which will give us the opportunity to determine the effects of the HRSLE regimen used within this trial. A problem in many previous exercise studies is the lack of standardization which makes reproducibility difficult. The comprehensive standardization in this trial facilitates the reproducibility of this trial. There is evidence that a higher metabolic rate is achieved by training using a reduced simultaneous muscle mass in the form of single limb training (that is, training using one leg/arm at a time) in COPD patients. This is due to less stress being placed on the respiratory system as ventilation is reduced compared to whole body exercises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>]. Previous studies indicate that single limb exercise regimens seem more effective regarding total work conducted during exercise compared to using a larger amount of muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This project will give important information about a single limb exercise regimen that gives patients the opportunity to incorporate both upper as well as lower extremity muscles within the same exercise regimen maintaining a low simultaneous impact on the ventilatory system. To find adjunctive exercise strategies is of great importance to optimize the treatment of the growing population of COPD patients. The results of this project will most likely influence how we treat COPD patients in the future. The number of females with COPD is increasing but most of the previously conducted exercise trials involve a majority of men. It is very important to investigate if the treatment effects differ between men and women to be able to optimize the treatment for all patients suffering from this troublesome disease. This RCT will contribute to the existing knowledge regarding potential sex-related differences in physiological response to exercise training. Adequate resistance for each separately involved muscle within an exercise regimen is of importance to optimize the training effects. If we could minimize the attempts needed to reach adequate resistance and provide accurate resistance for each involved muscle the effects of the exercise training could increase.</p><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is currently recruiting participants at time for submission of trial protocol 2012-02-10.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The clinical trial has been registered before the enrollment of the first participant.
