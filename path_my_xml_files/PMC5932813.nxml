Taurolidine is a nontoxic agent that does not develop antibiotic resistance because it acts as an antiseptic rather than an antibiotic. Taurolidine has shown controversial results in the few trials conducted in cancer patients. These studies have important limitations due to the lack of data on adult and/or high-risk neutropenic patients, the type of catheters studied (tunnelled or ports), and the lack of information regarding the intervention (e.g. dwelling of the solution, time, and periodicity of the lock technique). If our hypothesis is proven, the study could provide important solid evidence on the potential usefulness of this preventive procedure in a population at high risk of CRBSI, in whom this complication may significantly impair patient outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.isrctn.com/search?q=ISRCTN47102251">ISRCTN47102251</ext-link>.

Patients with cancer usually have central venous catheters (CVC) implanted for an indefinite period for the administration of chemotherapy and other products and medications and are at increased risk of presenting with this complication, especially during the neutropenic phase. CRBSI in patients with cancer is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality, with excess costs and prolonged length of hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Importantly, CRBSI can delay the administration of chemotherapy, which may negatively influence patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Gram-positive organisms, mainly coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, are the leading cause of CRBSI in patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, an increasing number of episodes of CRBSI due to Gram-negative bacilli and fungi have been recently documented in some institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, an alarming emergence of antimicrobial resistance is being observed among Gram-negative bacteria infecting high-risk patients with malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This is of special concern due to the associated increased mortality of bloodstream infections (BSI) due to resistant organisms in neutropenic cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The most frequent mechanism of infection with long-term, non-tunnelled CVC use is catheter hub contamination during catheter manipulation by health personnel, leading to endoluminal colonisation and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Bacterial colonisation of catheter lumens leads to the development of a microbial consortium associated with the catheter surface and embedded in an extracellular matrix, named biofilm, which hinders antibiotic penetration and bacterial eradication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Catheter removal and treatment with systemic antibiotics is the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; approach for CRBSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, in neutropenic cancer patients, the removal of their &#x02018;highly needed&#x02019; catheter is not always feasible, even when the diagnosis of catheter infection is established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, prevention of CRBSI in these high-risk patients is crucial.</p><p id="Par19">The use of lock therapy with different solutions as a method of preventing luminal catheter colonisation is an effective strategy in reducing CRBSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Lock therapy involves instillation of a solution into the catheter lumen for a variable period of time, depending on the solution at hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, the use of lock therapy decreases the incidence of CRBIS in some studies involving patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, significant differences in the definitions of CRBSI exist in the studies performed, as well as in the type of catheters, the solutions used, and the dwelling times. Additionally, almost all studies have been performed in paediatric populations, and the number of high-risk neutropenic patients included in the studies is very small. In fact, national guidelines do not currently support the prophylactic use of lock therapy in patients with cancer, while waiting for higher-quality scientific evidence.</p><p id="Par20">Vancomycin, ethanol, and taurolidine have been the most frequently studied lock solutions in patients with cancer, with very variable results, according to the significant aforementioned differences in the methodology of the studies and the population involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Of note, there is great concern regarding the use of vancomycin as a lock solution, since there is a risk of developing antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, the adverse events observed with the use of ethanol discourage its use as a lock solution. Taurolidine is a non-toxic substance derived from the amino acid taurine, which has anti-adherent, immunomodulatory, antithrombotic, and antitumour properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although it is not an antibiotic, it has a wide array of antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. Taurolidine-citrate was found to be effective in two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] of the three studies involving paediatric patients with cancer, reducing CRBSI rates compared with heparin solutions, but it did not offer any benefit when used in the single adult study performed in patients with non-haematological cancer who had totally implantable venous access ports implanted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The scarce and heterogeneous data obtained from these studies do not draw any solid conclusion. Moreover, almost all reported studies involved paediatric patients, and the devices studied in all of these trials were tunnelled catheters or ports.</p><p id="Par21">This prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial aims to test the hypothesis that lock solution with taurolidine-citrate-heparin is more effective than placebo for preventing CVC catheter infection in high-risk neutropenic haematological patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives of the study</title><p id="Par22">This study aims to determine whether taurolidine-citrate-heparin lock solution is more effective than heparin alone for the prevention of CVC infection in neutropenic haematological patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p id="Par23">Bacterial colonisation of the CVC hubs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary endpoints</title><p id="Par24">Incidence of CRBSI, CVC removal, adverse reactions, and 30-day case-fatality rate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par25">This study is a prospective, multicentre, randomised, double-blinded, parallel, superiority, placebo-controlled trial (1:1).

Any patient withdrawing their consent will be removed from the treatment and/or the study observations immediately after the date the patient requests it.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par61">The following data will be collected: sex, age, type of underlying disease, other comorbidities, date of hospital admission, HSCT, type and date of HSCT, immunosuppressive therapy, concomitant medication, duration of neutropenia, type of CVC, days from CVC insertion to inclusion in the study, use of prophylactic antibiotics or antifungal agents, systemic antibiotic therapy, number of catheter locks per episode, results of the cultures of the hubs and CVC insertion site, any episodes of infection, episodes of CRBSI, the need for CVC removal and reason, development of complications, adverse reactions, overall case-fatality rate, CRBSI attributable case-fatality rate, and date of discharge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Definitions</title><p id="Par62">Significant colonisation of any catheter hub will be defined as the presence of any microbial growth in the qualitative culture of the swabs. CRBSI will be defined as the detection of growth of bacteria or fungi in at least one blood culture obtained from a peripheral vein, associated with clinical signs and symptoms of infection (e.g. fever, chills, and/or hypotension), and no apparent source for BSI other than the CVC. In the case of common skin-colonising microorganisms, such as CNS, two positive sets of blood cultures will be necessary to make the diagnosis of CRBSI. CRBSI attributed to luminal colonisation will be defined as the isolation of identical organisms from the catheter hub and from cultures of separate percutaneously drawn blood specimens; the organism&#x02019;s identity will be proven by molecular typing for patients with BSI due to CNS. Overall, the 30-day case-fatality rate will be defined as death by any cause within the 30&#x000a0;days following the end of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Study outcomes and endpoint assessment</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p id="Par63">For the assessment of the primary endpoint (bacterial colonisation rate of the CVC hubs), swabs of the inner surfaces of the catheter hubs will be obtained by the nursing personnel before randomisation and three times weekly (approximately every 48-72&#x000a0;h) thereafter for culture, until the end of the intervention. All swabs are made of viscose, and only the swab of the catheter insertion site has a transport media (Stuart media). One swab is used for each lumen The cultures of the collected swabs will be processed in the microbiology department.

The incidence of CRBSI and the CRBSI attributed to luminal colonisation will be calculated for each group. The differential time to positivity will not be used to diagnose CRBSI. The development of CRBSI will be assessed during intervention and up to 30&#x000a0;days after the last intervention.

A reduction of this figure to 5% in the taurolidine-citrate-heparin group would be clinically relevant. To detect a 15% difference between groups with a power of 80%, it would be necessary to include 135 patients in the study. Considering the possibility of a loss of 10% of cases, the final sample should be 150 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par71">The analysis of the data will be carried out during the last 6&#x000a0;months of the project when all fieldwork has been completed. The database will then be analysed using the stepwise logistic regression model of the R software (R v. 3.2.5). The analyses will be made by intention-to-treat (all patients randomised who have a primary endpoint available). To handle missing data multiple imputation will be done under the missing at random assumption.</p><p id="Par72">For the analysis of the primary endpoint, the frequency of colonisation of the CVC hubs in both treatment groups will be compared. For the analysis of the secondary endpoints, the frequency of CRBSI will be compared between the two groups, as well as the need for CVC removal for any cause and overall case-fatality rate (30&#x000a0;days). Exploratory subgroup analyses will be conducted by underlying haematological condition (leukaemia, autologous HSCT, and allogeneic HSCT) and by centre. Due to the fact that a patient could have been included twice, the potential impact of independence violation will be assessed repeating the main analysis using patient as a cluster.</p><p id="Par73">The statistical analysis will be carried out using a Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test and a chi-square test. A multivariate analysis will be performed to verify the absence of confusion by other variables.

A qualitative culture of these samples will be performed, and they will be considered positive when the growth of a microorganism is detected. After catheter removal, the terminal portion (5&#x000a0;cm) of the catheter tip will be cultured using the roll-plate technique (Maki&#x02019;s technique) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].

However, catheter infection still occurs, especially with long-term CVC use. Given the integral role of long-term CVC use in the health care system, administering lock solutions to patients with these types of catheters remains an important option for the prevention and adjunctive treatment of CRBSI. The lock technique is a preventive strategy that inhibits bacterial colonisation in the catheter hubs, which is the initial step of endoluminal catheter colonisation and the development of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">A wide variety of antibiotic lock solutions have been evaluated for clinical use, with the largest body of data available for vancomycin and gentamicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this regard, in a meta-analysis, vancomycin-containing lock or flush solutions had shown to reduce CRBSIs and prolonged catheter survival in patients receiving haemodialysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">Patients with cancer who have a CVC implanted are at special risk of developing CRBSI. Infection rates of 2.66 per 1000 line-days have been found in adult haematology/oncology and bone marrow transplant units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Recently, lock solution technique as a preventive strategy for CRBSI in patients with cancer has been systematically reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The great majority of studies were performed in paediatric patients (10 studies), and only three were carried out in the adult population. Vancomycin was the most frequently studied solution because the great majority of infections are caused by Gram-positive bacteria. The results of vancomycin studies were variable; some studies showed a reduction of CRBSI in paediatric patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], while others failed to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, Carratal&#x000e0; et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] demonstrated a significant reduction of CRBSI in neutropenic haematological patients using vancomycin as lock solution in the single study carried out in adults. Nevertheless, the widespread use of prophylactic antibiotics as catheter lock solutions may contribute to the development of antibiotic-selective pressure and resistance. In addition, the emergence of Gram-negative bacteria as an important cause of CRBSI raises the doubt about the current utility of vancomycin. Furthermore, three studies investigating ethanol as a lock solution in paediatric and adult patients with cancer showed discordant results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Moreover, relatively frequent adverse effects have been reported with the use of ethanol-based solutions, which limits its use for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par82">Taurolidine is a non-toxic agent with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi. It reduces biofilm formation and does not develop antibiotic resistance because it acts as an antiseptic rather than an antibiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Interestingly, due to its broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, taurolidine-citrate used as a lock solution not only reduced the risk of CRBSI but also the risk of Gram-negative infections according to the results of a recent meta-analysis conducted in the general population without cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In the aforementioned systematic review in patients with cancer by Norris et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], taurolidine showed beneficial results compared with placebo in two of the three studies involving paediatric patients with cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the contrary, a third study of paediatric patients with totally implantable venous access ports showed no beneficial effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Likewise, in a recent prospective, randomised, phase IV trial, taurolidine-citrate did not show a significant reduction in the risk of infection when used in adult patients with non-haematological cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. These studies have important limitations due to the lack of data on adult and/or high-risk neutropenic patients, the type of catheters studied (tunnelled or ports), and the lack of information regarding the intervention (e.g. dwelling of the solution, time, and periodicity of the lock technique).</p><p id="Par83">The use of taurolidine-citrate as a lock solution has been associated with mild and self-limited adverse events when used as flushing, with an unpleasant taste in the mouth as the most common side effect.</p><p id="Par84">In this study, we aim to assess the efficacy of taurolidine-citrate as a catheter lock solution in preventing CVC bacterial colonisation and, consequently, CRBSI in neutropenic haematological patients. If our hypothesis is proven, the study could provide important solid evidence on the potential usefulness of this preventive procedure in a population at high risk of CRBSI, in whom this complication may significantly impair patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par85">Recruitment of patients started on 1 January 2013, and it will be completed by 30 June 2018.
