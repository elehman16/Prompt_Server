Whether these effects are due to the high dietary lipid content or to the concomitant decrease of carbohydrate intake is unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether higher amounts of dietary fat reaching the colon (through orlistat administration) affect the colonic ecosystem in healthy volunteers and the effect of the prebiotic oligofructose (OF) in this model.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS:</title><p>Forty-one healthy young subjects were distributed among four groups: Control (C), Prebiotic (P), Orlistat (O), and Orlistat/Prebiotic (OP). They consumed a fat-standardized diet (60&#x02009;g/day) during Week-1 (baseline) and after 1 week of washout, Week-3. During Week-3, they also received their respective treatment (Orlistat: 2 &#x000d7; 120&#x02009;mg/day, OF: 16&#x02009;g/day, and maltodextrin as placebo). A 72-h stool collection was carried out at the end of Week-1 (T0) and Week-3 (T1). Fecal fat, calprotectin, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) as well as the antioxidant activity of fecal waters (ferric-reducing antioxidant power), fecal microbiota composition (by deep sequencing), and gut permeability (Sucralose/Lactulose/Mannitol test) were determined at these times.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS:</title><p>Fecal fat excretion was higher in the O (<italic>P</italic>=0.0050) and OP (<italic>P</italic>=0.0069) groups. This event was accompanied, in the O group, by an increased calprotectin content (<italic>P</italic>=0.047) and a decreased fecal antioxidant activity (<italic>P</italic>=0.047). However, these alterations did not alter gut barrier function and the changes observed in the composition of the fecal microbiota only affected bacterial populations with low relative abundance (&#x0003c;0.01&#x00025;); in consequences, fecal SCFA remained mainly unchanged. Part of the colonic alterations induced by orlistat were prevented by OF administration.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS:</title><p>In the context of an equilibrated diet, the acute exposition of the colonic ecosystem to high amounts of dietary lipids is associated with an incremented excretion of fecal calprotectin and pro-oxidant activity of the colonic content, in the absence of significant changes in the microbiota.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Dietary triglycerides account for approximately 30&#x02013;35&#x00025; of the total energy intake in humans. They represent &#x0003e;95&#x00025; of the dietary lipids consumed daily and are efficiently digested, mainly by the gastric and pancreatic lipase, before being absorbed as free fatty acids by the small intestinal mucosa. It is estimated that only 4&#x02013;5&#x02009;g of fat reach the colon daily and that 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;g are excreted in stools. Fecal losses &#x0003e;5&#x00025; of the dietary fat are generally considered as steatorrhea and suggestive of malabsorption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> The fate of dietary lipids in the colon is poorly understood and the identity of the bacterial populations eventually involved in their metabolism is unclear. Saturated fatty acids may form insoluble soaps with calcium or magnesium in the gut lumen while unsaturated fatty acids may be hydrogenated or oxidized, generating by-products with cathartic and/or pro-oxidant effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup></p><p>Higher input of dietary fat into the colon occurs in patients treated with orlistat (tetrahydrolipstatin), an inhibitor of the pancreatic lipase that is widely used in the management of obesity and dyslipidemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> Its administration decreases by approximately 30&#x00025; the intraluminal hydrolysis of triglycerides, favoring their subsequent excretion in stools. The use of orlistat is frequently associated with side effects, such as bloating, loose stools or diarrhea, steatorrhea, oily stool feeling and/or fecal seeping. Increased fecal fat excretion is detected 24&#x02013;48&#x02009;h after orlistat administration and usually returns to baseline levels within 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;h after its administration is interrupted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Various studies have reported an association between obesity and alterations of the intestinal microbiota in both humans and animals. The main finding initially described was the increase of the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> However, subsequent studies produced conflicting results and the bacterial populations implicated in this dysbiosis and potentially in the development of obesity remain unclear.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Hildebrandt <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> have suggested that the fat content of the diet, more than the obesity <italic>per se</italic>, was responsible for the dysbiosis. On the other hand, other authors have proposed bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as a crucial factor linking high-fat diet consumption with gut microbiota alterations and the subsequent development of low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, type-2 diabetes and, in some cases, hepatic steatosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> High-fat diets have been reported to decrease Gram-positive bacteria and increase the concentrations of LPS in the gut lumen. This latter event was associated with impairment of the gastrointestinal barrier function and the subsequent development of metabolic endotoxemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, a limitation for the interpretation of these results and their extrapolation to humans are the supra-physiological amounts of fat used in the diets fed to the animals (about 70&#x00025; of the caloric intake). These amounts of fat are much higher than those provided by the human diet, even in obese subjects; in addition, in these animal studies, the lipids are incorporated to the diet at the expense of the carbohydrates, including the non-digestible polysaccharides/oligosaccharides. In consequence, it is unclear whether the dysbiosis associated with high-fat diets is due to the higher intake of fat or to the lower intake of carbohydrates.</p><p>Based on these antecedents, we proposed to use normal-weight, healthy, young subjects consuming a diet containing a standardized, equilibrated fat content and treated with orlistat to determine the impact of a higher amount of dietary fat reaching the colon on the gut barrier function, local and systemic inflammation, and bacterial populations of the colonic microbiota. As a number of studies carried out in animal models and in humans have reported that prebiotic administration improves gut barrier alterations and inflammation and modulates gut microbiota composition,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> we also determined whether dietary supplementation with the prebiotic oligofructose (OF) may interfere with the eventual deleterious effects of dietary fat at the colonic level.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Research in Humans of the Institute of Nutrition and Food Technology, University of Chile, Santiago, Chile in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration. All subjects were carefully informed about the aims and procedures of the study and those who agreed to participate and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria signed a written informed consent form.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Forty-one asymptomatic volunteers of either sex, aged 18&#x02013;40 years, with a body mass index between 18.5 and 24.9&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and non-smokers were recruited for this study. Anthropometric data and biochemical and lipid profiles, as well as the plasma inflammatory markers, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), were determined before initiating the study. Subjects with antecedents of acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases or with previous gastrointestinal surgery (appendectomy excepted) as well as those with autoimmune or chronic metabolic diseases, dietary treatment for weight loss, and pregnant women were excluded. Subjects treated with drugs that could interfere with the gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, or motility (antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs, laxatives, prokinetics) in the past 45 days before the study were also excluded. Subjects were requested to avoid consuming prebiotics and probiotics during 3 weeks previous to the study and during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>On admission, subjects were randomly assigned to four groups by using a per block random permutation table: Control (C), Orlistat (O), Prebiotic (P), and Orlistat/Prebiotic (OP). Every day for 1 week, subjects of the O group received 2 &#x000d7; 120&#x02009;mg Orlistat capsules (Xenical, Roche, Santiago, Chile) and 16&#x02009;g of placebo, those from the P group 2 &#x000d7; 120&#x02009;mg of placebo and 16&#x02009;g of OF (Raftilin, Orafti Chile, Santiago, Chile), those from the OP group 2 &#x000d7; 120&#x02009;mg of Orlistat and 16&#x02009;g of OF, and those from the C group 2 &#x000d7; 120&#x02009;mg and 16&#x02009;g of placebo. Maltodextrin was used as placebo for Orlistat as well as for OF.</p><p>The study began with a run-in basal period of 1 week (days 1&#x02013;7) during which the volunteers were counseled by two registered dietitians to standardize their daily intake of dietary fat to about 60&#x02009;g. With this aim, a list of foodstuffs with their corresponding fat content per serving was provided to the volunteers. At the end of this basal period (T0), a 72-h total stool collection was carried out to determine the fecal fat excretion at baseline. The subjects were allowed to return to their usual diet and for the following 7 days (days 8&#x02013;14). During the third week (days 15&#x02013;21), the volunteers had to consume the diet with the standardized fat content and, in addition, their corresponding treatment. A second 72-h total stool collection was carried out at the end of this period (T1).</p><p>During the study, the volunteers had to register daily the eventual presence of the digestive symptoms (abdominal pain and/or distension, vomiting/regurgitation, increased borborygmi, increased rectal gas, effort/pain during defecation, fecal emergency, fecal incontinence, evacuation of fatty/oily stools, increased stool emission) and distractors, and their respective intensity (absent (0); low (1); mild (2); high (3)). They also had to register their stool frequency and consistency using an <italic>ad-hoc</italic> form and the seven-point Bristol stool scale. For statistical analysis, the sum of the digestive symptoms was calculated considering their respective intensity for each subject.</p></sec><sec><title>Samples</title><p>Blood samples were obtained at T0 and T1 from the subjects while fasted to determine their lipid profile, glycemia, hsCRP, and IL-6. At the same time, a fresh stool was obtained to characterize the microbiota composition and to quantify the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and calprotectin. Fecal waters were obtained to determine their antioxidant capacity by FRAP (ferric-reducing antioxidant power). Fecal fat excretion was determined in the 72-h stool collection using the Van de Kamer method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> based on the hydrolysis of the fecal triglycerides in acidic conditions and the titration of the released free fatty acids.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the fecal microbiota</title><p>Bacterial genomic DNA was extracted from the fecal samples with the QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Fecal calprotectin levels did not change between T1 and T0 in the C group while they significantly decreased in the P group (<italic>P</italic>=0.041) and increased in the O group (<italic>P</italic>=0.047). The increase of fecal calprotectin induced by orlistat was prevented by the concomitant administration of prebiotic so that a significant decrease of this parameter was even observed in the OP group at T1 (<italic>P</italic>=0.016). In consequence, fecal calprotectin was significantly higher at T1 in the O group than in the P and OP groups (<italic>P</italic>=0.011 and 0.006, respectively). No correlations were observed between fecal calprotectin and fecal fat excretion (<italic>P</italic>=0.21).</p><p>As fat oxidation in the colon may result in the generation of pro-oxidant compounds, in addition to lipid peroxidation products, the antioxidant activity of the fecal water of the volunteers from the four groups was evaluated through the FRAP method. As reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, no differences between groups were detected in the fecal antioxidant activity at T0 (Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis ANOVA, <italic>P</italic>=0.93). This parameter remained unchanged at T1 in both the C and P groups but it significantly decreased after orlistat administration. Such decrease was prevented in the OP group.</p><p>The evaluation of gut barrier function was evaluated by using the lactulose/mannitol/sucralose test in a subgroup of subjects (six in each group). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S4</xref>, the urinary excretions of lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose were similar in the four groups at T0 and remained unchanged after the treatment period. When the results were expressed as lactulose/mannitol or lactulose/sucralose ratios, as a reflection of the permeability of the proximal and distal gut, respectively, no changes between T1 and T0 or between groups were observed either.</p><p>To determine whether the composition of the fecal microbiota was affected by the higher amounts of dietary fat reaching the colon after orlistat administration, we sequenced the V3&#x02013;V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 5,717,914 reads were obtained after trimming, assembly, quality filtering, and chimera checking, with an average of 70,045&#x000b1;11,983 sequences per sample (ranging from 42,308 to 115,406). One of the samples (from control Group, T1) only exhibited 32 sequences and was excluded from the study. Sequences were grouped into OTUs based on a sequence identity of 97&#x00025;. OTUs with at least 10 sequences were considered for further analysis, resulting in a total of 4,632 OTUs that could be classified into 13 phyla and 64 families. The rarefaction curves tended to the saturation plateau for each group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Alpha diversity was not significantly affected by the treatments (Shannon diversity index: Control: 3.67&#x000b1;0.58; Orlistat: 3.71&#x000b1;0.31; Prebiotic: 3.54&#x000b1;0.37; Orlistat&#x02013;Prebiotic: 3.78&#x000b1;0.36). The analysis of beta-diversity (weighted Unifrac) showed that samples at T1 did not cluster according to treatments; high interindividual variations were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). The effect of treatments on the dominant microbial phyla and families (with a relative abundance &#x0003e;0.5&#x00025;) is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b and c</xref>. For each treatment, some significant changes in the relative abundance of some phyla and families were detected between T1 and T0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table S5</xref>). However, after correction for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg procedure for controlling false discovery rate, these differences did not remain significant. The specific effect of the OF administration on <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> populations was also determined by quantitative PCR (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The fecal counts of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. were similar in the four groups at T0. However, the by-group analysis indicates a significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.028) and a non-significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.07) increase of <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> at T1 in the P and OP groups, respectively, without changes in the Control and Orlistat groups. The counts of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> spp. were similar between groups at T0 and T1 and remained unchanged after treatments.</p><p>Results corresponding to the fecal concentrations of SCFAs are described in <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Neither differences between T1 and T0 nor between groups were detected whether for each of them or for the total of SCFAs. However, a significant decrease of the ramified SCFAs, isobutyrate and isovalerate, was observed in the OP group.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The aim of the present study was to assess the way in which increased amounts of dietary fat reaching the colon may alter the colonic ecosystem, including the local microbiota, in healthy, normal-weight volunteers. This was achieved through the administration of orlistat, i.e., without the need to modify the proportion of lipids in the diet at the expense of carbohydrates or fiber.</p><p>As expected, we observed that daily intake of orlistat significantly increases fecal fat excretion, compared with the subjects from the C and P groups; this phenomenon was accompanied by adverse effects similar to those reported in other studies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> Orlistat partially inhibits (by about 30&#x00025;) triglyceride hydrolysis in the intestinal lumen and the non-absorbed fat finally reaches the colon. Considering that our subjects consumed daily a standardized diet with about 60&#x02009;g fat, it may be estimated that about 20&#x02009;g of this fat reached the colon of the orlistat-treated volunteers. To obtain this same amount in the context of a high-fat diet and considering a fat digestion efficiency of 90&#x00025;, subjects would have to consume about 200&#x02009;g of dietary fat/day, a high amount but that is compatible with that consumed by obese subjects in some cases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref></sup></p><p>In a first time, we evaluated whether the more elevated amount of fat reaching the colon was associated with increased inflammatory processes. We used fecal calprotectin, a biomarker of colonic inflammation currently used in the screening and follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> and that is also associated with physiological changes in the aged gastrointestinal tract and with physical inactivity and obesity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> In a previous study, we did not detect any changes of this parameter in young &#x0201c;asymptomatic&#x0201d; obese subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> However, our current results show, for the first time, that fecal calprotectin significantly increased after orlistat administration and that, accordingly, fat malabsorption might be associated with increased inflammatory processes in the colonic mucosa. It must be stated, however, that such increase was not accompanied by higher levels of the circulating inflammatory markers, hsCRP and IL-6. Interestingly, the addition of the prebiotic OF prevented the increase of fecal calprotectin induced by orlistat, confirming the observations of Vulevic <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> who reported that the administration of transgalacto-oligosaccharides decreased fecal calprotectin in patients with metabolic syndrome.</p><p>An explanation for the higher level of colonic inflammation in our subjects is the eventual increase of the pro-oxidant capacity of the intracolonic content resulting from dietary fat oxidation. Accordingly, we determined the antioxidant capacity of the fecal water of our subjects. Our results show a significant decrease of FRAP values between T1 and T0 only in the orlistat-treated subjects, suggesting that the antioxidant capacity of the fecal waters decreased (i.e., its pro-oxidant capacity increased) with fat malabsorption. In agreement with these results, Qiao <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> observed that mice fed a high-fat diet had higher contents of reactive oxygen species and malonedialdehyde adducts and exhibited decreased total antioxidant capacity in their colon. Such changes were associated with increased counts of colonic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> and decreased counts of colonic <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. High-fat diets have also been shown to increase free radical formation in the human feces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> and to alter the integrity of the intestinal barrier, favoring the entry of LPS into the circulation and the development of metabolic endotoxemia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup></p><p>As the increase of inflammation and the decrease of antioxidant capacity have been associated with disturbances of the gut barrier function, we determined the intestinal and colonic permeability to lactulose, mannitol, and sucralose in a subgroup of our subjects. No alterations of the urinary excretion of these biomarkers were detected in our study, suggesting that the increased presence of dietary fat in the colon does not affect the intestinal barrier function. However, it is possible that the duration of the administration of orlistat was not sufficient to induce such alterations. In fact, in most of the animal models of obesity induced by high-fat diet, defects of gut permeability are detected after &#x0003e;1 month of diet consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> However, it is noteworthy that in some genetic models of obesity (ob/ob mice), no alterations of gut barrier function were observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> and that in obese humans, results are contradictory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup></p><p>Another factor possibly implicated in the changes in inflammatory and oxidative status of the colonic ecosystem is the gut microbiota. Some bacterial populations express lipase activities capable of hydrolyzing the dietary triglycerides reaching the colon.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> In our study, the increasing dietary fat reaching the colon after orlistat treatment only provoked minor, not significant, changes in subdominant bacterial populations (with relative abundance &#x0003c;0.01&#x00025;), suggesting that it is not the fat, <italic>per se</italic>, which modifies the microbiota composition. In consequence, the shift in the diversity of dominant gut bacterial populations reported after long-term administration of high-fat diets could be due, eventually, to the decreased intake of carbohydrate and dietary fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup> It might be argued that in our study, orlistat administration was too short to affect the composition of the microbiota. Nevertheless, our results are supported by the observations of David <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> who recently reported significant changes in the composition of the gut microbiota only 1 day after initiating a diet entirely based on animal products (i.e., rich in fat and proteins and poor in dietary fibers). One of the major forces shaping the gut microbiota is the availability of substrates, especially complex dietary polysaccharides.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup> In this context, the dominant gut metagenome and proteome is mainly involved in energy production from carbohydrate metabolism even in high-fat diets while genes associated with lipid metabolism are mainly involved in biosynthetic or bioconversion reactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup> As discussed by other authors, the effect of high-fat diets could also be explained by indirect mechanisms such as the increased secretion of bile acids that they triggered and the increased abundance of bile-tolerant bacteria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> For example, in mice fed a high-fat diet, the fecal excretion of ursodeoxycholic acid decreased, whereas that of deoxycholic acid increased,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> this bile acid being involved in the disruption of epithelial integrity and in the modification of gut microbiota composition through its strong antibacterial properties.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> On the contrary, the administration of orlistat has been associated with decreased fecal excretion of bile salts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> meaning a lower potential of modulating the microbiota composition.</p><p>The administration of high-fat diets have been reported to decrease <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. in mice while increasing LPS-bearing gram-negative bacteria, and the use of probiotics and prebiotics has been proposed as a tool to re-establish the homeostasis of the colonic ecosystem.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> In our study, <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. were not affected by orlistat administration but significantly increased in the P and OP groups, confirming the well-known prebiotic effect of OF on this microorganism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> Bifidobacteria may exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, which may contribute to prevent the increase of fecal calprotectin and the decrease of antioxidant capacity induced by orlistat, similar to that in our subjects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref></sup></p><p>We also evaluated the fecal content of SCFA, as the proportion and concentrations of these bacterial metabolites are known to be strongly influenced by diet.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref></sup> However, no significant changes in fecal SCFA were detected in any of the groups, probably reflecting the fact that only small changes were observed in the bacterial populations. In contrast with our results, Brinkworth <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref></sup> reported decreased fecal butyrate and total SCFAs after the administration of a very low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet, compared with a high-carbohydrate, high-fibre, low-fat diet and Fava <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref></sup> described higher fecal SCFAs with a diet high in saturated fat in subjects at risk for metabolic syndrome.</p><p>In conclusion, increasing the amounts of dietary fat passing through the colon by using orlistat administration results in higher excretion of fecal calprotectin, increased oxidant activity of the fecal water, and small changes in some bacterial populations, without alterations of gut barrier function and fecal SCFA contents. These alterations tend to be prevented by the concomitant administration of the prebiotic OF. The short period of exposition to orlistat must be considered a limitation of this study because it probably does not provide enough time for more intense alterations, particularly on the barrier function. In the context of the regular consumption of high-fat diets, these results suggest that high amounts of dietary lipids could affect the colonic ecosystem and function, with eventual development of inflammatory, oxidative, and metabolic consequences at the systemic level.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ctg201620i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the volunteers who participated in the study and Dr Oscar Brunser for revising the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Information</xref> accompanies this paper on the Clinical and Translational Gastroenterology website (http://www.nature.com/ctg)</p></fn></fn-group><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article</bold>: Martin Gotteland, PhD.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions</bold>: Martin Gotteland and Pamela Morales carried out the experimental design of the study and the statistical analysis of the results and their interpretation.
