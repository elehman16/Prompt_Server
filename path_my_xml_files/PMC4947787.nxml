There is good evidence that graded exercise therapy is moderately effective in adults with CFS/ME, but there is little evidence for the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, acceptability or best method of delivery for paediatric CFS/ME. This study aims to investigate the acceptability and feasibility of carrying out a multicentre randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of graded exercise therapy compared with activity management for children/teenagers who are mildly or moderately affected with CFS/ME.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>100 paediatric patients (8&#x02013;17&#x02005;years) with CFS/ME will be recruited from 3 specialist UK National Health Service (NHS) CFS/ME services (Bath, Cambridge and Newcastle). Patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive either graded exercise therapy or activity management. Feasibility analysis will include the number of young people eligible, approached and consented to the trial; attrition rate and treatment adherence; questionnaire and accelerometer completion rates. Integrated qualitative methods will ascertain perceptions of feasibility and acceptability of recruitment, randomisation and the interventions. All adverse events will be monitored to assess the safety of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service (South West&#x02014;Frenchay 15/SW/0124).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN23962803; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PAEDIATRICS</kwd><kwd>chronic fatigue syndrome</kwd><kwd>CFS/ME</kwd><kwd>ME</kwd><kwd>GET</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Research Fellowship, Dr Esther Crawley, SRF</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This feasibility study is the first trial to investigate graded exercise therapy in children with chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in the outpatient setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Integrated qualitative methodology is being used to optimise recruitment and retention, and to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of the study processes and interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This is a multicentre study which will test the feasibility of running this trial in different National Health Service (NHS) settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The participants and clinicians will not be blinded to allocation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Participant outcomes are self-reported.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic fatigue syndrome or myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) in children is relatively common, affecting between 0.1% and 2% of secondary school-aged children.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref> CFS/ME is defined as &#x02018;generalised fatigue, causing disruption of daily life, persisting after routine tests and investigations have failed to identify an obvious underlying &#x0201c;cause&#x0201d;&#x02019;.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

This is a feasibility RCT with integrated qualitative methods.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Potential participants will be identified by the clinician conducting the first assessment at specialist paediatric CFS/ME services in Bath, Newcastle and Cambridge. The clinician will provide information about the study and obtain written assent/consent for a member of the research team to talk to the child and parent/carers about the study and for this discussion to be recorded.</p><p>Potential participants can either meet the recruiting researcher in the hospital on the day of the initial assessment or discuss the study at a later date on the phone. At the start of the recruitment to trial discussion, the recruiter will confirm assent/consent for the discussion and check that the parent continues to be happy to have the discussion audio-recorded. The recruiting researcher will then discuss and provide further information about the Managed Activity Graded Exercise iN Teenagers and pre-Adolescents (MAGENTA) trial, including the study design, interventions, participant burden and the potential risks and benefits of taking part.</p><p>Children and parents who wish to take part in the study can either complete the written study assent/consent forms with the recruiter at the end of the discussion, returning them via post, scan the forms and email them electronically or sign the web-based consent form provided through the University of Bristol's data capture system (Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://project-redcap.org/">http://project-redcap.org/</ext-link>). A key aim of the feasibility trial is to ascertain the usefulness of the consent procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Children and adolescents will be eligible for inclusion if they are given a diagnosis of CFS/ME (made using NICE guidance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and aged between 8 and 17&#x02005;years inclusive.</p><p>Children and adolescents will be excluded if they are severely affected. NICE defines severe CFS/ME as individuals who are unable to do activity for themselves, or carry out minimal daily tasks only, have severe cognitive difficulties and depend on wheelchair for mobility;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or are referred for CBT at their first clinical assessment; or are unable to attend clinical sessions. Eligibility assessment will be carried out by the clinician at assessment and confirmed by the recruiting researcher.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Randomisation and allocation</title><p>Once the recruiter has received the signed assent/consent forms, they will use the automated telephone/web randomisation service operated by the Bristol Randomised Trials Collaboration. Allocation (1:1) will use minimisation to facilitate balance by age and gender, and retain a random component to prevent accurate prediction of allocation. Owing to the nature of the interventions, it is not practical to keep either the family or the clinical service blind to intervention allocation. If allocation is done during the recruitment appointment, families can choose to know the allocation immediately or be told later by phone or letter (if told via phone, the discussion will be audio-recorded with assent/consent from the parent/child). The recruiter then informs the clinical service who writes to the parent/child with their appointment details. The child's general practitioners (GPs) will be told what intervention they will receive as part of routine clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Sample size</title><p>An estimated 380 children and adolescents are assessed per annum in the three centres (Bath/Bristol 300, Cambridge 50, Newcastle 30). Estimates based on the Specialist Medical Intervention and Lightning Evaluation (SMILE) trial<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> suggest 60% will be eligible, of which 40&#x02013;50% will be recruited. We therefore estimate that recruitment of 100 will take &#x0223c;12&#x02005;months.</p><p>Recruiting 100 children from 430 eligible children approached will give a 95% CI of 20% to 28% for an estimated recruitment rate of 24% (0.6 eligible&#x000d7;0.4 consenting), which is acceptably precise for planning the main study recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Clinical interventions</title><p>Both interventions will be delivered in an outpatient setting. During clinical sessions, clinicians and patients develop collaborative activity plans, which children and adolescents then implement in the community (including home and school environments). Children and adolescents will be advised to use paper diaries/apps to assist with monitoring and recording of activity levels. In both arms, children and adolescents, their parents and the clinician providing intervention will choose the number of clinical sessions (between 8 and 12) and the frequency of appointments (every 2&#x02013;6&#x02005;weeks) within a maximum length of treatment of 1&#x02005;year.</p><p>In both arms, clinicians will be encouraged to offer routine<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> advice about sleep, medication use, symptom control and setbacks at the assessment and during intervention sessions.</p><p>Participants who develop anxiety or depression that requires treatment during the trial follow-up period will be offered up to 12 sessions of CBT delivered as individual sessions every 2&#x02005;weeks by a CFS/ME specialist clinical psychologist.</p><p>Participants will be allowed to either discontinue the intervention or withdraw from the trial at any time. If parents or clinicians request cross-over to the other intervention arm, we will encourage them to try the original allocation for 6&#x02005;months (the primary outcome). Any cross-over will be recorded.</p><sec id="s3f1"><title>Arm 1: activity management</title><p>This arm will be delivered by CFS/ME specialists. As activity management is currently being delivered in all three services, clinicians will not require further training; however, they will receive guidance on the mandatory, prohibited and flexible components (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> 1). Clinicians therefore have flexibility in delivering the intervention within their National Health Service (NHS) setting. Activity management aims to convert a &#x02018;boom&#x02013;bust&#x02019; pattern of activity (lots 1&#x02005;day and little the next) to a baseline with the same daily amount before increasing the daily amount by 10&#x02013;20% each week. For children and adolescents with CFS/ME, these are mostly cognitive activities: school, schoolwork, reading, socialising and screen time (phone, laptop, TV, games). Those allocated to this arm will receive advice about the total amount of daily activity, including physical activity, but will not receive specific advice about their use of exercise, increasing exercise or timed physical exercise.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011255.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011255supp_appendix.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s3f2"><title>Arm 2: graded exercise therapy (GET)</title><p>This arm will be delivered by referral to a GET-trained CFS/ME specialist who will receive guidance on the mandatory, prohibited and flexible components (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> 1). They will be encouraged to deliver GET as they would in their NHS setting.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Those allocated to this arm will be offered advice that is focused on exercise with detailed assessment of current physical activity, advice about exercise and a programme including timed daily exercise. The intervention will encourage children and adolescents to find a baseline level of exercise which will be increased slowly (by 10&#x02013;20% a week, as per NICE guidance<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and the Pacing, graded Activity and Cognitive behaviour therapy &#x02013; a randomised Evaluation (PACE)<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This will be the median amount of daily exercise done during the week.

To identify recruitment difficulties and improve recruitment,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> we will audio-record (with assent/consent) recruitment discussions. A sample of these will be analysed at regular intervals to explore information provision, recruitment techniques, patient intervention preferences and trial participation decisions. If analyses of the audio-recordings identify issues that appear to be impacting on trial recruitment, then feedback and training will be offered to the recruiter, the content of which will depend on the findings.</p><p>If the number of eligible patients recruited is lower than expected, or if there are differences in the percentage recruited between centres, we may undertake in-depth interviews with the clinical and recruitment staff and analyse screening logs to examine possible problems with patient pathways in the different centres.</p><p>We will undertake in-depth interviews with parents and their children and adolescents to understand their views and experiences of trial processes. This will include provision and acceptability of patient information and reasons for accepting or declining participation. We are particularly interested in understanding barriers to participation and with assent/consent will interview those who choose not to participate in the trial, who drop out of trial follow-up or who do not accept intervention allocation at randomisation. We will interview children and adolescents and their parents about their use of the accelerometer, whether it is an acceptable device to wear and whether there are particular issues we need to consider in this patient group for the full trial.</p></sec><sec id="s3g2"><title>Trial interventions</title><p>Intervention sessions will be routinely audio-recorded, with consent, to enable us to test that activity management and GET are truly distinct, and to ensure that the interventions are delivered in a consistent manner across centres. The delivery of up to 10 interventions, in both arms in each centre, will be observed. Sessions delivered early in the feasibility study will be observed initially, with further sessions being sampled depending on the analysis of these initial observations. Detailed notes will be taken, including the context, intensity and variability of intervention delivery, to understand how interventions are delivered and received in practice and to help interpret outcomes (eg, variation between subgroups).</p><p>We will interview parents and their children and adolescents about both interventions, including any prior exposure to the study interventions; beliefs, expectations and preferences about the interventions before assignment; their experiences and acceptability of the interventions; use of heart rate monitors (including whether they increase or decrease anxiety); and their views of the number of intervention sessions required. Participants will be recruited from all three centres to assess differences in implementation between settings.</p><p>We will interview clinicians delivering both interventions in each centre to ascertain their views on the feasibility of delivery (particularly focusing on younger children), changes that need to be made to the interventions offered, optimal frequency of appointments and technical problems with using heart rate monitors.</p><p>Interviews with clinicians, participants and families will be semistructured using a topic guide to ensure that they cover the same issues while allowing new issues of importance to emerge. Sampling for interviews will ensure that a range of informants (in terms of age, gender, ethnicity, geographical location, socioeconomic circumstances and disease severity) are included (maximum variation sampling), and that people with particular characteristics of interest can be targeted to follow-up and develop emerging findings (theoretical sampling). Sample size will be determined by data saturation, that is, when no new themes are being uncovered.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> It is anticipated that up to 20 patients, 15 parents and 10 clinicians involved in recruitment and/or delivering the interventions will be interviewed at a location of their choice. We estimate that up to 45 patient, parent and clinical staff interviews will be sufficient to determine whether it is feasible and acceptable to take the study to full trial, and to identify ways to improve study processes. All discussions will be audio-recorded with assent/consent using encrypted software, transcribed verbatim and anonymised.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3i"><title>Outcomes measures</title><sec id="s3i1"><title>Feasibility outcomes measurement</title><p>We will use quantitative and qualitative data to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a full-scale multicentre RCT.

The retention estimates will be presented for each intervention arm with 95% CIs. We will record the number of booked intervention sessions where participants did not attend or where there was a late cancellation (within 24&#x02005;hours). We will assume that those who did not attend (or cancelled within 24&#x02005;hours) three or more consecutive appointments or 50% of appointments did not find the interventions acceptable.</p><p>We will calculate the proportion of children and adolescents who wear the accelerometer and provide usable data.

Emerging findings will inform further sampling and data collection. A multiple analytical approach will be employed, with the use of NVivo to assist with data management and analysis. Interview transcripts and observation notes will be systematically assigned codes and analysed thematically using techniques of constant comparison to identify common themes (thematic analysis). Individuals exhibiting contrasting attitudes (negative cases) will be studied in detail. The perspectives of the individuals will be paramount, with careful account taken of the context within which the discussion takes place.</p><p>Content analytic methods will be used to describe in a structured manner what was said by whom and how often in the audio-recordings of recruitment and intervention sessions. Thematic analysis will also be applied to the data to identify common or divergent themes, as described above, particularly focusing on the impact of statements by the recruiter/clinician on patients and parents. Conversation analysis will be used to focus in great detail on certain sections of the audio-recordings, for example, in the specific interactions during which randomisation is offered.</p><p>Data analyses will be undertaken primarily by the qualitative researcher. To check coding reliability, other members of the team will independently analyse a proportion of transcripts and compare findings.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>GET, CBT and activity management are recommended as treatments in NICE guidance for CFS/ME;<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> however, there is no evidence that GET is effective or safe in children and adolescents.

A trial in children is therefore required.</p><p>At the moment, CBT has the best evidence for treatment efficacy. We have not included CBT as the control arm because clinicians would not be in equipoise in randomising children to CBT or GET. CBT will continue to be offered to young people who develop mood problems after randomisation and can be accessed in addition to either treatment arm. We will analyse referral to CBT as a secondary outcome.</p><p>As the participants will be aged 8&#x02013;17&#x02005;years, we have put in place rigorous procedures for gaining informed assent/consent from children and adolescents and their parents. Families will be given as long as they need before giving assent/consent within the confines of the study. We will then obtain further assent/consent prior to each interview and prior to recording interventions to check that children and adolescents and their parents continue to be willing to participate.</p><sec id="s5a1"><title>Data protection/confidentiality</title><p>Participants will be allocated a unique seven-digit research identification number prior to assessment for screening logs and questionnaires.
