Chronic social stress is one of the most important factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] responsible for worsening stress related symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and for triggering previously undetected mood disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In recent years, the effects of social stress on psychopathologies development have been thoroughly investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that life stress alters the dynamic regulation of the autonomic, neuroendocrine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and immune systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The Central Nervous System (CNS), as the main biological target of stressful events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], has continuously to change to accommodate to rapid environmental development. This imperceptible adaptation process is detrimental to health and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Allostasis represents the adaptation process of the complex physiological system to physical, psychosocial and environmental changes or social stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The term "allostatic load" was coined by McEwen and refers to physiological costs of chronic exposure to neural or neuroendocrine stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The allostatic state is unable to guarantee the good management of the physiological systems and consequently the health status and the individual's well-being, and this phenomena often leads to the development of psychological and psychiatric symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Among the several non-pharmacological strategies today available to reduce and/or to treat the symptomatic effects of the stress and to improve the allostatic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], of particular interest appears the use of electrical and electromagnetic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], also exploiting the "classical" acupuncture points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The REAC uses a new kind of non invasive and not painful electromagnetic stimulation that produces a weak radio frequency current (RFC) easily applied with a probe to specific somatic reflex points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><sec><title>Aim of the Study</title><p>The purpose of this study is to verify if the use of REAC could reduce the subjective perception of stress and stress-related symptoms, evaluated by PSM at T0 and T1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PSM also allows the precise classification of the subject studied on a stress well-being scale, to accurately assess the effectiveness of the treatment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, with the Societa di Ottimizzazione Neuro Psico Fisica e CRM Terapia institutional ethics committee approval, and all subjects provided written informed consent. A double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled trial was performed to investigate the effectiveness of REAC auricular treatment in reducing of self perception of stress and stress-related symptoms and, consequently, the PSM total score.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>The study has been carried out on 200 subjects (138 females, 62 males), that voluntarily came to our Institute suffering from a broad stress-related range of psychological symptoms such as affective-emotional reactions i.e. sadness, irritability, anger, depression, poor concentration and attention, insecurity, anxious and apprehensive condition, depression, sleep disorders, generalized muscle tension, gastro intestinal disorders, headaches. Participants were properly informed about significance and objectives of the study and then they completed, in association with the Project Director prior to enrolment, a written consent form. For all participants were properly collected and detailed: general demographic information, background characteristics, treatments history, drug history survey and medical examination.</p><p>The participants, selected after a clinical screening, have been allocated randomly into 2 socially and demographically matched groups with a computerized procedure: Group A, treated with "active" REAC (N = 150, 46 males, age = 49.8 &#x000b1; 13.7 yrs and 104 females, age = 48.3 &#x000b1; 12.5 yrs), and Group B, treated with deactivated-placebo REAC (N = 50, 16 males, age = 52.7 &#x000b1; 17.7 yrs, and 34 females, age = 50.6 &#x000b1; 15.1 yrs). The 3:1 proportion between cases and controls has been selected only on the base of the main "typology" of the people who require a clinical treatment in our Institute: "stressed" subjects are more numerous than "non-stressed" subjects.</p><p>REAC protocol consists in 18 session each one lasting 3,5 seconds, administered in about 4 weeks.</p><p>All subjects were over 18 years old, declaring to suffer from stress-correlated psycho-physical conditions, as demonstrated by a clinical evaluation and the PSM total score &#x0003e;45.

In 3 of the 4 rooms has been activate REAC and in the other 1 the placebo-REAC. The physicians that have participated in the treatment's administration turned in the different rooms, using both "active" and "inactive" REAC but they didn't know if they used an active or placebo REAC. The computerized randomization process, managed by an external operator to the study, foresaw the assignment of the subjects to each room. The target sample size 200, divided in the 4 rooms, has produced 4 subgroups, each composed by 50 people (n = 50 &#x000d7; 3 = 150 treated, n = 50 &#x000d7; 1 = 50 placebo).</p></sec><sec><title>Instruments and materials</title><sec><title>Psychological Test</title><p>PSM, a standardized and validated self-reporting test for the measurement of psychological stress was administered to all subjects, before (T0) and after REAC treatment (T1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. PSM consists of 49 items for the self-evaluation aimed at identifying different "clusters" of symptoms such as loss of control, irritability, psycho-physiological sensations, confusion, anxiety, depression, physical pain, hyperactivity and agitation. The patient must answer to the various items ranking the intensity of his psychological stress condition (very much = 4, much = 3, little = 2, none = 1). Although the clear risk of subjectivity of evaluation, this self-administered questionnaire was preferred with the aim to reduce the increasing of psychic and somatic anxiety levels and "arousal" inevitably due to a "direct" subject-physician interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of the Radio Electric Asymmetric Conveyer REAC</title><p>The REAC is an innovative medical device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] aimed to promote a reduction of the dysfunctional modifications in the Nervous System induced by stress and psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. REAC uses the radio electric effects produced by the interaction between the electromagnetic field of the human body (~30-300 GHz, of about 3 mW/m2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and the field produced by the instrument (2.4 or 5.8 or 10.5 GHz, measurable from the emitter about 0.1 mW/m2) which lasts approximately a few milliseconds. This radio electric interaction is received by a probe (conveyer) placed on specific points of the auricular pinna giving a radio electric stimulation. The inactive REAC is the exact same machine, but has a modified probe. The instrument that we used is registered under the trademark Convogliatore di Radianza Modulante - CRM produced by ASMED, Italy.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of auricular therapy protocol</title><p>The auricular treatment protocol has been conceived by the authors and called Neuro Psycho Physical Optimization (NPPO). The REAC probe was applied to 7 specific points of the auricular pinna: "shen men", kidney, stomach, heart, occiput, ipotalamus, prefrontal cortex. Eighteen sessions of NPPO with REAC were administered on alternate days, in about four weeks, to each patient. Each therapeutic session lasted approximately 3 seconds. The protocol is painless, non-invasive, and without known side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis were performed using Statistical Package for Social Science (version 13). The McNemar test is used to compare the relevant frequencies for data resulting from PSM test in patients belonging to group A and to group B before and after NPPO with REAC. Also Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test and Sign test are used to evaluate the related samples of Total points resulting from PSM test of both groups. All results of p &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In both groups the total stress evaluation has been measured by PSM administered before (T0) and after a cycle of NPPO.
