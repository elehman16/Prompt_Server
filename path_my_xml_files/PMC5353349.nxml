Chronic (&#x0003e;4&#x02005;weeks) cough in children following ARI is associated with decreased quality-of-life scores and increased health and societal economic costs. We will determine whether a validated evidence-based cough algorithm, initiated when chronic cough is first diagnosed after presentation with ARI, improves clinical outcomes in children compared with usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A multicentre, parallel group, open-label, randomised controlled trial, nested within a prospective cohort study in Southeast Queensland, Australia, is underway. 750 children aged &#x0003c;15&#x02005;years will be enrolled and followed weekly for 8&#x02005;weeks after presenting with an ARI with cough. 214 children from this cohort with persistent cough at day 28 will be randomised to either early initiation of a cough management algorithm or usual care (107 per group). Randomisation is stratified by reason for presentation, site and total cough duration at day 28 (&#x0003c;6 and &#x02265;6&#x02005;weeks). Demographic details, risk factors, clinical histories, examination findings, cost-of-illness data, an anterior nasal swab and parent and child exhaled carbon monoxide levels (when age appropriate) are collected at enrolment. Weekly contacts will collect cough status and cost-of-illness data. Additional nasal swabs are collected at days 28 and 56. The primary outcome is time-to-cough resolution. Secondary outcomes include direct and indirect costs of illness and the predictors of chronic cough postpresentation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Children's Health Queensland (HREC/15/QRCH/15) and the Queensland University of Technology University (1500000132) Research Ethics Committees have approved the study.

In the analyses of our recent cohort study of 817 children (96% non-Indigenous) aged &#x0003c;15&#x02005;years presenting with cough to a tertiary paediatric ED,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> 20% (95% CI 17.2 to 22.7) developed chronic (&#x0003e;4&#x02005;weeks duration) cough after an acute respiratory infection (ARI). Of those, 42% were diagnosed at specialist review with protracted bacterial bronchitis (PBB) and 32% were found to have a previously undiagnosed respiratory disorder, including asthma, large airway lesions (such as tracheomalacia), obstructive sleep apnoea and bronchiectasis (unpublished).</p><p>Chronic cough in children is an under-recognised, but important cause of morbidity and decreased quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Although an economic evaluation has never been undertaken, chronic cough likely accounts for substantial direct and indirect economic costs.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> An Australian study found that &#x0003e;80% of parents had sought five or more medical consultations for their child in the 12&#x02005;months immediately prior to referral to respiratory specialists for their child's chronic cough.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Nevertheless, there are few high-quality studies that address the natural history of acute and chronic cough and none completed that have a predominant focus on Australian Indigenous children. Systematic reviews of the natural history of acute cough in children in primary healthcare found wide variation in the design and quality of studies.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> There was large variability in the duration of illnesses evaluated, how outcomes were measured and completeness of follow-up. Importantly, in most studies addressing acute cough in children, validated outcome measures for cough were not used; those with prolonged cough were not reviewed and there was no differentiation between &#x02018;wet&#x02019; and &#x02018;dry&#x02019; types.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Wet cough is important as it implies increased airway secretions and usually indicates clinically significant lower airway infection and neutrophilic inflammation.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> For example, chronic wet cough is the most common symptom of bronchiectasis<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and early diagnosis and treatment improves long-term outcomes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Indigenous people are at high risk of developing chronic pulmonary disorders. Indeed, in nationwide data for Indigenous Australians, respiratory disorders are: (1) the most common reason for primary healthcare encounters; (2) the second most prevalent self-reported chronic condition and (3) the second most common cause for hospitalisation.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Overall, 27% of Indigenous people report some form of respiratory disease; 19% in those aged &#x0003c;14&#x02005;years and 38% in those aged &#x0003e;55&#x02005;years. In remote Indigenous children, the rates of hospitalisation for ARI and radiographically diagnosed pneumonia,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and the incidence of bronchiectasis,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> are among the highest reported worldwide. Recurrent ARI episodes are common<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and studies in Indigenous children from central and northern Australia demonstrated associations between these infections and subsequent diagnosis of bronchiectasis.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p><p>To date, the focus on ARI has been largely on remote Indigenous children, with limited community-based data from those living in urban settings. This is despite socioeconomic and health indices being consistently lower for urban Indigenous populations compared with non-Indigenous groups.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The lack of data on urban and rural Indigenous populations has been identified as a significant barrier to &#x02018;Closing the Gap&#x02019; initiatives.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Although over half of the Indigenous population live in urban and regional centres, most research addresses the health and social issues of remote communities and only 11% of all articles about Indigenous health during a 5-year period addressed urban populations.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, preliminary data from our ongoing cohort study of ARI in young urban Indigenous children<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> suggest 20% will develop chronic cough post-ARI, principally from PBB.</p><p>Early detection and appropriate management of the underlying aetiology (eg, bronchiectasis) causing chronic cough in children is important as it results in improved short<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and medium-term<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> outcomes. Despite the availability of evidence-based cough management guidelines for children in several countries,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> including Australia,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> the uptake and impact of the guidelines is largely unknown. So far, only one randomised controlled trial (RCT) has evaluated any of these guidelines<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and economic evaluation was absent. This was conducted in five Australian cities where 272 children (mean age 4.5&#x02005;years, SD 3.7) newly referred to a paediatric respiratory physician were randomly allocated to either early review and use of a cough algorithm or usual care until review and subsequent use of a predefined cough algorithm.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The study<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> found that children in the &#x02018;early-arm&#x02019; group had significantly better clinical outcomes (ie, cough resolution at week 6 postintervention; absolute risk reduction=24.7%, 95% CI 13% to 35%) and better cough-specific QoL compared with the control group. However, in this study,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the median duration of cough at enrolment was 16&#x02005;weeks (IQR 8&#x02013;32), and investigating earlier intervention is warranted. Furthermore, the use of the cough algorithm in 346 children found that &#x0223c;18% had a serious underlying illness. Indigenous children (10/34; 29.4%) were more likely to have bronchiectasis than non-Indigenous children (6.7%; 21/312; OR=5.78, 95% CI 2.15 to 14.5; p&#x0003c;0.001).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Despite the high burden of ARI, there are little published data on interventions for acute and chronic cough, especially for urban and regional Indigenous children. An ARI sometimes unmasks a previously unrecognised chronic respiratory illness, which is a major problem in Indigenous Australians, but one that receives limited attention.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> Early diagnosis and management of chronic respiratory illness in children reduces morbidity and improves QoL. This RCT will therefore answer the primary question: &#x02018;Amongst children aged &#x0003c;15&#x02005;years with chronic cough post-ARI, does active intervention at 4&#x02005;weeks improve clinical outcomes?&#x02019;</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Study objectives</title><p>Our primary objective is to determine if children aged &#x0003c;15&#x02005;years with chronic (&#x0003e;4&#x02005;weeks) cough post-ARI and managed according to an evidence-based cough algorithm have better clinical outcomes (faster cough resolution) than those receiving standard care.</p><p>Our secondary objectives are to:

A minimum of three contact attempts are made at each weekly time-point. We did not employ daily diary cards as planned originally, since although their use in chronic cough studies was reliable, we found that in children with acute cough diary completion and return rates were low during preliminary work undertaken for this study. We also could not use smartphone apps as the ownership of smart phones in the target communities is low. Thus, instead we relied on weekly parent recall of acute child illness, which has been shown to introduce minimal bias (&#x0003c;10%) in prevalence studies.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>At day 28, any child with persistent cough (ie, &#x02264;3 day break in cough in the preceding 28&#x02005;days) is randomised (1:1 allocation) to clinical review and initiation of the cough management algorithm or to continue weekly follow-up. All study participants continue weekly follow-up until day 56 and any child still coughing at that time point undergoes clinical review until a definitive diagnosis is established or the child exits the protocol. The decision to follow children until day 56 was based on data from our ED cough study, suggesting 42% of children with persistent cough at day 28 will be diagnosed with PBB (manuscript in preparation) that resolves with a 14-day course of amoxycillin&#x02013;clavulanic acid.

Group allocation is concealed in opaque, consecutively numbered envelopes kept in a locked cabinet at the Centre for Children's Health Research, South Brisbane. At randomisation, the child's cough history over the past 28&#x02005;days and study-specific strata are confirmed by the Central Coordinating Site. The Study Coordinator selects the next consecutively numbered, opaque, sealed envelope from the relevant strata pack, opens the envelope and extracts the randomisation code. Two people check the allocation and the code is assigned to the participant. The Study Coordinator then arranges for the study physician to review within 2&#x02005;weeks of randomisation those children allocated to the intervention arm. If siblings are also enrolled and each child is still coughing at day 28, randomisation occurs for the first child enrolled (ie, earliest study number) and all siblings are allocated subsequently to the same arm. Differences in strata (eg presentation type and cough duration) will be accounted for in the analysis.</p><p>Blinding is not undertaken in this study; however, parents are not informed at enrolment that their child will be randomised at day 28 to a specific intervention if the child has a persistent cough. Instead, they are informed that children who develop persistent cough will be reviewed by a paediatrician during the study with some children being seen earlier and some later in the 8-week follow-up period.

Based on data from the first study of the algorithm<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> for the primary end point of cough resolution at day 56, we anticipate a 54% reduction in the proportion of children (54.3% in the early arm compared with 29.5% in the delayed arm) with persistent cough at day 56. Hence, 89 children per group with complete evaluable data at day 56 will provide 90% power (&#x003b1;=0.05), to detect this 54% reduction for our primary aim. Assuming a 20% loss to follow-up and spontaneous resolution of cough of between randomisation and physician review of 5%, we will therefore randomise a minimum of 112 children per group at day 28 across all 3 sites.</p><p>Given that the entire cohort study will have a 2-year recruitment period, and the natural history and predictors of chronic cough and cost-effectiveness of the intervention are important secondary outcomes, we will not limit recruitment to the RCT arm once 224 children have been randomised.

Preventing persistent cough in children may lead to important short and long-term health benefits. Our proposed intervention<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> is similar to the existing Australian guidelines,<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> but also has some differences that were developed following the incorporation of new data unavailable at the time the guidelines were published. The use of guidelines by clinicians depends on several factors, which include level of evidence, feasibility, degree of implementation and inherent clinician factors.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> Using an algorithm facilitates clinical guideline implementation by clearly describing pathways of care based on whether the child presents with a specific or non-specific cough. While this study uses specific study physicians, the overall goal is widespread adoption of the guidelines and management algorithm in the primary healthcare setting. Our extensive data collection, including direct and indirect costs of illness and healthcare provision, are important in achieving this goal. The study will also provide an avenue for assessing the extent to which these guidelines are being used currently in different clinical settings given. We will collect data on any intervention a child may receive external to our study.</p><p>Study site selection was based on several factors, including existing relationships, feasibility and how they incorporated geographically and demographically different Indigenous communities. Studies evaluating ARI and chronic cough have had differing study designs, objectives and end points between populations. Australian data suggest cough burden is independent of age and aetiology, but dependent on clinical setting.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In Australia, there are clear risk and burden distinctions between children from urban and remote areas and between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children.<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> Indigenous children in urban areas have received much less attention than those in remote centres. Failure to account for these differences may lead to inappropriate interventions or implementation of management guidelines that may not be applicable across all settings.</p><p>The economic data and analyses in this study will be the first to describe the cost of ARI and its outcomes in Indigenous children in Australia, and one of the few worldwide. Further, the CEA of the intervention will provide data critical to clinical and public policy decisions with respect to incorporation of the intervention into routine care at the primary and tertiary healthcare levels. Such decisions will be enhanced by our incorporation of direct and indirect costs to the family, the community and the healthcare sector,<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> particularly given the focus on resource allocation in Indigenous health in Australia,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and the different mechanisms for delivery of primary healthcare services compared with mainstream Australia.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref></p><p>We have incorporated microbiological components into the RCT as the role of infectious agents in the transition from ARI to chronic wet cough remains largely unknown. Whether persistent shedding, new acquisition and/or virus&#x02013;bacteria interactions are associated with the development of chronic cough post-ARI is a clinical and research gap needing to be addressed. A study of 170 children aged 5&#x02013;16&#x02005;years presenting to their family physician with a cough lasting &#x0003e;14&#x02005;days detected <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>B. pertussis</italic> in 12.9% and 36.6%, respectively.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Cough duration was shorter in <italic>M. pneumoniae</italic> than <italic>B. pertussis</italic> cases and codetection with respiratory viruses was not associated with cough duration.<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> An important limitation of this study<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> was that data were not collected from the time of ARI onset. Other studies<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> have also tested for bacteria and viruses in nasopharyngeal specimens, but to date none have followed children from ARI onset and examined the association with developing chronic cough. In the analyses of microbiological data collected in our study of children attending an ED with cough, <italic>M. cattarhalis</italic> detected by PCR in anterior nasal swabs collected at time presentation was the only organism independently associated with persistent cough at 4&#x02005;weeks after controlling for age, gender and the presence of any viruses.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Our Brisbane-based lower airway studies of children with chronic cough from PBB found intense neutrophilic airway inflammation and evidence of innate immune activation, suggesting that PBB may follow a single ARI episode with impaired pathogen clearance from the airways, either permanently or temporarily leading to a cycle of chronic inflammation.<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> Small case series from the late 1990s have reported chronic pulmonary sequelae following influenza infection in young children<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> and a relationship between adenovirus infection and bronchiectasis.<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref></p><p>The major threats to the validity of our proposal are loss to follow-up and potential for contamination of the control group based on the type of standard care they may receive. In our current ARI study in urban Indigenous children, loss to follow-up at the 4-week time point post-ARI is 23%. Procedures to minimise this loss include: home visiting by Indigenous research personnel, regular text and email messaging, and personal letters to families. Analysis plans will include measures to account for missing data and sensitivity analyses to assess the extent of bias.</p><p>Although contamination of the control group is possible, based on a multicentre RCT conducted in five major Australian cities,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> it is unlikely that a child in standard care will receive treatment similar to the intervention arm. In another of our studies,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> just 27% of children sought further medical advice for cough in the 4&#x02005;weeks following presentation to an ED for an illness with cough as a symptom (unpublished data). Furthermore, of the 9.7% receiving antibiotics during this 4-week period,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> most were prescribed antibiotics at the time of the original ED presentation. Hence, it is unlikely this will influence the validity of our RCT for several reasons: (1) We can assess any intervention either group receives outside of the RCT since our weekly follow-up data collection captures these events. (2) In the possible, but unlikely event of a change in treatment in the control group, the effect size of the intervention will be smaller requiring a larger sample size. The a priori sample size is conservative with 90% power and a smaller effect size will still be detectable within the available study population (eg, a 35% difference with power of 80% requires 114 per group). (3) To ensure robustness, an independent person will recalculate the sample size when 50% of children have completed the RCT component.</p><p>In summary, our RCT will be the first to examine the impact of a cough management algorithm implemented at the transitional stage from acute to chronic cough in Indigenous children. Clinical effectiveness will be evaluated concurrently with detailed epidemiological, clinical, microbiological and economic determinants of ARI and cough persistence in this population. If successful, the study may provide the data necessary to facilitate the uptake and implementation of cough management guidelines in the primary healthcare setting, potentially reducing the long-term burden of disease on the child, family, community and healthcare sector.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank those who have facilitated the study; Robert Ware for generating the randomisation sequences; Daniel Arnold for database development and data management; the Boards and staff of Murri Medical and Carbal Health Services and the Respiratory infection Outreach and Research Team's Indigenous Research Reference Group for their cultural oversight and support of the study.
