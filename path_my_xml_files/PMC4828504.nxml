The most frequent symptoms during menopause are hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, depression, irritability and sleep disorders [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Women living in a rural area suffer from more severe menopausal symptoms, particularly musculoskeletal, vasomotor and sexual, compared to urban women [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The menopause transition was associated in a prospective study with decreased health functioning in women who report menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. About 80-96% of women experience mild to severe physical or physiological menopause-related complaints per year when approaching menopause, which is caused by a decline in level of oestrogen [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Menopause is also related to reduction of muscle strength, increased cardiovascular diseases, stroke and osteoporosis [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Several studies have shown that regular exercise significantly reduced menopausal symptoms and improved well-being [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Physically active menopausal-aged women experience fewer problems with insomnia, fewer vasomotor symptoms and better mood [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Resistance exercise may reduce the decline in muscle strength in middle-aged women [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A positive alteration of aerobic and resistance exercises to the blood lipid profile was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in postmenopausal women, which is widely cited [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Although menopause is a normal aging process, the hormonal changes in this period of life may lead to many physical, physiological and social changes deteriorating the quality of life (QoL). Health-related quality of life in middle-life women is usually lower than in middle-aged men, young adults and elderly women [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The overall well-being and study of quality of life in mid-aged women has become a major public health concern in the world [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Menopausal-aged women usually report a low physical activity level and a sedentary lifestyle which may deteriorate their health and the quality of life. There is evidence that regular physical activity may decrease menopausal symptoms and improve the physical self-worth and QoL in middle-life women. In other words, physical activity may have direct and indirect effects on the quality of life in menopausal-aged women [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The impact of a specific exercise on the QoL in middle-aged women has not been directly tested, particularly in women from rural areas, who may experience more severe menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In most studies PA level was evaluated by questionnaires or a different kind of training was implemented.</p><p>The purpose of our study was to investigate the influence of 12-week training on the QoL in menopausal-aged women living in a rural area.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="S0002"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited by means of advertisements in a local newspaper and posters.

According to the SF36 questionnaire the average quality of life is 50. The findings of our study showed that QoL of women in both groups was lower than average in three domains: General Health, Vitality and Role limits &#x02013; emotional.</p><p>The benefits of regular physical activity are routinely cited. Most studies have shown that higher PA level was associated with higher QoL scores, especially for physical aspects [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The results of many studies have indicated that habitual physical activity had a favourable influence on menopausal symptoms particularly in the social and psychological domains and thus the quality of life is improved [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Skrzypulec <italic>et al</italic>. examined 336 menopausal women in Poland and found that a moderate level of physical activity significantly reduces menopausal complaints, particularly vasomotor symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. An observational study indicated that physical activity was associated with better mental health, and less anxiety and stress during menopause [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The longitudinal Australian Study on Women's Health showed that increased PH level was associated with decreased menopausal somatic symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These studies showed the positive influence of physical activity on some menopausal symptoms, which may suggest that the quality of life was also better. However, Moilanen <italic>et al</italic>. reported in their study that change in global quality of life is more associated with physical activity level than menopausal symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The findings of the present study showed that rural women after 12-week training reported significantly better quality of life in two domains (vitality and mental health) and the mean scores indicated that the level of their QoL was above the average, which is 50.</p><p>Another aspect worth mentioning is that general mental health was better in both groups than general physical health in rural women. Different factors must have influenced the quality of mental health in rural areas. Thus, other factors need to be analyzed to find out the reason for the improvement in mental health in the control group. This was in concordance with the findings of Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. and Martin <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Sharma <italic>et al</italic>. in their study assessed the QoL in urban and rural women and found that in both groups mental health was better than physical health, but women in the rural area had worse QoL [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Martin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that moderate physical activity level mostly improved the mean score of most SF36 [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In our study the mean score of each domain of SF36 in rural women was much lower than in other studies [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. However, after 12-week training exercising women reported improvement not only in physical aspects but also in mental health. Significant differences were observed only in vitality and mental health domains. This indicates that mental health may be improved by many different factors, but physical activity is an important factor influencing both physical and mental health. Martin <italic>et al</italic>. also observed significantly improved mental and physical health as a quality of life domain in women after exercises [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In their study exercising women participated in 3 or 4 training sessions each week for 6 months with training intensity at the heart rate associated with 50% of each woman's peak VO<sub>2</sub>. Reed <italic>et al</italic>. found that inactive women aged 40-62 who attended 12 weeks of yoga classes improved their quality of life and experienced fewer hot flushes, better sleep quality and fewer depression symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed that it was very important to encourage women to increase their PA level to improve their quality of life. Elavsky <italic>et al</italic>. observed that physically active women in menopause had improved self-worth and quality of life [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Moilanen <italic>et al</italic>. found that women whose PA level was stable or decreased during menopause had worse QoL [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Kim <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed PA level and QoL in menopausal women and found that increased PA level was associated with fewer total psychosocial symptoms and physical symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Our study showed similar results. The average score of mental health in the exercising group increased by 0.98, social functioning increased by 2.3 and vitality was improved by 4.96. An increased endorphin level due to exercises positively influenced mental health, and the possibility to attend exercises in groups may have a positive impact on social functioning. Consistent with other studies on exercise in midlife women, we found that exercise improved the physical domain of the QoL as compared with usual activity [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, in our study in the control group the mean scores in four SF36 domains slightly increased and in four domains decreased.</p><p>The mean score of other SF36 domains decreased in the control group. Further analysis with other factors would explain QoL changes in group of women without exercises. However, Mishra <italic>et al</italic>. in their longitudinal study with 2-year follow-up found that QoL measured by SF36 declines, particularly general health and well-being [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Ueda assessed the impact of a 12-week educational and exercise programme on the QoL and menopausal symptoms in climacteric women [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The QoL of all participants was improved, although statistical significance was not reached.</p><p>The results of many studies have shown that women who gained weight during menopause were more likely to report deteriorated quality of life [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Dennerstein <italic>et al</italic>. reported that menopausal women whose body mass index (BMI) increased showed decreased self-reported health [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) the results showed that women with a higher body mass index during menopause reported more vasomotor symptoms and poorer quality of life [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. This is consistent with the present study. Although the BMI was not considered as a factor influencing the QoL in this study, regular 12-week physical activity might have reduced body mass and could not lead to weight gain in women.</p><p>The main strength of our study is the SF36 Health Survey Questionnaire, which has 36 items assessing 8 specific QoL domains. Moreover, the influence of physical activity on QoL was assessed after 12 weeks of exercises performed with the same trainer in the same place, so there was no difference in exercises. Every woman performed the exercises in a controlled environment.</p><p>This is one of the few studies to have investigated the association between specific exercises and the quality of life in menopausal women using a validated instrument, the SF36, and a specific 12-week exercise programme. Our study revealed that 12 weeks of exercises was a sufficient period to significantly improve the QoL in menopausal-aged women. There may be many factors influencing the improvement of the general physical and mental quality of life. Endorphin improves well-being and the QoL. After 12-week training women may experience a reduction in body mass, increase in muscle mass and other positive changes in body mass composition, which may be slower during further training. Further studies are required to find out whether 12-week training is sufficient for women to change their life style for a longer time, to assess whether women exercise continuously and to assess the QoL in a 1-2-year follow-up study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0009"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A 12-week period of exercise was significantly correlated with a positive change in vitality and mental health in rural women. Our study indicates that physical activity promotion should be implemented and sedentary women should consider modification of their lifestyle to include physical activity, as it leads to improvement of their quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0010"><title>Disclosure</title><p>This study was funded by MNiSW (grant number: KNW-1-045/N/4/0).</p><p>Authors report no conflict of
