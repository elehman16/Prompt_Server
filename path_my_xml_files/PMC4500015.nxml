pain and disability in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. [Subjects] Thirty patients
with lumbar spinal stenosis were divided into two groups: a conservative treatment group
(<italic>n</italic>=15) and a flexion-distraction manipulation group
(<italic>n</italic>=15). [Methods] The conservative treatment group received conservative
physical therapy, and the flexion-distraction group received both conservative physical
therapy and flexion-distraction manipulation therapy. Both groups received treatment 3
times a week for 6 weeks. The Visual Analog Scale was used to measure pain intensity, and
the Oswestry Disability Index was used to evaluate the level of disability caused by the
pain. [Results] The Visual Analog Scale scores for pain were significantly decreased in
both groups. In the between-group comparison, the decrease in pain was more significant in
the flexion-distraction group. According to the Oswestry Disability Index, the level of
disability was significantly decreased in both groups, but the decrease was more
significant in the flexion-distraction group. [Conclusion] Flexion-distraction
manipulation appears to be an effective intervention for pain and disability among
patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spinal stenosis</kwd><kwd>Flexion-distraction manipulation</kwd><kwd>Disability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lumbar pain is commonly caused by decreased muscle strength, lack of exercise, and
maintaining a poor posture for extended periods during activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These factors lead to an increased load on the back, which
aggravates lumbar pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbar spinal
stenosis is classified into congenital and acquired types<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of acquired lumbar spinal stenosis include degenerative,
and traumatic factors, and spondylolisthesis or spondylosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The spinal canal narrows due to spondylosis, disc bulging,
hypertrophy, or ossification of the ligamentum flavum<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> causing various complex neurological signs and symptoms of the
lumbar spine or lower limbs<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition,
acquired lumbar spinal stenosis causes stenosis of the nervous pathway, producing pain in
the hips, femoral region, and lower legs, in addition to tingling, paresthesia, and
decreased muscle strength. The typical clinical symptoms of lumbar spinal stenosis are
lumbar pain, intermittent claudication, and radicular pain. These symptoms are particularly
prevalent when extension of lumbar spine is induced through gait or during standing for a
prolonged period, and they disappear when the body is stabilized<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Existing treatment methods of lumbar spinal stenosis can be classified into conservative
and surgical types. Conservative treatment includes physical therapy, posture and pelvic
correction, exercise therapy, drug treatment, and manipulation therapy. Among manipulation
therapies, distraction manipulation therapy is used for various types of lumbar pain,
including simple distortion and contusion. Distraction manipulation therapy elevates the
intervertebral disc, prevents distortion of the tip of the annulus fibrosus, which is
sensitive to pain, and reduces internal pressure on the disc<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. This reverts the vertebral pulp bulge toward the center by
producing a centripetal force in the disc<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Amelioration of displacement of the facet joint maintains a normal
range of spinal movement and reduces pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The treatment includes exercises to improve function, and
posture<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the conservative treatment method. Johnsson et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> observed the natural history of lumbar
spinal stenosis in 32 patients for an average duration of 4&#x02005;years. They reported that the
symptoms remained unchanged in 70% of the patients, whereas they worsened in 15% and
improved in 15%. Whang and Do<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that conservative treatment improved pain in lumbar spinal stenosis patients. Many studies
have applied flexion-distraction manipulation therapy to treat patients with a lumbar
herniated intervertebral disc. However, few studies have applied it to lumbar spinal
stenosis. Therefore, this study applied flexion-distraction manipulation therapy to lumbar
spinal stenosis patients and examined the effect of the therapy on pain and disability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study included 30 patients (male: <italic>n</italic>=9, female: <italic>n</italic>=21)
who were diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis by an orthopedist at the S Orthopedic
Hospitals in Daegu, Korea. The subjects were between 40 and 70&#x02005;years old and had symptoms of
lumbar pain, radicular pain, and intermittent claudication. The patients were divided into a
conservative treatment group (CTG, <italic>n</italic>=16) and a flexion-distraction
manipulation group (FMG, <italic>n</italic>=15). The mean age of the patients in the CTG was
58.2&#x000b1;5.0&#x02005;years, the mean height was 162.8&#x000b1;8.5&#x02005;cm, and the mean weight was 64.0&#x000b1;12.5&#x02005;kg. In
the FMG group, the mean age was 58.9&#x000b1;5.6&#x02005;years, the mean height was 160.3&#x000b1;4.9&#x02005;cm, and the
mean weight was 63.6&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;kg. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the institutional
review board of Youngdong University. All the subjects read and signed consent forms in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki. The subjects did not
have any structural abnormalities such as tumors or fractures, history of previous surgery,
or other infectious diseases.</p><p>The FMG received conservative physical therapy (hot pack for 20&#x02005;min, interference current
therapy [ICT] for 15&#x02005;min, and ultrasound therapy for 5&#x02005;min) for 40&#x02005;min/session, followed by
flexion-distraction manipulation therapy on a Zenith-Cox Flexion distraction table
(Zenith-100, Williams Healthcare Systems, Elgin, IL, USA), with full-spine elevation. This
equipment stabilizes the upper limb and manually moves the distal radius. The patient was
placed in a prone position, with both ankles fixed to the table with cuffs. During the
therapy, the therapist&#x02019;s right hand was placed on the patient&#x02019;s L4 spinous process, and the
left hand was placed on the cuff. The therapist&#x02019;s left hand then moved to under the table,
and the pelvis was moved in the caudal-ventral direction and maintained in that position for
4 sec. The patients received flexion-distraction manipulation therapy 5 times and maintained
flexion-distraction manipulation for a total of 20 sec. The therapy was performed for 3 sets
of 5 repetitions. The CTG was treated with a hot pack (20&#x02005;min), ICT (15&#x02005;min), and ultrasound
(5&#x02005;min) for 40&#x02005;min/session.</p><p>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to measure pain intensity, and the Oswestry
Disability Index (ODI) was used to evaluate the level of disability caused by pain. Ten
questions were scaled from 0 to 5, depending on functional performance ability, with a high
score denoting severe disability. To calculate the percentage, the sum of each question was
divided by the total possible score of 45. To measure the pain intensity and the level of
disability caused by pain, this study used a paired sample t-test for within-group
comparisons and an independent sample t-test for intergroup comparisons. The SPSS 12.0
Windows program was used for statistical analysis, with a significance level of 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The VAS for pain decreased significantly in both the CTG and FMG. In the between-group

spinal stenosis. Among such therapies, flexion-distraction manipulation is aimed at reducing
stenosis of the ligament around the spine, decreasing intradiscal pressure, and expanding
the intervertebral foramen, thereby aiding the recovery of damaged spinal nerves and
functional recovery of the surrounding structures.</p><p>Schliesser et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> treated 39 patients
who were diagnosed with a cervical herniated intervertebral disc with flexion-distraction
manipulation therapy and reported that it significantly decreased pain. The application of
flexion-distraction manipulation therapy in chronic back pain patients for 4 weeks was
effective in relieving their pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cox
et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> applied distraction manipulation
therapy in patients with lumbar and lower limb pain and found that 73% of patients had good
to excellent results. In their study, 50% of the lumbar and lower limb pain was relieved in
50% of the patients after an average of 15.95 days and 10.8 treatment sessions. Cox<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the VAS scores of patients
with a lumbar herniated intervertebral disc and lumbar neuropathy improved after distraction
manipulation therapy. Han<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> applied
conservative therapy (oriental medicine) to lumbar spinal stenosis patients and stated that
the patients reported decreased pain. Kim et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> prescribed a 4-week home exercise program to 15 lumbar spinal
stenosis patients and reported a significant decrease in self-reported scores on a
questionnaire about pain intensity. According to Sasaki et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, in patients with lumbar stenosis, there is a correlation
between muscle strength during active straight leg raising and walking capacity, and this
correlation is not affected by age. Moreover, Sasaki et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis
face a higher risk of falling subsequent to the onset of neurogenic intermittent
claudication.</p><p>According to the results of this study, the VAS and ODI scores showed a greater decrease in
the FMG than in the CTG. This finding may be due to flexion-distraction manipulation therapy
ameliorating stress posteriorly with facet joint distraction. Flexion-distraction
manipulation therapy also overcomes the distortion of the facet joints associated with
lumbar stenosis, thereby enabling a normal range of posterior spinal movement. In addition,
it strengthens adhesive tissues around joints to stimulate mechanical receptors and
normalizes fixed joints and abnormal movements of the spine<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, distraction manipulation elevates the intervertebral disc
and improves the distortion of the tip of the annulus fibrosus, which is sensitive to pain,
resulting in increased movement of metabolites in the discs and decreased internal pressure
on the discs due to expansion of the spinal canal<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ko</surname><given-names>TS</given-names></name><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>HB</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effects of thoracic mobilization on pain, disability
