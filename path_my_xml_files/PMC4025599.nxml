Because of this, the incidence of dementia&#x02013;in particular, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD)&#x02013;is rising rapidly, so there is a pressing need to provide effective treatment options for individuals with AD. In &#x0003e; 80 countries worldwide, memantine has been used to treat patients with AD (predominantly moderate-to-severe AD) for over 10 years, and its efficacy and safety have been reported in clinical trials and meta-analyses <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">[1-3]</xref>. Memantine was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in Japan in 2011. It is currently the only NMDA receptor antagonist for the treatment of AD <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A late Phase II dose-finding study in Japan demonstrated dose-responsiveness at 24 weeks in the Japanese version of the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB-J) <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">[5,6]</xref>. A Phase III study, also conducted in Japan, showed a statistically significant change in SIB-J score compared with placebo. Regarding the variable the Clinician&#x02019;s Interview-Based Impression of Change plus-Japanese version (CIBIC plus-J) <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the memantine group showed a lesser degree of worsening at week 24 compared with those receiving placebo, although the difference was not statistically significant <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Studies in the US and Europe have shown memantine to be effective in language improvement based on the SIB-Language (SIB-L) scale <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref> and in behavioral improvement based on the 12-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, there are no data on language improvements in Japanese patients treated with memantine and, given the differences in lifestyle and AD prevalence between Japan and Western countries, it remains unknown whether the results of clinical studies conducted outside Japan can be extrapolated to Japanese patients with AD. Taking into consideration the heterogeneity of AD, analysis of a large population could reveal information about the clinical effects of memantine on language ability in Japanese patients. Thus far, no analysis has been performed with a large population of Japanese subjects to evaluate the effects of memantine on behavioral improvement.</p><p>The objective of our study, therefore, was to clarify the efficacy&#x02013;in terms of cognition, language, communication, and behavior&#x02013;and safety of memantine in AD patients. To achieve this objective, we performed a pooled analysis of two previously published, multicenter randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (Phase II and Phase III) <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">[5,8]</xref> conducted in Japanese outpatients. We assessed the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Rating Scale (BEHAVE-AD) <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, a subscale of CIBIC plus-J that was used in the Phase II and III studies, to analyze the effects of memantine on behavioral improvement. We also assessed the SIB-J to evaluate cognitive function <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, and the SIB-L to evaluate language <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The rationale for performing a pooled analysis was that it provided greater statistical power for detecting significant differences in these end points between memantine and placebo, providing confirmation of the results presented in the original reports.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss2"><label>2. </label><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The data for our pooled analysis were derived from a Phase II dose-finding study <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and a Phase III study <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> of memantine in Japanese outpatients with moderate-to-severe AD.

Both studies in our pooled analysis used a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group design. The studies included a 4-week baseline observation period, during which patients received placebo once daily after breakfast. The double-blind period was 24 weeks in both studies, during which patients received memantine hydrochloride or placebo once daily after breakfast. The initial dose of memantine was 5 mg/day for 1 week, and the dose was then increased by 5 mg per week. The maintenance dose was 10 mg/day or 20 mg/day for the Phase II study, and 20 mg/day for the Phase III study. A total of 747 patients participated in the Phase II and Phase III studies (315 patients and 432 patients, respectively). Patients treated with memantine 10 mg/day in the Phase II study were excluded from the pooled analysis. Therefore, 321 patients treated with memantine 20 mg/day and 319 patients administered placebo were included in this pooled analysis. Patients and their caregivers visited the outpatient clinic once every 4 weeks and were evaluated for efficacy at the start of the double-blind period and at weeks 4, 12 and 24. Safety assessments took place seven times in total (at the predosing visit and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24). Patients were followed up for 4 weeks after completion of the double-blind period or discontinuation of treatment to monitor adverse events (AEs). Concomitant use of any investigational drugs other than memantine, cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil hydrochloride), NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., ketamine), antiepileptic drugs, antiparkinsonian drugs, thiazide diuretics, or centrally acting muscle relaxants was prohibited. Concomitant use of hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, or antipsychotics was prohibited in principle, but the use of brotizolam, rilmazafone, or lormetazepam was permitted only when necessary. The use of tiapride was allowed only when necessary or in a constant dosage regimen and within the normal dosage range (&#x02264; 150 mg/day).</p><p>Regarding short-term in-hospital stays, patients were not allowed to receive short-term stays within 3 weeks of every efficacy evaluation (i.e., at the start of the double-blind period and weeks 4, 12 and 24) in the Phase II study. In the Phase III study, patients were not allowed to receive short-term stays at the start of the double-blind period and within the 3 weeks before the efficacy evaluation at week 24. The duration of short-term stays during the 4-week periods between the visits to the outpatient clinic for evaluation was not allowed to exceed six nights. When patients were already receiving rehabilitation such as long-term care services, this remained unchanged throughout the study period.</p></sec><sec id="ss4"><label>2.2 </label><title>Patient population</title><p>Patient eligibility criteria included the following:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Age &#x02265; 50 years</p></list-item><list-item><p>Outpatient</p></list-item><list-item><p>AD diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, or probable AD according to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>

In addition, we examined the SIB-L-J (a subscale of the SIB-J) in this analysis. The SIB-J is the Japanese version of the SIB <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">[18,19]</xref>. The SIB was developed for evaluation of patients with severe cognitive impairment. The SIB-J consists of 40 items and has scores ranging from 0 to 100 points. The SIB-L consists of 21 items related to the Broca&#x02019;s area in the frontal lobe of the brain (relating to naming, reading, writing and repetition) among a total of 51 SIB items and has a maximum score of 41 points. A lower score indicates greater severity in language impairment. Consistent with the high variance of SIB-L scores within the three MMSE severity groups, the Pearson correlation coefficients between SIB-L and MMSE scores were low for the group with MMSE scores &#x0003c; 5 and moderate for the groups with MMSE scores 6 &#x02013; 9 and 10 &#x02013; 14. Additionally, the Pearson correlation coefficient for SIB-L with SIB was high, indicating that the SIB-L scale maintains the sensitivity of the complete SIB scale. The correlation was weaker between the nonlanguage SIB items and SIB-L items, but there were moderate correlations between SIB-L and level of functioning, as measured by the FAST and the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Stratified analysis of SIB-J data was performed according to the nine subdomains of the SIB-J at week 24 in both studies.

The report also states that information on the functional status of the patient from each caregiver may be insufficient because the burden of long-term care is often shared among family members in Japan. Considering these points, for those patients in our study who used long-term care services, information from only one caregiver might have been insufficient to reflect actual changes in clinical symptoms for the evaluation of CIBIC plus-J.</p><p>Regarding the statistical analysis performed in this study, because this pooled analysis is regarded as exploratory in nature, no adjustments were made for multiple observations. Therefore, further studies are needed to confirm the findings.</p><p>Because the observation period in this study was 24 weeks, any longer-term effect is unknown. While the effect of memantine on MMSE scores in a long-term study (mean duration 798 days) in Japanese patients has been demonstrated <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the long-term effect on other functions in patients with AD needs to be clarified in further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="ss14"><label>5. </label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of our pooled analysis show that memantine is potentially effective and is well tolerated in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, consistent with findings of studies from other countries. In particular, the findings suggest that memantine may be beneficial in terms of cognition, including attention, praxis, visuospatial ability and language. Memantine also demonstrated a beneficial effect on behavioral and psychological symptoms, including activity disturbances and aggressiveness. These symptoms are known to be associated with rapid disease progression, increased caregiver burden, early institutionalization, and increased cost of care, so strategies to manage these symptoms, particularly in light of the growth in the aging population, are of great importance. These findings will be useful for physicians, patients, and their caregivers, adding to knowledge about the use of memantine in the Japanese setting. Because the mechanism of action of memantine differs from that of AChEIs, memantine is expected to be effective in nonresponders or poor responders to AChEIs. Thus, memantine may be used as initial monotherapy and in patients with inadequate or progressively deteriorating responses to AChEIs. Memantine may also be used in patients who experience AChEI-related AEs. Therefore, memantine hydrochloride is a new treatment option for AD and is expected to expand the therapeutic options for patients with AD. Further studies of a larger scale and with a clearly prespecified primary end point are required to confirm the present findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Helen Roberton for providing scientific writing services during the preparation of this manuscript.
