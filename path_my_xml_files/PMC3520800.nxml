</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>A model of chronic indwelling CVC in the low superior vena cava with thrombus <italic>in situ</italic> was established after feasibility and safety testing in 7 pigs; and subsequently applied for repeated, sonothrombolytic treatments in 9 pigs (total 24 treatments). Baseline intracardiac echocardiography (ICE, 10.5F, Siemens), fluoroscopy and saline flushing confirmed the absence of any pre-existing CVC thrombus. A thrombus was then allowed to form and age over 24 hours. The created thrombus was localized and measured by ICE, and transthoracic image guided high mechanical index (MI) two-dimensional US treatments (1.1&#x02013;1.7 MI; iE33, Philips) applied intermittently whenever intravenously infused MBs (3% MRX-801; NuVox) were visualized near the thrombus (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10; Group A). Control pigs (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10; Group B) received US without MB. All treatments were randomized. Post-treatment thrombus area by ICE planimetry was compared with pre-treatment measurements. Thrombus area measurements before and after treatment were 0.22 and 0.10 cm<sup>2</sup> respectively in Group A; compared to 0.24 and 0.21 cm<sup>2</sup> in Group B (p &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0003). Effectiveness of longer duration US and MB thrombolytic treatments were studied (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4), which suggested that near complete thrombus dissolution is possible. No pulmonary emboli, alterations in oxygen saturation, or hemodynamics occurred with either treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Guided high MI diagnostic US+systemic MB facilitates reduction of aged CVC associated thrombi <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Cavitation and resultant shear forces are proposed mechanisms for sonothrombolysis <xref rid="pone.0051453-Prokop1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.The mechanical effect of cavitation leads to axial fluid acceleration, resulting in acoustic streaming and the creation of high-velocity flow gradients that penetrate and destabilize the structure of the thrombus.

Since contrast MBs serve as nuclei for cavitation, the peak negative pressure threshold required to induce cavitation is lowered when they are present within the field of insonation <xref rid="pone.0051453-Prokop1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, thereby improving the thrombolytic ability of US.</p><p>We recently demonstrated that guided high MI impulses from diagnostic US and MB were successful at dissolving aged venous thrombi within pediatric sized catheters <italic>in vitro</italic>, due to shearing and dissolution of micro fragments from the outer surface of the thrombus <xref rid="pone.0051453-Kutty1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This was the first demonstration of the effectiveness of this technique in older venous thrombi that typically form in chronic indwelling central venous catheters (CVC), or in deep venous thromboses. Because CVC in the clinical setting are often not completely occluded, MB can be infused through the central lumen of these catheters. Therefore, unlike other clinical applications in which only small concentrations of systemically administered MB reach the thrombus because of low flow, MB can be directly infused into the thrombosed CVC enabling a relatively high local MB concentration in the majority of cases. Moreover, delivery of targeted transthoracic US to the region of interest is likely achievable in pediatric subjects due to the generally favorable windows and relative proximity of systemic vasculature to the chest wall. This can potentially contribute to improved outcomes with sonothrombolytic therapy for CVC occlusion.</p><p>Our principal hypothesis was that MB enhanced sonothrombolysis is an effective alternative method for treating aged CVC associated thrombi <italic>in vivo</italic>. We sought to investigate the (a) safety and feasibility (Arm 1) and (b) therapeutic effectiveness (Arm 2) of MB enhanced sonothrombolysis for treatment of aged CVC thrombi <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our secondary goal was to determine if inertial cavitation is a necessary component of thrombus dissolution by analyzing the radiofrequency signals returning from guided high MI impulses. A porcine model was chosen based on our previous work with this model, and demonstrated safety of intravenous MB and transcutaneous US in this model.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Microbubble and Ultrasound Technology</title><p>The lipid encapsulated MB formulation MRX-801 (NuvOx Pharma, Tucson, AZ) was used. These MB have a diameter of 1.0&#x000b1;0.1 &#x000b5;m, and concentration of 1.5 to 3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>10</sup>/ml. The MB infusion was prepared by diluting 2 ml of the MRX-801 in 100 ml of 0.9% saline and infused at a rate of 1.0 ml/min. The US system (iE33, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA) and diagnostic transducer (S5&#x02013;1, Philips) used are both commercially available. The US system had low MI contrast sensitive imaging pulse sequences (Power Modulation) that were applied in between high MI impulses to assist in the detection of MB. Thereby, the application of brief high MI impulses (1.1&#x02013;1.7 MI) was guided (5 seconds on, 2 seconds off) to allow replenishment of MB within the pre-specified region of interest. The US system was also equipped with a radiofrequency data acquisition board to serve as an array-based passive cavitation detector. Thereby, recording and analysis of the beam-summed radiofrequency data of signals backscattered by the contrast MB were obtained in studies during the MB infusion and high MI applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Establishment of <italic>in vivo</italic> CVC Model (Arms 1 and 2)</title><p>The study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and was in compliance with the standards in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The establishment of a chronic animal model of CVC in Arms 1 and 2 was accomplished as below. Each procedure was a survival study and necessitated sterile fields and techniques. The pig was fasted overnight and pre-anesthetized with an intramuscular mixture of Telazol (4.4 mg/kg), Ketamine (2.2 mg/kg), and xylazine (2.2 mg/kg). Intramuscular atropine (0.05 mg/kg) was used to dry oral-tracheal secretions and prevent bradycardia during intubation. Following placement of a venous line in the lateral or medial auricular vein, the pig was intubated and isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (induction at 4%, maintained at 1.0 to 1.8%) administered. The animal was placed on a ventilator at a volume of 11 cc/kg of air and at a rate of 15 breaths/minute.</p><p>Indwelling CVC placement was performed via surgical cut-down under full aseptic precautions (JMH). A 10F single lumen CVC (long-term carbothane hemodialysis catheter, 35 cm, Bard Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) was used. After the pig was placed under anesthesia and preparation of surgical site, an incision was made over the jugular furrow of the neck to be continued through the subcutaneous tissue and cutaneous coli muscle. The jugular vein was exposed with blunt dissection, and a short incision made in the skin of the dorsal interscapular region. A trocar was used to tunnel subcutaneously from the ventral incision to the dorsal region of the chest wall and the CVC advanced through the subcutaneous tunnel for placement via surgical cut down in the superior vena cava under fluoroscopic guidance (Cardiovascular mobile digital C-arm system, GE, Milwaukee, WI). The jugular vein was canulated using the modified Seldinger technique, and the CVC positioned with its tip in the low superior vena cava (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051453-g001">

ICE and fluoroscopy were used to image the distal segment and tip of the CVC to confirm the absence of thrombus within the distal segment of the CVC or adherent to the tip, prior to the thrombus induction protocol. After confirmation of no preexisting CVC associated thrombus, the heparin lock solution was withdrawn, and 0.5&#x02013; 0.7 ml of blood was drawn into the CVC. The animal was allowed to recover, and an aged venous thrombus allowed to form in the distal tip of the CVC over the next 24 hours. Animals then proceeded to either safety testing (Arm 1) or randomized treatments (Arm 2).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety and Feasibility Assessments (Arm 1)</title><p>For assessment of safety in the animals that received US-MB treatments, venous blood was drawn (60 ml) for labeling of platelets with In-111 at the time of blood withdrawal for thrombus creation. Approximately 3 hours later, In-111 labeled platelets (200&#x02013;600 uCi in 5 ml) were administered intravenously to the animal. In-111 labeled platelet scintigraphy of lungs was performed at baseline to examine for pulmonary emboli utilizing a medium energy collimator [Infinia Hawkeye 4 Single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) scanner, GE, Milwaukee, WI]. The scan settings were: matrix 128&#x000d7;128, energy peaks at 245 and 171,window 20%, projections anterior-posterior, duration 30 minutes and zoom factor of two. MB enhanced sonothrombolytic treatment was followed by repeat scintigraphy of the lungs using the same imaging parameters as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051453-g001">

The activities expressed as counts per pixel in the lung fields were compared before and after each treatment to assess for pulmonary emboli. Safety was also evaluated by continuously monitoring oxygen saturation, arterial blood pressure, and 3-lead electrocardiograms before, during, and for 30 minutes after US and MB therapy.

The presence of an indwelling CVC is the single most important risk factor for childhood venous thrombo-embolism <xref rid="pone.0051453-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051453-Journeycake1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, a growing health problem associated with significant acute mortality and chronic morbidity <xref rid="pone.0051453-Chan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. The incidence of symptomatic CVC-related thrombosis has been reported to vary between 1.2 and 13.0%. Effective treatment to eliminate the thrombus has benefits beyond simple salvage of CVC functionality because it may prevent complications such as pulmonary emboli and infections. Since CVC-related thrombosis and infections are interrelated, interventions designed to reduce thrombus burden have the potential to also reduce CVC-related infections <xref rid="pone.0051453-Boersma1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Optimal therapy for CVC-associated thrombus or venous thromboembolism remains poorly defined. Current management options in children are limited and imperfect: either remove the CVC or leave the CVC in place and use thrombolytic agents. Removal of the CVC carries special challenges in children because of the limited alternative placement sites in patients who commonly require long-term uninterrupted access. Moreover, insertion of a new CVC may further increase thrombo-embolic risk. <xref rid="pone.0051453-Shivakumar1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> Use of thrombolytic drugs in children, however, can be associated with risks of major hemorrhage, reportedly as high as 40% <xref rid="pone.0051453-Raffini1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The safety and efficacy of thrombolytic agents has not been established in children <xref rid="pone.0051453-Parasuraman1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Recent guidelines therefore discourage the routine use of thrombolytics for treatment of neonatal and pediatric venous thromboembolism, except when major vessel occlusion is causing critical compromise of limbs or organs <xref rid="pone.0051453-Monagle2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The poor risk-benefit profile of the two currently available management strategies testifies to the need for development of a different treatment for CVC related thrombosis in children.</p><p>Sonothrombolysis comprises the use of MBs coupled with US to dissolve thrombi without thrombolytic agents, or enhance the effectiveness of exogenous tissue plasminogen activator and the rate of thrombolysis. Diagnostic US and MB treatment regimens have been utilized in animal models to restore myocardial microvascular flow and function in acute myocardial infarction <xref rid="pone.0051453-Porter1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, and to recanalize cerebral vessels following ischemic stroke <xref rid="pone.0051453-Meairs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Recently we created <italic>in vitro</italic> models of aged venous thrombi and demonstrated that successful dissolution is achievable with guided high MI impulses delivered from a diagnostic US transducer, while simultaneously utilizing low MI MB sensitive imaging pulse sequence schemes to detect the MB with the same transducer <xref rid="pone.0051453-Kutty1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we describe the application of transcutaneous diagnostic US and intravenous MB treatments to facilitate reduction and resolution of aged CVC-associated thrombi <italic>in vivo</italic>. An image-guided approach was utilized by ensuring the presence of MB around the CVC tip thrombus when the high MI impulses were applied. This therapeutic US and MB application may be particularly advantageous in children because of the proximity of vascular structures to the chest wall with less intervening tissue to limit attenuation of transcutaneously applied US impulses. Because of decreased US attenuation, there is less likelihood of reduction in the peak negative pressure in the region of interest. The superior and inferior vena cavae and the innominate vein are common CVC locations and can be suitably imaged in children from standard suprasternal and subxiphoid pediatric US windows <xref rid="pone.0051453-Lai1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051453-Kluckow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

</xref>) Thus simultaneous imaging can be performed with the diagnostic transducer, where sensitive low-MI pulse sequence schemes detect the presence of MB around the thrombus and guide the timing of high-MI impulses. The safety and success of these non-invasive therapeutic applications from our porcine model of indwelling CVC increase the potential for translation to the human, and could be a significant new treatment modality. The potential therapeutic implications could extend far beyond the realm of cardiovascular disease, for example into hemato-oncologic disease and renal disease where the use of indwelling catheters are very common.</p><p>Importantly, thrombus dissolution in this study was achieved without exogenous fibrinolytic therapy, and without evidence of pulmonary emboli. In the clinical setting, significant thrombus reduction would allow for continued CVC patency and use, while facilitating ongoing thrombolytic treatment. Results from our 90-minute applications suggest that longer treatments would promote further lysis, and could achieve the goal of complete thrombus dissolution. Further studies, possibly incorporating techniques such as ligand attachment to MB (e.g. targeting to fibrin or platelets) that increase their affinity to the surface of thrombi and enhance cavitation effects, may have the potential for improved thrombus reduction during treatment. Further work is also needed to assess the success of this therapy for older CVC thrombi (aged several weeks) and to assess the concomitant effect of low dose tissue plasminogen activator with therapeutic US and MB applications.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Parameters of optimal US application for MB enhanced sonothrombolysis, i.e. with maximum therapeutic efficacy and no adverse bioeffects, are unknown. Although there is potential for unwanted mechanical bioeffects at MI&#x0003e;1.0, the effects are likely to be minimal because the US application used in the study was with a commercially available diagnostic transducer, and the high-MI therapeutic pulses were significantly lower than the Food and Drug Administration recommended MI limit (1.9) for clinical use. However, we do recognize that bioeffects can still occur with a transthoracic MI&#x0003e;1.0. The mechanistic data suggested that inertial cavitation was dominant during the high-MI US application for sonthrombolysis of the 24-hour old CVC thrombi. However, the extent of treatment success with stable cavitation, and relative contribution of stable and inertial cavitation for achieving successful MB enhanced sonothrombolysis, was not quantified. A potential disadvantage to the application of sonothrombolysis in the clinical setting is the variable age of CVC thrombi. The histology samples we obtained demonstrated organized thrombi, but with further aging there may be more fibrin cross-linking and clot retraction that may render the thrombus resistant to cavitation dissolution. Finally, although we were able to substantially reduce the thrombus burden at the CVC tip, there was still significant residual thrombus noted in some of the pigs. This may indicate the need for more prolonged applications of US and MB in these settings, which was not tested in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Guided transcutaneous high MI diagnostic US during a systemic MB infusion facilitates reduction and resolution of aged CVC associated thrombi <italic>in vivo</italic>. This technique may be a non-invasive safe alternative to thrombolytic agents in treating thrombotic CVC occlusions. Inertial cavitation was dominant during this therapeutic US application. Although ultrasound contrast agents have not been approved for pediatric use, recent clinical trials have indicated they are safe and effective for improving left and right ventricular opacification and endocardial border delineation <xref rid="pone.0051453-Kutty2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The particular contrast agent used for this study was similar to the commercially available agent Definity (Lantheus Medical). Therefore, the success with this non-invasive targeted MB and US therapy in this large animal model indicates it could be safely examined for the management of CVC associated thrombi in patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0051453-Xie1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
