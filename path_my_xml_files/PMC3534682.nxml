Recent exciting clinical trial results in advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER) breast cancer support mTOR activation is a major means of estrogen-independent tumor growth. Hence the means to identify a responsive breast cancer population that would most benefit from these compounds in the adjuvant or earlier stage setting is of high interest. Here we study <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype as well as a previously reported PI3K/mTOR-pathway gene signature (<italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS) and their ability to estimate the level of PI3K pathway activation in two clinical trials of newly diagnosed ER-positive breast cancer patients- a total of 81 patients- one of which was randomized between letrozole and placebo vs letrozole and everolimus. The main objectives were to correlate the baseline <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype and GS with the relative change from baseline to day 15 in Ki67 (which has been shown to be prognostic in breast cancer) and phosphorylated S6 (S240) immunohistochemistry (a substrate of mTOR). In the randomized dataset, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS could identify those patients with the largest relative decreases in Ki67 to letrozole/everolimus (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.43, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008) compared with letrozole/placebo (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.07, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.58; interaction test p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). In a second dataset of pre-surgical everolimus alone, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS was not significantly correlated with relative change in Ki67 (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.11, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.37) but with relative change in phosphorlyated S6 (S240) (R&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.46, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.028). <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype was not significantly associated with any endpoint in either datasets. Our results suggest that the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS has potential to identify those ER-positive BCs who may benefit from the addition of everolimus to letrozole. Further evaluation of the PIK3CA-GS as a predictive biomarker is warranted as it may facilitate better selection of responsive patient populations for mTOR inhibition in combination with letrozole.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>SL and CS are supported by the JC Fonds Heuson, Belgium and the Estee Lauder Breast Cancer Research Foundation, NY.

The presence of genetic aberrations such as <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutations, PTEN loss and HER2 amplification are frequent in breast cancer and whilst data suggest they could predict for greater sensitivity to PI3K pathway inhibition, not all sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors can be explained by these markers <xref rid="pone.0053292-Brachmann1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-DiNicolantonio1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. PI3K pathway activation has also been implicated in resistance to endocrine therapy in patients with estrogen receptor (ER) -positive breast cancers <xref rid="pone.0053292-Boulay1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Recent results from the BOLERO-2 trial highlight that targeting mTOR is a viable strategy in patients with metastatic ER-positive disease who have progressed on previous endocrine therapy with a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor. The toxicity from the combination was not insignificant <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Hence, means to identify which ER-positive breast cancer patients may require PI3K/mTOR inhibition in addition to their endocrine therapy could facilitate better selection of patient populations for treatment, particularly in the adjuvant setting.</p><p>We have previously reported a gene signature (<italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS) derived from patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer with <italic>PIK3CA</italic> kinase domain mutations which was able to predict <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status (genotype) in independent datasets and was also associated with better outcomes in tamoxifen-treated ER-positive breast cancers <xref rid="pone.0053292-Loi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Several other investigators have also reported that the <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutated compared with wild-type genotype is associated with a better prognosis, though a robust prognostic study is yet to be performed in large clinical breast cancer cohorts <xref rid="pone.0053292-Loi1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Ellis1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Kalinsky1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Cizkova1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Whilst the mechanism for this is unclear, at the gene expression level we observed unexpectedly low levels of PI3K/mTOR pathway activation and increased levels of estrogen signaling in <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutant breast cancers. Hence, high levels of the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer were associated with PIK3CA mutant (genotyped) breast cancers but paradoxically low mTORC1 pathway output. This led us to ask the question if the signature could provide an indication of pathway activation in ER-positive breast cancer patients, how this would compare to mutation status <italic>per se</italic> and importantly, if it could identify patients who may benefit from addition of a PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitor as well as their hormonal therapy.</p><p>In this study we evaluated the ability of both <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype and the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS to quantify the level of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation in a given tumor and its associations with anti-proliferative responses in ER-positive breast cancer treated with everolimus. The main endpoint of interest in this correlative analysis was centrally reviewed Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC) after two weeks of therapy. Both the change in percentage positively staining Ki67 measured from baseline to day 15 whilst on therapy, hereby referred to as &#x0201c;relative %Ki67 decrease&#x0201d; and the number of patients achieving a &#x0201c;complete cell cycle response&#x0201d; (a day 15 absolute Ki67 value of less than one after log transformation) were evaluated. Both of these endpoints have been shown to be correlated with long term outcomes in ER-positive breast cancer- ie have potential as early biomarkers of efficacy prediction of new drugs and have been used in clinical trials in this disease for this purpose <xref rid="pone.0053292-Dowsett1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Dowsett2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Ellis2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Importantly, one of the data sets examined in this study contained samples from a randomized clinical trial. This allowed us the opportunity to determine whether a predictive association existed between the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS and the letrozole/everolimus combination compared with the letrozole alone. A biomarker that can identify individuals with a high chance of benefit from a drug may ultimately have more utility in the clinic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patient Populations</title><p>Two independent datasets (A and B) were used for these analyses and the patient populations have been previously described <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Macaskill1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Sabine1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole (2.5 mg/daily) plus placebo or letrozole plus the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus (10 mg/daily), provided by Novartis Pharma AG (Basel, Switzerland), for 4 months prior to primary surgery. Of the original trial cohort, only 58 (21.5%) patients had pre-treatment (or baseline) samples profiled using Affymetrix U133A GeneChips&#x02122; and standard protocols. One patient was found to be ER-negative and removed from further analysis. No major differences between this subset and the global trial population in terms of clinical characteristics were observed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0053292-t001">Table 1</xref>).

In contrast, the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS (and not genotype) was associated with Ki67 responses but not changes in pS6 in dataset A. Dataset A involved a randomization between endocrine therapy with and without everolimus. In dataset A, changes in Ki67 reflected the primary endpoint results (objective decrease in tumor size), whereas changes in phosphorylated S6 were not correlated with clinical outcomes and seemed to indicate a purely pharmacodynamic effect <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Several hypotheses are possible for why changes in Ki67 and pS6 had different implications in these two datasets: (i) the PIK3CA-GS is not specific to everolimus alone, but could incorporate a measurement of estrogen signaling given that the PIK3CA-GS was developed from ER-positive, <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutant BC samples&#x02013; many ER-related genes are present in the gene signature and this could explain why the signature could be conceivably also affected by endocrine therapy and have correlations with anti-proliferative Ki67 reductions in this context (ii) the small sample size in dataset B limited our power to see subtle Ki67 effects with the single agent everolimus, (iii) the combination of letrozole/everolimus altered the effects on pS6 reductions compared with everolimus alone, (iv) different patient populations between datasets (v) the lower dose of everolimus and finally (vi) technical issues could all be contributing factors to these observations <xref rid="pone.0053292-Pinhel1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Whilst further study is required to clarify the relationship between the signature, different biomarkers and single vs combination therapy, for this study, dataset A probably provides the most persuasive data due to the randomization and some clinical outcome information being available.</p><p>Importantly, whilst we cannot exclude the possibility that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status alone could yield the same prognostic or predictive information as the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS in larger clinical trial data sets that would have more statistical power, notably there was no interaction seen previously in the whole trial cohort of dataset A involving nearly 300 women <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Larger studies will also be able to analyze the effects of <italic>PIK3CA</italic> mutation status and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS on more robust clinical endpoints such as survival other than Ki67 changes. It is also possible that <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype may be more predictive of sensitivity to specific PI3K or AKT inhibitors rather than mTOR. Regardless, future phase II/III trials should consider upfront stratification by <italic>PIK3CA</italic> genotype in order to accurately determine efficacy in this population, especially given its high frequency. Perhaps the combination of mutation status (genotype) and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS (phenotype) could allow optimal therapy individualization for this particular aberration. Moreover, PIK3CA genotype may have different implications in early vs. metastatic settings,</p><p>HER2 negative vs. overpressing breast cancer subtypes &#x02013; the latter could imply further dependency on p110&#x003b1; or higher &#x0201c;oncogene addiction&#x0201d; to PI3K signaling.</p><p>We acknowledge that none of these analyses were prospectively pre-planned in the study protocols and the cohort sizes were small so the conclusions are hypothesis generating. Nevertheless, the strengths of our analysis derive from the fact that the validation was performed using data from prospectively designed clinical trials - one of which was randomized. Importantly, both trials used the same centrally reviewed Ki67 endpoint. Notably, these results highlight the importance of prospective tumor banking, the use of standard endpoints in clinical trials and collaboration between academia and pharma in order to facilitate biomarker validation. Without concerted efforts in this regard, the hope for individualized cancer treatment will remain elusive. As seen, we could only evaluate the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS in two small cohorts, as correlative tumor collection is not standard in many clinical studies. Yet, this is the first time a PI3K pathway-related microarray-derived gene signature has been validated in an independent randomized, prospective clinical trial dataset for its potential as a predictive biomarker to PI3K-pathway targeted agents.</p><p>In conclusion, whilst it is clear that many ER-positive BC patients do well with endocrine therapy alone <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Chow1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, recent clinical trial data presented in the ER-positive metastatic BC setting provide substantial support for mTOR pathway activation as a major means of estrogen independent tumor growth in this population <xref rid="pone.0053292-Baselga1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0053292-Bachelot1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Hence, the ability to identify which ER-positive patients could benefit most from the combination in newly diagnosed tumors is now crucial to understanding who needs this combination in the adjuvant setting. Our study supports further investigation of the <italic>PIK3CA</italic>-GS in appropriate randomized datasets as a biomarker that could identify women who may derive benefit from the addition of everolimus to letrozole in ER-positive disease.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Access to Gene Expression Data</title><p>De-identified gene expression data for dataset A is available on request to David Chen, Novartis <email>David.chen@novartis.com</email>.
