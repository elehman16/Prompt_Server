If adequate glycemic control cannot be obtained by controlling fasting blood glucose alone, it becomes necessary to also control prandial glucose levels. Among the options is to add a short- or rapid-acting insulin. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), recommended therapy for T2DM consists of matching the prandial insulin dose to premeal blood glucose, carbohydrate intake, and anticipated activity.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> For many patients (especially if hypoglycemia is a problem), use of insulin analogs is recommended.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The use of rapid-acting insulin analogs, such as insulin lispro, insulin aspart, or insulin glulisine, also facilitates flexible dosing in these insulin treatment regimens.</p><p>Insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. This modification does not alter insulin receptor binding, but blocks the formation of dimers and hexamers. As a consequence, higher amounts of subcutaneous monomers are available for rapid absorption. This enables a shorter waiting period after injection before starting the meal. Insulin lispro is the active ingredient of Humalog<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (Ly-Lis; Lilly).<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Humalog was the first rapid-acting insulin approved and marketed in the EU, the US, and many other countries worldwide, and is used in the treatment of both patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and T2DM.</p><p>SAR342434 (SAR-Lis; insulin lispro; Sanofi) has been developed as a biosimilar (follow-on) biological medicinal product to Humalog U100 in accordance with the relevant US and EU guidelines, including the EU guidelines for similar medicinal products containing recombinant human insulin and insulin analogs, as well as product-specific guidelines.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;8</xref></sup> SAR-Lis was shown to be highly similar to Ly-Lis through physicochemical analyses and in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. Similar pharmacokinetic (PK) exposure and pharmacodynamic (PD) activity were demonstrated for SAR-Lis to both Ly-Lis approved in the EU and Ly-Lis approved in the US, as well as between Ly-Lis US and Ly-Lis EU in a PK/PD study in patients with T1DM using the euglycemic clamp technique.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This report presents the results of a multinational, open-label, randomized, controlled Phase 3 study (SORELLA 2) comparing the efficacy and safety of SAR-Lis and the reference product Ly-Lis (100&#x02009;U/mL) in patients with T2DM, also using insulin glargine (GLA-100).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by relevant review boards/ethics committees, and was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines.

Noninsulin antihyperglycemic background therapy taken at a stable dose for at least 3 months before the screening visit was permitted. Excluded were patients with body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;40&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, the use of noninsulin injectable peptides (e.g., GLP1-receptor agonists or other peptides), use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, history of severe hypoglycemia requiring treatment by emergency room admission, or poor metabolic control requiring hospitalization, all within the last 6 months before screening.

The study consisted of a screening period (up to 2 weeks), a 26-week treatment period, and a 1-day safety follow-up (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>; Supplementary Data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/dia.2017.0281">http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/suppl/10.1089/dia.2017.0281</uri>). Clinical visits were scheduled for screening, randomization (day 1), weeks 4, 8, 12, 20, and 26 (endpoint). After the screening period, 480 patients were planned to be randomized 1:1 to receive either SAR-Lis or Ly-Lis in addition to the once-daily Gla-100. The randomization was stratified by HbA<sub>1c</sub> obtained at the screening visit (&#x0003c;8.0%, &#x02265;8.0%) and prior use of insulin lispro (Yes, No). The randomization and the treatment kit allocation were performed centrally by an interactive voice response system/interactive web response system. The comparator drug in the study was Ly-Lis. Patients randomized to Ly-Lis received US- or EU-approved Ly-Lis, depending on the location of their study site. Based on the similarity between Ly-Lis US and Ly-Lis EU shown in physicochemical analyses, nonclinical studies, and the PK/PD study,<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> data from both insulins were pooled in the comparator group of this study.</p><p>Study medications were dispensed on day 1, and weeks 4, 8, 12, and 20. Self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) and insulin dose data were obtained from the patient's diary at each visit when compliance was checked by reviewing the patient's diary and counting/collecting used and unused pens. Starting dose of SAR-Lis or Ly-Lis was a unit-to-unit conversion from the Humalog/Liprolog or Novolog/NovoRapid dose used before the trial. SAR-Lis or Ly-Lis was administered subcutaneously (SC), immediately before meal intake using insulin pens. Occasional postprandial injections soon after meal intake were permitted if deemed necessary and if allowed by the national product label for Ly-Lis. Mealtime insulin dose could be adjusted to achieve a target range for 2-h postprandial plasma glucose (PG) of 120&#x02013;160&#x02009;mg/dL (6.7&#x02013;8.9&#x02009;mmol/L). The starting dose of GLA-100 was the same as the prestudy dose. GLA-100 was injected SC once daily at the same time throughout the study, and dose adjustments were made to achieve a fasting, prebreakfast PG of 80&#x02013;130&#x02009;mg/dL (4.4&#x02013;7.2&#x02009;mmol/L). No formal titration algorithm was recommended for basal insulin; patients were instructed to use dosage self-adjustment of rapid-acting insulin analogs according to local guidelines to achieve target glucose, while avoiding hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="s005"><title>Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity assessments</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were determined in a central laboratory blinded for treatment (Covance, Indianapolis, IN) at screening (HbA<sub>1c</sub> only), baseline, week 12, and week 26.

SMPG results, hypoglycemic events, and insulin doses were recorded by the patients in a paper diary and manually entered in the e-CRF by the investigator. Adverse events (AEs), including hypersensitivity events and injection site reactions, were documented at each visit. Further safety monitoring included hematology and clinical chemistry, as well as body weight.</p><p>Blood samples for anti-insulin antibodies (AIA) determination were to be drawn at least 8&#x02009;h after the last administration of mealtime insulin on day 1, at weeks 4 and 12, and at the end of treatment at week 26. AIA were determined employing a validated radio immunoprecipitation assay in a central laboratory blinded for treatment.

Secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis in terms of positive/negative status and antibody titers at baseline and during the course of the study; to assess the relationship of AIA with efficacy and safety; to assess the efficacy of SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis in terms of patients reaching target HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% and &#x02264;6.5%, FPG, SMPG profiles, and insulin dose; and to assess the safety of SAR-Lis and Ly-Lis.</p></sec><sec id="s007"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>Efficacy endpoints included change from baseline to week 26 in HbA<sub>1c</sub> (primary endpoint), FPG, 24-h PG concentration from seven-point SMPG profiles and postprandial PG excursions (difference between 2-h postprandial and preprandial PG values from seven-point SMPG profiles), as well as the proportion of patients reaching target HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.0% and &#x02264;6.5% at week 26. Safety endpoints included the percentage of patients reporting at least one hypoglycemic event, hypoglycemic event rates, the occurrence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), including hypersensitivity and injection site reactions, and change in body weight and clinical laboratory and hematology parameters. Hypersensitivity events and injection site reactions were identified using specific MedDRA codes. TEAEs were defined as events that occurred, worsened, or became serious from first investigational medicinal product (IMP) intake up to 1 day after last IMP intake.</p><p>Hypoglycemia was categorized based on the ADA definitions.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia was an event during which typical symptoms of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a measured PG concentration &#x02264;3.9&#x02009;mmol/L (&#x02264;70&#x02009;mg/dL); those with PG &#x0003c;3.0&#x02009;mmol/L (&#x0003c;54&#x02009;mg/dL) were also analyzed. Nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as any hypoglycemia that occurred between 00:00 and 05:59 a.m. hours. Severe hypoglycemia was an event that required assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other resuscitative actions. Severe hypoglycemia associated with seizure, unconsciousness, or coma was also to be reported as a serious AE.</p><p>Immunogenicity was assessed by incidence (patients with newly positive postbaseline [treatment induced] or with &#x02265;4-fold increase in titer [treatment boosted], i.e., patients with treatment-emergent AIA) and prevalence (patients with at least one positive sample at baseline or postbaseline) of AIA, and using sample status, titer, and cross-reactivity to human insulin, insulin glargine, and insulin glargine M1 metabolite.</p></sec><sec id="s008"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Efficacy analyses were performed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, which included all randomized patients, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures.
