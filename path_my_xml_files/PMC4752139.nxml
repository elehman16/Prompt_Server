Pre-operation data were collected for all patients. Hemodynamic, respiratory and blood acid-base parameters were measured at the moment of induction of anesthesia (T0), after starting CO<sub>2</sub> insuffation (T1), and at 60 (T2) and 120 minutes (T3) after insufflation. In all cases, the abdominal pressure was set at 15 mmHg. Complications were reported according to the Clavien-Dindo classification. Student's two&#x02013;t-test, with a significance level set at p&#x0003c;0.05, was used to compare categorical values between groups.

Analysis of intra-operative anesthesiologic parameters showed that partial CO<sub>2</sub> pressure during EP was significantly higher than during TP, with a consequent decrease in arterial pH.

The most important limitations of this study were the small size of the patient groups and the impossibility of maintaining standard abdominal pressure throughout the operational phases, despite attempts to regulate it.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>This prospective randomized study demonstrates that, from the anesthesiologic viewpoint, during RARP the TP approach is preferable to EP, because of lower CO<sub>2</sub> reabsorption and risk of acidosis.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words:</title><kwd>Prostatectomy</kwd><kwd>Robotic Surgical Procedures</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>Anesthesiology</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="10"/><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Robot-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) can be performed via either transperitoneal (TP) or total extra-peritoneal (EP) approaches. There are some contraindications for TP endoscopic surgery, such as obesity or intraperitone-al adhesions, which may make the EP approach more attractive. EP is also believed to follow open surgery principles more closely, because the peritoneal cavity is not violated and the peritoneum functions as a natural bowel retractor, thereby preventing bowel displacement into the surgical field. Another advantage of the EP approach is the possibility of decreasing the risk of intra-abdominal complications such as bowel injury.</p><p>Nevertheless, TP is the most frequently used approach to RARP, perhaps because a larger working space is created than during EP.</p><p>During laparo-endoscopy, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation into both peritoneal and extra-peritoneal cavities produces a wide range of pathophysiological hemodynamic changes. Vigilance in monitoring and diligence in management are essential in order to prevent complications.</p><p>Although several studies comparing extra/ retroperitoneal and TP approaches for laparoscopic or robotic surgical interventions (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) have focused on functional and oncological outcomes, the literature contains few reports on the anesthesiologic effects of the two approaches in animal models and only one concerning RARP in humans (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>This prospective randomized study assesses the effects of EP and TP CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation on hemodynamic parameters and oxygen transport in a group of patients undergoing RARP for prostate cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 62 patients were randomly assigned to TP (32) or EP (30) RARP.

A 20-Fr Foley catheter was inserted into the bladder. The skin was incised transversely just below the umbilicus. The anterior rectus sheet was incised vertically over 1 cm. The pre-peritoneal space was then freed by finger dissection and further developed with a balloon trocar (Tyco, Norwalk, CN), inflated by 20-24 pumping actions until the extra-peritoneal space was appropriately created. The first 8-mm robot trocar (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) on the left side was bluntly introduced about four fingers laterally to the sub-umbilical incision, on the line joining the incision and the left anterior iliac crest. The 12mm optic trocar was then introduced and insuf-flation was started (intra-abdominal pressure 15 mmHg). Inspection of the extra-peritoneal space was performed with the 0&#x000b0; 3D da Vinci&#x000ae; camera. Under direct vision, the camera itself can be used to increase the size of the extra-peritoneal space by being made to sweep the peritoneal borders gently latero-cranially. The second 8-mm robot trocar can be placed under visual control in order to reflect the previously placed one. The 12mm assistant trocar on the right side was placed cranio-medially to the right anterior iliac crest. Another 8-mm robot trocar was placed under vision on the left side, cranio-medially to the left anterior iliac crest for the fourth arm of the robot.

Furthermore tidal volume was higher in EP group although there was not a statistically significant difference.</p><p>CO<sub>2</sub> absorption during laparo-endoscopic surgery is a challenging anesthesiologic problem, and may lead to hypercarbia and acidosis. Clearance of CO<sub>2</sub> is related to adequate alveolar ventilation, and a rapid increase in CO<sub>2</sub> levels may be compensated by hyperventilation of the lungs.</p><p>Only a small proportion of CO<sub>2</sub> is dissolved in blood and delivered directly to the lungs.</p><p>Most of it combines with water in red blood cells to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into hydrogen and bicarbonate, according to the formula:</p><disp-formula id="e1"><graphic xlink:href="1677-5538-ibju-41-3-0466-eq01.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula><p>CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed through the peritoneum is handled in the same manner and, ultimately, is eliminated by respiratory exchange in the lungs. While the patient is under general anesthesia, minute ventilation volumes must be increased to maintain normocarbia.</p><p>Although the increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> is not fully compensated by hyperventilation, most healthy patients can easily adapt to the increase in end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>. However, some cannot tolerate the increased CO<sub>2</sub> load during insufflation, and this condition may lead to myocardial depression and vasodilation. Conversely, severe acidemia and hypercapnia may depress heart performance, secondary to decreases in myocardial inotropy (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>The patient counteracts these effects by centrally mediated sympathetic stimulation, which causes persistent increases in blood pressure and heart rate, increasing catecholamine concentrations (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the pneumoperitoneum, because of direct compression of the diaphragm, leads to a significant reduction in forced expiratory volume, peak expiratory flow and forced vital capacity, with a consequent decrease in pulmonary compliance (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The extent of the hemodynamic effects of hypercarbia is also correlated to the patient's position: in the Trendelenburg position, abdominal contents are pushed against the diaphragm, reducing functional residual capacity and predisposing to atelectasis (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In 1946, Case et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) described a 15% decrease in lung volume in this position. The Trendelenburg position also increases central venous pressure, myocardial work, pulmonary venous pressure (decreasing pulmonary compliance), intra&#x02013;cranial pressure (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and intra-ocular pressure (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Our data concerning hemodynamic changes during RARP demonstrate that the EP approach is associated with hemodynamic alterations similar to those observed during TP access, but with more rapid increases in partial CO<sub>2</sub> pressure compared with TP, starting 1 hour after the beginning of CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation.</p><p>Despite substantially comparable operation times, and despite a less extreme Trendelenburg position in the EP approach and theoretically higher permeation of the gas into the bloodstream from the peritoneal cavity during TP access, in our experience EP RARP causes a significantly higher absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> than TP, resulting in more rapid acidosis.</p><p>These findings confirm the results of the only reported study comparing CO<sub>2</sub> homeostasis during TP and EP RARP in humans (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>): the authors reported a more marked acidosis during CO<sub>2</sub> insu-fflation in EP than during TP.</p><p>The mechanisms responsible for these changes appear to be multifactorial and have not been completely clarified.</p><p>One mechanism causing higher EP CO<sub>2</sub> re-absorption may be direct intra-vascular uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>, perhaps facilitated, as suggested by Glascock et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), by the disruption of microvascular and lymphatic channels during the creation of an extra-peritoneal cavity.</p><p>Another less well-known element playing a role in CO<sub>2</sub> absorption may be the use of a suction device during TP: repeated suction during the operation causes a cyclic decrease-increase in intracavity pressure, which is less pronounced in the peritoneal cavity because of the larger space, in which suction leads to a dramatic and rapid decrease in pressure. Repeated rapid variations in pressure may act as a sort of pump which insufflates CO<sub>2</sub> into the microvessels of the extra-peritoneal cavity, causing gas reabsorption.</p><p>Examining the clinical outcomes of our patients, in cases of acidosis and hypercarbia, the ventilation parameters were intra-operatively modified to maintain values under 30 mmHg and pH&#x0003e;7.3, respectively, increasing tidal volume and respiratory frequency, and successfully correcting pH alterations without complications.</p><p>All of our patients performed a pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND) independently to the risk group. This step inevitably prolonged the duration of the procedure in both groups. However the extension of the lymphadenectomy has been the same in both groups. We performed PLND in all of our patients for a prospective study (on going in that period) in order to evaluate a new nomogram on the risk of nodes metastasis in prostate cancer patients. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether patients actually classified as low risk (according to D'Amico risk groups) had in fact a risk close to zero to have nodes metastasis and to evaluate the predictive power of a new nomogram independently to the core's number evaluated at the biopsy. Nowadays the guidelines do not suggest to perform PLND in all patients because of the very low risk of nodes metastasis in low risk patients. However the nomograms proposed do not evaluate the total number of cores at the biopsy but only the percentage of positive cores.</p><p>There are several criticisms of our study: one of the most important is the impossibility of maintaining standard intra-cavity pressure throughout the operational phases, despite attempts to regulate it.</p><p>In addition, the statistical power of the small sample size of the two groups may have been insufficient to detect certain differences between them.</p><p>Nevertheless, our findings bring to the attention-not only of urologists but also of anesthesiologists-the possible hemodynamic effects of which approach is used for RARP. Although the choice is often dictated by the surgeon's preferences, the above data may help to tailor a safer approach for each patient, preferring when possible TP access, when CO<sub>2</sub> reabsorption could be more dangerous and difficult to manage intra-operatively by the anesthesiologist.</p><p>This prospective randomized study demonstrates that TP and EP RARP are comparable, considering the times of the single steps of the operation. From the anesthesiologic viewpoint, during RARP the TP approach is preferable, because there is less CO<sub>2</sub> reabsorption and risk of acidosis. These data should consequently be interpreted with caution, until they can be replicated in other settings and in other types of studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref
