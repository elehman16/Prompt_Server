Such disorders occasionally result in individuals living in environments with large amounts of garbage. Key symptoms of hoarding include difficulty discarding, excessive clutter and excessive acquisition of objects.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> The latter symptoms pose a number of dangers, such as the potential for fire and tripping over clutter. The presence of trash or clutter in one&#x02019;s living space also affects an individual&#x02019;s overall quality of life.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> This issue is a growing social problem in Japan.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
</p><p>An individual living in such conditions can become isolated from the rest of society; this can be particularly true for older people.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Unsanitary living conditions can eventually become a public health problem if they affect one&#x02019;s neighbours. Hoarding disorder is therefore an individual problem and a problem for society, and a practical solution is warranted from a public health point of view.</p><p>Hoarding disorder is often accompanied by psychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression or obsessive&#x02013;compulsive disorder (OCD).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;11</xref> A relationship between hoarding disorder and distress tolerance and anxiety sensitivity has also been noted in a sample of young adults.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Signs of hoarding were separately reported in children aged 13<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and 11&#x02013;15&#x000a0;years,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and the severity of the disorder evidently increases with age. Many sufferers report symptom onset before age 20&#x000a0;years,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> with symptoms tending to worsen past age 55&#x000a0;years.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This suggests that prevention among younger people is important. To accommodate this, we targeted a wide range of participants aged 12&#x02013;55 years old.</p><p>A previous study in England and Germany estimated that incidence of hoarding disorder was 1.5%&#x02013;5.8%.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> Another study reported that cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy, either individually or in groups, as well as home visits, are effective at assisting patients with hoarding disorder. However, these cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapies required relatively long intervention periods, and the subject samples were middle-aged and elderly people.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref>
</p><p>To the contrary, a study on the effects of a brief anxiety sensitivity reduction intervention on obsessive&#x02013;compulsive&#x000a0;(OC) spectrum symptoms in a young adult sample showed reduced OC symptoms across the postintervention follow-up period. However, the intervention did not show a specific effect on reducing hoarding symptoms.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> There is a clear need to identify new avenues through which to develop additional interventions.</p><p>Japan&#x02019;s population is ageing at an increasingly rapid rate. Given the association with age, early intervention is imperative. There is urgent need to establish a system to help prevent younger people who show signs of difficulty decluttering and organising from developing a hoarding disorder.</p><p>A previous study in Japan examined the state of the living space of 450 undergraduates from two universities.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The results showed that younger people who had difficulty decluttering and organising tended to live in cluttered or disorganised living spaces and to have low self-esteem. The study used the Japanese version of the Saving Inventory-Revised (SI-R).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This was developed in the USA<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and translated into Japanese, and its reliability and validity have been verified.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The previous study&#x02019;s SI-R scores had a mean of 32.1 points (&#x000b1;13.0) and a normal distribution. SI-R scores have been reported to be high in people who said that they did not like to clean, but many such people also want to improve the state of their living space.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> There are various ways to learn how to clean effectively in Japan, including workshops, books and professional support, but it is not clear which method is most effective.</p><p>We have therefore developed an education programme, of a series of workshops on decluttering and organising, for teens and adults who find it difficult to organise. In the workshops, we will help identify what belongings a person truly needs. It also covers the state of the individual&#x02019;s living space and its relationship with physical and mental health. The purpose of the workshop is to improve recognition of the importance of cleaning and to change behaviour.</p><p>This study examines behaviour 7 months after the intervention, using a control group, and is designed to assess both changes in habits and levels of stress. It is impossible to blind this type of intervention, so the study was made open&#x000a0;label to minimise bias.</p><p>The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme in reducing clutter and improving the quality of life in teens and middle-aged adults who have difficulty decluttering and organising and have a cluttered living space.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The design of this study is an open-label, parallel-group, stratified, randomised controlled trial. The aim of this trial is to investigate the effect of the workshop plus a professional organising and cleaning service. We hope that the programme will improve quality of life and help prevent hoarding disorder in younger people who currently have difficulty decluttering and organising. Participants will be involved for a period of 7 months. The design of the trial is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Based on previous experience, it is expected that the study will include around 90% of eligible participants.

After assessment via questionnaire, those verified as eligible will be immediately enrolled if they give their full consent. Each subject will then be randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. Enrolment will continue until the required sample size (30 participants per group) is reached. We consider that the effects of lifestyle education need several months to show progress; many studies use 6 months or longer.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> We therefore set a term of 7 months by considering 6 months after the intervention begins as the observation period in the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>A sealed envelope method will be used for random allocation. This is based on a permuted block method, with a block size of 4 and a random number table created before the study begins. Each presealed envelope, prepared by a person independent from the research, will contain a random number. Participants will open this at the location of the session meeting where they gave consent and cannot change their designated group.</p><p>Because of the open-label design, participants will know whether they are assigned to the intervention or control group. However, this information is blinded for the professional organising and cleaning service in order to avoid risk of bias.</p><p>Effectiveness of the intervention will be determined via surveys completed by the participants and sent directly to the study chair at Teikyo&#x000a0;University along with a photograph of the room to assess the present level of cleanliness or clutter. The organising and cleaning services will not be able to see the results for individual subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Intervention group</title><p>This group will attend a workshop programme, undergo inspections of cleanliness or clutter of their rooms and receive visits from an organising and cleaning service.

The second will take place before the start of the study.

The second group of 23 subjects had yet to undergo cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> A comparison of the two groups indicated that subjects who had completed the 12th session of cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy had a 10-point drop in their SI-R score. Around 10 points were improved on using a pre-test on the general population. A meta-analysis in another study indicated that intervention was more effective in younger individuals than older ones. This study therefore assumed a potential 10-point improvement in SI-R score.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Previous results indicated that the SI-R score had a normal distribution and SD was 13.0.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The sample size was therefore calculated as 28 per group under the assumptions of a significance level of 5% (two&#x000a0;tailed), a power of 80% and an effect size of 0.75. Considering the likely dropout rate, we set the sample size needed for this trial as 60 subjects in total, 30 in each group.</p></sec><sec id="s2i2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analyses will be conducted under the intention-to-treat principle. The main target set for analysis is the full analysis set. Missing data will be permutated under the assumption of missing at random following the last observation carried forward principle. A sensitivity analysis will be performed using the multiple imputation method. The secondary target set for the analyses will be the per-protocol set.</p><p>Summary statistics (maximum, median, minimum, mean and SD) will be calculated for all continuous data, and frequency and proportion for categorical data.</p><p>The differences in effect sizes between the two groups will be examined using a t-test. Differences will be assessed in a general linear model by adjusting for gender, age and marital status at the start of the study and outcome measure at the baseline. Crude and adjusted ORs will be calculated for binary variables and the two groups will be compared using logistic regression analysis. As secondary analysis, mixed-effects random-effects models will be used as a longitudinal data analysis. The significance level for testing will be set at p&#x0003c;0.05 (two&#x000a0;tailed).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Timeframe of the study</title><p>Participants were registered between January and May 2016.

The findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations.</p><p>Study participant candidates will be given an explanation form. The study will be fully explained orally and in writing, and voluntary consent for study participation will be sought in writing.

Considerations have been made in the event a participant consents to take part but later withdraws that consent. Participants will be assured they will not be penalised for withdrawal or for not participating. Participants will be informed of the study&#x02019;s results after its conclusion and on their request. Those aged 12&#x02013;14&#x000a0;years must provide written informed assent together with an adult consent form from the parents. Those aged 15&#x02013;18 years&#x000a0;must provide written consent (same as for adults) and a guardian consent form. The ages for requisite informed assent were decided with reference to the guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31 32</xref> and the decision of the Teikyo University Ethics Committee. Minors living with a guardian or family member (in this section hereinafter &#x02018;relevant party&#x02019;) will have a similar form mailed to the relevant party or the minor will be asked to deliver it to the relevant party. If information is obtained that may affect the participant or the relevant party, or if the protocol is modified to such an extent that the change would affect the consent of all relevant parties, that information will be promptly provided to the relevant parties and the participant&#x02019;s desire to continue will be verified. In either of the aforementioned instances, the Research Ethics Committee will revise and approve the consent and explanation form, and the consent of all relevant parties will be sought.</p><p>Participants who wish to view their information or withdraw consent may contact the study chair for resolution. Any modifications to the protocol that may affect the conduct of the study will be presented to the aforementioned committee.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>One aim of this study is to assess the effect of an intervention (a workshop) on the state of living spaces and the quality of life of younger people who have difficulty decluttering and organising and who therefore have a cluttered living space. If the approach is found to be effective, then the findings of this study will be widely publicised and the workshop materials will be made widely available, so that it can be conducted by others, including administrative bodies and professional organisers and cleaners. This should improve the quality of life and help to prevent a hoarding disorder in younger people who have difficulty decluttering and organising.</p><p>This study has certain strengths and weaknesses. Blinding is not possible because of the type of intervention. It is impossible to create a convincing placebo for the workshop on decluttering and organising, and this lack of blinding may affect the results. As far as possible, subjects need to have an experience equivalent to undergoing training from a professional organising and cleaning service.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014687.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary material 1</title></caption><p>
