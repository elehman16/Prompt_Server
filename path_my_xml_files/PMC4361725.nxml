Five clusters (parishes, consisting of &#x0223c;11 villages each) were randomly selected for each of the three study arms with between 7,534 and 9,401 households per arm. Arm 1 received one hang-up visit, while Arm 2 received two visits by volunteers four and seven months after the campaign. Visits consisted of assistance hanging the net and education on net use. The control arm was only exposed to messages during the campaign itself. Three cross-sectional surveys with a two-stage cluster sampling design, representative of the study populations, were carried out to capture the two key outcome variables of net hanging and ITN use.

However, a consistent gap between net ownership as defined by households owning at least one ITN and use by specific target groups or the general population has been observed which&#x02014;at least to a large part&#x02014;has been interpreted as a lack of ability or willingness to hang and/or use the nets [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Application of recently expanded indicators for ITN ownership and use [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] suggests that most of this gap was due to insufficient ITN within the household rather than unwillingness to use [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, in the late 2000&#x02019;s the main hypothesis was that difficulties in hanging the net and lack of knowledge about use were the key barriers to use [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This resulted in calls for active support in net hanging and inter-personal communication through home visits after the campaign distribution [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and WHO now recommends to include &#x0201c;hang-up&#x0201d; activities by community volunteers as part of LLIN distribution campaigns [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Detailed instructions on the implementation of such activities have been issued [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and included in many LLIN mass distribution campaigns [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In recent years there has been a significant increase in the literature on determinants of net use and reasons for non-use which have been shown to be complex, reflecting the living conditions of poor rural populations in high-risk malaria transmission areas. They include environmental factors such as climate and mosquito density, community norms and values, intra-family dynamics regarding decision taking and gender or age priorities, and factors associated with the net itself such as age or physical condition [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, published data to date does not suggest that difficulty in hanging is a significant factor in non-use even though it is frequently mentioned in focus group discussions [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Cohee and coworkers studied ITN use among HIV affected households in Rakai District, Uganda, and found that only 6% of the non-users said the net was &#x0201c;too difficult to mount&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. From two post-campaign surveys in Niger Thwing and colleagues report that &#x0003c;5% of unused nets were not used due to difficulties in hanging [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Kenya Alaii et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] found 4% of the reasons given for non-use of ITN by children to be associated with technical difficulties in hanging, and from Malawi Holtz and coworkers [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] report 5% of non-users stating such difficulties. Five additional studies included in a review on quantifiable reasons for net non-use by Pulford at al. [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] make no mention at all of technical problems in hanging. On the other hand there is evidence that behavior change communication (BCC) without &#x0201c;hang-up&#x0201d; can significantly increase net use either through mass media [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], intensive and repeated inter-personal communication [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], or material incentives [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Published literature regarding the effects of door-to-door visits following an LLIN mass distribution campaign on net hanging and use rates is as yet very limited. The previously mentioned post-campaign surveys in Niger [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found net use in children under five only increased by 3 percentage-points after intervention by Red Cross volunteers (72% vs. 74%) while in Togo [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], households with a volunteer follow-up visit showed an 8 percentage-point increase in nets hanging (80.4% vs. 72.3%) but only a 3 percentage-point increase in ITN use by children (89.0% vs. 86.2%) which was not statistically significant. In Madagascar 59 districts received an integrated LLIN mass campaign with volunteer door-to-door visits post-campaign and results were compared to districts with no campaign where ITN were obtained from routine distributions or from the retail market. ITN use among children in households with any ITN was 94.6% and 90.0% respectively, with the difference not statistically significant [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A post campaign survey in Luangwa District in Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] revealed no difference in the proportion of children using an ITN the previous night comparing ITN owning households where a community health worker had hung a net or not (53.5% vs. 54.5%). In the same district of Luangwa, Keating and coworkers undertook a quasi-experimental study of the effect of door-to-door interpersonal communication on ITN use [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and found a strong increase in use in both intervention and control groups with no statistical difference at the end of the trial (82.8% vs. 79.8%).</p><p>Since the organization of door-to-door visits has its costs even when undertaken by community volunteers and hang-up activities are routinely undertaken by programs even though available evidence to support it is not very strong, more evidence is needed to judge whether this approach should continue to be recommended for use in all campaigns. This study was undertaken in Uganda within the context of the Alliance for Malaria Prevention Operational Research Working Group in order to produce more evidence regarding this question. A similar study was undertaken in Togo and will be reported on separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study site</title><p>The study was carried out in Kamuli District within its January 2010 administrative boundaries. This location was selected in close collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program based on the following criteria: 1) a mass distribution of LLIN planned within the time window of the study; 2) an anticipated moderate net use rate based on the results of the 2009 Malaria Indicator Survey in the Eastern Region of Uganda [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] which showed 57.5% of children under 5 in households with at least one ITN using a net the previous night; and 3) no previous mass campaigns of LLIN.</p><p>Kamuli District is bordered by Lake Kyoga to the North, the Nile River to the West, Jinja District to the South and Iganga and Kaliro Districts to the East (<xref rid="pone.0119078.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Kamuli is part of the Busoga kingdom with a majority population of Basoga and minorities of Isiga, Banyoro and Bagungu ethnic groups. In addition to English Lusoga and Luganda are the main spoken languages. Kamuli is a predominantly agricultural district with rice, sweet potatoes and plantains being the main crops. In addition, fishing and animal husbandry are also significant sources of income. The estimated population of the district in its 2010 boundaries was 558,000 based on the 2002 National Census and approximately 707,600 in 2010 based on a 3% annual growth rate assumption.</p><fig id="pone.0119078.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0119078.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of Uganda with Kamuli District (2010 borders) and study clusters (parishes).</title><p>Numbers represent the five geographical strata; orange: study arm 1; yellow: study arm 2; green study arm 3.

The two major outcomes were defined as the proportion of households hanging all their nets obtained from the campaign and the proportion of the <italic>de facto</italic> population using an ITN the previous night if they had access to one.</p><p>The design was a cluster-randomized, controlled study where the administrative unit of a parish (Local Council 2) was defined as cluster for randomization of interventions and control. In Kamuli District, a parish comprises on average 11 villages (Local Council 1) and 10,000 people and was the lowest unit at which training for the LLIN mass campaign was carried out. This approach excluded the use of villages as randomization clusters as it would have been impossible to avoid contamination of nearby control villages. First, sub-counties where a targeted LLIN distribution to young children had previously been carried out were excluded. Second, the district capital, Kamuli Municipality, was excluded so that all clusters had a rural background. Third, any parish bordering the Nile River or Lake Kyoga was excluded as these areas were anticipated to have higher levels of nuisance biting mosquitoes and hence a higher propensity to use nets. This gave a list of 47 Parishes eligible for selection. In the next step fifteen parishes (five clusters per study arm) were selected in such a way that no parish would directly border another eligible parish in order to minimize contamination between study arms. These parishes were then grouped into five geographical groups of three (<xref rid="pone.0119078.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) to ensure matching contribution of each sector of the district to each study arm. Within each of these groups parishes were randomly allocated to one of the study arms. A detailed list of selected parishes by study arm and group is provided in additional <xref rid="pone.0119078.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>. The study participants were defined as all households residing in the 15 selected parishes with a total of 24,471 households: 7,534 in study arm 1, 7,535 in arm 2 and 9,401 in arm 3. The study arms were defined as follows (see also <xref rid="pone.0119078.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>):</p><fig id="pone.0119078.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0119078.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Rainfall pattern for Kamuli District and timing of study activities.</title><p>Light blue bars represent monthly rainfall; red = LLIN mass campaign; green = interventions; stars show which timing of activities per study arm.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0119078.g002"/></fig><p>ARM 1: One &#x0201c;hang-up visit&#x0201d;; All households receive one visit by members of the Village Health Team (VHT) four months after the LLIN distribution.

These visits were not part of the study interventions but were allowed in study arms 1 and 2. They were not carried out in the parishes of study arm 3.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Mass distribution campaign</title><p>The mass campaign, funded by the Global Fund Round 7, targeted pregnant women and children under five with LLIN in all districts in the country. The Kamuli district LLIN distribution was conducted by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and a consortium of NGOs led by Program for Accessible Health and Education (PACE) with the final distribution occurring on December 1<sup>st</sup> 2010. Households and their eligible population were registered in a house-to-house exercise prior to net distribution. All pregnant women were allocated one LLIN each and children under five were allocated LLIN in the ratio of one for every two children in the household. However, if there were three children under five, two nets were given. This allocation rule was used to determine the number of nets each household was to receive and this number was written on a coupon issued to the household to be redeemed at the distribution point. The date set for distribution was communicated to the heads of households instructing them where to collect their nets. In addition, radio announcements communicated the date and the distribution point. The registration exercise lasted two days, the actual net distribution one day. Before and during the collection process education was provided to the beneficiaries on malaria prevention and how to correctly hang a net and this was done in all three study arms.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Home visits</title><p>The intervention home visits were done by VHTs and organized by the NGO PACE. A series of activities were carried out by PACE to prepare and ensure quality education and hang up activities in the households in arm 1 and arm 2. PACE developed a training curriculum based on the Red Cross guidelines for the hang-up intervention generally recommended by WHO. VHTs were selected and organized into teams and trained to follow a standard operating guideline for the hang-up and follow-up. The guidelines prescribed using a job aid to provide education on LLIN, asking about number and verify status of campaign LLIN in the household, noting how many LLIN are hanging, providing assistance with hanging LLIN and filling out monitoring forms for each household location and identifiers. Independent supervisors conducted quality checks of the intervention and verified the validity of data entry by the VHTs. The job aid used by the VHT is presented as additional <xref rid="pone.0119078.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 File</xref>.</p><p>Based on the PACE project records of the home visits undertaken, volunteers visited 87.9% of all eligible households for the first visit in study arm 1 and 78.4% for study arm 2. The second visit (arm 2 only) had a completeness of 83.9%.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Evaluation surveys and sample size</title><p>For the evaluation of the interventions three cross-sectional household surveys were carried out using a two-stage cluster sampling design. The first survey served as baseline immediately after the mass distribution. The second and third surveys each followed two to four weeks after the home visit interventions in arms one and two (<xref rid="pone.0119078.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Each study arm was considered a sampling domain and a sample of 30 villages was taken with probability proportionate to size (PPS) using the number of households recorded during the mass campaign as a measure of size. Within each village, 25 households were sampled with equal probability from the lists of all households registered during the mass campaign. Random numbers were generated by Stata 11 (StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, USA) statistical software. Villages were maintained for each survey while households within villages were re-selected for each survey round from the same lists.</p><p>The sample size of 750 households per survey and study arm was calculated using the sample size module of the Stata software and applying an alpha error of 0.017 or 98.3% confidence interval (adjusting for multiple comparisons between study arms by dividing an alpha error of 0.05 by three), a beta error of 0.1 (power 90%), a design effect of 2.0, a 5% non-response rate, a net use rate at baseline of 50% and a difference between study arms of at least 15 percentage points. The total targeted sample was 2,250 households per survey round.</p><p>Pre-coded, structured questionnaires were used for data collection within households with the head of household or his or her spouse being the main respondent. In the first survey, the person going to the distribution point to pick up the net from the mass campaign was also interviewed. The questionnaire included a roster of all household members, a section on characteristics of the household and assets owned, a section on knowledge and perceptions around ITN, on the process of obtaining LLIN from the campaign including any home visits thereafter and hanging of the nets, and a roster of all nets found in the household. Each net was physically observed by the interviewer provided permission was given by the respondent. Visual aids with images of all available brands of LLIN (labels and packaging) were used to identify campaign nets (Netprotect, Bestnet\AS, Denmark) and other ITN in the houses. Verbal consent was obtained from each household respondent after adequate information on the rights to refuse or withdraw had been provided.</p><p>The survey team consisted of experienced field workers and interviewers who were able to communicate in the local languages Lusoga and Luganda. A three-day training preceded each survey round and during data collections supervisors checked all filled questionnaires for completeness and consistency. In addition, spot-checks were performed on 10% of interviews conducted by each field worker to validate the data collected.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Costing data</title><p>To capture the cost of the interventions, a standardized spreadsheet was provided to the implementing agent (PACE) to capture all direct costs involved in each of the two rounds of home visits as well as indirect costs such as staff time and other contributions. The cost data collection followed the approach previously developed by WHO and Malaria Consortium as described by Kolaczinski et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and excluded any cost of the research itself.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data entry and analysis</title><p>A relational data base constructed in EpiData 3.1 was used for data entry with consistency checks incorporated. All records were double entered and any discrepancies validated from the original paper records.</p><p>Data were then transferred to Stata for data processing and analysis. Having used PPS to sample, the data can be considered self-weighted at the survey village level. However, to adjust for possible distortion of results by the difference of village sizes, standardized sampling weights were calculated. Analysis was done by an intention to treat approach based on study arm and independent of whether or not a home visit could be verified. Statistics were adjusted for the cluster sampling design (design effect) of the evaluation surveys by using Stata&#x02019;s survey commands. A p-value of 0.017 was used as cut-off for statistical significance based on multi-comparisons between study arms (0.05 divided by 3).</p><p>The wealth index was computed at the household level using principal component analysis (PCA) [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The variables for household amenities, assets, livestock, and other characteristics that are related to a household&#x02019;s socioeconomic status were used for the computation. All variables were dichotomized except those of animal ownership where the total number owned was used. The first component of the PCA was used as the wealth index. Households were then classified according to their index value into quintiles. Quintiles were calculated separately for each study arm. For analysis of individual members of the household or nets the quintile allocation of the household was applied. Concentration index was used to analyze outcome differences by wealth. Standard errors and confidence intervals for the concentration indices were calculated using the formula suggested by Kakwani et al [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>The indicator of &#x0201c;access to ITN within the household&#x0201d; for individual household members was calculated as recommended by MERG [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. First, an intermediate variable of &#x0201c;potential ITN users&#x0201d; was created by multiplying the number of ITN in each household by a factor of 2.0. In order to adjust for households with more than one net for every two people, the potential ITN users were set equal to the de-facto population in that household if the potential users exceeded the number of people in the household. Second, the access indicator was calculated by dividing the potential ITN users by the number of de-facto members for each household and determining the overall sample mean of that fraction.</p><p>Responses related to questions on IEC/BCC were recorded using a Likert scale, i.e. by asking respondents to choose on a scale of agreement. Response options were recoded to read 2 for &#x0201c;definitely could,&#x0201d; 1 for &#x0201c;probably could,&#x0201d; &#x02013;1 for &#x0201c;probably could not&#x0201d;, &#x02013;2 for &#x0201c;definitely could not&#x0201d;. Similarly, the responses were recoded to read 2 for &#x0201c;strongly agree,&#x0201d; 1 for &#x0201c;somewhat agree,&#x0201d; &#x02013;1 for &#x0201c;somewhat disagree,&#x0201d; and &#x02013;2 for &#x0201c;strongly disagree.&#x0201d;</p><p>To test for effects between study arms and time points (survey) for the major outcome of ITN use a &#x02018;difference of differences&#x02019; analysis was used. This was done using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with main effects of study arm and survey together with study arm-survey interactions. The models assume a binomial distribution with identity link and an independent correlation structure. The study arm-survey interaction terms describe the difference of differences effect. Each model accounted for survey villages as well as the randomization clusters (parishes) and the geographically matched groups of parishes by introducing them as random effects in the binomial model. Wealth quintiles were also included in the model as a potential confounder.</p><p>Data sets as well as full study protocol are available from the corresponding author on request.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Ethical clearance</title><p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the Uganda Council for Science and Technology (ref. number SS 2397) and from the Institutional Review Board of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (IRB number: 3051).

The proportion of the targeted households reached (2250 per survey) reduced over the course of the study from 88.6% in the first survey to 84.6% and 80.5% respectively. This rather low completion rate was, however, not caused by refusals to participate but rather by a high proportion of households from the original campaign registration lists that could not be identified. This proportion was 10.2% initially and increased to 14.8% and 18.9% in the following surveys with no statistically significant differences between study arms. While the initial failure to identify households was mainly due to incorrect registrations (nonexistent names of household heads or double registration of same household under different names), the increase over the course of the study was caused by movement of households outside the study area.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0119078.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0119078.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Survey coverage based on a target sample of 2250 households per survey (750 per arm).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0119078.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0119078.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survey 1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survey 2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Survey 3</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">December 2010</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">March 2011</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">July 2011</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Responses were grouped into two main categories: subjective reasons that are prone to be influenced by behavior change communication such as fear of side effects, inability to hang the net or perception that there is no malaria, and objective reasons that are more difficult or impossible to address, such as the usual occupant or the net not being present or available that night, the net being too old and torn, or having an excess net for which there is currently no use. A detailed list of categories is shown in <xref rid="pone.0119078.t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref> which presents results from the final evaluation at survey 3, i.e. after all interventions had been implemented. In all three study arms &#x0201c;net not needed&#x0201d;, i.e. an excess net for which there currently is no user, was the most common reason for not using the net, at 42.1%. The second most common reason was that the net was &#x0201c;too old, torn or dirty&#x0201d;, at 16.7% followed by &#x0201c;user not around&#x0201d; with 13.0%, and &#x0201c;net not available&#x0201d; with 8.4%. Together these reasons, categorized as objective, comprised 80.2% of the stated reasons for non-use compared to 9.9% for subjective reasons, among which &#x0201c;not ready to use net at this time&#x0201d; was the most common with 4.1% followed by &#x0201c;fear of side effects/dislike of net&#x0201d; with 2.7% and &#x0201c;no malaria/mosquitoes&#x0201d; with 2.6%. Inability to hang the net was the least mentioned reason for non-use with 0.6%, and all of these came from the control arm. The remaining 9.5% of responses were &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; without specification and, therefore, could not be categorized further. There was no statistically significant difference in reasons for non-use between the study arms at survey 3 (p = 0.3). Non-use due to the &#x0201c;net not being needed&#x0201d; was also particularly high for nets from households that were oversupplied with ITN (56%), i.e. had more than one ITN for every two people. This suggests that the newer campaign nets were kept for later use if more than enough nets were available.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0119078.t005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0119078.t005</object-id><label>Table 5</label><caption><title>Reasons for non-use of ITN: final evaluation at survey 3 (N = 1391).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0119078.t005g" xlink:href="pone.0119078.t005"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arm 1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arm 2</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arm 3</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">One visit</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Two visits</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% (95% CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% (95% CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">% (95% CI)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n = 406</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n = 473</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n = 512</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

At the survey immediately following the campaign 68.1% confirmed exposure to such messages with no difference between the study arms (p = 0.3) and no change was detected in the two follow-up surveys (p = 0.9). The most commonly mentioned sources were local leaders with 58.5% and health workers, 30.5%. Messages heard on radio played a lesser role, at 15.9%, from the campaign mobilization team, at 13.4%, and from family and friends, at 12.2%. The campaign leaflet was mentioned by only 4.0% while newspaper, drama shows and religious groups were mentioned by less than 1%. Two thirds (65.7%) of those exposed to messages mentioned a single source while 34.2% mentioned two or more sources with a maximum of four. The most commonly recalled message content was &#x0201c;hang your net&#x0201d; mentioned by 56.9% and &#x0201c;use your net&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;use net every night&#x0201d; with together 54.2%.

Controlling for survey, study arm and the geographical groups of clusters, the two most important determinants of individual ITN use were &#x0201c;intention to use nets every or most nights&#x0201d; expressed by the household respondent with an adjusted Odds-Ratio (OR) of 3.22 (95% CI 2.75, 3.78) and the household having at least one ITN for every two people, OR 2.76 (2.44, 3.12). The household respondent being confident to take action in preventing malaria (mean action score &#x0003e;1) was also positively associated with ITN use, OR 1.23 (1.10, 1.36), as was having discussed net use in the family, OR 1.25 (1.13, 1.38). High level of agreement with statements about the threat of malaria were negatively associated with ITN use, OR 0.81 (0.71, 0.92), implying that with increasing ITN use, the perceived threat decreased. Other factors significantly associated with ITN use were gender, with an adjusted OR for females compared to males of 1.16 (1.10, 1.22), wealth, with decreasing use as wealth increased (p = 0.0001), and age (p&#x0003c;0.0001), with highest use in under-fives and lowest use in the age groups 10&#x02013;14 and 15&#x02013;19 years. Education level of head of household or family size did not have an independent effect on ITN use in this model. However, overall, the final model only explained 12% of the variation of ITN use (R-squared 0.12) suggesting that other unmeasured factors also play a significant role.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec033"><title>Cost of intervention per household reached</title><p>The financial cost of the intervention of one or two additional home visits to enhance ITN hanging and use after the campaign is shown in <xref rid="pone.0119078.t008" ref-type="table">Table 8</xref>.

But there was no difference detected in the outcome between the control and either intervention arm, nor between the two intervention arms themselves. This result is very similar to the only other study on net use and home visits with an experimental design from Luangwa, Zambia, although due to an error in the allocation of intervention and control clusters it was declared quasi-experimental [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In Luangwa District, home visits and interpersonal communication by community volunteers were provided in addition to the information given during the campaign over an 18 months period. This intervention resulted in a general increase of net use in children under five from 54% to 81%. But there was no difference detected between intervention and control (82.8% vs. 79.8%), and both intervention and control households had a high exposure to information on net use from the media (94.2% vs. 86.6%). Other published data comes from observational studies from Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Niger [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Togo [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Madagascar [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and none of them found a significant impact of post-campaign home visits on ITN use, nor did any of the differences exceed 5 percentage-points. This suggests that improvements detected in our study were achieved by the campaign-related information and messages in combination with BCC through multiple media channels. This is plausible as achievements of the magnitude observed in this study have been shown in Cameroon to be possible by a well-organized media campaign alone with an increase of 12 percentage-points in net use by children and 7 percentage points for the general population [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. An even larger increase attributable to BCC messages of 29% was reported from Zambia [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>Data from this study strongly suggest that difficulties in hanging of nets is not the primary reason for non-use, and that nets are being hung and used if there is motivation and opportunity to use. Categorizing reasons for non-use in this study following suggestions by Alaii et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Pulford et al. [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], the vast majority (74% at the first and 80% at the third survey) could be categorized as &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d;, i.e. not easily influenced by BCC, and only 18% and 10%, respectively, as subjective. Among subjective reasons, inability to hang the net was only stated for 3.5% of unused nets at the first survey and 0.6% at the final evaluation with no differences detected between study arms. Among the objective reasons, &#x0201c;net not needed&#x0201d;, i.e. a net without an evident user, was most common. Second, only 12% of households stated that they had difficulties in hanging the nets at the first survey reducing to 5.3% in the third survey and the reduction was similar in all study arms. Furthermore, stating difficulties in hanging did not prevent households from hanging nets as 86% still had at least one of the campaign nets hanging and 56% all campaign nets, compared to 90% and 67% respectively if no difficulties were stated. Third, even in the control group, gains in campaign nets hanging were observed with nets moving from being stored to being hung during the seven months of follow-up. This appears to be based on the exposure to messages during the campaign&#x02014;mainly from local leaders (59%) and health workers (31%) and to a lesser degree from radio (16%) and family and friends (12%)&#x02014;and assisted by the provision of a pack of nails and strings together with the campaign nets. The multi-variable regression analysis showed that the intention to use a net every or most nights was the strongest determinant of use (OR 3.2), followed by having enough nets for all household members (OR 2.8), discussing net use in the family (OR 1.3) and a high level of confidence to take actions for malaria prevention (OR 1.2). Intention to use nets every night or most nights and discussing net use with the family were both significantly associated with exposure to messages. At the same time the perceived threat of malaria decreased with increasing net use, suggesting that the experience of improvements in the malaria situation through net use encouraged continued use.</p><p>Taken together, this implies that cause and effect between hanging of nets and their use starts with exposure to messages which enhance the intra-household discussion about net use and willingness and confidence to use, leading to the ability to overcome any perceived or existing challenges in hanging of nets, and resulting in increased levels of net use if there are enough nets in the household. Repeated net use and the positive experience of a declining threat then further enhances net use with increasing use rates also among population groups that are usually less likely to use such as older children and adolescents [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119078.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119078.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This interpretation is in keeping with the Health Belief Model [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0119078.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], a widely used model in public health, which states that the combination of the perception of risk and beliefs about the barriers to and benefits of a health action determine health behaviors.</p><p>In the Ugandan setting, some level of net use and communication around nets has been ongoing for several years. It appears that the exposure to routine BCC around the campaign was sufficient to trigger this process and the additional intensive home visits by VHT members four and seven months after the distribution did not have an additional effect. At costs of USD 2.33 per household for the first visit and USD 2.24 for the second visit, this approach does not suggest good value for money considering that a mass media campaign to promote ITN use in Cameroon was costed at USD 0.16 per adult reached and USD 1.62 per additional person protected by a net [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Several limitations of the study need to be taken into account. First, although records from the NGO implementing the home visit intervention indicate that between 78% and 88% of households in the communities sampled for the evaluation surveys were visited by the VHT during the first and second round of intervention, this could not be verified by recall of the respondents. Only 46% and 45% of households in study arms 1 and 2, respectively, recalled the first home visit and 38% the second (study arm 2 only). One possible explanation could be that the respondent to the questionnaire might not have been present when the VHT member visited. However, this is not likely to explain most of the deficit in recall as a senior member of the household had to confirm the visit by fingerprint. Another reason could be confusion with activities of the VHT regarding health aspects other than malaria. The majority of households in this study that recalled a Hang-up visit regarding nets confirmed that the volunteer had talked to them about the importance of using the ITN (91%) and 84% about hanging the net, even though only in 18% did they actually assist in hanging. In connection with the high level of coverage from the implementer&#x02019;s records this strongly suggests that the intervention was delivered in sufficient quality and quantity so that an effect could have been seen.</p><p>There was also a recall of a hang-up visit in the control arm by 9% and 13% of households at the second and third survey, respectively. This could either be due to confusion with other health activities by the VHT, or reflect home visits of volunteers undertaken on their own initiative, or be a recall error. Actual contamination by the organized intervention is highly unlikely based on the study design of using parishes as units of randomization and leaving at least one parish as a buffer zone between intervention and control clusters. Although a slight dilution effect on the assessment of the intervention cannot be excluded, the magnitude would not have been sufficient to change the key findings of this study.</p><p>The non-response rate in the evaluation surveys was higher than the usually tolerated 5% with 12% reported in the first survey, 16% in the second and 19% in the third. However, the rate of refusal by households was very low with a maximum of 1.6% in the first survey. Instead, most of the &#x0201c;non-response&#x0201d; was due to households on the list that were found to be nonexistent (false name) or misleading (household members registered as separate households). This comprised 10% of sampled households in the first survey. The further increase to 15% and 19% in the following surveys was mainly due to movement of households to other communities.</p><p>Measurement of the key outcome, the use of an ITN the previous night, was by recall by the respondent regarding who used which net, with a cross-check of these names against the list of household members. This is general practice for Malaria Indicator and Demographic and Health Surveys [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] but could possibly overestimate the true use rate if respondents exaggerate actual use based on perceived expectations. There is only one published study where ITN use was physically confirmed by a household visit in the early morning [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and 72% of the population was found using an ITN, but this result was not compared against a self-reported use rate. In this study, the changes over time in reported ITN use were closely matched by observed changes in hanging nets, which makes it highly unlikely that the detected increases in use were caused by an increasing overestimation of ITN use rather than actual use.</p><p>Finally, this study was designed to measure the impact of one or two additional post-campaign home visits on net hanging and use based on standard procedures in the given setting of Uganda. The extent to which the findings reported here can be extrapolated to other settings where the level of pre-existing &#x02018;net culture&#x02019; and intensity of BCC activities around a net campaign are different remains unclear. Results from a similar study in Togo published recently [<xref rid="pone.0119078.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] show generally similar results although a significant increase in ITN use among children under five was found. This is a limitation with respect to the practical applicability of the study results for program managers, and can only be addressed once comparable evidence from more settings becomes available and can be subjected to a meta-analysis.</p><p>In conclusion, in the setting of Kamuli District, Uganda, behavior change communication provided during the LLIN mass campaign or through other channels was sufficient to induce high levels of net hanging and use and additional &#x0201c;hang-up&#x0201d; activities based on the recommended &#x0201c;home-visit&#x0201d; procedures did not provide any additional impact on net use, were not cost-effective and should not be recommended for similar settings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec035"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119078.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>List of clusters (Parishes) per study arm.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119078.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119078.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>visual aid for the intervention home visits.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119078.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119078.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Composition of final sample by study arm and intervention cluster.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119078.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0119078.s004"><label>S4 File</label><caption><title>Determinants of ITN use from multi-variable analysis.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0119078.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the survey team of supervisors and interviewers for their excellent work and particularly Agnes Subi of Malaria Consortium for her tremendous efforts in overall coordination.
