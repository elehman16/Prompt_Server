Angiogenesis inhibitors, including the anti&#x02212;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) monoclonal antibody bevacizumab; the recombinant anti-VEGF fusion protein aflibercept; and the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib, sunitinib, axitinib, vandetanib, and pazopanib, have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with certain cancer types, either as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0108048-Korpanty1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Blumenschein1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, only a fraction of treated patients typically derive clinical benefit. Predictive biomarkers identifying patients most likely to respond would allow for a more targeted approach to treatment and, therefore, would be of significant clinical value. To date, no validated biomarker has been identified for any angiogenesis inhibitor despite extensive investigation. Lambrechts et al <xref rid="pone.0108048-Lambrechts1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> recently described efforts to identify predictive biomarkers for bevacizumab: although potential markers have been identified in certain tumor types, as yet none have proven robust. A recent prospective study found an association between low VEGF-A levels and both progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC <xref rid="pone.0108048-Mok1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, because the study did not include a control arm it was not possible to differentiate between prognostic and predictive value of the biomarker.</p><p>Motesanib is a potent small-molecule inhibitor of VEGF receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor; and Kit <xref rid="pone.0108048-Polverino1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, with demonstrated antitumor activity as monotherapy <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in combination with chemotherapy <xref rid="pone.0108048-Blumenschein2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In the motesanib first-in-human study, analysis of potential biomarker candidates showed a strong pharmacodynamic response of placental growth factor (PLGF) and further suggested that increased levels of PLGF from baseline were associated with increased motesanib exposure and possibly correlated with tumor shrinkage <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. PLGF is a VEGF-A homolog and a VEGFR1 ligand that is up-regulated during hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0108048-Green1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108048-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and may be involved in pathologic angiogenesis, possibly by increasing the responsiveness of endothelial cells to VEGF-A <xref rid="pone.0108048-Carmeliet2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The increase in PLGF following motesanib treatment possibly represents a compensatory upregulation in response to VEGF pathway blockade. Subsequent phase 2 studies with motesanib showed a consistent association between increased levels from baseline in PLGF and outcomes across different tumor types, including thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and non&#x02013;small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, other inhibitors of the VEGF pathway have been known to induce pharmacodynamic changes in PLGF <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rini1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Batchelor1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, which, in some cases, have been associated with outcomes including objective response and OS. Taken together, the data suggested that PLGF may serve as a biomarker for the biologic effect of VEGF receptor inhibitors, and as such, it may be a potential biomarker identifying a population most likely to benefit from continued treatment with these agents.</p><p> The PLGF data collected in motesanib phase 2 studies <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> formed a strong body of evidence that supported further prospective testing of PLGF as a potential biomarker in the large international phase 3 Motesanib NSCLC Efficacy and Tolerability (MONET1) study of motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel versus placebo plus carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with nonsquamous NSCLC. However, the study did not meet its primary endpoint, and PLGF analysis with a validated assay developed specifically as a companion diagnostic test did not reveal an association between change from baseline in PLGF and OS <xref rid="pone.0108048-Scagliotti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. To date, MONET1 remains the only large, prospective study of a biomarker candidate for an angiogenesis inhibitor. Considering the body of evidence for PLGF as a biomarker for motesanib and the rigorous analysis of data that formed the basis of the PLGF hypothesis for MONET1, the study&#x02019;s negative biomarker results demonstrate the challenges in the development of a valid predictive biomarker. Here we describe the processes we undertook in an effort to develop PLGF as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for motesanib using an ongoing phase 3 study of motesanib in patients with NSCLC and supporting data from the preceding phase 2 study of motesanib in NSCLC. We hope that our experiences will help others who intend to develop predictive biomarkers based on early biomarker data by highlighting the challenges of applying late-emerging biomarker data to ongoing clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s004">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s005">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical Studies</title><p>PLGF was evaluated as a pharmacodynamic biomarker for motesanib in patients with advanced nonsquamous NSCLC in an exploratory analysis of a randomized phase 2 study (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00369070; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00369070">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00369070</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0108048-Blumenschein2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and as a secondary endpoint in a prespecified analysis of a randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 study (MONET1; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00460317; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00460317">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00460317</ext-link>) <xref rid="pone.0108048-Scagliotti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>The phase 2 study <xref rid="pone.0108048-Blumenschein2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> enrolled patients (&#x02265;18 years) with unresectable stage IIIB nonsquamous NSCLC with pericardial or pleural effusion or stage IV/recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC (histologically or cytologically confirmed), measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.0 <xref rid="pone.0108048-Therasse1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &#x02264;1, and life expectancy &#x02265;3 months.

For accuracy, there is no certified standard commercially available for the PLGF analyte. A commercially available antigen was used to develop an Amino Acid Analyses (AAA)&#x02013;based extinction coefficient for an A280-independent method to assign a concentration value to PLGF internal standards.

Patients with samples that did not meet predefined assay acceptance criteria or that had values below the LLOQ were excluded. Patients who did not provide either a baseline or a postbaseline blood sample were included in the undetermined biomarker group. Before all statistical analyses, biomarker values were log-transformed to normalize data. In both studies, PFS time was defined as the number of days from randomization until disease progression (per RECIST) <xref rid="pone.0108048-Therasse1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> or death.

Twenty-four patients had undetermined biomarker status because of missing samples at baseline and/or after 3 weeks of treatment. Demographics and baseline characteristics of these patients were similar to those for patients with known biomarker status, although more patients in the undetermined group had adenocarcinoma histology (88%) than in the &#x02265;2.2-fold change (72%) and &#x0003c;2.2-fold change (68%) groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0108048-t001">

OS and PFS for patients with undetermined biomarker status was within the range of data reported for the two PLGF fold-change groups (<bold>Figure S1</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). Notably, the association between fold-change in PLGF and PFS and OS remained when patients with undetermined biomarker status were included in either the &#x02265;2.2-fold PLGF change group or the &#x0003c;2.2-fold change group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.038 and 0.013, respectively). Moreover, the association between fold-change in PLGF as a continuous covariate and OS remained when Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for the baseline covariates of age, ethnicity, sex, disease stage, ECOG status, histology (adenocarcinoma vs other), and weight loss before therapy. Finally, change in PLGF from baseline at week 4 in Arm A was associated with outcomes independently of exposure to motesanib. The area under the ROC curve for fold-change in PLGF was 0.726 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37). When predicting 1-year survival based on a PLGF increase of 2.2-fold, the sensitivity was 74% and the specificity was 66% (<bold>Figure S2</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). In contrast to the area under the ROC curve for fold-change in PLGF, the areas under the ROC curves for the 1-hour and 24-hour exposure to motesanib were 0.525 and 0.426, respectively (<bold>Figure S3</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). The association between fold-change in PLGF and OS remained when motesanib 1-hour and 24-hour exposures were included in the Cox proportional hazards models. In any combination of PLGF, 1-hour, or 24-hour exposure terms, exposure never had an association with survival and PLGF was always had the strongest association (<bold>Table S1</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). Finally, permutation testing was performed in which the outcome was reordered with respect to fold-change in PLGF. Using a total of 10,000 permutations of the data set, the original finding remained (empirical <italic>P</italic> value of 0.045).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Biomarker Hypothesis (MONET1 Study)</title><p>As described in the Introduction, a robust body of evidence, including results from the phase 2 study of motesanib in NSCLC, suggested that change in PLGF from baseline occurring early in treatment was associated with response to motesanib. Consequently, a prospective hypothesis was formed that those patients who achieved a &#x02265;2-fold increase in PLGF from baseline after the first 3 weeks of motesanib treatment would have a survival advantage over those patients whose response was below this cut-off. After gaining agreement from US regulatory authorities, the protocol of the MONET1 phase 3 study of motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel was amended to prospectively evaluate PLGF as a biomarker in patients with nonsquamous histology. Specifically, the primary objective of the biomarker analysis was to assess whether improved OS was associated with increased log-transformed PLGF fold-change at week 4. Conditional on a significant association between OS and the PLGF fold change, PLGF was to be evaluated as a binary variable with a cut-off point of a 2.0-fold change in PLGF from baseline. The 2.0-fold threshold was determined based on the analysis of the phase 2 study biomarker data <xref rid="pone.0108048-Blumenschein2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, which used a cutpoint of 2.2-fold. The threshold value of 2.0-fold was chosen because it is an even number that was within the range identified in the phase 2 study. It should be noted that there were no patient values between 2.0-fold and 2.2-fold (the midpoint between the two existing patient values).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Companion Diagnostic Test</title><p>Consistent with most biomarker studies, our phase 1 and 2 studies used a laboratory-developed MSD assay to evaluate PLGF. The ARCHITECT platform was used for evaluation of PLGF in the phase 3 study because of its potential as a companion diagnostic. The ARCHITECT assay was highly concordant with the MSD assay (<bold>Table S2</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). When serum samples from the phase 2 study were retested on the ARCHITECT system, the Lin concordance correlation <xref rid="pone.0108048-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> (rho) was 0.807 and the Pearson correlation (r) was 0.835. To ensure the broadest applicability of the assay, circulating PLGF was evaluated in plasma samples in the phase 3 study. Concordance between the MSD and ARCHITECT assays was confirmed in both serum and plasma (rho and r; <bold>Figure S4</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>). When phase 2 plasma samples were retested using the MSD assay, the association between fold-change in PLGF and outcomes was reaffirmed. Similarly, when samples from the phase 2 study were retested on the ARCHITECT platform, the correlation to PFS and OS was reaffirmed (<bold>Figure S4</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Biomarker Results From the Phase 3 Study</title><p>The primary analysis of the MONET1 study did not show a statistically significant improvement in OS (the primary endpoint) with motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel treatment, compared with placebo, in either nonsquamous patients (median OS, 13.0 vs 11.0 months; HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.78&#x02013;1.04; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.14) or the adenocarcinoma subset (13.5 vs 11.0 months, respectively; HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.75&#x02013;1.03; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.11) <xref rid="pone.0108048-Scagliotti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Consistent with this hypothesis, results from several motesanib studies suggested that change from baseline in PLGF may be associated with tumor regression and PFS <xref rid="pone.0108048-Rosen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. As described in this report, the pharmacodynamic PLGF response to motesanib treatment was confirmed in a phase 2 study in patients with NSCLC. Taken together, these data indicated that the PLGF response was not tumor type-specific and that associations with outcomes, although not always significant, could be seen across tumor types.</p><p>Although these results provided promising evidence in support of PLGF as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker for motesanib treatment (particularly in patients with NSCLC), they had certain limitations. The data were derived from small phase 1 and 2 studies that were not prospectively designed for biomarker discovery, the biomarker ascertainment rate was not always high, and analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing. Consequently, we employed several different approaches to assess the robustness of results from the phase 2 study in NSCLC. The association between fold-change in PLGF and OS remained when Cox proportional hazards models were adjusted for baseline covariates and when motesanib exposure was included in the model. Additionally, to account for the possibility that the approximately one third of patients who were unevaluable for PLGF influenced the outcome, we performed an analysis in which these patients were included in either the &#x02265;2.2-fold or &#x0003c;2.2-fold&#x02013;change groups; in both instances, the association with OS remained. Finally, in permutation simulations in which the outcome was shuffled with respect to PLGF, the association with OS remained (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.045). Of interest, although PLGF was confirmed to be a pharmacodynamic biomarker, drug exposure did not predict response (<bold>Figure S3</bold> in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0108048.s001">Appendix S1</xref></bold>), suggesting that PLGF response to motesanib was a better indicator of clinical response than exposure to the drug.</p><p>Although the data from the phase 2 NSCLC study were intriguing, it was clear that the hypothesis of PLGF being a pharmacodynamic biomarker that predicts outcome in patients with NSCLC who receive motesanib would require further testing. Ideally, this would occur in a larger prospective validation study specifically designed to validate a predictive pharmacodynamic response biomarker <xref rid="pone.0108048-Freidlin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Such a study might have employed a run-in design, in which motesanib was administered to all patients then, after stratification by change in PLGF, patients would be randomized to either continue or discontinue treatment with motesanib. However, when the PLGF biomarker hypothesis for motesanib emerged, the large international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled MONET1 study of motesanib plus carboplatin/paclitaxel in patients with NSCLC was already actively enrolling <xref rid="pone.0108048-Scagliotti1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Although MONET1 was initially designed only to evaluate the efficacy of motesanib compared with placebo, it provided an important opportunity, given the PLGF data available at the time, to add biomarker testing as a secondary endpoint to a large phase 3 study, even though MONET1 was nearing the end of its enrollment period at that time. The approach required numerous challenges to be overcome in a short period of time. The protocol amendement had to consider where the biomarker endpoint(s) should be placed in the context of the other endpoints and how statistical analysis of these endpoints will be approached. Some studies split alpha between the secondary endpoints, giving equal weight to each <xref rid="pone.0108048-Hung1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Other studies (including MONET1) use a sequential testing of the secondary endpoints. In the case of MONET1, the study protocol amendment was discussed with both drug and diagnostics divisons of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Its approval through the FDA&#x02019;s Special Protocol Assessment; agreement with the FDA on assay performance and testing; and development of an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assay that was reliable, robust, and easily implemented in a clinical setting <xref rid="pone.0108048-Metcalfe1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, all had to take place before the event trigger for the primary analysis. Development of the IVD assay also necessitated validation of the phase 2 PLGF results using the follow-on ARCHITECT assay system to ensure that the association between fold-change in PLGF and OS remained when using the new companion diagnostic.</p><p>Ultimately, the MONET1 study did not confirm change in PLGF as a prognostic biomarker for motesanib. It is reasonable to speculate that, despite analysis of all known covariates, the dataset from the phase 2 study had unidentified confounders that unknowingly introduced bias towards a positive identification of change in PLGF as a potential predictive pharmacodynamic effect, a possibility which has been identified as a potential problem in small biomarker-derived subgroups <xref rid="pone.0108048-Korn1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Other challenges may have contributed to the outcome. While the sample ascertainment rate for paired biomarker samples that were used to compute PLGF change was high (69%), it may not be representative of the entire study. Initial studies had shown a pharmacodynamic effect as early as 24 hours after the first dose of motesanib <xref rid="pone.0108048-Bass2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, but the earliest evaluation of PLGF in the phase 3 NSCLC studies was after 3 weeks of treatment (a time point selected prior to formation of the biomarker hypothesis, at the time of study design). Although this time point was the same as that used in the phase 2 study, the possibility that earlier timepoints might be significantly associated with survival could not be evaluated. Furthermore, subgroups defined according to postrandomization characteristics are more prone to biases compared with those based on baseline characteristics. Identification of high PLGF responders before randomization was not possible and, as observed in both the phase 2 and 3 studies, placebo patients did not have PLGF increases beyond random temporal variation. Finally, although extensive efforts were made to ensure concordance between the MSD and ARCHITECT assays, it is possible that use of a different PLGF assay may have contributed to the outcome. Each of these obstacles highlights the difficulty in assessing the predictive utility of biomarkers.</p><p>Despite the outcome of the MONET1 biomarker analysis, we believe that adding biomarker testing as a secondary endpoint to an ongoing phase 3 study represented a timely and scientifically robust approach that also illustrates the challenges involved in biomarker development in an oncology setting. In particular, evidence for a biomarker typically does not appear early in the drug development process (except when the biomarker is very closely linked to the therapeutic target); instead, it usually emerges during phase 2 evaluation <xref rid="pone.0108048-Freidlin1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and often after a phase 3 study has been initiated. In our case, the PLGF biomarker hypothesis was developed in early-phase testing, with analysis of the phase 2 data occurring while a phase 3 study was ongoing. Consequently, the PLGF hypothesis was added to the phase 3 study following interactions with the FDA. While the option of assessing PLGF as a predictive pharmacodynamic biomarker for motesanib in a larger, independent phase 2 study first represented a scientifically ideal approach, it would have resulted in significant delays in evaluating the hypothesis with no guarantee of a positive outcome. Potentially, a confirmatory prospective run-in design trial (as described above) may have been considered had the PLGF biomarker hypothesis been confirmed in MONET1.</p><p>It has been suggested that less than 1% of published cancer biomarkers are routinely used in the clinical setting <xref rid="pone.0108048-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Factors identified as contributing to failure to translate biomarkers into the clinic include lack of clinical practicality of the biomarker, hidden biases within the data, an inadequate assay, inappropriate statistical techniques, and lack of biologic plausibility for the biomarker <xref rid="pone.0108048-Kern1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Although we were not successful in developing a predictive biomarker for motesanib in NSCLC our approach adequately addressed these factors. Biomarker identification was included in early-phase studies, we developed adequate statistical techniques, a robust diagnostic test to evaluate PLGF, and engaged early with the US FDA to gain support for our protocol amendment. However, using a pharmacodynamic biomarker as a predictor of efficacy remains an unproven approach. Such biomarkers have typically only been used to identify toxicity issues <xref rid="pone.0108048-US1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> and there is no precedent that could have guided the development of the biomarker portion of our study.</p><p>Our experience illustrates several significant challenges to develop predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers in oncology. Ideal approaches calling for specific study designs and/or sequences of events should be applied wherever possible in an effort to maximize the chances of success; however, they seldom reflect the unpredictable scenarios that may unfold during drug development. Furthermore, a methodical, no-risk approach must be balanced against economic factors and the desire to rapidly identify patient populations that may benefit the most from a potential new treatment. Despite these challenges, it remains important to develop biomarker hypotheses and to subject them to objective evaluation in clinical studies. Development of predictive pharmacodynamic biomarkers remains an opportunity to markedly improve outcomes for patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0108048.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
