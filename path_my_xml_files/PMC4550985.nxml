</p><p>Detailed information on cost for AREDS formulation (for category 3 and 4 AMD patients), ranibizumab, bevacizumab, aflibercept, injection procedure cost, consultation costs, and diagnostics costs (for wet AMD) were obtained from Tan Tock Seng Hospital Eye Centre and the National Healthcare Group Pharmacy Department.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness of AREDS formulation was estimated by computing the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted for the 5 years study period. DALY is calculated as the sum of the years of life lost due to disability (YLD) and the years of life lost (YLL) due to premature death (DALY = YLD + YLL). The DALY scale ranges from 0 (perfect health) to 1 (dead).</p><p>Years of life lost due to disability = disability weight associated with wet AMD X number of people with wet AMD X number of years lived with wet AMD during the course of the 5 years study period.</p><p>The disability weight associated with wet AMD was 0.22/year of life lived with wet AMD for patients within our study age group.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Years of life lost = reduced life expectancy due to mortality attributed to the disease (legal blindness due to wet AMD).</p><p>Since no local data were available for the life expectancy of wet AMD patients, we assumed that patients with wet AMD dying during the 5 years study period had negligible loss of life due to premature death associated with wet AMD-related causes like vision loss. We do acknowledge that in reality, this might not be the case.</p><p>Although utility values for AMD in Singapore were available from a publication,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] the authors had concluded that these health status utilities may not be sufficiently robust for healthcare economic analyses. In addition, applying utility values from other studies conducted in Caucasian populations might not accurately represent the disease burden to the society in Singapore.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Hence, we opted to use the &#x0201c;cost per DALY averted&#x0201d; measure to determine cost-effectiveness rather than the utility value based &#x0201c;cost per Quality Adjusted Life Year (QALY) saved.&#x0201d; The analysis was carried out from the providers&#x02019; perspective, and all costs were presented in Singapore dollars (1 SGD &#x02248; 0.80 USD as on September 2014). The costs were discounted at an annual rate of 3%.</p><p>Our CEA model had several assumptions; there was no dropout of patients for the 5 years of follow-up although mortality was incorporated into the model; patients were fully compliant with prescribed treatment; proportion of category 3 and 4 AMD patients and progression rates were similar to the reported proportions from the AREDS report; treatment for wet AMD with ranibizumab was similar to that reported in the CATT 1 and 2 years study as well as the HORIZON study for post-2 years follow-up and treatment with aflibercept was similar to the regimen in the VIEW I and II trials; and finally, cost of consultation, treatment and diagnostic investigations did not change during the 5 years of follow-up.

Our study shows that prescribing AREDS formulation to category 3 and 4 AMD patients is extremely cost-effective in preventing progression to wet AMD for Singaporean patients.</p><p>With an aging population, the number of AMD cases in Singapore is going to increase with time. The burden of AMD on the society is tremendous. Brown <italic>et al.</italic> showed that mild AMD caused a 17% decrease in the quality of life of the average patient, which is similar to that encountered with moderate cardiac angina or symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus syndrome; Moderate AMD caused a 32% decrease in the average patient's quality of life, comparable to severe cardiac angina or a fractured hip. Severe AMD caused a 53% decrease in quality, which is more than that of renal hemodialysis. Very severe AMD caused a 60% decrease in the average AMD patient's quality of life, similar to that encountered with end-stage prostate cancer or a catastrophic stroke.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>The economic burden of AMD is also high. A study conducted by Rein <italic>et al.</italic> in the US showed that the direct medical cost for treating AMD in patients 40 years and older was $575 million for calendar year 2004.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Another study conducted by Garattini <italic>et al.</italic> in Italy found the direct cost to the hospital's ophthalmology department to be, on average, &#x020ac; 383 (~509 USD) per AMD patient per year, with cost being the highest for patients with wet AMD.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Thus preventing progression to wet AMD will not only benefit the patient in terms of quality of life, but also the healthcare provider by reducing the direct costs associated with wet AMD.</p><p>To date, two studies reported the cost-effectiveness of anti-oxidant vitamins in preventing the progression to wet AMD. Hopley conducted an economic evaluation of screening for early AMD followed by prophylactic treatment with vitamins for patients who were diagnosed with the disease.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This study showed that the cost per QALY gained was &#x000a3; 22,700 (~35,185 USD). Another study conducted by Rein <italic>et al.</italic> showed that the cost per QALY gained for anti-oxidant treatment versus no treatment was USD$21,387.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Based on the accepted threshold value for the &#x0201c;willingness to pay&#x0201d; to gain a QALY, both studies concluded that it was cost-effective to prescribe anti-oxidant vitamins to early AMD patients.</p><p>In our study, we used the cost per DALY averted measure to determine cost-effectiveness. Although utility values associated with AMD were available in the local setting, the authors concluded that they were not suitable to be used for health economic evaluations.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Hence, we used reported disability weights to compute the number of DALYs for patients receiving ARED formulation versus placebo. The accepted threshold for cost-effectiveness set by the WHO is 1&#x02013;3 times the GDP per-capita.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Our results fall well within the WHO stated range, suggesting it is cost-effective to prescribe anti-oxidant vitamins and zinc to category 3 and 4 AMD patients from Singapore.</p><p>In our study, we noted that AREDS formulation followed by ranibizumab was cost-effective compared to placebo-ranibizumab while the reverse was true for bevacizumab. The reason for this is the high-cost difference between the two drugs (almost 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the price assuming no dose titrations are done). However, sensitivity analysis showed that the results for bevacizumab were inconclusive. A meta-analysis and systematic review conducted by Schmucker <italic>et al.</italic> showed that bevacizumab was associated with an increased risk of ocular and multiple systemic adverse events compared to ranibizumab for the treatment of wet AMD.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] The CATT trial[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed a statistically significant higher rate of gastrointestinal adverse events for bevacizumab treated patients compared to ranibizumab treated patients. Although there are significant cost differences between bevacizumab and ranibizumab, this may perhaps be mitigated if adverse event rates for the different drugs are taken into consideration. This would be hampered, however, by a paucity of data regarding the comparative safety of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatments currently.</p><p>We acknowledge that our study suffers from several limitations. First, since no progression rates were available for Singaporean patients, we applied rates from the AREDS report to the local Singaporean context. However, in order to test our model assumptions, we did conduct a sensitivity analysis by varying the progression rates based on treatment with AREDS formulation versus placebo. Second, our model accounted for only the prevalent cases of AMD and not the incident cases as no local incidence data were available. Third, we assumed that compliance to treatment for anti-oxidant vitamins as well as anti-VEGF treatment was 100%. This might not be the case in the real world scenario. The disability weight associated with wet AMD was not available from local literature and hence we used the weight of 0.22, obtained from a foreign study, to compute the YLD in the DALY calculation.</p><p>A study conducted by Bandello <italic>et al.</italic> suggested that on average, 2 years of life are lost due to premature death associated with consequences of developing wet AMD.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] As ours was a hypothetical cohort study, we had no way to estimate the YLL in our study population. Had we assumed that all cases of wet AMD dying during the study period died due to wet AMD-related causes, and that on average each patient that had died had lost 2 years of life due to premature death (maximum possible YLL for our cohort), our CEA results would still hold true. In reality, the YLL would lie between 0 and this maximum number, but as no local data are available at this point in time, we assumed YLL to be zero. Nevertheless, any value of YLL for our study period, lying between 0 and the maximum, based on Bandello <italic>et al.</italic>&#x02019;s estimate mentioned above, would not have impacted our CEA results (data not shown).</p><p>Our study provides evidence of the effectiveness of AREDS formulation for patients with intermediate AMD. These results will help physicians make an informed decision on the treatment options for intermediate and wet AMD in Singapore. This study forms the basis for an in-depth analysis of AREDS treatment for prophylaxis use among a cohort of patients in the real world setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prophylactic treatment with AREDS formulation for category 3 and 4 AMD patients from Singapore is cost-effective in preventing progression to wet AMD.
