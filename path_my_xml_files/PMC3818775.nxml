mobilization with movement (MWM) influences pain and physical function of patients with
degenerative osteoarthritis. [Subjects] Thirty patients diagnosed with degenerative
osteoarthritis were divided into an experimental group (n=15), and a control group (n=15).
[Methods] The experimental group was treated with general physical therapy, trunk
stabilization exercises, and performed the MWM using the Mulligan technique. The control
group was treated with general physical therapy, and then performed trunk stabilization
exercises. [Results] Statistically significant differences were found after the
intervention in the experimental group in the visual analog scale and Western Ontario and
McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index pain, stiffening, and physical function scores.
[Conclusion] We consider the treatment of degenerative osteoarthritis patients using the
MWM technique is effective for reducing pain and improving physical functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>MWM</kwd><kwd>Knee</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Humans repeat transfer activities such as walking and running to manage their daily lives.
Identifying the transfer activities of humans in mechanical terms is necessary to understand
neuromuscular control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, the
knee joint plays an important role in walking and other transfer activities.</p><p>The recent increase in human life expectancy resulting from scientific and medical advances
has increased elderly populations, which has, in turn, caused a higher incidence of
degenerative diseases. In particular, chronic degenerative osteoarthritis, which is one of
several musculoskeletal diseases, has become a leading geriatric disease with a high
prevalence. Degenerative osteoarthritis is emerging as an important area of interest as it
creates a number of obstacles to elderly peoples' daily lives and physical activities,
thereby lowering their quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Degenerative osteoarthritis can be accompanied by joint pain, joint dysfunction,
stiffening, pressure pain, joint hypertrophy, and muscle weakening. In addition, it
gradually limits the range of motion (ROM) and reduces functional activities of the knee
joint<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Both drug-based and a variety of non-drug treatments are used to treat degenerative
osteoarthritis. Drug treatments are effective at pain reduction and symptom improvement, but
carry the risks of side effects and drug overdose. Non-drug treatments include physical
therapies such as electrotherapy, hyperthermia, phototherapy, exercise therapy, and manual
therapy. These treatments reduce patients' reliance on drugs and pain, and improve muscular
endurance, coordination, and muscular strength<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Mulligan techniques are a kind of manual therapy for spinal or upper and lower extremity
pain which use NAG (Natural Apophyseal Glide), SNAG (Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glide), or
MWM (Mobilization with Movement) techniques.</p><p>Mulligan techniques do not cause patients pain and have no side effects. These techniques
are also not physically intensive for therapists to practice due to their use of belts and
patients' voluntary movements. Moreover, they are easy to learn, which makes them useful for
clinical applications. If applied properly, they have some effect on various types of pain.
However, most studies of Mulligan techniques have investigated their effect on diseases of
the lumbar and thoracic regions. In this study, aimed to identify how the application of the
MWM Mulligan technique influences pain and physical function of patients with degenerative
osteoarthritis when walking.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects (Mean &#x000b1; SD)</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group (n=15)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=15)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.13 &#x000b1; 7.376</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.20 &#x000b1; 8.62</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.13 &#x000b1; 10.59</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60.07 &#x000b1; 13.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">159.33 &#x000b1; 9.88</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">156.13 &#x000b1; 10.12</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of symptoms (months)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44.80 &#x000b1; 32.35</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.73 &#x000b1; 40.64</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male / female)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (26.7) / 11 (73.3)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (26.7) / 11 (73.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Affected side (left / right)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (53.3) / 7 (46.7)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (40) / 9 (60)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>This study selected 30 outpatients visiting the J orthopedic hospital, who had been
diagnosed with degenerative joint arthritis by orthopedists, based on radiographic
findings. This study's purpose and test method were fully explained to potential subjects
and those who volunteered to participate were included (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The subjects were measured before the treatment commenced and again six weeks afterwards.
The experimental group was treated with hot packs for 10 minutes, interferential current
therapy for 20 minutes, and ultrasound therapy for 5 minutes. Upon completion of this
treatment, the group performed trunk stabilization exercises and then received MWM using
Mulligan techniques. The control group was treated with general physical therapy, and then
performed trunk stabilization exercises. Both groups received their treatment three times
a week over a six-week period. The subjects did not limit their daily movements or usual
occupational activities until the end of the treatment, and were instructed not to receive
any treatments other than MWM during the experimental period.</p><p>In the trunk stabilization exercise program, subjects lay prone and lifted both legs
through cross extension without knee flexion. The patient then repeated the motion of
maintaining the earlier condition for 10 seconds at an extent that caused no pain, and
then lowered the legs ten times. The exercise program consisted of three sessions and a
30-second break was provided between each session. During the exercise, the therapist
fixed the patient's lumbar region to prevent corresponding activities of the upper
extremities.</p><p>The MWM technique is a manual therapy that combines active physiological exercises
generated by the motions of patients. In this technique, small vibrations, compression,
and stretching are applied to the end points of the affected body region without causing
pain. In addition, these techniques are practiced in a direction that causes no pain.</p><p>The technique is now recognized in manual therapy worldwide. In this study, the therapist
first placed each patient's leg on the affected side on a 30&#x02005;cm high table. After
positioning himself or herself behind the patient, the therapist held the patient's lower
leg with both hands and rotated the tibia inward upon the thigh while the patient flexed
his/her knee. The patient was then instructed to perform the motion of knee flexion ten
times.</p><p>The present study's program was performed within a range that caused no pain. The
subjects repeated the motion of knee joint gliding without pain. The program consisted of
three sessions and after the end of each session, a 30-second break was provided.</p><p>The degree of pain was scored between a minimum of 0&#x02005;mm and a maximum of 100&#x02005;mm on a
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The subjects marked their own scores before the treatment
began and again six weeks after the treatment had been completed. A VAS score closer to
0&#x02005;mm denotes a lower level of pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) measures
specific diseases, personal health management, and physical conditions. It is a clinically
important functional evaluation tool in terms of pain, stiffening, and physical function
of patients with osteoarthritis and coxarthritis. This index consists of 24 categories (5
categories for pain, 2 categories for stiffening, and 17 categories for physical
function), and its assessment can be completed within 5 minutes.</p><p>The WOMAC is used for the functional evaluation of osteoarthritis and coxarthritis
throughout the world. It is a tool for identifying clinically important changes in the
physical conditions of osteoarthritis and coxarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This tool can evaluate disorders exhibited by patients with
osteoarthritis and coxarthritis during their physical activities in daily life, based on
the categories of joint pain, stiffening, and physical function.</p><p>In this study, the Korean-WOMAC, which was modified to suit the evaluation of Koreans,
was employed. The Korean-WOMAC is also divided into the subcategories of pain, stiffening,
and physical function, and is based on a 5-point scale (none, a little bit, normal,
serious, very serious).</p><p>SPSS for Windows (Version 20.0) was used to statistically analyze the data. Differences
in the general characteristics of the subjects were analyzed by performing the independent
samples t-test. In order to examine differences in the effects of the intervention between
the experimental and control groups, the independent samples t-test and paired t-tests
were performed. The statistical significance level was chosen as 0.05<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of the VAS and K-WOMAC of the control group at the

therapy, trunk stabilization exercises, and MWM using Mulligan techniques and a control
group that received only general therapy and trunk stabilization exercises. Each group
consisted of 15 subjects, and over a six-week period, three treatment sessions were
conducted weekly. During the practice of the manual therapy on the knee joint, changes in
the patients' pain, stiffening, and physical functions were evaluated.</p><p>Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis that causes disabilities or problems in
elderly populations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Women have a higher
incidence of degenerative osteoarthritis than men. In addition, if the condition is
untreated, it increases the risk, as patients age, of their being injured in falls which, in
turn, decreases human life expectancy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
While degenerative osteoarthritis has not clearly been defined to date, it is a disease that
exhibits local degenerative changes due to the physical activities that place repetitive or
large loads on the articular cartilage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As people age, they experience functional deterioration and weakening of their body parts.
Likewise, the articular cartilage exhibits limited regenerative abilities and degeneration
with aging. A study which performed radiographic tests on groups of various ages reported
that about 80% of the population aged 60 or older, and about 95% of the population aged 75
or older exhibit symptoms of degenerative osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The degrees of pain and functional disorders caused by degenerative osteoarthritis are
highly complicated and their clinical mechanism has not been firmly established. However,
some researchers have put forward a plausible biomechanical regarding the mechanism of the
occurrence of pain due to degenerative osteoarthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Degenerative
osteoarthritis is a chronic disease that progresses over a long period of time. Therefore,
pain becomes an indicator of degenerative osteoarthritis and the treatment of the condition
is focused on reducing pain rather than dealing with the progress of arthritis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A complete recovery from degenerative osteoarthritis is difficult and the prevention of its
pathological progress is often problematic. Thus, the purpose of its treatment should be the
inhibition of the causes of degenerative osteoarthritis, pain reduction, and improvement in
physical function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study noted that
the purpose of treating degenerative osteoarthritis patients is to maintain the best
possible physical function and reduce pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among joint diseases that damage the articular cartilage due to
aging or weight-bearing during walking, degenerative osteoarthritis frequently occurs in
elderly populations. It is also considered a key disease that causes physical
dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The goal of treatment for degenerative osteoarthritis patients is to control pain, minimize
the side effects of treatments, and improve patients' knee joint functions and quality of
life. Patients also need to be educated to control loads on the knee joint, through changes
in life patterns, exercises, control of physical activities, and weight loss. In this study,
MWM using Mulligan techniques, which were implemented while the patients placed their knee
joint on the affected side on a 30&#x02005;cm high table, is similar to the motions of lunge and a
single limb squat. These motions are closed chain exercises as well as functional exercises
for the knee joint, and thus, are frequently used in lower-extremity rehabilitation
exercises<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A study by Fisher<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that, after
the implementation of muscular function improvement exercises for degenerative
osteoarthritis patients for 16 weeks, the patients showed reductions of 40%, 10%, and 30% in
pain, reliance, and dysfunction, respectively. Previous studies related to degenerative
osteoarthritis have reported that manual therapy MWM is an effective treatment for pain and
physical dysfunction caused by degenerative osteoarthritis. A comparison of the experimental
and control groups of the present study revealed that the experimental group showed greater
improvements in both pain and physical function. Damage of the joints causes pain and
limitation of motion (LOM) due to sprain of soft tissues. Pain and LOM cause more damage to
the joint. Joint control of MWM can reduce the emission of noxious stimuli from a damaged
joint, and when pain is reduced, LOM is also reduced leading to improvement in physical
function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, regarding Mulligan Technique MWM was verified as effective at
ameliorating pain and physical dysfunction caused by degenerative osteoarthritis. Therefore,
MWM can be suggested as an effective treatment for relieving pain and physical functions in
degenerative osteoarthritis patients.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the small number of subjects, which makes it difficult to
make generalizations of the findings, and the selection of subjects within a limited
geographical area, which precludes comparison with other regions. In addition, the effects
of subjects' physical characteristics, life patterns and personal post-treatment exercises
could not be entirely controlled. Therefore, further research is necessary investigation the
MWM technique for other diseases and body regions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Dingwell</surname><given-names>JB</given-names></name><name><surname>Cusumano</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Nonlinear time series analysis of normal and pathological
