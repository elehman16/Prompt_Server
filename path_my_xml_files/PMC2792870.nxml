Ten participating advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) completed online knowledge and self-efficacy measures pre-onsite training and twice more after completing a continuing education program. Patient participants self-refer in response to study recruitment brochures and posters. Twenty-four participants from each APRN practice (total <italic>N</italic> = 240) are randomly assigned by the PEP-NG software to either control (data collection and four routine APRN visits) or tailored intervention (PEP-NG interface and four focused APRN visits) conditions. Patients access the PEP-NG interface via wireless tablet and use a stylus to answer demographic, knowledge, and self-efficacy questions as well as prescription and over-the-counter self-medication practice questions. The PEP-NG analyzes patient-reported information and delivers tailored educational content. Patients&#x02019; outcome measures are self-reported antihypertensive medication adherence, blood pressure, knowledge and self-efficacy concerning potential adverse self-medication practices, adverse self-medication behavior &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d; score and satisfaction with the PEP-NG and APRN provider relationship. APRN outcome measures are knowledge and self-efficacy concerning adverse self-medication practices, self-efficacy for communicating with older adults and satisfaction with the PEP-NG. Time&#x02013;motion and cost&#x02013;benefit analyses will be conducted.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hypertension</kwd><kwd>self-medication</kwd><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>tailored intervention</kwd><kwd>computer-based education</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Despite frequent primary care visits, adults over the age of 60 years often do not achieve target blood pressure (BP) readings (&#x0003c;140/90; &#x0003c;130/80 for those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-3-323">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ppa-3-323">5</xref> An estimated $100 billion is spent annually in the United States on health care for patients with poorly controlled BP in part due to poor antihypertensive medication adherence and other adverse self-medication behaviors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-3-323">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-3-323">10</xref> Failure of the health care system to identify and remediate poor adherence and adverse self-medication behaviors adds to the overall cost of treatment as providers typically intensify antihypertensive therapy and add additional agents to the regimen which further increases the risk of adverse drug side effects as well as cost.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ppa-3-323">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ppa-3-323">12</xref></p><p>Recent trials aimed at improving patient adherence to antihypertensive therapy have yet to demonstrate large long-term improvements in either adherence or health outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-ppa-3-323">13</xref> Intensive and frequent (monthly) counseling can greatly improve antihypertensive adherence, but adherence declines to baseline when the intervention is removed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ppa-3-323">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ppa-3-323">16</xref> Patient adherence to antihypertensives has been shown to be greatest five days prior and five days after health care visit and usually declines within 30 days to typify the so called &#x0201c;white coat adherence.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ppa-3-323">7</xref></p><p>Inadequate patient education about adherence and safe medication use contributes to preventable adverse drug events.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-3-323">6</xref> Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, supplements, and alcohol can interact with antihypertensives and contribute to poor BP control.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ppa-3-323">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ppa-3-323">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ppa-3-323">17</xref> For example, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS such as ibuprofen) increase BP and antagonize the efficacy of antihypertensives and the anti-platelet effects of low-dose aspirin when taken concurrently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ppa-3-323">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ppa-3-323">20</xref> Many patients choose inappropriate OTC analgesics such as NSAIDs to self-medicate pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ppa-3-323">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ppa-3-323">22</xref> In separate surveys of English- and Spanish-speaking older adults with hypertension, more than 85% reported two or more adverse self-medication practices.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ppa-3-323">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ppa-3-323">22</xref> Older adults with hypertension also had large knowledge deficits regarding conflicts between prescription and OTC agents, as well as low confidence in their ability to avoid these conflicts.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ppa-3-323">23</xref> Addressing adverse self-medication practices is one step toward reducing the risk of potential adverse drug interactions (PADI).</p><p>A personal computer (PC)-based interactive Personal Education Program (PEP) was effective in improving knowledge and self-efficacy in addition to reducing adverse self-medication practices in older adults with hypertension.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ppa-3-323">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ppa-3-323">25</xref> The PEP was upgraded to the &#x0201c;next generation&#x0201d; PEP (PEP-NG), a web-based program accessed wirelessly.

The PEP-NG analyzes patient-entered information and delivers tailored educational content. A rules engine selects and addresses three adverse self-medication behaviors (with the highest risk scores) and offers the following: 1) &#x0201c;medicine facts;&#x0201d; 2) animations that illustrate the consequences of the adverse behaviors identified; 3) &#x0201c;what you can do&#x0201d; corrective strategies; and 4) realistic scenarios that allow the user to practice the information learned.</p><p>The PEP-NG prints summaries for both the patient and provider of patient-reported symptoms, medication use (including frequency/time), adverse self-medication behaviors (along with a thumbnail illustration) and corrective strategies. Prior to the patient-provider visit, providers enter the prescribed medication regimen and patient&#x02019;s blood pressure, age, and health literacy scores on a separate provider interface on the PEP-NG. This allows the provider to review and contrast the provider-entered data against the patient printout prior to the primary care visit. The printout also supports the provider in reinforcing guidance and oversight of adherence behaviors. The patient takes a copy of the printout home for self-study.</p><p>Trial data collected are automatically transferred to a Microsoft Access database (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) via Virtual-Private-Network, which meets or exceeds the HIPAA requirements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ppa-3-323">26</xref> and the European Union Directive 95/46/EC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ppa-3-323">27</xref> The interface was developed in accordance with ISO 9100 international standards.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ppa-3-323">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ppa-3-323">29</xref></p><p>The PEP-NG was designed through formative research and formal usability studies with advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) providers and older adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ppa-3-323">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ppa-3-323">33</xref> The text, graphic elements and animation materials are programmed with Macromedia&#x02019;s Flash ActionScript language (Adobe, San Jose, CA).

Behavior risk score did not change significantly, but the risk score was significantly correlated with systolic BP at visit 4. There was a significant decline in systolic BP (medium effect size) for the nine participants not at BP goal upon study entry.</p><p>The goal of the clinical trial is to reduce adverse self-medication practices in older adults with hypertension in active primary care settings through improved patient-provider communication about self-medication adherence and safety. Specific aims for older adults are to show that users of the PEP-NG will: 1) increase knowledge concerning potential adverse outcomes arising from self-medication practices; 2) increase self-efficacy as to how to avoid adverse self-medication practices; 3) reduce adverse self-medication behaviors; 4) improve prescription antihypertensive medication adherence; 5) achieve and maintain target blood pressure readings; 6) demonstrate satisfaction with the PEP-NG; and 7) enhance the APRN provider-patient relationship. Specific aims for APRN providers are to show that their use of the PEP-NG will: 1) increase knowledge concerning potential adverse outcomes arising from older adults&#x02019; self-medication practices; 2) increase self-efficacy for teaching older adults about adverse self-medication practices; 3) increase self-efficacy for communicating with older adults about self-medication adherence and safety; and 4) demonstrate satisfaction using the PEP-NG with clients.</p><p>In summary, the PEP-NG trial will educate both patients with hypertension and APRN providers to improve patient self-medication literacy, which will result in improved medication adherence, reduced adverse self-medication behaviors, and improved BP control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-3-323">Figure 1</xref>, increased patient self-efficacy and knowledge can increase patient health literacy. In addition, increased provider self-efficacy and conceptual knowledge will foster patient/provider communication and patient satisfaction, resulting in improved listening and speaking components of patient health literacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Design, setting, and recruitment</title><p>The study has approval from the University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and meets all HIPAA regulations. The clinical trial is in cooperation with two practice-based research networks (PBRN) in New England. APRNet is the only PBRN of APRNs and is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) through the Yale School of Nursing. The Connecticut Center for Primary Care (CCPC) is a PBRN and an independent, not-for-profit corporation established under CT law by ProHealth Physicians, Inc. The primary care practices have widely different patient demographics and practice characteristics. The practices are located in urban centers, small cities, suburbs, and rural areas; while some APRNs are salaried, others are paid by the number of patients seen.</p><p>Primary care practice owners and APRNs affiliated with each PBRN were contacted by letter inviting participation in the study. A member of the research team met with each APRN who responded with interest in learning more about the study. The APRNs received an illustrated brochure describing the study and an informed consent form and given a demonstration of the PEP-NG software. Participating practices were offered free installation of a wireless access node (meeting HIPAA requirements)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ppa-3-323">26</xref> and a second tablet PC unit (in addition to the unit used for the study) as incentives for participation. Practices associated with the PBRN networks entered the study in an ongoing basis. Ten APRNs in eight practice locations are enrolled in the study. Five other practices signed on to the study but withdrew soon after the installation of the wireless access nodes for reasons unrelated to the study (due to APRN illness, APRN job change, and practice location change).</p><p>Each participating APRN received a two-hour on-site training session with a member of the research team (who is a master&#x02019;s prepared Registered Nurse). The APRNS were given a research notebook with a step-by-step study protocol, instruments for assessing study eligibility, record sheets for documenting each visit, grocery gift cards to compensate participants for their time, and PEP-NG study appointment cards. A supply of illustrated participant recruitment brochures and posters with the APRNs&#x02019; names and practice contact information were placed in waiting rooms and examination rooms.</p><p>APRNS were offered $80 to compensate for their time during the two-hour on-site PEP-NG training. They were also offered 10 continuing education units (CEUs) for reading 10 journal articles written by the principal investigator (PI) (aimed at practitioners and related to potential adverse outcomes stemming from patients&#x02019; adverse self-medication behaviors) and subsequently completing the APRN pre- and post-training knowledge and self-efficacy surveys. APRNs were also offered $55 (to be paid to either the APRN or the practice) for each participant enrolled (up to 24 participants) to compensate for spending approximately 40 minutes per participant to: 1) ascertain study eligibility; 2) conduct the informed consent process; 3) cover the online tutorial with the patient; 4) keep receipts for participant gift cards; and 5) file recruitment reports.</p><p>Older adults self-refer for the study by calling the practice and making an appointment with the APRN. The APRN meets with the prospective participant to review the consent form (written in a 14-point Arial font at a grade 6 reading level). Participants are requested not to participate in another research study related to their health while enrolled in the current study. If the patient consents to participate, the APRN then ascertains study eligibility with the following inclusion criteria: 1) not previously involved in a PEP study; 2) aged at least 60 years (by self-report); 3) a health literacy score of at least 44 (6th grade) as measured by the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) tool;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ppa-3-323">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ppa-3-323">36</xref> 4) takes prescribed antihypertensive medication; and 5) lives independently with independent physical and cognitive functioning. The last criterion assesses patient ability to: 1) independently manage the tasks of telephone communication, shopping, travel arrangements, medication taking, and personal finances, as assessed with the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ppa-3-323">37</xref> and 2) answer six of 10 items on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ppa-3-323">38</xref> Participants also need to demonstrate a visual acuity of at least 20/100 (with corrective lenses if needed).</p><p>The APRN selects a four-digit random number from a list (provided in advance by the study) as the login ID for each participant, another for the APRN login ID, and another for the site ID. The PEP-NG system randomly assigns participants to either the control or the intervention group. Patient randomization is carried out within each APRN practice in order to eliminate any possible confounding effects due to the heterogeneity among APRNs or their practices. APRNs mail study monitoring data monthly to the PI, including the numbers of patients: 1) screened for participation; 2) met and not met study criteria; 3) enrolled; 4) dropped out of the study; and 5) experienced adverse or unexpected effects.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>APRN provider intervention</title><p>As described above, APRNs received a two-hour on-site training session. Before training, they logged on to a dedicated website to complete pre-training knowledge and self-efficacy instruments. As part of their on-site training, they logged onto the PEP-NG and proceeded through the program, trying out both the patient and provider interfaces. They were given a packet of 10 articles documenting the evidence that underlies the specific adverse medication behaviors addressed by the PEP-NG. The APRNs read these articles on their own time over the following two weeks and then logged on to the APRN PEP-NG website to complete post-training knowledge and self-efficacy instruments. The APRNs completed the post-training instruments again after enrollment of their 6th participant (typically three months later) and again after enrollment of their 12th participant (typically 6 months later).</p></sec><sec><title>Patient intervention</title><p>Each participant (from both control and intervention groups) meets with the APRN four times over three months in a private examination room at the practice site. Participants are encouraged to bring all of their medications (including supplements) to each visit. At the beginning of visit 1, the tablet is connected to its detachable keyboard and the APRN records the participant&#x02019;s age, gender, BP and health literacy score on the APRN provider screen. The APRN also enters each patient&#x02019;s prescribed and provider recommended (eg, low-dose aspirin) medications, including, dose, timing, and any special instructions for taking the medication. The APRN then removes the tablet from the keyboard and sets it on a height/angle adjustable stand designed for study use. The APRN reads a script to the participant about how to use the PEP-NG while the participant practices using the stylus to interface with the tutorial program (that includes a sample question, a medication screen, a &#x0201c;clock&#x0201d; screen, and an interactive animation screen). When the participant expresses comfort with the PEP-NG interface, the APRN leaves the patient to continue with the PEP-NG to complete a demographic questionnaire, the knowledge and self-efficacy scales, the health care relationship scale as well as answer questions about medications they take.</p><p>On subsequent visits, before asking the patient to continue with the PEP-NG unassisted, the APRN reviews patient comfort with stylus use and the PEP-NG interface. The demographic questionnaire is omitted on subsequent visits. At the beginning of visit 4, participants complete the patient PEP-NG satisfaction instrument, in addition to the other scales and questions measured during visits 1&#x02013;3. After each PEP-NG use, the participant meets with the APRN for approximately 15 minutes. The APRN takes the participant&#x02019;s blood pressure and reviews the provider interface to review/update any changes in the medication regimen.</p><p>Participants in the intervention group receive tailored education. This process is triggered by the PEP-NG&#x02019;s analysis of patient-entered data, which instantaneously generates and delivers intervention and education content tailored to the patient-reported behaviors (including the aforementioned &#x0201c;medicine facts,&#x0201d; animations dealing with the adverse behaviors identified, corrective strategies, and interactive questions that allow the user to apply information learned). A printout generated by the patient-reported data on the PEP-NG lists patient reported symptoms, three identified adverse self-medication behaviors (with the highest risk scores) and tailored corrective strategies suggested by the PEP-NG, along with a thumbnail illustration from the animations. In the case of fewer than three reported adverse behaviors, the PEP-NG delivers a set of up to three default statements dealing with medication adherence, OTC pain relievers (that can be safely taken with antihypertensives), and dangers of combining different types of pain relievers (prescription or OTC). An office assistant gives a copy of the printout to the patient and a second copy of the printout to the APRN to inform the patient visit.</p><p>Participants in the control group complete all questions via the PEP-NG, in addition to receiving a general education message and interactive animation as well as a question at the end that explains how BP medicines work and emphasizes how BP medications must be taken every day. Participants in the control group meet with the APRN for a care as usual BP visit without a printout.</p><p>Each participant in both groups is offered a $10 grocery gift card at the end of each of the first three visits and a $25 grocery gift card at the end of the 4th visit. At the end of the 4th visit, the patient is provided a card with a dedicated telephone number to call, if they wish to schedule a 20-minute post-PEP-NG qualitative interview at the practice site with a nurse from the research team. They are then given an additional $10 grocery gift card for participating in the post-trial qualitative interview. Each APRN will also be interviewed at the end of the study to elicit their experience with the PEP-NG study and will be given a $25 grocery gift card to reimburse them for their time.</p><p>Health care utilization will be compared between the control and intervention groups for a cost-benefit analysis (CBA). A time-motion study will also be conducted. The total number of provider visits, emergency room visits and hospitalizations will be tracked for 52 weeks following the participant&#x02019;s entry to the study. This data will be obtained via medical record review by the participating APRNs at the practice sites.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome is patient adverse self-medication behavior score. BP control at each visit is a secondary outcome for patients. Knowledge, self-efficacy, health care relationships, and satisfaction with the PEP-NG are secondary outcomes for both patients and APRNs. Eldercare cultural self-efficacy is a secondary outcome for APRNs.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline</title><p>The APRN records the patient&#x02019;s age (confirmed from the medical record), gender, health literacy (using the (REALM) tool)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ppa-3-323">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ppa-3-323">35</xref> and blood pressure at visit 1. All questions are prepared at a 6th grade Flesch&#x02013;Kincaid reading level<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ppa-3-323">39</xref> and appear on the screen in a 20-point Arial Black font. The patient answers demographic questions concerning living arrangements (who they live with, type of residence), education, race and ethnicity, income (eg, whether their monthly income is above or below $1,500 per month) as well as health questions about current medical problems and symptoms. The patient then completes the self-efficacy and knowledge instruments. Finally, the patient responds to questions about what they take for hypertension and for common health problems.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn2-ppa-3-323">b</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure</title><p>BP measurements are taken by the APRN at each visit - at the beginning of PEP-NG use on visit 1 and post-PEP-NG use on subsequent visits. Inadequate BP control is defined as a SBP &#x02265; 140 mm Hg or a DBP &#x02265; 90 mm Hg for patients without diabetes and SBP &#x02265; 130 mm Hg or a DBP &#x02265; 80 mm Hg for patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease according to the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-7) guidelines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-3-323">1</xref> A potential study limitation associated with this protocol is that the BP measurements are taken by the participating APRN and could be subject to observer bias. Also, since patients self-refer to the study; the percentage of participants with controlled BP may not be representative of the total patient population in the practice site.</p></sec><sec><title>Medication use</title><p>The instrument captures self-reported, patient-entered frequency and longitudinal use data on medications, supplements, and alcohol use.

The design is factorial and balanced in that each factor is crossed with the other two factors and equal numbers of participants will be in each study &#x0201c;cell&#x0201d; defined by crossing the three factors.</p><p>When data collection is completed, the analysis plan is to employ repeated measures ANOVA as the basis for statistical testing. The primary study hypothesis concerns the possibility of differential change in the PEP-NG and control conditions between the baseline and final study assessments.</p><p>From our pilot data,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ppa-3-323">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ppa-3-323">34</xref> we estimated that standardized effect sizes (d) range from 0.41 to 1.30, depending on which participant outcome measure was considered. Calculations using the smallest of these effect sizes (adverse self-medication risk score &#x02013; the primary outcome variable) were used to determine the sample size. We believe that the pre-intervention mean value of the adverse self-medication risk score will be 21.5 among participants in both the intervention and control groups. We expect that, with intervention, this mean score will decrease to 16.5 by the end of follow-up; without intervention, the mean score will remain unchanged. Using data from the preliminary studies, we assume the standard deviation of the adverse self-medication risk score will be &#x000b1;10.1 in both groups throughout follow-up. We also anticipate that the correlation between scores on individuals between the baseline and final assessments will be +0.20 or higher. Setting an objective to have 80% power to detect a difference in mean changes between groups, we determined a sample size estimate of 82 participants per group &#x02013;ie, a total of 164. However, in order to maintain balance across all 10 APRNs, this estimate implied a need to recruit a minimum of 180 participants, ie, nine per group per APRN. Anticipating the potential for 20% loss to follow-up among study participants, the final recruitment goal was set at 240 participants, ie, 12 per group per APRN, in order to have complete data on a sample of 180 participants. In a crossed and balanced design, testing results for the study&#x02019;s primary hypothesis will be asymptotically equivalent whether performed using a multi-factor model or by applying a two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test to contrast the mean levels of within-subject changes between groups. The sample size estimates were derived from formulas related to the <italic>t</italic>-test, assumed application of one-tailed testing at the 5% level of significance, and were calculated using PASS 2008 software (NCSS, LLC., Kaysville, UT).</p><p>A secondary outcome of special interest is blood pressure control. Accordingly, we also conducted power analyses relative to this variable to ensure that the sample size determined for the primary outcome would be sufficient to detect clinically meaningful differences between the intervention and control conditions in the maintenance or achievement of acceptable blood pressure levels. Based on the rates of hypertension control found by Chobanian and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ppa-3-323">1</xref> we expect to find 35% of participants with controlled blood pressure at the time of study entry. Due to randomization, the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure is expected to hold, on average, in both the intervention and control groups. During the study period, some patients&#x02019; blood pressures will move into the controlled range while other patients&#x02019; blood pressures move out of it. We expect that, in the control group, at most 30% of participants will experience a change in blood pressure control during the study period, that these changes will occur in both directions with equal probability, and that, by the end of the follow-up period, 35% of participants will have blood pressures in the controlled range (though not necessarily the same persons who had controlled blood pressure at study entry). In the intervention group, we also expect that up to 30% of participants will experience a change in blood pressure control during the study period, but that these changes will occur predominantly in the direction from the uncontrolled range to the controlled range. Under these assumptions, the sample size objective of 180 participants with complete data will provide 80% power to detect a 20% or greater increase in the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure in the intervention group relative to the control group at the end of follow-up, ie, an expected frequency of 55% or more of intervention participants with controlled blood pressure by study completion. This power analysis accounted for random variation in the percentage of participants with controlled blood pressure at study entry in both the control and intervention groups (under the assumption of an expected frequency of 35%), for systematic differences and random variation in the percentages of participants who change blood pressure control status during follow-up (under the assumption of an expected frequency of 30% or less), and for correlations due to pairing of initial and final blood pressure control assessments within participants.

It empowers older adults with hypertension with a self-management mechanism that enables them to enhance their self-efficacy in self care, which is the corner stone of improving public health. The PEP-NG offers the provider advance knowledge of a patient&#x02019;s self-medication behavior and literacy, which can be instrumental in facilitating patient&#x02013;provider communication aimed at improving medication adherence and safety. If found effective in the current clinical trial, the PEP-NG has the potential for rapid adoption in the primary care setting and become a model for other self-management and medication adherence interventions directed at other serious chronic conditions (eg, diabetes, asthma, etc) that pose the major threats to public health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to thank Christian Rauh, MS and Yan Li, PhD for creating the computer code for the PEP interface, Zoe Strickler MDes for animation design, Jonathan Gill for wireless network configuration and server support and Sheri Peabody, MS, APRN, Jessica Planas, MPH, RN, and Karen Pasquale, MPH for their assistance in site recruitment, training and monitoring.
