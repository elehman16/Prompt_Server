A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted to compare percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and calcium sulfate cement (PR+CSC) grafting with minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach and plate fixation (MISTA) for treatment of DIACFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ultimately, 80 patients with a DIACFs were randomly allocated to receive either PR+CSC (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;42) or MISTA (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;38). Functional outcomes were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot scores. Radiological results were assessed using plain radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans, and postoperative wound-related complications were also recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average time from initial injury to operation and the average operation time in the PR+CSC group were both significantly shorter than those in the MISTA group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

The good and excellent results in the two groups were comparable for Sanders Type-II calcaneal fractures, but the good to excellent rate in the MISTA group was significantly higher for Sanders Type-III fractures (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The clinical outcomes are comparable between the two minimally invasive techniques in the treatment of Sanders Type-II DIACFs. The PR+CSC grafting is superior to the MISTA in terms of the average time between initial injury and operation, operation time, wound-related complications and subtalar joint activity. However, the MISTA has its own advantages in improving the calcaneal width, providing a more clear visualization and accurate reduction of the articular surface, especially for Sanders Type-III DIACFs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn/">ChiCTRIOR16008512</ext-link>. 21 May 2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Calcaneus</kwd><kwd>Intra-articular fractures</kwd><kwd>Minimally invasive</kwd><kwd>Percutaneous fixation</kwd><kwd>Sinus tarsi approach</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zhejiang provincial medical and health technology project funding</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016KYA138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Yongzeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Zhejiang provincial traditional chinese medicine scientific research fund project</institution></funding-source><award-id>2016ZA141</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feng</surname><given-names>Yongzeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The management of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) remains challenging and controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) through an extensile lateral approach has been widely accepted and established as a standard treatment for DIACFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, a fairly high wound-related complication rate has been reported with this approach, including wound edge necrosis, dehiscence, hematoma, infection and injury to the sural nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to lower the complication rate, various minimally invasive techniques have recently been introduced, including external fixation, percutaneous fixation, arthroscopically assisted fixation, and minimal incision techniques via medial, modified lateral (such as the sinus tarsi approach), longitudinal, or combined approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These techniques have been reported as effective in minimizing soft tissue trauma, thereby reducing the incidence of wound-related complications.</p><p>As one of the most popular and effective minimally invasive techniques, the sinus tarsi approach not only can fully expose the posterior facet and the anterolateral fragment, but it also significantly reduces the incidence of postoperative wound complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In order to further shorten the operative time and decrease the wound complication rate, we introduced, in 2006, percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and calcium sulfate cement (CSC) grafting. A preliminary clinical study carried out by our team found that compared with the traditional L-shaped extensile lateral approach, this new technique allowed earlier weight-bearing, reduced subtalar joint stiffness and a reduced wound complication rate, while improving the patients&#x02019; satisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The purpose of the present study was to compare the functional and radiological outcomes and complications of our percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and CSC grafting with those of the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach and plate fixation for treatment of DIACFs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients with a Sanders Type-II or Type-III calcaneal fracture, who were the consecutive candidates for surgical treatment at our hospital from January 2009 to December 2011, were randomly allocated to either the percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and CSC grafting (the PR+CSC group) or the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach and plate fixation (the MISTA group). The patients were randomly divided into the two groups using coin tossing method. Three senior surgeons were randomly assigned to each group to perform the surgeries using either surgical method.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: 1) unilateral Sanders Type-II or Type-III intra-articular calcaneal fracture; 2) the age was greater than or equal to 18&#x000a0;years old; and 3) closed fracture. The exclusion criteria were: 1) severe medical ailments (severe vascular or neurologic injury, diabetes) or contraindications (known local or systemic infection); 2) Sanders Type-IV, bilateral or open calcaneal fractures; 3) severe and polytraumatic injuries or polytrauma of the ipsilateral lower limb when admitted; and 4) refused to accept the treatment plan. All patients agreed to participate in this clinical trial by signing an informed consent form. The study was approved by the Ethical Board Review of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University (Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China), and was performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preoperative management</title><p>All patients were evaluated using preoperative calcaneal radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans and two-dimensional reconstruction of the injured foot. The swelling of the hindfoot did not need to subside if the patients were randomly assigned to the PR+CSC group. All surgeries were performed with patients placed in the lateral decubitus position under either epidural or spinal anesthesia. Tourniquets were applied routinely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Surgical techniques</title><p>As previously described, the percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and CSC grafting procedures were briefly summarized as below [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. First, we crossed the tuberosity with a 6.5-mm Schanz pin via a stab incision to reduce the height and length of the calcaneus. Then, another 6.5-mm Schanz pin was introduced into the fragment with the displaced posterior facet and levered the compressed facet under fluoroscopic guidance. When necessary, especially in Sanders Type-III fractures, another Schanz pin was introduced percutaneously through the lateral cortex of the calcaneus to push up any remaining depressed parts of the subtalar joint surface. Once the B&#x000f6;hler&#x02019;s angle and articular surface were reduced, two Kirschner wires were inserted from the lateral side to the sustentaculum to sustain the reduced joint surface. Then another two Kirschner wires were introduced from the tuberosity to the anterior part of the calcaneus in different directions to fix the primary and secondary fracture line. After the closed reduction and provisional fixation were performed, the Kirschner wires were replaced by 6.5- and 3.5-mm cannulated screws percutaneously. Finally, the CSC (Wright Medical Technology, Arlington, TN) was then slowly and carefully injected into the bone void in the body created after the reduction under fluoroscopic guidance (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A 42-year-old female patient suffered left lateral displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture caused by a fall from a height.

Using sharp dissection, this incision was made down to the posterior subtalar joint capsule. After moderate exposure of the lateral wall of the calcaneus, we elevated the subtalar articular surface with a dedicated elevator inserted into the fracture and then a 3.5&#x000a0;mm Steinmann pin was inserted into the calcaneus tuberosity followed by longitudinally extending it to the posterior articular surface to correct the B&#x000f6;hler angle. After reduction, the Steinmann pin was driven into the anterior process of the calcaneus. After the calcaneus length, height and width, and B&#x000f6;hlers and Gissanes angles were recovered satisfactorily under C-arm fluoroscopy, the plate was inserted through the incision. Following the plate insertion, the screws were well fixed through the incision or percutaneously under C-arm fluoroscopy (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>A 38-year-old male patient suffered right lateral displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture caused by a fall from a height.

An increasing number of studies have shown a trend toward better functional outcomes in the operatively managed groups than those treated non-operatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, the high concern about wound-related complications with the extensile lateral L-shaped approach has troubled many orthopedic surgeons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The complication rate after surgical treatment has been reported to range from 11 to 25&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As one of the most widely applied minimally invasive techniques, the sinus tarsi approach has the advantage of direct visualization of the posterior articular facet and fewer wound-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In order to minimize the wound-related complications and explore the optimal treatment for DIACFs, in 2006, we introduced percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and CSC grafting for treatment of DIACFs. We reported the first clinical data using this technique to treat 90 patients with 90 DIACFs in an article published in 2011 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We found that, compared with ORIF, this minimally invasive technique allowed earlier weight bearing, reduced subtalar joint stiffness, and improved patient satisfaction. To further optimize the minimally invasive percutaneous technique in the treatment of DIACFs, in this study, we aimed to compare the functional outcomes, radiographic results and the postoperative wound-related complications between the minimally invasive percutaneous fixation and the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach.</p><p>The assessment of functional outcomes in our study revealed an overall good to excellent rate of 81.0&#x000a0;% in the PR+CSC group compared with 89.5&#x000a0;% in the MISTA group. The mean AOFAS score was 84.6 in the PR+CSC group, which was higher than that 82.5 in the MISTA group. However, both differences were not statistically significant. There was also no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the good to excellent rate for Sanders Type-II fractures. Wang YM et al. reported percutaneous reduction and Steinman pin fixation minimized complications and achieved functional outcomes comparable to those of the open techniques in patients with Sanders Type-II calcaneal fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. For Sanders Type-III fractures, however, the MISTA group could achieve better functional outcomes than the PR+CSC group. For this reason, we believed that the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach was superior to the percutaneous cannulated screw fixation in acquiring a better articular surface reduction, especially for Sanders Type-III fractures. Thus different functional outcomes may be attributed to different qualities of articular reduction. Consistently, Mulcahy et al. also suggessted that a minor residual step-off of the posterior facet could cause a significant load shift within the subtalar joint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which might have an adverse effect on functional outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, using the percutaneous reduction and cannulated screw fixation to treat comminuted calcaneal fractures may carry a risk of inadequate reduction of the articular surface.</p><p>The results analysis from the partial variables of the AOFAS scoring system suggested that patients in the PR+CSC group suffered from less pain, less activity limitations, less gait abnormality, and less demand on walking surfaces. Meanwhile, they obtained better sagittal motion and hindfoot motion than patients in the MISTA group. However, the difference was only statistically significant for two variables; sagittal motion and hindfoot motion, which suggests, compared with the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach, that percutaneous reduction and cannulated screw fixation may be more minimally invasive and favor earlier and painless functional exercise.</p><p>The radiographic results revealed the significant differences between the two groups in terms of the calcaneal width immediately postoperatively and at the final follow-up. Therefore, the role of the percutaneous reduction and cannulated screw fixation restoring the calcaneal width was weaker than the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach. Although it is known that the widened calcaneus is the main reason for patients suffering from lateral impingement syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the difference in the overall functional outcomes between the two groups was not statistically significant. Our data suggested that the reduction of the posterior articular surface might be the most important factor associated with the functional outcome of calcaneal fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The wound-healing complication rate was significantly lower in the PR+CSC group than that in the MISTA group (2.4 vs 18.4&#x000a0;%). The minimized disturbance to the blood supply and the soft tissue of the lateral aspect of the calcaneal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], coupled with the significantly shorter operative time, may have contributed to the lower rate of wound-healing complications in the PR+CSC group. Furthermore, the PR+CSC group had a lower risk of sural nerve injury and musculus peroneus brevis injury compared with the MISTA group, however, the difference was not statistically significant. Although the overall complication rate was found to be quite high in the MISTA group, most of the complications appeared in the early days. The complication rate decreased significantly as our experience improved and the waiting time to operation extended.</p><p>There are a few limitations in this study. First, we had a relatively small number of patients and short average follow-up time. Therefore, further investigation with a larger sample size and longer follow-up time is needed to obtain more overall clinical data. In addition, the differences in surgeons&#x02019; performances might have decreased the generalization power of this study. Assigning all the patients to only one surgeon would be much beneficial to reduce the variability caused by the surgeon&#x02019;s performance, but this would be practically impossible in our hospital. Furthermore, the quality of joint surface reduction was not specifically analyzed or compared between the two groups. It needs to be studied further.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The percutaneous reduction, cannulated screw fixation and CSC grafting for treatment of Sanders Type-II DIACFs can achieve almost equivalent functional outcomes compared with the minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach and plate fixation. The two techniques have their own advantages. The PR+CSC grafting is superior to the MISTA procedure in terms of the average time between initial injury and operation, operation time, wound-related complications and subtalar joint activity. However, the MISTA procedure has its own advantages in improving the calcaneal width, providing clear visualization and more accurate reduction of the articular surface, especially for Sanders Type-III DIACFs. The functional outcomes of Sanders Type-III DIACFs treated by MISTA excelled the PR+CSC grafting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AOFAS, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society; CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; CSC, calcium sulfate cement; CT, computed tomography; DIACFs, displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures; MISTA, minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach; ORIF, open reduction and internal fixation; PR, percutaneous reduction</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This research was supported by Zhejiang provincial medical and health technology project funding (No.2016KYA138) and Zhejiang provincial traditional chinese medicine scientific research fund project (No. 2016ZA141).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YF, XS, JW, and JH initiated the study design.
