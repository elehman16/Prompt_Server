rich in fruit and vegetables can prevent development of several chronic age-related diseases. However, the mechanisms behind this protective effect are not elucidated. We have tested the hypothesis that intake of antioxidant-rich foods can affect groups of genes associated with cellular stress defence in human blood cells. Trial registration number: NCT00520819 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In an 8-week dietary intervention study, 102 healthy male smokers were randomised to either a diet rich in various antioxidant-rich foods, a kiwifruit diet (three kiwifruits/d added to the regular diet) or a control group. Blood cell gene expression profiles were obtained from 10 randomly selected individuals of each group. Diet-induced changes on gene expression were compared to controls using a novel application of the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on transcription profiles obtained using Affymetrix HG-U133-Plus 2.0 whole genome arrays.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Changes were observed in the blood cell gene expression profiles in both intervention groups when compared to the control group. Groups of genes involved in regulation of cellular stress defence, such as DNA repair, apoptosis and hypoxia, were significantly upregulated (GSEA, FDR q-values &#x0003c; 5%) by both diets compared to the control group. Genes with common regulatory motifs for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR nuclear translocator (AhR/ARNT) were upregulated by both interventions (FDR q-values &#x0003c; 5%). Plasma antioxidant biomarkers (polyphenols/carotenoids) increased in both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The observed changes in the blood cell gene expression profiles suggest that the beneficial effects of a plant-based diet on human health may be mediated through optimization of defence processes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The majority of plant chemicals (phytochemicals) are antioxidants. A predominantly plant-based diet reduces the risk for development of many chronic age-related diseases linked to oxidative stress, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The hypothesis that the antioxidant abilities of phytochemicals limit oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been tested in large clinical investigations with pharmacological doses of antioxidants (vitamin C, betacarotene and vitamin E). However, these antioxidant supplementations have failed to prevent chronic diseases and in some cases actually worsen the outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These results are interesting but not contradictory to a biological function of plant food antioxidants. In contrast to antioxidant supplements that contain single or a few antioxidants, plant food contains thousands of different phytochemicals with various antioxidant content and chemical properties. It is possible that a variety of antioxidants at physiological concentrations is required for a beneficial health effect. It is also likely that phytochemicals modulate signal transduction and gene expression related to protective networks via antioxidant as well as through nonantioxidant activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Several phytochemicals can regulate the expression of genes involved in cellular defence via the antioxidant responsive element (ARE/EpRE) by activation of the transcription factor NFE2L2/Nrf2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Notably, vitamin C, &#x003b2;-carotene and vitamin E are not particularly efficient inducers of NFE2L2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Through evolution, aerobic organisms have acquired inducible networks of genes for protection against damaging effects of ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and for repair thereof [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. On the other hand, compelling evidence indicates that ROS is an important mediator, for example, of proper cell signalling, homeostasis control, cell turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has been proposed that oxidative challenges induce adaptive/hormetic responses responsible for the health-promoting effects of physical exercise. Intake of antioxidant supplements during exercise has prevented health-promoting effects of physical exercise in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It is possible that ROS as well as plant food substances induce gene expression related to adaptive responses of cellular defence. Removal of ROS by high-dose single antioxidants without the concomitant induction of adaptive/hormetic responses, such as defence and repair processes, may explain the disappointing results of antioxidant supplements on disease prevention. It is also possible that high-dose antioxidants have pro-oxidative effects.</p><p>As an approach to identify food with potential beneficial health effects, we have screened more than 3500 different foods for total antioxidant capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. On the basis of these results, we designed an antioxidant-rich diet including berries, nuts and seeds, spices, certain fruits and vegetables to test the hypothesis that plant food substances induce gene expression related to adaptive responses of cellular stress defence. We also examined whether adding three kiwifruits daily to a regular diet could induce similar effects. In kiwifruit, the majority of measurable total antioxidant content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] is contributed by one antioxidant (vitamin C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design and intervention</title><p>The study followed a randomised group design with 8 weeks of intervention. Healthy male smokers were recruited via an advertisement in a local newspaper.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were men between 45 and 75 years of age, smoking at least 5 cigarettes daily and BMI &#x0003c; 35 kg/m<sup>2 </sup>with stable weight range for the past 6 months. The exclusion criteria were any symptomatic cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes (type 1 or type 2), following a vegetarian or near-vegetarian diet, allergy to any items of the intervention or clinically diagnosed disorders, including gastrointestinal diseases. Moreover, participants with a history of serious or unstable medical or psychiatric disorder, current users or those in need of lipid-lowering drug treatment, aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, nutritional supplements or herbs for weight loss within 4 weeks prior to inclusion or participating in a drug trial during the previous 30 days were not included. Participants were included between March 2004 and March 2005. The Easter holiday, summer vacation and Christmas holiday were avoided to prevent possible confounding by seasonal changes in the participants' diets.</p><p>The 102 included participants were randomly assigned to the two intervention groups and the control group, with 34 in each group. Randomization was performed in blocks of 12, with group allocation provided in presealed, numbered envelopes. One group received an antioxidant-rich diet while another group received three kiwifruits daily. The antioxidant-rich diet food items were included in exchange for foods in their habitual diet. The food exchange was discussed with the study nutritionist, but the participants were free to select which foods to replace. The kiwifruits were added to the habitual diet. The control subjects continued their habitual diet with a few restrictions (e.g., limitation to coffee intake). In total, 100 participants completed the study (n = 34 in the control group and n = 33 in both the intervention groups). Blood samples were collected at Oslo University Hospital, Ullev&#x000e5;l, Norway. Ten individuals from each group were randomly chosen for gene expression analysis of whole-blood RNA using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 arrays. All statistics on baseline characteristics and plasma biomarkers in this paper are given for this subgroup only.</p><p>The subjects in both intervention groups received food items weekly. In the antioxidant group these included green tea, dog rose juice, cranberry juice, aronia juice, unsweetened bilberry juice, bilberry jam, bilberries, blackberries, strawberries, raspberries, pomegranate, dark blue grapes, Brussels sprouts, broccoli, red cabbage, kale, blue potatoes, tomatoes, dark chocolate, bread with pecan nuts and sunflower seeds, walnuts, olive oil, rosemary, thyme and oregano. The kiwifruit group received a bag of 21 kiwifruits. Weekly amounts of the food items provided to the antioxidant-rich diet group are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The foods that were not consumed were registered weekly in a custom-made questionnaire. Subjects in the control group were monitored at follow-ups every second week. For whole-blood genome analysis, samples were collected using PAXgene Blood RNA Tubes (QIAGEN, Cat. No. 762115) at the time of randomization and at the end of the intervention period. All investigators performing sample analyses or statistics were blinded until statistical analyses were performed. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee for medical research (REK S&#x000f8;r), and all participants gave their written, informed consent.

In the kiwifruit group, nine gene transcripts were significantly altered compared to the control group. The maximum induction of gene transcripts in the antioxidant-rich diet group was 77%, whereas the kiwifruit group had a maximum increase of 37%. The maximum reduction was 34% in the antioxidant-rich diet group and 23% in the kiwifruit group.</p><p>Twenty-six of the differentially expressed genes in the antioxidant-rich diet group were identified as encoding proteins with known chromosomal location and function (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). The identified gene transcripts are known to be associated with processes such as signal transduction, lipid metabolism, transcriptional regulation, intracellular transport, cytoskeleton organization and inflammatory response. Two of the downregulated gene transcripts, hormone-sensitive lipase (LIPE) and glycerol kinase 2 (GK2), are targets for the nuclear receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR&#x003b3;) and are involved in lipid metabolism. In addition, the nuclear receptor subfamily 0 (NR0B1) known as a PPAR&#x003b3; corepressor was also downregulated compared to the control group. Several of the downregulated transcripts represent genes involved in signal transduction, including the two G protein-coupled receptors: bitter taste receptor (TAS2R16) and olfactory receptor 2 (OR2F1). The probe ID 1567015_at which was significantly downregulated is annotated NFE2L2 nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 by the NetAffx from Affymetrix. However, we performed a BLAST aligning approach and found this probe ID to be wrongly annotated. Five of the nine gene transcripts that were significantly altered in the kiwifruit group are annotated with known functions (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>) and are associated with signal transduction (G protein-coupled receptor 173 (GPR173) (down), creatine kinase muscle (CKM) (down), catenin-&#x003b4; (CTNND1) (up)), ion transport (Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+ </sup>exchanger domain

Two of these are genes containing the promoter motive for Yin-Yang transcription factor (YY1). The other represents genes with promoter motifs for GA binding protein transcription factor (GABP)/nuclear respiratory factor 2 (NRF2), member of the E-26 (ETS) oncogene family (ELK1) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Four C3 TFT gene sets were downregulated in the antioxidant-rich diet group. Two of these are grouped by similar promoter motives for known transcription factors; cutlike 1 (CUTL1) and RE1-silencing transcription factor (REST). Three C3 TFT gene sets were upregulated in the kiwifruit group. Two of these are grouped by similar promoter motives for known transcription factors: the AhR and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF1A), respectively. No C3 TFT gene sets were downregulated in the kiwifruit group.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of regulated biological processes among the differentially expressed transcripts</title><p>Up- and downregulated gene transcript lists obtained by Limma, as described in the Methods section, were analysed separately in the downstream applications looking for patterns with regard to biological processes or pathways.

This tool tests whether the distribution of a biological process in a list of regulated gene transcripts may be expected when compared to a reference (all GO processes associated with the HG-133 plus 2 chip). A number of biological processes were significantly enriched in the lists of up- and downregulated gene transcripts for both intervention groups (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S15">15</xref>, Tables S8-S11). Biological processes significantly enriched are listed hierarchically. Processes with less than two genes are not included in the table. One gene transcript may map to several biological processes. Biological processes related to 'response to stress', such as DNA repair and defence responses, were significantly enriched in the list of upregulated gene transcripts in both intervention groups and were not found in the downregulated lists. Immune-related processes and processes relevant for regulation of apoptosis were enriched in both up- and downregulated gene transcript lists for both intervention groups.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To our knowledge, this human intervention study is the first in which effects of a plant-based diet have been measured in blood cells using whole genome microarray technology. We have applied a novel application of the GSEA method to test the hypothesis that intake of antioxidant-rich foods has an effect on groups of genes associated with cellular stress defence in human blood cells and present data supporting this view.</p><p>It is widely accepted that accumulation of molecular and cellular damage, together with progressive failure of maintenance and repair processes, is associated with aging and that plant-based diets protect against age-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Induction of defence pathways by phytochemicals has been proposed to explain the beneficial effects of a plant-based diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both energy restriction and regular physical activity are thought to improve life expectancy by inducing adaptive/hormetic responses that protect against molecular damage and subsequent premature aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It is possible that components of plant foods may promote health effects and longevity through similar mechanisms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Hypothetical model suggesting how plant food phytochemicals influence protective cellular defence systems (yellow box) in a similar manner as an optimal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS)</bold>. It is possible that phytochemicals work by modulating ROS levels while regulating inducible defence systems.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1741-7015-8-54-3"/></fig><p>One of the few natural compounds that can increase lifespan in animals is resveratrol, a phenolic compound found mainly in the skin of grapes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The antioxidant-rich diet used in this intervention study contains not only dietary sources of resveratrol but also thousands of other plant compounds with potential bioefficiency.</p><p>Upregulation of nuclear genes related to DNA repair, metabolism, apoptosis and 'stress' response has been reported in several studies in association with longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. For instance, human centenarians are observed to have higher activity levels of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, which is a key player in the immediate cellular response to stress-induced DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The transcripts associated with such mechanisms that are upregulated by both the antioxidant-rich diet and the kiwifruit diet may therefore be similarly important for cellular stress defence and maintenance. In agreement with our findings, a moderate and significant upregulation of DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes has been found after a 3-week intervention with cooked carrots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and several DNA repair genes were upregulated following a flavonoid-rich diet for 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Thus, we suggest that upregulation of genes involved in different DNA repair pathways may explain the observed increase in lymphocyte DNA repair capacity induced by plant-enriched diets. The upregulation of target genes for transcription factors involved in stress responses in our study also offers some potential mechanistic explanations behind the beneficial health effects of plant-based diets. Genes sharing the regulatory xenobiotic response element (XRE) for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)/AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT) were upregulated in both intervention groups. Phytochemicals may act as ligands for AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Ligand activation of AHR results in dimerisation with ARNT with subsequent binding to XRE. Genes controlled by XRE are involved in Phase I and Phase II reactions whose primary function is to inactivate and eliminate harmful xenobiotic substances. We also found genes with the regulatory motif for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 A (HIF1A) upregulated in the kiwifruit group. HIF1A controls the hypoxic response occurring at low oxygen tension. Under hypoxia, HIF1A dimerises with ARNT, allowing translocation into the nucleus for induction of gene expression. HIF1A target genes are involved in stress and defence responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The hypoxic response is also important for proper immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Our data therefore support the hypotheses that intake of a diet rich in antioxidants induces expression of detoxification enzymes and proteins involved in defence and stress responses.</p><p>Target genes for nuclear respiratory factor 2 (GABP/NRF2) were upregulated in the antioxidant-rich diet group. Nuclear respiratory factors enhance the expression of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial function and biogenesis, such as the respiratory subunits, and may be important for human health and longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, GABP/NRF2 may coordinate the cytosolic and mitochondrial protein synthesis. Impairment of mitochondrial function, probably caused by ROS, may be associated with age-related disorders such as type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Mitochondrial turnover is higher in young individuals compared to middle-aged and older subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and genes involved in renewal of mitochondria are downregulated in old mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Increased mitochondrial number has also been associated with the life-prolonging effects of exercise as well as energy restriction in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The effect of energy restriction on longevity in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans </italic>is linked to genes that increase mitochondrial activity throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In addition, resveratrol reversed the decline of hepatic mitochondrial number in mice fed a high-energy diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In this study, we also found genes sharing regulatory motifs for another transcription factor controlling mitochondrial gene transcription, Yin Yang 1 (YY1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], to be upregulated in both intervention groups. The antioxidant-rich diets may thus offer a health benefit regarding chronic age-related diseases by influencing mitochondrial biogenesis via induction of GABP/NRF2 and YY1 target genes.</p><p>The antioxidant-rich diet presented here is not only rich in antioxidants, but provided nutrients such as monounsaturated and polyunsaturated lipids and folate (magnesium and iron). The effects on gene expression observed in this intervention study may therefore be attributed not only to phytochemicals but also to other dietary compounds acting via several different mechanisms. However, as similar effects are exerted by the kiwifruit diet, it is plausible to suggest that the observed modulation is mediated mainly by plant-based compounds. Another important aspect is that we have utilised blood cells to assess the effect of the interventions on gene expression. Thus, all the cellular processes found to be regulated by the diets may be of importance for immune function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This human dietary intervention is the first to investigate the influences of antioxidant-rich diets on gene expression in whole blood. We observe that gene sets related to DNA repair, hypoxia, apoptosis and immune processes are significantly upregulated by a complex antioxidant-rich diet or by kiwifruits. Our results suggest that the beneficial health effects of a plant-based diet may involve modulation of stress- and defence-related gene expression important for maintenance of cellular functions. Whether this effect is caused by modulation of redox homeostasis or via other mechanisms needs further investigation. The reported results may contribute to the development of public nutritional advice on antioxidant intake in aspects of prevention of oxidative stress-related diseases and subsequent healthy aging, although the conclusions are preliminary.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA: ascorbic acid; AhR: aryl hydrocarbon receptor; AhR/ARNT(HIF1B): AhR nuclear translocator; ALAT: alanine-aminotransferase; ANOVA: analysis of variance; ARE/EpRE: antioxidant responsive element; BLAST: basic local alignment search tool; BMI: body mass index; CKM: creatine kinase muscle; CTNND1: catenin (cadherin-associated protein)-&#x003b4; 1; CUTL1L: cutlike 1; CVD: cardiovascular diseases; DOPAC: 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid; ELK1: ETS oncogene family; ETS: E-26.
