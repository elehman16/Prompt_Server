Patients used the medication daily for the first 2 weeks of the study, and twice weekly.

In addition, women who underwent hormone replacement therapy, treated with systemic or vaginal estrogen within 6 months prior to the study, or had any contraindication for estrogen therapy were excluded from the study.</p><p>Using simple randomization, women were randomly divided into Vagifem (from Novo Nordisk) or vaginal estrogen cream (Equin from Actoverco) treatment groups (80 women in each group).</p><p>Patients of the first group were commenced on vaginal estrogen cream of Actoverco company, one tube every night for 14 nights; then, one tube 2 nights in 1 week (two tubes every week) for 10 weeks. In the second group, vaginal estrogen cream from Novo Nordisk was replaced with Vagifem 25 mcg; however, the treatment plan was similar to the first group.</p><p>In addition to recording demographic data, four main symptoms of atrophic vaginitis including dysuria, dyspareunia, vaginal itching, and dryness were evaluated by patients&#x02019; self-report, and vaginal atrophy was assessed by the gynecologist.</p><p>At the beginning of the study, all patients were asked to answer a check list to record pretreatment symptom severity. Patients were asked to report whether they had no symptom or had mild, moderate, or severe symptoms.</p><p>Then, the women were examined by a single gynecologist, and the degree of vaginal atrophy was determined and recorded. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Follow-up sessions were arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment.</p><p>Women were reexamined by the gynecologist to reevaluate the severity of vaginal atrophy. The gynecologist who examined the women was unaware of the treatment group. At the end of the study, patients answered regarding their satisfaction of the treatment, and posttreatment symptom severity.</p><p>Effectiveness means effectiveness for the relief of vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) symptoms. This is just confined to the response of the patients to the questions included in the checklist.</p><p>Medication acceptability was checked after 2 weeks of the treatment and at the end of the study. Patients were asked about the presence and degree of pain [using visual analog scale (VAS)] during application of the medication, vaginal leakage of the medication, need to use sanitary towels to clean leakage, and user-friendliness.</p><p>A 3-point scale (very easy, easy, or difficult) was used to evaluate user-friendliness of the treatment method.</p><p>Women were also asked about whether they had experienced vaginal bleeding, recurrent vaginal discharge, stress, or urge incontinence.</p><p>Any adverse events were also recorded at the follow-up sessions. Data were analyzed by Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 16 software (Equine cream Manufactured by ALDO-UNION, S.A, Barcelona, Spain).

Patient acceptability and preference is a very important aspect of local estrogen therapy, which significantly affects patients&#x02019; compliance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Since long-term therapy is likely to be necessary for women suffering from atrophic vaginitis, treatment should be easy and convenient.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Despite the well-documented efficacy of treatment with vaginal estrogen creams, compliance with therapy can be poor due to the aforementioned issues.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In November 2009, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the 10 mcg estradiol vaginal tablet formulation (Vagifem) for the treatment of VVA in menopausal women. Estradiol vaginal tablets previously were approved in a 25 mcg formulation in the United States and the European Union. The company discontinued the sale of Vagifem 25 mcg in the United States on July 30, 2010.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>This poor compliance is mainly caused by vaginal leakage of medication, which usually necessitates the use of sanitary protection.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>This study showed that both Vagifem and vaginal estrogen cream significantly improve the signs and symptoms of atrophic vaginitis.</p><p>Although there was no significant difference between these two medications in treating the symptoms, patients were more satisfied with Vagifem regarding user-friendliness and hygienic issues.</p><p>Two other previous studies also confirmed our findings, and showed that women treated with Vagifem were more likely to remain on therapy than those who were treated with a vaginal cream.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Dugal <italic>et al</italic>. studied 96 women randomly classified them into two equal groups of vaginal estrogen cream and estrogen tablet. Patients were followed up for 24 weeks. Their results showed that vaginal tablets were as effective as estrogen cream; however, patients&#x02019; acceptance was significantly higher in the tablet-treated group.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, Rioux <italic>et al</italic>. Performed a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel group study on 159 menopausal women to compare treatment with Vagifem and vaginal estrogen cream. They concluded that treatment with Vagifem and with vaginal estrogen cream was equivalent in relieving symptoms of atrophic vaginitis. In addition, they demonstrated that vaginal tablets have a localized effect with no significant increase in the systemic estradiol level or estrogenic side effects. They also reported greater patient acceptance and lower withdrawal rates in vaginal tablet therapy compared with the vaginal cream group.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Based on findings of several studies, estradiol vaginal tablets such as Vagifem were found to be an effective alternative to traditional therapeutic methods for atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal women. This is consistent with the results of previous clinical trials, which treated and followed up patients for up to 2 years.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>It is not a difficult decision to select one treatment from a group of choices when the efficacy is similar. In the presence of similar effectiveness, selection criteria were having fewer adverse effects and more patients&#x02019; acceptance.</p><p>Vagifem is the tablet form of local estrogen preparation and therefore, it has an easier method of application with fewer adverse hygienic effects such as vaginal leakage. This is a very important factor, which affects patient adherence to the treatment in long term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In summary, we conclude that Vagifem is an appropriate medication for the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, which is as effective as vaginal estrogen creams and is more userfriendly.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are thank full of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Vice Chancellery for Research and Thechnology.
