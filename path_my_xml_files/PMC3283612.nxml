The use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors (RAAS-I) to target doses is recommended by guidelines. But physicians seemingly do not sufficiently follow this recommendation, while little is known about the physician and patient predictors of adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To examine the coherence of primary care (PC) physicians' knowledge and self-perceived competencies regarding RAAS-I with their respective prescribing behavior being related to patient-associated barriers. Cross-sectional follow-up study after a randomized medical educational intervention trial with a seven month observation period. PC physicians (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;37) and patients with systolic HF (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;168) from practices in Baden-Wuerttemberg. Measurements were knowledge (blueprint-based multiple choice test), self-perceived competencies (questionnaire on global confidence in the therapy and on frequency of use of RAAS-I), and patient variables (age, gender, NYHA functional status, blood pressure, potassium level, renal function). Prescribing was collected from the trials' documentation. The target variable consisted of &#x02265;50&#x00025; of recommended RAAS-I dosage being investigated by two-level logistic regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients (69&#x00025; male, mean age 68.8 years) showed symptomatic and objectified left ventricular (NYHA II vs. III/IV: 51&#x00025; vs. 49&#x00025; and mean LVEF 33.3&#x00025;) and renal (GFR&#x0003c;50&#x00025;: 22&#x00025;) impairment. Mean percentage of RAAS-I target dose was 47&#x00025;, 59&#x00025; of patients receiving &#x02265;50&#x00025;. Determinants of improved prescribing of RAAS-I were patient age (OR 0.95, CI 0.92&#x02013;0.99, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01), physician's global self-confidence at follow-up (OR 1.09, CI 1.02&#x02013;1.05, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01) and NYHA class (II vs. III/IV) (OR 0.63, CI 0.38&#x02013;1.05, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>A change in physician's confidence as a predictor of RAAS-I dose increase is a new finding that might reflect an intervention effect of improved physicians' intention and that might foster novel strategies to improve safe evidence-based prescribing.

The clinical management of HF is complex and includes a repeated evaluation of the clinical course of the syndrome and its' comorbidities. Moreover it encompasses patient education, non-/pharmacological treatment, devices and surgery. Thus a coordinated and transdisciplinary approach is mandatory. Evidence-based pharmacological treatment, such as the use of renin angiotensin aldostererone inhibitors (RAAS-I) and betablockers (BB) requires the physician's competence in prescribing appropriate medications (indications vs contraindications) and step-wise up-titration while monitoring typical side-effects (i.e. hypotension, change in creatinine-clearance or potassium levels) during the subsequent trajectory of the syndrome <xref rid="pone.0031082-Swedberg1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031082-Muth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>Despite the consensus on clinical practice guidelines (CPG) that recommend the use of RAAS-I in target doses <xref rid="pone.0031082-Muth1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031082-Hunt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, there seems to be imperfect transfer into practice, especially in primary care. Current literature suggests that many patients actually, do not receive RAAS-I, mostly due to clinical and/or professional uncertainty or unawareness <xref rid="pone.0031082-Cleland2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. If prescribed, doses were titrated to only 50&#x00025; of the target doses recommended in the CPGs <xref rid="pone.0031082-Cleland2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-deGroote1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Understanding this gap between a physician's knowledge and his actual acting might therefore be essential for the development of strategies aiming to improve the care of HF patients <xref rid="pone.0031082-Cochrane1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>In general, reasons for non-adherence to guideline recommendations can either be attributed to the knowledge and attitudes of physicians or might be due to external factors like specific reimbursement procedures or patient preferences <xref rid="pone.0031082-Cabana1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Self-reported physician-related barriers to evidence based prescribing of HF medication include lack of knowledge or confidence <xref rid="pone.0031082-Fuat1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, but these do not explain variance in treatment alone <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Usually, physician characteristics, as part of explorative studies, have been shown to impact the quality of care the patients receive. For example, working individually more than 15 years as a primary care physician has been correlated with non-prescription of RAAS-I <xref rid="pone.0031082-Koschack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Moreover a comparison between specialties revealed that primary care physicians use less diagnostic procedures and less evidence-based pharmacotherapy which was found to be explained only in part by patient characteristics <xref rid="pone.0031082-Rutten1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>However, many patients with heart failure have comorbidities that would have prevented inclusion in RCTs that have shown benefits in mortality <xref rid="pone.0031082-Lenzen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, which reflects the complexity physicians face (especially in primary care) in the treatment of elderly, multimorbid patients <xref rid="pone.0031082-vanWeel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Patient characteristics that have been found to be associated with the prescription of RAAS-I are age <xref rid="pone.0031082-deGroote1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Koschack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, gender <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, NYHA functional class <xref rid="pone.0031082-Sturm1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and comorbidity, such as hypertension <xref rid="pone.0031082-Koschack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Sturm1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and renal failure <xref rid="pone.0031082-deGroote1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.

Accordingly, to retrieve an estimate of patients' &#x0201c;morbidity burden&#x0201d; in addition to the documentation of single co-occurring medical conditions, physicians applied the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS-G) <xref rid="pone.0031082-Hudon1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> that measures the chronic medical illness (&#x0201c;morbidity&#x0201d;) burden while taking into consideration the severity of chronic diseases in 14 items representing individual body systems. The final score of the CIRS is the sum of each of the 14 scores, a higher score indicating higher impairment [range 0&#x02013;56]. Actual laboratory results including creatinine and potassium were also recorded. We estimated the creatinine clearance using the formula by Cockroft and Gault <xref rid="pone.0031082-Luke1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Therefore, we treated the outcome variable as a dichotomous variable with (cut-off &#x02265;50&#x00025; of target dose). Dummy variables were built for ordinal variables (e.g. self-perceived confidence). We aggregated NYHA functional class I with II and III with IV accounting for the low number of observations in the classes I and IV. For the regression model, we imputed missing data using means of available data regarding self-rated frequency of prescription and overall self-confidence in therapy, in both there were missings in six cases. The model accounted for hierarchical clustering of the data, with patient variables and the outcome variable on level-1 and physician variables on level-two. The first model was validated by excluding variables with a p-value greater than 0.3. In other models, we replaced self-perceived competency variables measured at follow-up by those at baseline to verify further their predictive value. We used SPSS 15 for the analysis of descriptive data and SAS 9.2 (PROC GENMOD) for the two-level logistic regression analyses. As SAS outputs are reported in log odds ratios, we transformed these in odds ratios for better readability of the results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Physician and patient characteristics</title><p>
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031082-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows the flow of participating physicians and patients through the trial. Of the 750 physicians approached in a single mail-out, 37 ultimately participated and recruited 168 eligible patients between March and September 2005. Following patient recruitment, 18 physicians were randomised to the TTT group and 19 to the Standard group. At the patient level, 15 patients were lost to follow up (13 died and 2 were lost during the follow up).

In contrast to self-assessed frequency, the global self-confidence in therapy of HF had a significant impact, i.e. the higher the global self-confidence, the higher were observed prescribed doses (odds ratio 1.09; 95&#x00025; CI 1.02&#x02013;1.05; p-value: 0.01) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0031082-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Neither multimorbidity (as measured by CIRS summary score) nor systolic/diastolic blood pressure, or renal function, or hyperkalemia were associated with prescription of higher doses of RAAS inhibitors (data not shown).

This study focused on primary care physicians' competency levels (before and after attending a CME event) and patient-related barriers as predictors of actual guideline-conform prescription of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (RAAS inhibitors) at daily doses equal or more than 50&#x00025; of target. Physicians' global self-confidence in therapy of HF positively determined while patient age negatively determined RAAS-I prescription towards target dose. Outcome-specific factual knowledge and a higher NYHA functional class showed a trend for a negative impact.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Internal and external validity of the study</title><p>The fact that the parental trial was performed as a clinical trial promoted the internal validity <xref rid="pone.0031082-PetersKlimm2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. For example, the defined patient population with confirmed symptomatic systolic heart failure is an essential aspect to assess evidence-based pharmacotherapy such as target dosing of RAAS-I. Similarly, patient variables derived from the trial documentation are characterized by a high validity. However, although developed with considerable time and effort, assessment of physician-related competence lacks validation and the study is relatively small in size which probably questions its power to detect significant predictors and to detect between group differences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0031082.s001">Appendix S1</xref>, table 4 competence outcomes).</p><p>A physician participation rate of 5&#x00025; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0031082-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and some physician and patient characteristics may indicate that participants are not representative of the primary care physicians' population: &#x0201c;High time and effort&#x0201d; due to the trial's documentation and lack of eligible patients (both measures for a high internal validity) were the main reasons for the non-participation of physicians. Physicians' offices were larger than average (approx. 800/practice) and had a larger adoption rate of primary care-based disease management programs and peer review groups (approx. 53 and 30&#x00025;). Baseline prescription rates of RAAS-I and betablockers revealed a superior guideline adherence as compared to other primary-care based studies, while being similar in comparison to studies conducted in secondary care <xref rid="pone.0031082-Komajda1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Komajda2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. In our view, the observation of high prescription rates is rather based on the inclusion criterion of <italic>objectified</italic> systolic heart failure than a selection bias as it is the crucial indication to start RAAS-I. As primary-care-based studies in HF typically lack a predefined population (of systolic HF patients) prescribing rates are therefore lower. In fact, results of a primary care-based dutch study (10.6&#x00025; confirmed systolic heart failure) suggest that an objectified systolic HF diagnosis, specific care in an HF clinic or referrals to a cardiologist are all associated with the prescription of ACE inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>General interpretation in the context or current evidence</title><p>The understanding of how physician- and patient-related characteristics are associated with target dosing may foster future (educational) efforts to improve care. Some results are in line with previous findings such as age <xref rid="pone.0031082-deGroote1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Koschack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and female gender being a negative patient-level predictor. We cannot explain the (non-significant) finding that a high NYHA score negatively determined RAAS dosing. A substudy of the IMPROVEMENT survey <xref rid="pone.0031082-Cleland2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> showed that with higher NYHA scores the rates of ACE inhibitors increased <xref rid="pone.0031082-Sturm1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This study, however, is not easy to compare as rates of ACE inhibitor prescription were high in our study and studies chose different outcomes (prescription versus target dosing rates). The patient population of the IMPROVEMENT survey shows another spectrum of patients, it was less defined regarding the left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVEF&#x0003c;40&#x00025; in 33&#x00025; of patients in Germany and 27&#x00025; in all countries) with another morbidity pattern of asymptomatic (12&#x00025;), mild (34&#x00025;), moderate (31&#x00025;) and severe (10&#x00025;) symptoms (percentages are given for the overall population). Therefore, in that study, NYHA stage in that population might indirectly reflect the type and advanced stage of heart failure, which, once assessed and confirmed crucially guide physicians' treatment decisions.</p><p>More interestingly, global self-confidence in the therapy of HF after (but not so prior to!) a CME event predicted target dosing, while conversely knowledge seemed to do the opposite. The first aspect is in line with literature that suggests that training may reduce variation between self- and external assessments <xref rid="pone.0031082-Moret1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031082-Leopold1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, but the second is difficult to interpret: Qualitative studies suggest that increased confidence is associated with greater self-reported prescribing rates of ACE inhibitors <xref rid="pone.0031082-Khunti1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. It may be speculated that knowing more specific facts by itself increases the awareness of iatrogenic effects and might therefore induce reluctance in some physicians to increase the dose in elderly patients (primum nihil nocere!). This is reflected by various authors showing that primary care physicians did not use ACE inhibitors because of fear of side effects <xref rid="pone.0031082-Fuat1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Khunti1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Phillips1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Psychological and organisational theory is being used to explain and to influence professional behaviour and might be helpful in relation to our findings, although there are virtually innumerable theories and constructs, without any final theory or model whatsoever <xref rid="pone.0031082-Robertson1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0031082-Abraham2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>. Nevertheless, physicians' (post-interventional) self-confidence in our study might reflect the competence, motivation, and intention finally to prescribe higher dosages. Of note, it might also depend on personality traits as some physicians may have hesitated to use their newly acquired knowledge in case of elderly patients. However, our study did not identify objective predictive patient-related factors that reflect intolerance of up-titration. Therefore, final causal relations of this observation remain unclear.</p><p>Sinha et al. investigated physician characteristics in the context prescription of beta-blockers among patients with systolic HF, another important evidence-based treatment <xref rid="pone.0031082-Sinha1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>: In their cross-sectional survey with a supplementary retrospective chart review they examined the association between primary care physician characteristics and both self-reported and actual prescription, results showed that physicians with teaching responsibilities and physicians with confidence in managing HF patients reported significantly higher rates of beta-blocker prescribing. However, only self-reported rates of prescribing were significantly associated with actual prescribing of beta-blockers among HF patients, not other physician characteristics, and the authors discussed a lack of power for further discrimination of the explanatory variables. Nevertheless, they concluded that self-confidence seems to play a role in beta-blocker prescribing in HF and should be targeted by teaching. Insofar the results of our study are in line with Sinha et al. and might be even stronger as they show the association of self-confidence and actual prescription.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>Usually, determinants of evidence-based prescribing rely on explorative, secondary studies, which was the case in our study. However, our study has several limitations: It is relatively small in size, which prohibits further explanatory variables, whether physician- or patient-related <xref rid="pone.0031082-deGroote1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Koschack1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0031082-Sturm1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, or related to the organization of care <xref rid="pone.0031082-Kasje2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. As we were especially interested in the predictive role of different levels of physicians' competencies, we focused on these pre-specified variables while taking account for variables that play a direct role in medical decision making in this context. Further limitations are the use of self-developed and not completely validated assessments of physicians' competence. The use of imputation methodology in six observations might have affected the internal validity. Finally, the focus of this paper was not a primary outcome of the parental trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings replicated known barriers (such as patient age) to the prescription of RAAS-inhibitors according to actual guideline recommendations. Physicians' self-confidence and factual knowledge improved after the educational interventions, but only self-confidence became predictive of prescribing behaviour which might reflect an intervention effect of improved physicians' intention. Therefore, educational approaches that target knowledge, skills and attitudes (e.g. intentions) are required to further close the perceived performance gaps in complex behaviours such as safe evidence-based prescribing in elderly patients with heart failure. Further theory-driven research with comprehensive assessments using validated instruments and a larger dataset and sample is also recommended to further clarify the mechanisms of knowledge transfer into daily practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0031082.s001"><label>Appendix S1</label><caption><p>
