Little is known about the efficiency of protein substitution. We quantified and qualified the systemic and local protein loss in burn patients during protein substitution, comparing fresh frozen plasma and the human serum protein solution Biseko. <bold>Methods:</bold> In 40 patients suffering from second-degree burn wounds with the total burn surface area between 20% and 60%, immediately after admission a defined wound surface area was enclosed with in a wound chamber. Wound fluid and serum samples were collected in 8 hour intervals for 2 days. Samples were analyzed for total protein, albumin, immunoglobulins -A, -G, -M, clotting parameters, c-reactive protein, and white blood cells. Protein substitution started 24 hour posttrauma. In a randomized pattern, patients received equal volumes of fresh frozen plasma or Biseko. <bold>Results:</bold> Total protein and albumin accumulated in high concentrations in wound fluid. With beginning of fresh frozen plasma substitution on day 2 posttrauma, serum total protein (1.7 g&#x02013;3.9 g) and albumin (1.3 g&#x02013;3.4 g) concentrations increased. Substitution of Biseko resulted in a stronger increase (serum total protein 1.8 g to 4.5 g, albumin 0.9 g to 3.4 g). Wound fluid concentrations revealed similar change patterns. Immunoglobulins showed higher serum levels in the Biseko group. C-reactive protein and white blood cell values indicated a lower immunological reaction in the Biseko group. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Substitution of human protein solutions such as Biseko can result in significantly higher serum protein and albumin concentrations as well as lower infection parameters. Higher serum immunoglobulins could help to decrease potential immunodeficiency.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Severe burn injuries of more than 15% total body surface area (TBSA) result in burn disease that is characterized by electrolyte imbalance, loss of proteins followed by fluid dysregulations, circulatory insufficiency, and immunodeficiencies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref> These dysregulations arising from capillary leakage (CL) potentially lead to systemic inflammatory response syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hypermetabolism, hypoxia, and catabolism, and potentially result in multiorgan distress syndrome.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></p><p>Capillary leakage is known to appear approximately 24 hours posttrauma and is not restricted to the burned area.

There are mainly three schools of thought:</p><p>1. Protein solutions should not be given within the first 24 hours: they are not effective in resuscitation because of shifting to the interstitium and they promote accumulation of lung water when edema fluid is being absorbed from the burn wound.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></p><p>2.Proteins should be given from the beginning of resuscitation, along with crystalloid, to counter the protein deficiency and its disadvantages.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></p><p>3. Protein should be given after 8&#x02013;12 hours postburn; resuscitation should be strictly crystalloid in the first 8&#x02013;12 hours because of the massive extravasation of fluids during this period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref></p><p>This study demonstrates an average wound protein loss of 16.6 &#x000b1; 8.86 g in a collection period of 8 hours in a 10% burnt TBSA. Total protein values measured in wound chambers were consistently high until the end of measurements. These findings confirm results of a previous study in which a patient's TP amount in serum is lost to a wound surface of 20% burnt TBSA in 24 hours.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref> Substitution of FFP and Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> beginning 24 hours posttrauma rises the intravascular protein and AL concentration and consecutively increases intravascular oncotic pressure. Furthermore, TP and AL concentration also increases in WF and reveals a persistent leakage of proteins for a time period of more than 24 hours posttrauma. The data suggest that the CL persists significantly longer than the estimated time of 24 hours posttrauma; however, the protein substitution results in increasing serum values of TP and AL in both the FFP and Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> groups and, furthermore, increasing values of Igs in the Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> group. The resulting increased intravascular oncotic pressure and the immune status might be beneficial for the patient. We therefore recommend an early substitution beginning after 24 hours posttrauma although the CL persists.</p></sec><sec id="S3-2"><title>Type of resuscitations solutions</title><p>The choice of the type of protein solution in burn injuries can also be confusing. After 24 hours posttrauma, several add-ups, for example, plasma expander and colloidal or AL solutions, are administered.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref> Several different strategies for plasma volume expansions are used: for example, FFP, AL, starches, gelatins, dextrans, and different human protein compilations. At present, in most burn centers, physicians use 5%&#x02013;20% AL in isotonic crystalloid solution or FFP to increase the intravasal oncotic pressure, whereas gelatins are less common and dextrans are only rarely used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref> Standard protein supplements result in increased concentrations of AL and, consequently, TP. Besides the singular colloidal supplements, protein compilations are used to elevate not only the AL and TP concentrations but also the Igs concentrations.</p><p>There are a few drawbacks that have to be accepted in using FFP. Beside its limited availability, the cold chain may not be interrupted. FFP has a limited durability (2 years including 4&#x02013;6 months of quarantine). Before using, FFP must be thawed. A blood group&#x02013;adapted infusion and documentation, as well as a bedside test, are essential. Furthermore, as a product of human blood, it has a marked risk of viral and bacterial infections although several technologies for pathogen reduction of plasma reduce the risk of bacteria and virus transmission.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref> However, FFP's major advantage is still the content of haemostatic factors.</p><p>Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is a compilation of human AL and the Igs A, G, and M. It has a durability of 3 years and there is no need for a blood group&#x02013;adapted infusion. Even though Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> is a human product and there is consequently a risk of viral and bacterial infections, presently, no viral or bacterial infections after Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> infusions have been documented.</p><p>This study reveals a considerable beneficial progression of serum-TP and AL concentrations in the Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> group. Furthermore, we found an effective increase of the substituted Igs in the Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> group.</p><p>Although Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> does not contain coagulation parameters, there was a positive effect on blood coagulation in this group as well. A possible reason might be associated with the more physiological level of TP and AL. In consideration of the known multiple functions of AL, including its transportation functionality, the impact of high AL concentrations seems understandable.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></p><p>The registered systemic inflammatory parameters WBC and CRP showed lower values in the Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> group. It shows varying immunological responses in the compared groups. The proteins administered do not interfere with the humoral-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome or CL; nevertheless, there seems to be an effect of the proteins that leads to differing immunologic response.</p><p>In summary, commercial protein solutions like Biseko<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> are valuable alternatives to pure AL or FFP substitution. The application might result in better conditions for the patient in view of starting with surgical interventions on day 3 posttrauma. Further trials with bigger patient groups are necessary to validate the beneficial aspects of different protein solutions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank
