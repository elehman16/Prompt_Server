To date, research has relied on self-reported mindfulness or heterogeneous mindfulness trainings to infer skillful mindfulness practice and its effects. In four independent studies with over 400 total participants, we present the first construct validation of a behavioral measure of mindfulness, breath counting. We found it was reliable, correlated with self-reported mindfulness, differentiated long-term meditators from age-matched controls, and was distinct from sustained attention and working memory measures. In addition, we employed breath counting to test the nomological network of mindfulness. As theorized, we found skill in breath counting associated with more meta-awareness, less mind wandering, better mood, and greater non-attachment (i.e., less attentional capture by distractors formerly paired with reward). We also found in a randomized online training study that 4 weeks of breath counting training improved mindfulness and decreased mind wandering relative to working memory training and no training controls. Together, these findings provide the first evidence for breath counting as a behavioral measure of mindfulness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mindfulness</kwd><kwd>mind wandering</kwd><kwd>task-unrelated thought</kwd><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>meta-awareness</kwd><kwd>meta-cognition</kwd><kwd>wanting</kwd><kwd>working memory training</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="61"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">James (1890)</xref>, a founder of American Psychology wrote, &#x0201c;the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again is the very root of judgment, character, and will. &#x02026; An education which should improve this faculty would be <italic>the</italic> education <italic>par excellence.</italic>&#x0201d; In the 1960s and more recently, others have productively followed James&#x02019;s interest in wandering attention &#x02013; under the overlapping terms of mind wandering, task-unrelated-thought (TUT), and stimulus-independent thought &#x02013; to document that it occurs 30&#x02013;50% of daily life (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Klinger and Cox, 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010</xref>), and is associated with cognitive task errors (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Antrobus, 1968</xref>) and worse mood (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>; but see <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, research on the education of voluntarily bringing back a wandering mind has evoked both promise and controversy. Regarding its promise, the practice of returning attention to the present, which is core to mindfulness, has been associated with reduced pain (<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Zeidan et al., 2011</xref>), improved attention (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007</xref>), and enhanced well-being (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Ryan, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2007</xref>) among other benefits (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;lzel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Nonetheless, mindfulness measurements are controversial. For example, self-report on the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2006</xref>) cannot distinguish individuals receiving Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction vs. a validated active control intervention (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">MacCoon et al., 2012</xref>) because both interventions increase reported mindfulness equally (MacCoon, personal communication). In addition, mindfulness trainings and monetary incentives equally increase certain cognitive test scores, suggesting that the demand characteristics inherent in mindfulness training studies may result in training studies measuring effects of non-specific factors such as motivation as opposed to, or at least in addition to, mindfulness (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is unclear the extent to which mindfulness <italic>per se</italic> is captured by self-report or responsible for improvements following putative mindfulness trainings.</p><p>It is therefore critical for the field to establish a behavioral and thus less biased measure of mindfulness. Unlike questionnaires, which suffer from retrospective distortions and susceptibility to implicit demand characteristics (e.g., pressure on meditators to report being mindful), behavioral measures prevent &#x0201c;faking good&#x0201d; as ability must be demonstrated instead of simply averred. A behavioral measure could also avoid the confounding, non-specific training effects introduced in mindfulness training studies and provide a more efficient assessment. However, to our knowledge, no behavioral measure of mindfulness exists for scientific use. To address this gap, we present the first validation of such a measure.</p><sec><title>DEFINING AND OPERATIONALIZING MINDFULNESS</title><p>We chose <italic>present moment awareness</italic> as a definition of mindfulness to operationalize. Grounded in traditional descriptions of mindfulness (Supplementary Material Introduction), it is a commonality in the diversity of modern scientific definitions (e.g., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Ryan, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Bishop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Baer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Schooler et al., 2011</xref>) and meditation styles, which variably emphasize non-attachment, non-judgment, or other facets as well.</p><p>Mindfulness of breathing can be indexed by breath counting, which lends itself to objective behavioral study and draws face validity from its longstanding use in mindfulness practice (recorded c. 430 AD, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Buddhaghosa, 2010</xref>). Prima facie, accurately counting breaths operationalizes mindfulness because it depends on (1) directly perceiving the experience of breathing in the present and (2) awareness that experience (such as mind wandering) is happening, which enables a return of attention to the breath whenever attention drifts. Therefore, although counting is not necessary for mindfulness, we propose mindfulness contributes to accurate breath counting.</p></sec><sec><title>EVALUATING THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY OF BREATH COUNTING AS AN INDEX OF MINDFULNESS</title><p>To test the proposition that breath counting measures mindfulness, we followed the recommendations of <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref> for establishing such construct validity. We reasoned that if breath counting measures mindfulness, then those skilled in breath counting should exhibit all the theorized consequences of mindfulness, including more meta-awareness, less mind wandering, better mood, and greater non-attachment. The theory behind each of these links in mindfulness&#x02019;s nomological network is briefly reviewed.</p><sec><title>Evaluating convergent validity</title><p>Mindfulness is not the absence of stimulus-independent thought. Rather, both can coexist according to traditional mindfulness styles with instructions to be aware of the present moment experience of stimulus-independent thoughts arising and passing: &#x0201c;(one skilled in mindfulness) knows a distracted mind to be &#x02018;distracted&#x02019;... a lustful mind to be &#x02018;lustful&#x02019;... an angry mind to be &#x02018;angry&#x0201d;&#x02019; (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">An&#x00101;layo, 2003</xref>). Mindfulness, then, should associate with greater meta-awareness (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Fox et al., 2012</xref>), particularly of emotions (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Nielsen and Kaszniak, 2006</xref>) and mind wandering, where meta-awareness is defined as the explicit recognition of the current contents of consciousness (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Schooler et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we assessed the convergent validity of breath counting with meta-awareness in Study 1.</p><p>Although mindfulness is the presence of present moment awareness rather than the absence of stimulus-independent thought, in certain contexts mindfulness should result in lessened stimulus-independent thought. For example, when one intends to fully attend to an activity involving minimal discursive thought &#x02013; e.g., mindfulness of breathing &#x02013; then awareness of task-unrelated thoughts and their causes (e.g., certain emotions) may lead to their decrease (see Discussion and <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Schooler et al., 2011</xref>). In a similar fashion, mindfulness should likewise attenuate task-unrelated thoughts that purportedly lower mood (&#x0003e;50% of mind wandering, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010</xref>) if they are understood as unnecessary. In support of these theories, previous research has shown self-reported mindfulness is inversely correlated with mind wandering as indexed by the sustained attention to response task (SART; <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Allan Cheyne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek et al., 2012</xref>) and positively correlated with well-being (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Brown and Ryan, 2003</xref>). Therefore, if breath counting accuracy measures mindfulness it should associate with less mind wandering during breath counting and overall, as well as with better mood. We assessed breath counting&#x02019;s convergent validity with mood in Study 2, and with mind wandering in all studies.</p><p>Just as the increased awareness of mindfulness may help lessen stimulus-independent thought, it may also attenuate the influence of certain emotions (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Creswell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2013</xref>), such as wanting (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Berridge et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, awareness decreases the power of erotica to capture attention (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2006</xref>) and lessens the emotion-induced influences of weather on life satisfaction (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz and Clore, 1983</xref>). Therefore, accurate breath counting should associate with non-attachment as demonstrated by a decreased influence of wanting. This prediction is in line with non-attachment&#x02019;s positive association with mindfulness in traditional theory (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">An&#x00101;layo, 2003</xref>) and self-report research (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sahdra et al., 2010</xref>). We tested the convergent validity of breath counting with non-attachment in Study 3.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluating discriminant validity</title><p>In parallel to its convergent validity, we assessed breath counting for discriminant validity by examining its empirical alignment with the theoretical distinctions between mindfulness and established attention constructs such as sustained attention and working memory capacity. Mindfulness practice emphasizes the direct perception of present moment experience, which is a continuously present and changing process (e.g., the felt experience of breathing). In contrast, sustained attention tasks such as the SART emphasize the conceptual detection of infrequent and discrete target content (e.g., detecting a &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; present &#x0003c;5% of total task time). In further contrast, working memory tasks such as the automated operation span task (OSPAN) emphasize the priority-driven maintenance and manipulation of information not present in the current environment (e.g., a string of letters). While each of the three tasks measure an attentional trait by assessing how well a person can maintain a certain attentional set (e.g., holding seven letters in memory while doing math), breath counting should not be highly correlated with the OSPAN or SART, a prediction we assessed in Studies 1 and 2, respectively. Although the SART as an index of mind wandering would ideally be somewhat inversely correlated with breath counting, breath counting&#x02019;s predicted correlates (e.g., history of meditation practice) should nonetheless remain significant correlates after controlling for the SART, a claim we tested in Studies 2 &#x00026; 3. Furthermore, although breath counting ability should be stable over time in the absence of intervention (assessed in Study 2), it should be selectively increased by a mindfulness intervention but unchanged by an intervention aimed to increase working memory (assessed in Study 4).</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluating criterion validity</title><p>Following <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref>, we also assessed breath counting&#x02019;s criterion validity. As they noted, two indices that measure a similar construct should correlate. Therefore, we evaluated whether individuals reporting greater mindfulness on existing mindfulness questionnaires counted breaths more accurately as well (Study 1). We additionally tested for expected group differences by assessing whether long-term meditators counted breaths more accurately than controls (Study 3).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>EVALUATING INCREMENTAL VALIDITY</title><p>Finally, we assessed breath counting&#x02019;s incremental validity relative to extant criteria by testing whether breath counting could explain individual differences in meta-awareness, mind wandering, and non-attachment beyond what could be explained by mindfulness questionnaires (Studies 1 and 3).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>STUDY 1</title><p>In Study 1 we explored the convergent, discriminant, criterion, and incremental validity of breath counting by assessing its correlation with meta-awareness, mind wandering, working memory, and trait mindfulness. We instructed 120 participants to &#x0201c;be aware&#x02026; of the movement of breath&#x0201d; and count their breaths from 1 to 9 repeatedly. With breaths 1&#x02013;8 they pressed one button, and on breath nine they pressed another, measuring counting accuracy. Every &#x0223c;90 s (60&#x02013;120 s range) experience sampling probed state mind wandering and meta-awareness, respectively, with 2 6-point Likert scales, &#x0201c;just now where was your attention? (completely on-task/off-task)&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;how aware were you of where your attention was? (completely aware/unaware).&#x0201d; Participants were then probed for their count.</p><p>Accurate breath tracking was physiologically confirmed in a subset of 52 participants, with mean keypress rate tracking mean breath rate, <italic>r</italic> = 0.99.

Wanting, defined as an incentive motivation to approach, can be irrationally incongruent with cognitive goals, e.g., as occurs in addiction (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Berridge et al., 2009</xref>). When approach contradicts cognitive goals and is unhelpful, it indexes wanting with particular clarity. Therefore, to measure the influence of wanting we assessed how much individuals were slowed by attending to a distractor formerly paired with reward despite their cognitive goal of completing a visual search as quickly as possible. This validated measure of attention capture (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>) parallels the paradigm of operant extinction used to measure wanting in animals (e.g., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Wyvell and Berridge, 2000</xref>), and so we predicted it would correlate inversely with breath counting accuracy &#x02013; supporting convergent validity &#x02013; and do so beyond what could be explained by self-reported mindfulness &#x02013; supporting incremental validity.</p><p>As described in detail elsewhere (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>; Supplementary Material Methods and Supplementary Figure S2), for the training portion of the attention capture task participants were monetarily rewarded when they accurately identified targets highlighted by specific colors.

We reasoned that if breath counting measures mindfulness, than an individual&#x02019;s counting accuracy should increase following training in mindfulness but not training in working memory, a construct found uncorrelated with breath counting accuracy in Study 1.</p><p>We drew training methodology from a growing literature suggesting that mental capacities such as working memory can be improved with practice, as evidenced by neural plasticity and better performance on working memory measures following repeated practice of working memory tasks such as the spatial n-back task (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Jaeggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">McNab et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Davidson and McEwen, 2012</xref>; but see <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Redick et al., 2013</xref>). In the same way that working memory may be improved by repeated practice of working memory tasks, mindfulness may be improved by repeated practice of breath counting if it is indeed a mindfulness task. Therefore, in a randomized controlled trial we tested whether breath counting training &#x02013; but not n-back training or no training &#x02013; could increase counting accuracy and self-reported mindfulness as well as decrease mind wandering.</p><p>Participants were randomized into three training groups, a breath counting training, a spatial n-back training control, and a no-training control. Attrition rates were 27%, 33%, and 15%, making final sample sizes of 22, 20, and 29, respectively (see Supplementary Material Methods and Supplementary Figures S3 and S4 for training protocols and retention details at each study phase; online breath counting training can be viewed at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://webtasks.keck.waisman.wisc.edu/b/demo">http://webtasks.keck.waisman.wisc.edu/b/demo</ext-link>).

Here we validate breath counting as a behavioral measure of mindfulness with findings that extend previous research (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Lutz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">Sahdra et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Braboszcz and Delorme, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Burg and Michalak, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Hasenkamp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Mrazek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Baird et al., 2014</xref>). We found that breath counting accuracy tracked with naturally occurring variations in self-reported mindfulness, distinguished well-practiced meditators from novices, and increased following a mindfulness training.</p><sec><title>CONVERGENT VALIDITY: EVIDENCING BOTH THEORY AND METHODS</title><p>We also provided the first evidence that skill in mindfulness rigorously measured through behavior is related to more meta-awareness, less mind wandering, better mood, and greater non-attachment, in line with theoretical claims that underlie explanations of mindfulness&#x02019;s educational and health benefits. Our novel assessment of mindfulness&#x02019;s relation to non-attachment using attention capture especially highlights non-attachment as a mechanism by which mindfulness may ease addiction (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Bowen et al., 2014</xref>), a disorder in which reward-associated attention capture is elevated (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2013a</xref>). Such convergence of breath counting and mindfulness theory helps substantiate both per <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref>: &#x0201c;we do not first &#x02018;prove&#x02019; the theory, and then validate the test, nor conversely.... Actually the evidence is significant for all parts.&#x0201d;</p><p>One hypothesis to be explored for the convergence of mindfulness with these constructs is awareness-dependent learning and memory. As a specific example, present moment awareness of task-unrelated worry and its consequences &#x02013; such as forecasting dangers that do not occur (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Gilbert and Wilson, 2009</xref>) &#x02013; may form a memory that the worry was unnecessary. In the future, meta-awareness of worry may retrieve that memory, reducing the priority of worrying and thus the working memory resources maintaining it (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Levinson et al., 2012</xref>). Reducing such mind wandering would reduce the negative emotions it triggers (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010</xref>), improving mood. And with fewer negative emotions to fuel it (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Horowitz and Becker, 1973</xref>), mind wandering would reduce further. The same would apply to wanting, resulting in non-attachment.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY: CLARIFYING THE CONSTRUCT OF MINDFULNESS</title><p>To establish the validity of a new construct, it must be distinguished from existing constructs. Our data suggest that mindfulness as indexed by breath counting is not reducible to mind wandering&#x02019;s absence, working memory, or sustained attention, as is evident from the variance in breath counting accuracy unexplained by these measures. How then is mindfulness unique?</p><p>Mindfulness encourages awareness that task-unrelated thoughts are happening as present moment experiences. As a result, mindfulness, and task-unrelated thoughts may coexist. At the same time, since mindfulness encourages direct perception of present experience, we suggest mindfulness may simultaneously reduce task-unrelated thought as a natural byproduct of more fully saturating perceptual resources (Supplementary Material Discussion; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Forster and Lavie, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Levinson et al., 2012</xref>). This perspective can account for the inverse relation we found between counting accuracy and mind wandering without defining mindfulness by the absence of task-unrelated thought.</p><p>Such reduction of mind wandering is putatively independent of working memory (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Lavie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Forster and Lavie, 2009</xref>), further distinguishing mindfulness from working memory tasks and the SART which depend on working memory to block task-unrelated thoughts from awareness (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">McVay and Kane, 2009</xref>). Therefore, this perspective can also explain why mindfulness and working memory capacity are uncorrelated (Supplementary Material Discussion), why n-back training did not improve breath counting accuracy, and why breath counting significantly differentiated long-term meditators and novices even after controlling for individual differences in sustained attention indexed by SART errors. Mindfulness also differs from sustained attention in that it theoretically changes one&#x02019;s relationship with emotions, in line with findings that breath counting accuracy (but not SART errors, <italic>r</italic> = 0.11, <italic>P</italic> = 0.51) predicted less reward-associated distraction.</p></sec><sec><title>CRITERION AND INCREMENTAL VALIDITY</title><p><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Cronbach and Meehl (1955)</xref> observed that construct validity evolves by bootstrapping, wherein a new test is initially validated with existing imperfect tests (e.g., self-report) yet may be ultimately judged to have greater construct validity. For example, the thermometer received initial validation from self-reports of felt temperature, but ultimately outperformed self-reported temperature in predicting the pressure of a heated gas. We too validated breath counting using existing methods &#x02013; mindfulness training and self-report &#x02013; and so it is important to discuss how we navigated their limitations and how breath counting compares with them in predicting the theoretical correlates of mindfulness.</p><p>In theory, training effects result from increasing a targeted quality (e.g., mindfulness). Yet in practice training effects can result from untargeted, non-specific factors such as trainees&#x02019; group interactions or motivation, as has been previously found in mindfulness trainings (e.g., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2012</xref>). Our methods minimized such factors (Supplementary Material Discussion). Evidencing this, we found verbal 3-back performance improved most following n-back training [group &#x000d7; time interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>(2,68)</sub> = 3.72, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03; improvement in n-back training group vs. breath counting and no-training groups, <italic>F</italic><sub>(1,68)</sub> = 6.86, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01] but did not differ following breath counting vs. no training (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1,68)</sub> = 0.32, <italic>P</italic> = 0.58). This suggests the effects of our mindfulness training were not simply due to non-specific factors such as motivation that should have improved performance non-selectively on any task, including the verbal 3-back.</p><p>As mentioned, self-report is vulnerable to confounds such as retrospective bias and demand characteristics. We protected against spurious correlations between self-report and breath counting via replication with bias-resistant methods, as illustrated in our mind wandering data. For example, to decrease retrospective bias, participants reported on mind wandering occurring in the moment instead of the past using experience sampling methods that demonstrate convergent validity with neural measures (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Christoff et al., 2009</xref>). To decrease demand characteristics, we collected mind wandering reports with the IPI weeks before participants realized they might be in a breath counting experiment and experience any demands. Finally, to sidestep self-report biases altogether, we administered the SART which has been validated as an indirect measure of mind wandering (<xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Smallwood et al., 2008</xref>). In all cases, even after self-report bias was reduced, the association between breath counting and mind wandering replicated.</p><p>As construct validity progresses, one expects newer measures to display variance that can better predict the theoretical correlates of the construct (Supplementary Material Discussion). In line with this view, using multiple regression we found that breath counting, over and beyond the FFMQ, predicted non-attachment as indexed by decreased attentional capture by reward-associated distractions. Breath counting also significantly explained an individual&#x02019;s meta-awareness and mind wandering beyond what was possible with the MAAS and FFMQ alone. These data demonstrate breath counting&#x02019;s incremental validity over existing measures for inferring skill in mindfulness.</p></sec><sec><title>FUTURE DIRECTIONS</title><p>Incremental validity notwithstanding, breath counting requires further research on its sensitivity to the more affective dimensions of mindfulness and its specificity to mindfulness vs. established attention constructs. Mindfulness is putatively associated with non-attachment (as evidenced in Study 3) and non-judgment. Therefore, it would be helpful to test, for example, whether decreasing craving increases counting accuracy. Conversely, the validity of breath counting should be questioned if increasing self-judgment about counting errors leads to sustainable increases in counting accuracy. Since breath counting is likely not process pure, it will also be important for future investigations to discriminate what variance in counting accuracy is unrelated to mindfulness and its affective correlates in order to avoid over-interpreting counting accuracy as solely reflecting mindfulness as opposed to other attention constructs as well.</p><p>Nonetheless, the present validation of breath counting is a first step in behaviorally measuring mindfulness that opens many avenues for research. As exemplified here, breath counting can now behaviorally evaluate trainings for their impact on mindfulness <italic>per se</italic> and identify which individual differences accompany mindfulness. It can also start a behavioral investigation on the extent to which mindfulness is a domain-general capacity. To take working memory research as an example, the development of behavioral measures with verbal vs. spatial content has clarified that working memory of words vs. spatial location is similar but distinct. While the difference suggests working memory may partly rely on content-specific abilities, the similarity points to a domain-general working memory capacity used to complete both types of tests (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Kane et al., 2004</xref>). In the same way, breath counting may depend on both breath-specific factors and domain-general mindfulness. Future research correlating breath counting with behavioral measures of mindfulness of diverse content, including emotion, should elucidate the domain-generality and content-specificity of the structure of mindfulness.</p><p>Our initial findings suggest breath counting may be useful not only scientifically as a measurement tool but also clinically as a mindfulness training. As a training that simultaneously measures change in skill, it allows evidence-based tailoring of training on an individual basis. In theory, it could determine the guidance that most improves skill for an individual and insert it in the very moment his or her mindfulness lapses. Since the counting errors signaling these lapses occur with greater frequency than trainees notice on their own, such feedback may increase opportunities to practice voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, a skill William James recognized as fundamental.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>For over 1500 years mindfulness trainees have used breath counting for training in mindfulness.
