In 2015, it was estimated that about 4,292,000 patients with invasive cancer would be newly diagnosed and about 2,814,000 were expected to die.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Although advances in screening and treatments have extended the lifespan of patients with cancer, cancer-related pain remains a problematic symptom in the advanced stages,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> which adversely affects their quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> Cancer pain is complex with numerous mechanisms operating that include inflammatory, neuropathic, ischemic and compressive changes at multiple sites in the body.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Pain can be caused by inflammatory mediators<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> (such as endothelin-1, prostaglandin E, and tumor necrosis factor alpha), which are released from tumor-associated macrophages, mast cells, neutrophils and T lymphocytes. In addition, cancer patients often have disorders of the blood microcirculation and pain can be triggered by vasodilatation, induced by free chemicals and local blood stasis.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> The endothelin-B receptor (ET<sub>B</sub>R) is believed to mediate inflammatory pain and vasodilatation.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> The characteristics of cancer pain vary depending on the duration, location, and type of cancer. Even with the broad availability of analgesics, more than 50% of cancer patients were undertreated for the relief of moderate and severe pain symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup></p><p>One common approach to cancer pain management employs the guideline of the 3-step pain ladder introduced by the World Health Organization (WHO),<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> which suggested that prompt oral administration of nonopioid analgesics with or without adjuvants, low-potency opioids plus nonopioid analgesics with/without adjuvants, and potent opioids plus nonopioid analgesics with/without adjuvants should be used to treat mild pain (Step 1), medium pain (Step 2) and intense pain (Step 3), respectively. Long-term use of analgesics for cancer pain should consider concerns about side effects. Nonopioid analgesics may produce gastrointestinal bleeding, kidney and liver dysfunction, cardiovascular toxicity and allergic reactions. The adverse effects of opioids include constipation, itchiness, urinary retention, nausea, and dizziness. Serious consequences may be coma and respiratory depression. In addition, opioid analgesics may lead to addiction or acute toxicity, affect physiological and psychological well-being, cause social phobia and also a reduced QOL.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has a long history in the treatment malignancies and believes that impediment of collaterals and meridians is the origin of pathogenic of cancer pain. Long-term stagnation of vital energy (<italic>qi</italic>) and stasis of blood are thought to result in &#x0201c;pain due to impediment&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;pain due to lack of nourishment.&#x0201d; TCM treatment for cancer pain involves the use of traditional Chinese medication to restore the balance of the internal environment by reinforcing and adjusting <italic>qi to</italic> circulate through meridians, which connect various internal organs and functions.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Studies have shown that the application of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) and acupuncture increase the peripheral release of endogenous analgesic agents, reduce pain mediator secretion and induce central nervous system (CNS) analgesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> These studies demonstrated that the use of TCM to treat pain triggered by cancer is effective and economical and furthermore produces fewer side effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup></p><p>According to the statement of Wu Shiji, a great master of external treatment in the Qing Dynasty, the external treatment is the same as the endotherapy in theory; CHM for external treatment is also the same as endotherapy. CHM for external treatment can be absorbed through the skin, infiltrate the skin and reach the target meridians for its actions. Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang, a CMWC, is a CHM and composed of <italic>evodia rutaecarpa</italic> (<italic>Wuzhuyu</italic>), <italic>semen sinapis</italic> (<italic>Baijiezi</italic>), <italic>ephedra sinica</italic> (<italic>Mahuang</italic>), and <italic>asarum sieboldii</italic> (<italic>Xixin</italic>). It is designed for cancer pain relief through dredging healthy <italic>qi</italic> to warm and activated blood and by promoting the circulation through the back meridians, which is considered to be the source of <italic>yang qi</italic> (healthy <italic>qi</italic>) and have broad connections with the viscera.

Patients were excluded if they had grave skin lesions, drug allergy, dysfunction of vital organs (heart, liver, and kidneys), mental disorders, severe idiopathic disease, or bad compliance. As a result, a total of 62 patients (32 men and 30 women) aged 39 to 82 years were recruited and randomly allocated into the treatment group (group A) or the control group (group B) (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;31 for each group). The WHO 3-step analgesic ladder for the relief of cancer pain with and without CMWC, named as &#x0201c;Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang&#x0201d; in Chinese, were given to patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively. Written informed consent was obtained from every patient before enrolment and approval for the study was granted by the Ethics Committee of Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (no.

The intensity of the pain score was calculated by measuring the distance in mm between the &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; mark and the patient's mark, producing scores ranging from 0 to 100. VAS scores have been recommended as the following grades (in&#x0200a;mm): no pain (0&#x02013;4), mild pain (5&#x02013;44), moderate pain (45&#x02013;74), and severe pain (75&#x02013;100). NRS: The patients rated their pain from 0 to 10 and the pain level was divided into the following 4 grades: 0 for no pain (grade 0), 1 to 3 for mild pain (grade I, background pain having no significant effects on the activities of daily living (ADLs), 4 to 6 for moderate pain (grade II, significantly interfering with ADLs) and 7 to 10 for excruciating pain (grade III, marked interference with the ADLs).</p></sec><sec><label>2.4.2</label><title>Evaluation of clinical efficacy</title><p>Pain relief was compared before versus 14 days after treatment initiation by using VAS scores to determine the clinical efficacy of treatment.

Although the etiology of cancer has not been completely illustrated, cancer pain relief can be achieved through various strategies, including the 3-step analgesic ladder management and biological and nerve block treatment. Approximately 50% of patients however, do not have their pain effectively controlled for various reasons.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> Regardless of the effectiveness of the 3-step analgesic ladder treatment, some patients fail to achieve pain relief due to intolerable side effects and the prevention of drug addiction.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> Recent research has reported that TCM treatment has good efficacy in alleviating cancer pain and improving the overall QOL of cancer patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> In the present study, cancer patients were treated with a 3-step analgesic ladder with or without CMWC, and the effect of the CMWC on pain relief, analgesic doses, adverse events and QOL of patients were assessed.</p><p>From the perspective of TCM, the etiology and mechanism of cancer pain involves a deficiency of healthy <italic>qi</italic>, invasion of pathogens (evil <italic>qi</italic>), obstruction of channels of healthy <italic>qi</italic> and blood stasis, which results in the accumulation of pain-producing chemicals. Therefore, the principles of TCM for cancer pain focus on strengthening healthy <italic>qi,</italic> expelling evil <italic>qi</italic> and activating and warming blood to treat both the symptoms and pathogens. Previous studies showed TCM together with the 3-step analgesic ladder achieved a total response rate of cancer pain relief greater than 80%.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Our study also showed a significant difference in alleviating cancer pain using &#x0201c;<italic>Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang</italic>&#x0201d; combined with the 3-step analgesic ladder treatment compared with the 3-step ladder alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>). The 4 constituents of the CMWC share common features as well as unique characters. Modern pharmacological research has reported that <italic>Evodia rutaecarpa</italic> (<italic>Wuzhuyu</italic>) can decrease blood pressure, improve the microcirculation, regulate body temperature and has anti-thrombotic, anti-allergic, anti-cancer, analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup><italic>Semen sinapis</italic> (<italic>Baijiezi</italic>) has anti-tussive, expectorant, anti-asthmatic, anti-radiation and anti-inflammatory effects<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> and is attributive to the lung and stomach meridians. <italic>Ephedra sinica</italic> (<italic>Mahuang</italic>) can promote sweating, ventilate lungs to relieve dyspnea, and induce diuresis to disperse swelling.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> It is attributive to the lung, large intestine, and urinary bladder meridians. <italic>Asarum sieboldii</italic> (<italic>Xixin</italic>) is attributive to the lung and kidney meridians. It has been reported that Xinxin can expel heat, relieve pain and dyspnea, strengthen cardiac function, eliminate phlegm, improve the body's metabolism and immune system, and have anti-inflammatory and anti-convulsive effects.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> A combination of these herbs in appropriate proportions is expected to relieve cancer pain by stimulating healthy <italic>qi</italic>, dredging the meridians and collaterals, regulating <italic>qi</italic> and blood, and restoring the internal physiological functions of vital organs in the body.</p><table-wrap id="T8" position="float"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Comparison of the incidence of constipation in the 2 groups (n).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-97-e9965-g010"/></table-wrap><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of meridians in the back of regulating <italic>qi</italic> and blood flow, controlling the functions of internal organs (<italic>zang fu</italic>), improving the body's immune system and relieving pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> The back of the body is considered to be the region where <italic>qi</italic> from the individual internal organs converges and from where the <italic>qi</italic> and blood return to the targeted viscera. There are several important meridians located on the back of the body including: 1) the urinary bladder (UB) meridian on the first (<italic>back shu</italic>) and second line (<italic>shu</italic> point), which has close and broad connections with internal organs; 2) <italic>Du</italic> meridian, starting from the midpoint between the coccyx and the anus. It ascends along the spinal column of the body up to the top of the head and connects with the Ren meridian. The <italic>Du</italic> meridian enters the spine and brain and has associations with the kidneys, spine and brain. It also connects <italic>UB</italic>, <italic>Yang Wei</italic> and <italic>Yang Qiao</italic> meridians as well as several individual internal organs; 3) <italic>Hua Tuo Jia Ji</italic> acupoints located bilaterally in a row alongside the spine, is part of the CNS responsible for consciousness and has a close relationship with individual internal organs, limbs and connective tissues. In addition, the heated CMWC was deposited on the back meridian from T1-T12 vertebrae at the <italic>Du</italic>, <italic>Back Shu</italic> and <italic>Jiaji</italic> points. The role of the CMWC in pain relief was likely to be similar to that of &#x02018;dermatomes&#x02019; associated with the T1-T12 vertebrae, which could activate the sympathetic nervous system and lead to autonomic neuropathy, resulting in disorders pertaining to internal organs, blood flow, alterations in nutrition supply and producing local symptoms in the case of thoracic vertebrae, spinal cord or nerve root damage. Conversely, a lesion of an internal organ could cause the local transmission of pain to the cerebral cortex and into spinal cord, resulting in referred pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the combined use of the 3-step analgesic ladder treatment with CMWC on the back meridians was expected to function in dredging <italic>qi</italic> of internal organs, regulating <italic>yin/yang</italic> and <italic>qi/</italic>blood, unblocking meridians/collaterals, resolving pain and easing the mind. Moreover, our study showed improved ORR of pain relief with the CMWC treatment in different locations (from 100% to 33.33% for upper and lower back pain, respectively, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) compared with before therapy. Larger scale studies with a greater number of patients are needed to compare the effect of CMV for alleviating cancer pain in different locations.</p><p>Currently the WHO 3-step analgesic ladder strategy is the internationally recognized and widely accepted management strategy for cancer pain. However, various side effects related to non-opioid and opioid analgesics, such as nausea and vomiting, urinary retention, constipation, dizziness, respiratory inhibition and even coma, have been reported.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Our study showed that only constipation was found in the treatment group (3-step analgesic ladder with CMWC treatment) and the incidence of constipation was significantly decreased in the treatment group compared with the control group (only 3-step analgesic treatment). Moreover, analgesic doses were significantly reduced after 1 week of CMWC treatment, suggesting the potentiality of using CMWC instead of western medicine in appropriate cancer patients to treat pain at an early stage of cancer. In agreement with other studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> our study showed improved QOL of cancer patients due to less side effects and decreased adverse events using CMWC combined with the 3-step analgesic ladder for cancer pain treatment.</p><p>A limitation of the study was that although the application of CMWCs on back meridians combined with WHO 3-step analgesic ladder treatment was effective in relieving cancer-related pain with reduced doses, less adverse reactions, and improved QOL, the research findings of this study were limited by a small sample size and short duration. It should be noted that in our study the CHW &#x0201c;<italic>Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang</italic>&#x0201d; compress deposited on back meridians was combined with the 3-step analgesic ladder treatment. Further study is needed to address whether &#x0201c;<italic>Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang</italic>&#x0201d; alone is effective in relieving cancer pain in appropriate cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study demonstrated that &#x0201c;<italic>Wen Jing Zhi Tong Fang</italic>&#x0201d;, a CMWC, was effective in alleviating cancer pain, reduced side effects of adjuvant analgesics and improved QOL of cancer patients in combination with the WHO 3-step analgesic ladder treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We are indebted to all of the personnel working in the Department of Oncology, Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ADLs = activities of daily living, CHM = Chinese herbal medicine, CMWC = Chinese medicine warm compress, CNS = central nervous system, ET<sub>B</sub>R = endothelin-B receptor, MR = minimal relief, NR = no effect, NRS = numeric rating scale, ORR = overall response rate, PR = partial relief, QOL = quality of life, TCM = Traditional Chinese medicine, VAS = visual analogue scale, WHO = World Health Organization.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Registration number: ChiCTR-IOR-17012918, Name of trial registry: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This work was supported in part by Terry Fox Fund for Cancer Research (YN2014TF 02), Jie-Ping Wu Medical Foundation (32067001125), the Department of Science and Technology of Guangdong Province (2007B031402010), the Specific Science and Technology Research Fund from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (YK2013B2N13), and the Research Fund from Guangdong Province Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (20132149).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors declare that there are no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Baade</surname><given-names>PD</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
