<bold>Background:</bold> Shoulder pain is a very common complaint that presents in primary care, and there are many different possible causes. Acute pain would normally be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), supplemented with steroid injections (which are often reserved for the treatment of severe or persistent pain). One NSAID, diclofenac, is used frequently for this condition, but other NSAIDs might also be effective. A subgroup of NSAIDs called the Cox-2 selective inhibitors specifically inhibit one particular enzyme (cyclo-oxygenase, shortened to Cox-2) which is involved in inflammation and pain. These drugs are thought to be less likely to cause stomach irritation than other NSAIDs. Therefore the researchers in this study carried out a short-term, three-way clinical trial comparing diclofenac with one particular Cox-2 inhibitor, rofecoxib, and placebo in patients with acute shoulder pain. However, rofecoxib was withdrawn from the market in September 2004 because of evidence that use of the drug was associated with an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, and controversy remains regarding the risk of such events among users of other Cox-2 inhibitors.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> The main aim of this trial was to compare the level of pain relief over seven days of treatment with either diclofenac or rofecoxib, as compared to placebo. The primary outcome measure used in the trial was the proportion of patients achieving a 50% or greater decrease in pain levels over the course of the study, measured using a numerical rating scale. A total of 273 participants were recruited into the trial and at day 7 the proportion achieving a 30% decrease in pain was 38% in the placebo arm, 54% in the diclofenac arm, and 56% in the rofecoxib arm. The differences in this outcome measure between diclofenac and placebo and between rofecoxib and placebo were statistically significant; however, the researchers did not carry out a direct comparison between diclofenac and rofecoxib. The rates of adverse events were roughly comparable between all three arms of the trial, although the study was not originally planned to be large enough to detect differences in the rates of such events, so it is not possible to conclude whether there was any true difference.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The randomization procedures used in the study minimize the possibility of bias in assigning patients to treatment arms. Bias in assessment of outcomes was also minimized by ensuring that steps were taken to prevent investigators and patients from knowing which drugs a particular patient received until the end of the trial. A key limitation of the study is the short follow-up, only seven days, and it is therefore unclear whether efficacy and safety of these drugs would continue for the much longer periods of time (weeks or even months) for which these patients might need pain relief. Finally, patients randomized to the placebo arm received no treatment for the seven days of the study other than acetaminophen or steroid injections (which would result in withdrawal from the trial). This design does not limit interpretation of the data but could be criticized because of concern over whether the patients receiving placebo received adequate pain relief.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> This study provides some data on the efficacy of diclofenac and rofecoxib, as compared to placebo in treatment of this condition. Given that rofecoxib is now withdrawn, the efficacy of this drug is no longer relevant. However, the information from this trial should help in designing future studies of NSAIDs in shoulder pain, for example to define appropriate trial outcomes, sample size, and other aspects of study design.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Dougados M, Le Henanff A, Logeart I, Ravaud P (2007) Short-term efficacy of rofecoxib and diclofenac in acute shoulder pain: A placebo-controlled randomized trial.

A wide range of potential pathoanatomic entities can give rise to shoulder pain, from simple sprains to massive rotator tears [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Most of these different conditions can be adequately diagnosed after careful interview and physical examination of the patient [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Options for the medical management of acute shoulder pain include systemic (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and local (e.g., injection of steroids) approaches. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of injectable steroids and/or the combination of injectable steroids and NSAIDs [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Given the invasiveness of injections, many practitioners prefer an initial trial of oral NSAIDs with injections reserved for patients with persistent pain or severe pain at the time of initial presentation [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite this pragmatic approach, such a procedure was until recently [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] little evaluated. Among the different conventional NSAIDs, diclofenac is one of the most frequently used for such conditions in daily practice [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because of a better gastrointestinal safety profile, coxibs might be preferred in particular in patients at risk of gastrointestinal complications [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Efficacy of rofecoxib 50 mg once daily has been demonstrated in different acute pain human models (e.g., post&#x02013;dental surgery [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], primary dysmenorrhea [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and post&#x02013;orthopedic surgery pain [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]).</p><p>These findings prompted us to conduct a seven-day clinical trial evaluating the short-term symptomatic efficacy of rofecoxib in acute, painful episodes of rotator-cuff syndrome using both potentially negative (placebo) and active (diclofenac) control groups. A secondary but clinically relevant end point was the requirement for local steroid injections. Although one of the study drugs (rofecoxib) was withdrawn from the market in October 2004, the data are being reported now for the sake of completeness and transparency.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>The inclusion criteria were selected to optimize the probability of recruiting patients suffering from an acute painful episode of tendonitis of the rotator cuff. For this purpose, the following criteria were chosen: patients less than 60 years of age, suffering from an acute (less than 7 d), painful (numerical rating scale [NRS] 0&#x02013;10 &#x02265; 5 in which 0 and 10 are the best and worst conditions, respectively), episode occurring in the shoulder area with the following findings at physical examination: no limitation of the glenohumeral external rotation and a painful Job test [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A schema explaining the Job test was provided to all the 47 investigators. Moreover, in order to enter the trial, the patients had to have no contraindication for receiving either diclofenac or rofecoxib (e.g., history of NSAID allergy; renal, liver, or cardiac failure; or pregnancy).</p><p>Any NSAID intake other than the study drug was prohibited during the study. In case of previous intake, the NSAIDs had to be discontinued at least 3 d before enrollment. During the baseline visit, the following information was also collected: lateralization (right- or left-handedness) and history of progression of the symptoms with the a priori defined following four categories: (i) no history of chronic pain before this episode; (ii) history of chronic pain before this first acute episode; (iii) history of similar acute episodes without any history of chronic pain between episodes; and (iv) history of similar acute episodes with history of chronic pain between episodes. Therefore, the date of onset of shoulder disease was not always that of the current episode.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Design</title><p>The study was a double-blind, 7-d randomized controlled trial comparing placebo, rofecoxib 50 mg, and diclofenac 150 mg using a double-dummy technique. The design of the study was approved by the ethics committee of Cochin Hospital (Paris, France). All patients gave their written informed consent before entering the trial. The study was conducted in 47 centers from 15 April 2003 to 16 March 16 2004.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Study drugs.</title><p>After confirmation of patient eligibility and after written informed consent was obtained, patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo, diclofenac 50 mg three times daily, or rofecoxib 50 mg once daily.

The original trial protocol was referring to a &#x0201c;clinically relevant&#x0201d; definition of the primary outcome (e.g., a success defined by a sustained improvement of at least 50% and an absolute level of pain of 30 or less [0&#x02013;100 normalized scale]). While the recruitment of patients was still ongoing and based on discussion concerning the potential loss of statistical power by using a dichotomous variable instead of a continuous variable, an amendment was proposed and accepted by the ethical committee to redefine the primary variable as the mean changes in pain during the study. Since both techniques resulted in similar findings, we are presenting here the results according to the original trial protocol. For this purpose, a diary was provided to the patient in order to collect twice a day (in the morning and in the evening) his/her pain intensity over the 12 previous hours (&#x0201c;nocturnal&#x0201d; pain collected in the morning and &#x0201c;diurnal&#x0201d; pain collected in the evening) using a 0&#x02013;10 NRS.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Secondary outcome measures.</title><p>Functional impairment and patient's global assessment were considered as secondary symptomatic outcome measures. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline and after 7 d by the same investigator, and functional impairment and patient's global assessment were collected. Functional impairment was evaluated using the function subscale of Neer's index [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This scale consists of ten questions related to daily activities (1, use back pocket; 2, perineal care; 3, wash opposite axilla; 4, eat with utensil; 5, comb hair; 6, use hand with arm at shoulder level; 7, carry 10&#x02013;15 pounds with arm at side; 8, dress; 9, sleep on side; 10, do usual work). For each question, a score of 0 was assigned if the activity could be performed without any difficulty, 1 with some difficulty, 2 with marked difficulty, 3 with great difficulty (requiring assistance), and 4 if impossible. Therefore, this scale ranges from 0 to 40.</p><p>Patients' global assessments were evaluated using three different techniques. In one, at the baseline and the final visits, patient's global assessment of disease activity was collected by the following question &#x0201c;considering all the ways your shoulder disease affects you, mark an (X) in the appropriate box for how well you are doing&#x0201d; and the following potential answers 0, very well; 1, well; 2, fair; 3, poor; and 4, very poor. For the analysis, this variable was considered as a continuous one and normalized from 0 = best condition to 100 = worst condition.</p><p>In a second technique, at the final visit, patient's global assessment on her/his relative condition was collected by the following question: &#x0201c;compared to when you started the study, how have you been during the last 48 hours?&#x0201d; and the following potential 15 answers from &#x02212;7, very great deal worse to +7, very great deal better. For the analysis, we considered this variable as a dichotomous one (e.g., improvement yes/no in which an improvement was considered for the patients answering at least &#x0201c;good deal better&#x0201d;).</p><p>In a third technique, at the final visit, acceptable symptom state was assessed by the following question: &#x0201c;considering your current level of pain and functional impairment, if you were to remain for the next following months as you were during the last 48 hours would this be acceptable or unacceptable to you?&#x0201d; and the potential following answers 0, acceptable; 1, not acceptable.</p><p>Moreover, the requirement for rescue therapies (e.g., acetaminophen intake and/or local injection of steroids) was also considered as a secondary outcome measure of efficacy.</p><p>At baseline and final visit, blood pressure and body weight were systematically collected and at final visit, the investigators checked for tolerability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size needed in order to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between NSAID and placebo using the pain intensity (mean of nocturnal and diurnal pain) was calculated. A success was a priori defined by a sustained improvement of at least 50% and an absolute level of pain 30 or less (on a 0&#x02013;100 normalized scale). The analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier technique in which the event was defined by the time the patient fulfilled the above definition of improvement in pain with such an improvement sustained until the end of the study. Based on information on changes in pain in previously reported trials [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of patients achieving such an improvement was expected to be around 40% in the active group. Since, to our knowledge, no information was available in the literature concerning the placebo group, we a priori and arbitrarily expected a 20% success rate in the placebo group. Thus a sample size of 82 patients per treatment group would allow demonstration of this difference with an alpha level of 0.05 and power of 0.80 two-tailed).</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization: Sequence Generation</title><p>A computer-generated randomization sequence assigned participants in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive rofecoxib, diclofenac, or placebo using a block size of six.

The results are expressed as Kaplan-Meier estimates of the percentage of success per treatment group at day 7. The primary analysis consisted in the comparison between rofecoxib and placebo groups using the log-rank test. As a secondary analysis, diclofenac was also compared to placebo according to the same definition of success.</p><p>Exploratory analyses were also performed using the same approach (life table analysis) but with different definitions of event (success): time to reach an improvement of 50%; time to reach an improvement of 50% and such an improvement is maintained during the remaining days of the study; time to reach an absolute level of pain &#x02264; 30; and time to reach an absolute level of pain &#x02264; 30 and such a good condition is maintained during the remaining days of the study.</p><p>The continuous secondary variables are also expressed in normalized units using a 0&#x02013;100 scale in which 0 = best condition and 100 = worst condition.

The observed treatment effect in the a priori selected outcome variable (i.e., 54% and 56% versus 38% in the diclofenac and rofecoxib versus placebo groups) reached statistical significance and was also close to the a priori expected treatment effect (i.e., a difference of 20% between active and placebo). The interpretation of results is made difficult by the fact that there is no clear consensus on the primary outcome variable which should be chosen in this type of study. However, the positive and statistically significant results in favor of NSAIDs in the secondary outcome variables, especially the requirement for steroid injections, support the primary analysis. Finally, the interpretation of the results should also take into account issues related to both the eligibility criteria, the outcome measures, and the choice of the study drugs (in particular the placebo).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Eligibility Criteria</title><p>There is no current, formal recommendation for conducting clinical trials in shoulder pain syndrome, at least to our knowledge. The design of the currently reported trial was based on knowledge of the disease and of the commonly used outcome variables in musculoskeletal disorders. Concerning the disease, reviews on diagnostic criteria for shoulder pain conclude that current diagnostic tools are not evidence based [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The main objective when establishing exclusion criteria of the present study were to try to avoid the inclusion of patients suffering from glenohumeral osteoarthritis and/or adhesive capsulitis. For this purpose, we excluded patients over 60 years old and patients with an abnormal glenohumeral external rotation (the most commonly limited range of motion in osteoarthritis and/or adhesive capsulitis [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). The second objective was to try to avoid patients with massive rotator cuff tears and/or ruptures. Based on the data found in the literature, we considered that the Job's test was the most discriminant for this purpose [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>While designing the trial, concerning the choice of the outcome measures used in this trial, we considered three key aspects: Which domain? Which instrument? Which analysis? The ultimate goal of any therapeutic intervention for shoulder pain is the restoration of pain-free function [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Based on this objective, we focused our research on the three domains commonly selected in musculoskeletal disorders, i.e., pain, functional impairment, and the patient's global assessment. For each of these domains, we selected specific tools, items, and/or instruments we considered to be the most adequate. For the domain &#x0201c;pain,&#x0201d; it seemed important to collect its degree of severity both during the night and during daily activities. There is no consensus related to the optimal questionnaire evaluating shoulder disability [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The scoring system proposed by Neer is a composite index combining the information from four different domains: pain, range of motion, functional impairment, and patient's global [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. This scoring system is frequently used for the evaluation of orthopedic procedures. For our trial we considered that the function subscale was appropriate, since it is relevant and simple to use. Finally patient's global assessment is an important domain to consider, as was recently re-emphasized during a meeting about rheumatology and methodology for trials [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In our study, the patient's global assessment was evaluated in different ways. First, we used a &#x0201c;conventional&#x0201d; approach by evaluating the changes during the study of the current status of the patient using a 5-point Likert scale [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Second, we evaluated the concept of minimum clinically important improvement [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] by questioning the patient at the end of the study about the clinical relevance of the changes she/he noted during the study [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thirdly, we also evaluated the concept of patient-acceptable symptom state by questioning the patient at the end of the trial about her/his acceptability of the current status [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The report results also anticipated considering that presentation at an individual level is probably more relevant than presentation at a group level [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore, instead of choosing mean changes as the primary variable, we selected the presentation at an individual level. There are several possibilities of presentation of results at an individual level: the first step is to choose between the concept of responder (to be in a better condition) and the concept of status (to be in a good condition). The concept of status seemed to be more relevant [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and more appropriate in acute painful conditions in which the main objective is to attain a pain-free condition [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, the onset of action is also important to consider. This concept (to feel good as soon as possible and to maintain such a good condition during the study) was the rationale of the choice of the primary variable used in this study.</p><p>The choice of the threshold of 30/100 in degree of severity of pain below which the patient considers her/his status as acceptable was arbitrarily chosen but was close to other patient-acceptable symptom state thresholds recently reported [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study Drugs (Placebo Arm)</title><p>Because of the huge variability of symptoms in most painful musculoskeletal disorders, a placebo arm is usually encouraged in order to facilitate the interpretation of the results. Such a placebo arm seems acceptable from an ethical point of view if the patient has the opportunity to obtain an optimal rescue therapy. This was the case in this trial during which a persistent painful condition was treated by use of acetaminophen and if necessary by local injections of steroids.</p><p>Despite the fact that we did not perform formal comparative statistical testing, data obtained in this trial are in favor of a similar treatment effect for rofecoxib and diclofenac. However, we have to re-emphasize the fact that because of cardiovascular safety concerns, rofecoxib has been withdrawn from the market. This study, conducted during a very short period of time without further follow-up of patients, cannot contribute toward the assessment of safety.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Generalizability</title><p>Based on this study, it is hard to generalize the obtained results with regard to both the study drugs and clinical condition being evaluated. In particular, such a study does not allow a conclusion that any NSAID at any dose might be beneficial in such conditions. Also, such a study does not allow conclusions to be made that positive clinical benefit may be identical in another musculoskeletal condition (such as epicondylitis or achilleus tendinitis).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>A Cochrane review on therapeutic interventions for acute shoulder pain currently does not include an estimate of the treatment effect of NSAIDs for this particular condition [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A recent systematic literature review found inconclusive evidence on the effects of oral NSAIDs in people with shoulder pain [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Positive results with other NSAIDs/coxibs have been reported, but only in open and/or comparative trials [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. A single trial, using a prospective placebo design (similar to the currently reported one), compared the two-week symptomatic efficacy of celecoxib 200 mg twice daily and naproxen 500 mg twice daily versus placebo, and showed similar results with a superiority of both celecoxib and naproxen when compared to placebo [<xref rid="pctr-0020009-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Finally, other studies are needed in order to evaluate the best dose regimen and the best therapeutical strategy, in particular whether it might be more clinically relevant to perform as the first step an NSAID/coxib intake and thereafter (in case of failure) a local injection of steroids (as has been evaluated in this trial) versus a local injection of steroids without oral drugs as the first step versus the combination of oral drug and local injection of steroids.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020009-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020009.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(50 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020009-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol (Original)</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020009.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(413 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020009-sd003"><label>Trial Protocol (Amendment)</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020009.sd003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(384 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>
