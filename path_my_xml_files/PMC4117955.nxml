In China, the figure is 4%-6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Severe chronic constipation is defined as two or fewer spontaneous, complete bowel movements (SCBMs) per week, hard stool and a sensation of straining during defecation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Due to their widespread use, laxatives are an available choice for constipated patients. However, a high level of dissatisfaction has been reported for laxatives; specifically, evidence supporting the lasting effect of laxatives is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A study of PEG3350 showed that 38.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;14.1&#x000a0;days after the cessation of PG3350, 29 of 47 (61.7%) patients needed to take additional constipation treatment interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A survey of 744 patients with chronic constipation in Europe showed that almost half were using alternative treatments (homeopathy, massage and acupuncture), and nearly 90% of respondents expressed interests in new therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>With a history of thousands of years, acupuncture has long been used to treat constipation in China. The systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] we have published concluded that acupuncture was safe for chronic functional constipation and might improve weekly spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs), the quality of life, and relevant symptoms. However, the evidence was limited by the small sample size and the methodological quality. A pilot study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;60) we have finished showed that 31.67% patients had 3 or more weekly SBMs after 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. By the third month, 40% patients still had 3 or more weekly SBMs, which reflected the lasting effect (effect post treatment) of acupuncture (to be published).</p><p>This report is a protocol of a phase-II trial aiming to evaluate the effect of electroacupuncture (EA) versus prucalopride for severe chronic constipation. The World Gastroenterology Organisation recommends prucalopride for patients for whom previous laxative use failed to provide satisfactory relief [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was also considered effective and safe in a randomised controlled trial conducted in the Asia-Pacific region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, the use of prucalopride as the control drug in this trial is reasonable. The objective is to compare the effect of EA versus prucalopride for severe chronic constipation. We will also observe how many patients will not need additional medicine until the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> month post treatment. The safety and acceptance of EA will be simultaneously evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a prospective randomised controlled trial. It will be conducted from April 2014 to August 2015 at 14 hospitals around China<sup>a</sup>. Five hundred and sixty participants are planned to be recruited via advertisements in newspapers, television, websites and posters. After being diagnosed by physicians of the gastroenterology or anorectal departments, participants will receive a 2-week long assessment (the stool diary). Randomisation will be performed centrally by the Clinical Evaluation Centre of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing, and eligible participants will be randomised into the EA group or the control group. After the baseline assessment has been carried out and the informed consent has been obtained, a randomisation number will be sent to the acupuncturist by phone or online. The statisticians, outcome assessors, and physicians will be blinded to the allocation. The flowchart of the trial is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The duration of the trial is 34&#x000a0;weeks, including a 2-week long baseline assessment period (week-2-0), 8-week long treatment period (week 1&#x02013;8), and 24-week long follow-up period (week 9&#x02013;32). The time frame of the trial is presented in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The trial protocol is in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by the review board and ethics committee of the participating hospitals.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Therapies other than the treatment regimen are prohibited during the trial.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Treatment group</title><p>The acupuncture regimen is based on the Chinese literature from the past 20&#x000a0;years, our pilot trial and specialist consensus. The point regimen (points used for every participants of EA group) includes bilateral ST25, SP14 and ST 37. Moreover, BL33, DU20 and DU24 could be used according to the individual situation. BL 33 could be used for straining and incomplete evacuation. DU20 and DU24 could be used for anxiety and depression.</p><p>For ST25 and SP14, the needle will be inserted vertically to the abdominal muscles. The acupuncturist can feel resistance from the tip of the needle when touching the muscles and continues to insert it to a depth of 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;mm and stops. For ST 37, the needle will be inserted vertically to a depth of 25&#x000a0;mm. The needle will be manipulated with an even lifting and twisting method three times to achieve the sensation of deqi (patients having a sour and distension sensation). For DU20 and DU24, the needle is obliquely inserted back towards the galea aponeurotica to a depth of 40&#x000a0;mm. The needle is manipulated with an even lifting and twisting method three times to achieve the sensation of deqi. If BL33 is needed, all points could be simultaneously needled when participants are in the lateral decubitus position. The site 0.5-1&#x000a0;cm outside and above the 3rd posterior sacral foramina will serve as the inserting site. The needle is inserted at the inserting site inward and downward at a 30&#x02013;45 degree angle to a depth of 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mm.</p><p>An electric stimulator will be placed on the pair of ST25 and SP14 points with a spare-dense wave, 10/50&#x000a0;Hz, 0.1&#x02013;1.0&#x000a0;mA (for BL33, the intensity is 0.5-2.0&#x000a0;mA). For ST37, DU20 and DU24, the needles will be manipulated with an even lifting and twisting method every ten minutes, and three manipulations will be used for each participant in all. Patients will be given one session per day for 30&#x000a0;min, 5 sessions/week for the first 2&#x000a0;weeks, and 3 times/week for the next 6&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Control group</title><p>Prucalopride Succinate (Janssen S.P.A) will be taken orally at a dose of 2&#x000a0;mg/day before breakfast for 8&#x000a0;weeks.

According to our pilot trial and the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the proportion of participant having &#x02265;3 SCBMs averaged over week 3&#x02013;8 was 31.6% for the EA group and 30.9% for the prucalopride group. The figure for the placebo group was 12.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Thus, a non-inferiority margin of 10% is reasonable. To assess the non-inferiority between the treatment and control groups, a sample size of 276 for each group will be sufficient, with a one-sided 5% level of significance, a power of 80% and allowing for a 20% dropout. In this trial, we aim to recruit 560 participants, 40 for each hospital.</p><p>The data from the 14 centres will be pooled, and the Clinical Evaluation Centre of the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing will conduct the statistical analysis using the SAS 9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US) and SPSS Ver.13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software. The data analysis is based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. All statistical analyses will be two-sided tests except for the primary outcome. The level of significance will be established at 0.05. Continuous data will be represented by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum value, and maximum value; categorical data will be represented by percentages. To compare two independent samples, a t-test or nonparametric test will be used for continuous data, and a chi-square test/the Fisher exact test/nonparametric tests will be used for categorical data. For the primary outcome, the CMH test will be used to avoid the centre effect. The analysis methods for secondary outcomes are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.
