</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par7">Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is a once-daily (QD) oral antiepileptic drug (AED) approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 21 April, 2009 (Zebinix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; BIAL-Portela &#x00026; C<sup>a</sup>, S.A., S. Mamede do Coronado, Portugal), as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures (POS), focal seizures according to the new classification of the International League Against Epilepsy, with or without secondary generalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Currently, ESL is approved in 43 countries (31 of the European Economic Area and 12 non-European Economic Area countries, including USA and Canada), and is currently marketed in 22. Eslicarbazepine acetate (Aptiom<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA) has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive therapy (November 2013) and monotherapy (August 2015) in adults with POS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Recently, the EMA approved ESL (Zebinix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for monotherapy in the treatment of POS in adults and as adjunctive therapy in children aged above 6&#x000a0;years with POS.</p><p id="Par8">During the clinical development program, four pivotal phase III, randomized, controlled studies (BIA-2093-301, -302, -303, -304) assessed the efficacy and safety of adjunctive ESL for adult patients with refractory POS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. An analysis of pooled (pool reviewed and approved by the EMA) safety data (-301, -302, and -303) has been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and, more recently, Biton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] published a pooled analysis of three phase III studies (-301, -302, and -304) [pool reviewed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration].</p><p id="Par9">The main purpose of this work is to provide an overview on the safety profile of ESL by expanding the information obtained from several clinical studies including two phase I studies (renal or hepatic impairment subjects), one phase III study (elderly patients), and a post-hoc pooled analysis of safety data of four phase III studies (-301, -302, -303, -304) to that obtained by the pharmacovigilance activities gathered during 6&#x000a0;years of real-life clinical experience. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an overview of the safety of ESL from clinical studies to post-marketing experience is reported. Moreover, we discuss the safety profile of ESL in special populations such as renal and hepatic impairment subjects, elderly patients, and pregnant women.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Eslicarbazepine Acetate</title><p id="Par10">After oral administration, ESL undergoes extensive first-pass hydrolysis to its major active metabolite eslicarbazepine, representing approximately 95% of circulating active moieties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Maximum plasma concentrations of eslicarbazepine are attained 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h post-dose and steady-state plasma concentrations are achieved after 4&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days of QD dosing, consistent with an effective half-life in the order of 20&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h. In studies in healthy subjects and adult patients with epilepsy, the eslicarbazepine apparent half-life of elimination was 10&#x02013;20 and 13&#x02013;20&#x000a0;h, respectively. A study in healthy volunteers showed that in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) there was a smaller apparent peak-to-trough fluctuation of eslicarbazepine (1.5) compared with plasma (2.9), with a longer apparent half-life (24.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8.1&#x000a0;h), and with just minor exposure to both oxcarbazepine or R-licarbazepine in plasma or CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The smaller peak-trough fluctuation in the CSF compared with plasma is explained by a slower brain disposition and elimination rates and a smaller difference between the rates of these processes in relation to the plasma compartment. Indeed, the maximum plasma concentration in CSF is achieved at 12&#x000a0;h, that is half of the time range (24&#x000a0;h), meaning that the amount of ESL eliminated from the CSF balances the amount 12&#x000a0;h after (time to maximum plasma concentration&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;h, half-life&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24.8&#x000a0;h). However, in plasma, the maximum plasma concentration is attained at 2.4&#x000a0;h and a fast disposition was observed compared with the elimination phase (time to maximum plasma concentration&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.4&#x000a0;h, half-life&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15.9&#x000a0;h) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Food did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine, meaning that ESL tablets may be taken with or without food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Eslicarbazepine acetate tablets can be taken either as whole or as crushed, as was shown in a bioequivalence study with ESL 800&#x000a0;mg crushed or intact tablets in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Studies in humans have shown that drug&#x02013;drug interactions between ESL and other AEDs are unlikely to be clinically relevant in most cases, although dosage adjustments may be required if ESL is administered concomitantly with carbamazepine and phenytoin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; ESL also may decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives and, therefore, additional non-hormonal forms of contraception are recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Regarding statins, there was a decrease in exposure to simvastatin and rosuvastatin when co-administered with ESL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Eslicarbazepine is thought to act by stabilizing the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels, with greater selectivity for the inactive state of the channel vs. the resting state, compared with carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Additionally, eslicarbazepine does not share with carbamazepine the ability to alter fast inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels, but rather appears to modify the kinetics and voltage dependence of slow inactivation states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Eslicarbazepine also shows a 10- to 60-fold higher potency for the blockade of low- and high-affinity hCav3.2 inward currents when compared with carbamazepine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis demonstrated that as the ESL dosage and eslicarbazepine plasma concentrations increase, the seizure frequency decreases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pooled Analysis of Four Phase III Studies</title><p id="Par14">This is a post-hoc pooled analysis of safety data from four pivotal phase III epilepsy studies (BIA-2093-301 [NCT00957684], BIA-2093-302 [NCT00957047], BIA-2093-303 [NCT00957372], and BIA-2093-304 [NCT00988429]; registered at ClinicalTrials.gov).

In general, ESL was well tolerated by subjects in both groups. Of the 36 AEs reported, three were considered to be drug related: nausea in a subject in the hepatic impairment group and two events of fatigue in the healthy control group. Seven AEs were assessed to be of moderate intensity and 28 to be of mild intensity. There was one SAE described as hepatic encephalopathy secondary to increased protein intake (unlikely related) in the liver-impaired group.

The most frequent reported ADR terms were hyponatremia (10.2%), seizure (5.8%), dizziness (4.1%), rash (2.6%), fatigue (2.1%), and nausea (1.8%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Cases of off-label use included overdose (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;111), unapproved indication (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;92), use in monotherapy (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;65, not approved within timeframe of data analysis), inappropriate starting dose (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46), use in pediatric population (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40, not approved within timeframe of data analysis), and drug administration error (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A total of 239 cases were reported as &#x02018;hyponatremia&#x02019; or &#x02018;blood sodium decreased&#x02019; (188 serious and 51 non-serious) [Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Serious and non-serious adverse events classified within the SOC psychiatric disorders represented 7.4% of all ADRs reported.

Four cases of suicide attempt (two fatal cases) had been observed. Cardiac disorders were also infrequently reported (21 cases, mostly bradycardia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Considering the skin and subcutaneous disorders, rash (generalized and pruritic) represented about 3.8% of all ADRs registered.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par36">Pooled safety data from the four phase III studies and from specific studies in special populations together with those obtained from 6&#x000a0;years of post-marketing experience were analyzed to confirm the assessment of the safety profile of ESL. This approach allows the assessment of safety data in a broader population and in more &#x02018;realistic clinical conditions&#x02019; because it combines the data obtained from strict controlled, double-blind, phase III studies with uncontrolled spontaneous reports from post-marketing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par37">A dose-dependent increase in the overall incidence of TEAEs, TEAEs leading to discontinuation, and ADRs with the increase in ESL dosage was observed in this full integrated analysis. These results are in agreement with those obtained from individual phase III trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and corroborate with previous pooled analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The total discontinuation rate for ESL patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1186) was 15.8% (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), which is low compared with withdrawal rates reported with oxcarbazepine, which ranged from 12 to 67% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Biton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which does not include study -303, reported a similar ESL discontinuation rate (17.5%). Moreover, despite somnolence and headache being common TEAEs, their relationship to discontinuation was minor, when compared with dizziness, ataxia, nausea, and vomiting.</p><p id="Par38">Beyond these four phase III studies, the safety profile of ESL in adult patients was also evaluated in special populations, with special attention to renal and hepatic impairment and elderly patients. The phase I study performed in subjects with renal impairment demonstrated that clearance of ESL is dependent on renal function and, therefore, during treatment with ESL, dose adjustment is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance &#x0003c;60&#x000a0;mL/min. Hemodialysis removes ESL metabolites from plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and in patients with creatinine clearance&#x000a0;&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;mL/min, ESL use is not recommended. Despite the fact that ESL undergoes extensive hepatic first-pass hydrolysis, moderate hepatic impairment did not affect the pharmacokinetics of ESL. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment. Patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated; therefore, its use is not recommended in this group of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">During its clinical development, the use of ESL in elderly patients (aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) was limited (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9, in a pooled population of four phase III studies) and, as such, a multicenter, open-label, non-controlled, single-arm study was performed (BIA-2093-401) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The highest incidence of hyponatremia, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to study discontinuation in elderly patients was not unexpected given the higher co-morbidities in this age group. Nevertheless, no special concern is adopted to elderly patients when compared with other aged groups and no dose adjustment of ESL is needed in the elderly population if the renal function is not disturbed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Finally, current data of ESL exposure in pregnant women are limited, and for that reason it is recommended that if women receiving ESL become pregnant or plan to become pregnant, the use of ESL should be carefully re-evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">The incidence of rash, which is a common idiosyncratic reaction with AEDs, seems to be low in patients treated with ESL and dose dependent (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). In the post-marketing, it occurred in 3.8% of the reports, which is in accordance with incidence values found for pooled population of phase III studies (1.5 and 4.9% for ESL 800 and 1200&#x000a0;mg, respectively) and elderly patients (2.8%).</p><p id="Par41">There were two cases of potential drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome that occurred during the clinical trial (BIA-2093-301) and two other cases from PMS. The first two patients, recently described by Biton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], had combinations of AEs that may potentially met the RegiSCAR criteria for DRESS syndrome. Both cases were identified as &#x02018;potential DRESS&#x02019; as no confirmation on diagnosis was identified by the reporter.</p><p id="Par42">Regarding post-marketing DRESS cases, the first refers to a 60-year-old male patient, bedridden as a result of multi-infarction dementia, with a history of several episodes of febrile exanthema and allergy to paracetamol and levetiracetam. The patient had been taking ESL for 5&#x000a0;days and further developed febrile exanthema, which worsened 10&#x000a0;days later owing to a hemorrhagic exanthema. Causality cannot be assessed properly because of multi-drug treatment, pre-existent allergy to levetiracetam, and recurring febrile exanthemas in the past. The dermatological expert confirmed that DRESS was a probable diagnosis in this case with concomitantly used drugs or infection as plausible alternative causes. The second PMS case refers to a 16-year-old female patient who developed &#x02018;cutaneous eruption&#x02019; primarily on the trunk and left arm associated with face edema, headache, and hyperthermia 12&#x000a0;days after exposure to ESL (Zebinix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). Concomitant medication included lamotrigine and clobazam. The dermatological expert confirmed that DRESS was a possible diagnosis in this case, possibly related to ESL.</p><p id="Par43">In phase III studies, hyponatremia &#x0003c;125&#x000a0;mmol/L was reported in &#x02264;2% of patients taking ESL, whilst in post-marketing hyponatremia/blood sodium decreased represented 14.1% of ADRs reported. Most of the PMS cases were commonly in the range of 120&#x02013;129&#x000a0;mmol/L, nevertheless in 33 (13.8% of these cases), the sodium levels were below 120&#x000a0;mmol/L and complications including seizure, confusional state, nausea, vomiting, and hypertension were reported in about 50% of these cases. More than half of the hyponatremia cases (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;140, 58.6%) occurred when ESL was given at daily doses higher than 1200&#x000a0;mg. Other cases occurred with drug administration errors, including no up-titration, unapproved use, or the result of concomitant medication (e.g., diuretics) or intercurrent illness (e.g., renal disease) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Changes in mean clinical laboratory parameters did not reveal clinically relevant findings.</p><p id="Par44">Data from literature demonstrate an interaction of ESL with other AEDs by an inducing effect on the metabolism of drugs (carbamazepine, phenobarbital, topiramate), which are primarily eliminated by metabolism through CYP3A4 or conjugation through the UDP&#x02013;glucuronosyl (lamotrigine) or inhibiting properties against CYP2C9 (phenytoin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Plasmatic concentrations of oral contraceptives and simvastatin may also be affected by ESL most likely caused by an induction of CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The PMS safety data collected during these 6&#x000a0;years did not identify any new potential interaction beyond those identified in the clinical development program and described in the literature.</p><p id="Par45">Psychiatric AEs such as anxiety, aggressive behavior, irritability, and depression have been associated with AED therapy. Recently, published data demonstrated that patients receiving sodium channel-blocking AEDs (as ESL) were statistically less likely to develop intolerable psychiatric problems, compared with those taking AEDs possessing other mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. From the four phase III ESL studies, the most frequently reported psychiatric TEAEs were depression and irritability, both demonstrated no dose relationship with ESL (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). From post-marketing experience, confusional state, depression, aggression, and suicidal ideation represented 0.82, 0.71, 0.59, and 0.59% of reported ADRs, respectively. All cases of suicidal ideation were classified as serious because of medical significance, nevertheless for most of them alternative explanations are available, mainly depression and concomitant AEDs. Cognition-related TEAEs were reported uncommonly with ESL treatment during post-marketing experience, similar to that described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The main limitations of this work is the analysis of TEAE incidence of four phase III studies because descriptive statistics was performed and the underlying limitations of post-marketing reports.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par47">Based on four phase III clinical trials and a review of post-marketing safety data, adjunctive therapy with ESL is generally well tolerated, with most AEs being of mild-to-moderate severity. The most common TEAEs (dizziness, somnolence, headache, and nausea) were dose dependent. Dose adjustment of ESL is recommended in patients with creatinine clearance&#x000a0;&#x0003c;60&#x000a0;mL/min, whilst no dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild-to-moderate liver impairment (phase I studies). Elderly patients had the highest incidence of hyponatremia and SAEs when compared with non-elderly patients; nevertheless, no special concern is needed for the elderly population if renal function is not disturbed. Most of the hyponatremia cases in post-marketing experience have been related to high doses of ESL (&#x0003e;1200&#x000a0;mg), drug administration errors, concomitant medications or/and inter-current illness. Limited data are available to draw conclusions about the safety of ESL in pregnant women. Despite the limitations of the global safety databases, the data available support the safety profile of ESL according to the information gathered during clinical development and continue to support the favorable benefit-risk profile of the product.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><sec id="FPar2"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par48">Bial&#x02013;Portela &#x00026; C<sup>a</sup>, S.A., Coronado, Portugal and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc., Marlborough, MA, USA funded the phase III clinical trials reported in this manuscript.
