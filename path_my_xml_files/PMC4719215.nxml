Body mass and body composition as determined via Dual-Energy x-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and follow-up were selected as primary study endpoints. Confounding parameters (i.e., nutritional intake, diseases, medication) that may affect study endpoints were determined every two years.

With respect to body composition, the 5.5-times higher weight gain of college students compared with the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which can be largely attributed to increases of fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], may be the most prominent negative consequence of this new situation. The main reason for this development may be the severe decline of physical activity as a protective factor that was reported to be far above average during this period of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although this problem was primarily reported for US student cohorts, the general problem of drastically reduced physical activity combined with unhealthy life style changes may concern many young adults. Maintaining or increasing the amount of sport and/or physical exercise may be the most effective tool in fighting overweight and obesity in this period of life. Thus, the aim of the study was to determine the&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;preferably&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;isolated effect of physical activity, or, more specifically, exercise on the development of body composition during young adulthood. In order to achieve this goal we accompanied two cohorts of students with fundamentally different exercise patterns (sports vs. dentistry students), but comparable basic condition, setting and situation before and during their study course of&#x02009;&#x02248;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;years. The rational behind selecting these cohorts was based on the assumption that the new unfamiliar setting and the high demands related to the dentistry college course will significantly decrease exercise levels and thus dentistry students may be ideal representatives for corresponding life style changes among young adults. On the other hand, sports students are one of the few cohorts to increase or at least maintaine their former exercise levels. Thus, we expect that dentistry and sports student may be most suitable to determine the effect of occupational related sports and exercise increases or reductions on body composition during young adulthood.</p><p id="Par7">Our primary hypothesis was that 5-year changes in (a) total body fat mass and (b) lean body mass would differ significantly between sports/physical education) students (SPS) and dentistry students (DES) with no significant differences with respect to body mass gain.</p><p id="Par8">Our secondary hypothesis was that 5-year changes in (a) appendicular skeletal muscle mass, (b) abdominal fat mass and (c) aerobic capacity would differ significantly between SPS and DES.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par9">The present study was a randomized, semi-blinded (i.e., researchers and assessors were blinded) 5-year study that determined the effect of exercise (reduction) on health risk factors with particular consideration of body composition during the college years.

Region of interest (ROI) for abdominal body fat was determined between the lower edge of the 12<sup>th</sup> rib and the upper edge of the iliac crest. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (fat- and bone-free proportion of the legs and arms [kg] as assessed by DXA / height [m<sup>2</sup>]: ASSM) was segmented and calculated according to the method described by Baumgartner et al.

Follow-up questionnaires and structured interviews included several sections of the baseline questionnaire; but the main aim of the FU questionnaire and interview was to control for changes of parameters that may confound our results (e.g., lifestyle, physical activities, medication, diseases).</p><p id="Par26">Baseline physical activity, sports- and exercise levels and their changes during the study course were specifically addressed. History, type, volume and self-rated intensity of physical activity, sports and exercise were determined with the specific questionnaires and personal interviews described and validated in recent publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on this questionnaire, several indices were calculated by three sports scientists (WK, MB, SvS) using the Delphi technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For this contribution, four indices were applied: (1) A summary of total physical activity (h/week) under consideration of the type and intensity of this activity, rated on a 7-item scale (activity intensity index: AI) (2) The total exercise index (EI, in min/week) defined by weekly frequency x exercise duration per session. (3) In addition, the latter index was structured according to the type of sports and exercise (either aerobic (EI<sub>aer</sub>) or resistance type (EI<sub>res</sub>) exercise (or neither) in min/week). Finally, (4) Both indices (IEI<sub>aer</sub>; IEI<sub>res</sub>) were further rated for their inherent general intensity of the corresponding exercises by multiplying EI<sub>aer/res</sub> (min/week) &#x000d7; 1 (low), &#x000d7; 2 (moderate), or &#x000d7; 3 (high intensity).</p><p id="Par27">Finally, 4-day dietary protocols were completed in parallel to the questionnaires at baseline, after the 5th semester and at study end.

Completely unlike conventional trials involving an isolated intervention, starting university affects most aspects of students&#x02019; lives.</p><p id="Par29">In order to assess the complete effect of this profound intervention, we tested subjects immediately after the start of their study program and during the last (or penultimate: DES) semester. Since both study protocols have already been described in detail, only a brief characterization of these study programs will be given here.</p><p id="Par30">The regular study period for dentistry is 11 semesters with an average volume of obligatory and facultative lectures, tutorials and required practicals of 32&#x02013;36&#x000a0;h/week during the semester. Due to obligatory dentistry internships, practical work and key examinations, the occupational workload and stress remained at high levels during the 2-month &#x0201c;semester breaks&#x0201d;. Questionnaires provided after the 5<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> semesters to determine the weekly workload directly or indirectly related to the dentistry course revealed an average of 32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9 and 37&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;h/week respectively. However, physical activity during this occupation is relatively low due to the rather immobile sitting and standing positions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition to the dentistry-related workload, subjects reported an average 8.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.1&#x000a0;h/week of physical activity related to earning a living (paid work), predominately during the semester break.</p><p id="Par31">Sports students (i.e., physical education students) aiming to qualify as secondary-school teachers in Bavaria have to be extremely physically active. Besides the theory component, 1,050 obligatory hours of practical sport are required during the 9-semester study curriculum. Including preparation for practical sport tests and leisure time sports activity or exercise increase this amounts up to 11.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.4&#x000a0;h/w. (range: 8&#x02013;17&#x000a0;h/w.). Obligatory core and facultative disciplines (altogether12 disciplines) included all types of exercises (track and field athletics, swimming, gymnastics, dancing, team and individual ball games, skiing, water sports and martial arts), while core disciplines did not differ for males and females. Due to the preparation for tests and increased leisure time sports activity, the total amount of exercise remained at high levels (i.e., 6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3&#x000a0;h/w.) during the semester breaks. Just like dentistry students, sport students reported additional physical activity due to paid work outside the study program that averaged 9.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.2&#x000a0;h/week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistics</title><p id="Par32">The sample size calculation has been described at length elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

In order to evaluate this issue we looked at a study course with high occupational but low physical activity demands, which makes it very likely that exercise will fall significantly during the study period. We compared this group, which may be a typical representative for the situation facing young adults, with sports students, a cohort with increased or at least maintained exercise levels which were already high at the start.</p><p id="Par49">The first, but not unexpected finding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] was that both cohorts generated a comparable general physical activity (but not exercise) that increased slightly during the college years. This is in line with (German) data that reported a reduction in sport and exercise participation but not in regular physical activity during young adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par50">Based on high sports ad exercise participation at baseline, DES students reduced their exercise volume by one third during the study period. Furthermore, and potentially even more importantly, exercise intensity for resistance and aerobic type exercise decreased by 40&#x000a0;%. This finding was supported by the observation that the number of DES taking part in competitions decreased by 57&#x000a0;%; with 63&#x000a0;% stating that they competed at a lower level. Due to a lack of data for detailed changes of exercise pattern during young adulthood in Germany (and the US), we are unable to present a full discussion; on the other hand, representative national reports consistently stated that the erosion of sports participation was greatest during this period of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par51">No relevant changes for dietary intake parameters as determined by dietary records were observed in the present study.

Some studies which addressed long-term changes of sports and exercise in adolescents and/or young adults support this implication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

In the present study both cohorts showed significant weight (i.e., body mass) gain (SPS: 1.9&#x000a0;% vs. DES: 3.4&#x000a0;%), the rate of fat and LBM gains differed significantly between groups, however. While DES gained fat and LBM at a 2:1 rate, body mass changes in the SPS group were completely reflected by LBM changes (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). This finding was supported by data of Crombie et al.

Similarly, female DES gained less body mass and LBM compared with their male counterparts. With respect to other predictors of body mass gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] during the early college period, we are unable to confirm the effect of initial BMI, ethnicity or residency.</p><p id="Par55">In line with present data for young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], physical fitness as determined by cardiorespiratory fitness (i.e., VO<sub>2</sub>max, time under load) significantly decreased in male and female DES, while SPS increased their (even high) cardiorespiratory fitness (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.08).

(a) German students were older and a higher rate of subjects are experienced in independent living thanks to preceding social/military service or education courses. This factor may be important, because potentially lifestyle changes with impact on obesity may happen before the study period. We are unable to address this issue, however most subjects reported no relevant weight changes during this period (b) The DES-group mainly represented a cohort of upperclass children with the excellent grades required to qualify for a demanding university dentistry degree course. Thus, DES students were rather more focused and perhaps less susceptible to lifestyle changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. (c) Although exercise was significantly reduced in the DES group, participation in sports and exercise at study end still exceed the data given for this age group as a whole by far [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. (d) The SPS group by far exceeded the exercise levels of all active or highly active study groups of corresponding degree courses. However, we opted to compare DES versus SPS due to the predictable changes of sports and exercise parameters generated by the corresponding study curriculum. Due to the &#x0201c;occupational exercise&#x0201d; changes in the SPS, our aim of including a group that preferentially increased or at least maintained its high level of exercise was assured. The demanding study curriculum of the DES, on the other hand, strongly suggested there would be a significant decrease in exercise and sport participation in this cohort. Thus, to a certain degree we hoped to avoid subjective errors or cheating through self-reporting which might otherwise confound our results for nutritional intake, general physical activity and leisure time sports and exercise. (e) Our sample size calculation is based on the Metabolic Syndrome Z-Score as a clinical consequence of unfavorable changes of body composition, which was addressed in another publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We opted for this parameter on the assumption that differences between the groups were lower compared with lean or fat mass. Thus in summary, the power to address the present issue was not negatively affected by our approach. (f) We are unable to randomly allocate study starters to the different degrees (i.e., SPS vs. DES), thus our strategy scheduled a randomized selection of study starters within the degree courses themselves. (g) We placed a strong emphasis on detecting possible confounders, but some relevant changes may have escaped our attention. (h) Due to the application of DXA-technique with its (albeit rather low) radiation dosage, we decided to abstain from more frequent assessments of body composition parameters in this young cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par57">In summary, we conclude that the most deleterious effect on fitness and fatness in young college students was closely related to the sharp decreases in exercise volume and&#x02014;probably to an even higher degree&#x02014;intensity. The finding that higher general physical activity is obviously unable to compensate for this reduction in exercise, although energy expenditure may be at least the same, supported this conclusion. Since occupation-related reductions of exercise are not restricted to college students but affect most other young adults who move to take up an apprenticeship or a job, a more favorable environment for sport and exercise has to be created by universities or companies. Most effective would be for public health policy to focus on introducing mandatory exercise programs during working hours. Time-effective aerobic and resistance HIT-exercise protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] may be the most feasible and efficient exercise methods for achieving this aim.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>WK, SvS, MK and JB have made substantial contributions to conception and design, or acquisition of data, or analysis and interpretation of data.
