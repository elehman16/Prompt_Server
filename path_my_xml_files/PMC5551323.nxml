A wide range of graft materials including autografts, allografts, xenografts, and synthetic materials has been used for the treatment of intrabony defects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Alloplasts are synthetic, inorganic, biocompatible, and bioactive bone graft substitutes which promote healing through osteoconduction. Alloplasts offer the advantages of unlimited quantity, no additional surgical site, and no potential for disease transmission.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Bioactive glasses are one of the widely used alloplastic bone graft materials used in the treatment of infrabony defects in humans.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Calcium phosphosilicate (CPS) putty (NovaBone Dental putty; NovaBone products, Alachua, FL) is a premixed composite of bioactive CPS particulate and an absorbable binder which is a combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and glycerin. The volume of active ingredient is 70%, and the putty is delivered in ready-to-use state. PEG and glycerin are both water soluble and to be absorbed from the site in 3&#x02013;5 days. The smaller CPS particles (32&#x02013;125 &#x003bc;m) are more rapidly resorbed, providing the initial burst of Ca and <italic>P</italic> ions. Subsequently, the larger particles (90&#x02013;710 &#x003bc;m) react, being more resistant to resorption, continues process of regeneration. Unlike other bone graft materials, putty form of NovaBone eliminates need for a membrane to stabilize the graft material. It also provides ease of handling the material.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>A different approach to periodontal regeneration is the use of polypeptide growth factors. These factors, abundant in alpha granules of platelets, may control the growth of cells and hence the number of cells available to produce a tissue. Platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) described by Choukroun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] allows one to obtain fibrin membranes enriched with platelets and growth factors. Being autogenous in nature, with no artificial chemical agents involved, makes PRF a safe and inexpensive treatment modality. The physiologic fibrin matrix of PRF, obtained as the result of slow polymerization, has the ability to hold various growth factors and cytokines which are released at the wound site for a prolonged period. This unique structure may act as a vehicle for carrying cells that are essential for tissue regeneration.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of present study is to evaluate periodontal regeneration in intrabony defects using PRF and CPS putty (NovaBone putty) alone and in combination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection</title><p>A total of 45 patients with chronic periodontitis were selected from the Outpatient Department of Periodontics and Implantology, Manubhai Patel Dental College, Vadodara.

The complete regeneration of the periodontium after periodontal treatment modalities has been difficult to achieve because of differences in healing abilities among periodontal tissues.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The present study evaluates the clinical efficacy of combination of NovaBone and PRF in the treatment of intrabony defects in patients with chronic periodontitis, and result shows a significant improvement in clinical and radiographic parameters.</p><p>Smoking, tobacco products, and systemic disease such as diabetes are important factors that were shown to significantly influence the outcomes of regenerative periodontal surgery. Because the present study excludes smokers and only includes patients who were able to maintain acceptable oral hygiene, it may be assumed that the careful patient selection was also responsible for the positive outcomes obtained in all groups.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>While one-wall intrabony defects are characterized by only one limited area for periodontal ligament (PDL) cell proliferation in the apical portions of the defect, angular defect border by at least two bony walls yields lateral sources for PDL cell proliferation and hence may heal in a more predictable way than one wall intrabony defects. Hence, in the present study, 3 wall/2 wall defects were included.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Bioactive glass is widely used alloplast in periodontal therapy. However, they are granular in nature and unreliable as a scaffold matrix.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] To overcome this limitation, in the present study, CPS putty was used which has excellent osteostimulative and osteoconductive property. It also has a transient hemostatic effect, encouraging clot stabilization and promotes healing. Putty does not adhere to the surgical gloves and instruments during manipulation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>PRF consists of a fibrin matrix polymerized in a tetramolecular structure, the incorporation of platelets, leukocyte, and cytokines, and circulating stem cells.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] PRF would be able to progressively release growth factors (such as transforming growth factor-1 &#x003b2;, platelet-derived growth factor-AB, and vascular endothelial growth factor) and glycoproteins (such as thrombospondin-1).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the present study, PRF group showed improvement in clinical and radiographic parameters which in accordance with clinical trials conducted by Sharma and Pradeep,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Thorat <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Bajaj <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In CPS putty (NovaBone putty) treated sites, significant change in GI reduction, PD reduction and CAL gain, defect fill, and defect depth resolution was seen from baseline to 6 months. Similar results were observed in studies conducted by Chacko <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Lovelace <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Froum <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Mengel <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Singh and Mehta[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] also reported that the sites treated with bioactive glass have shown statistically significant gain of attachment levels 6 months&#x02019; postsurgery. This decrease in defect depth and attachment gain can be attributed to soft and hard tissue improvements following resolution of inflammation and osteogenic potential of CPS putty.</p><p>Till now, no study compared the combined use of both autologous PRF and NovaBone putty as graft materials in the treatment of human periodontal intrabony defects. Thus, a direct comparison with other studies was not possible. In the present study, significant change in GI, PD reduction, CAL gain, gingival recession, defect fill, crestal bone level changes, and defect depth resolution was seen from baseline to 6 months. Lakshmi P <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported the combination of PRF and bioactive glass and showed significant difference in pocket depth reduction, CAL gain, and defect depth at the end of 9 months. In contrast, Shukla <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] compared CPS putty with and without platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in infrabony defects and concluded that addition of PRP to CPS putty does not seem to provide any additive benefit.</p><p>In the present study, combination of PRF and NovaBone putty demonstrated more favorable radiographic results compared to PRF or NovaBone putty alone. The precise role played by PRF in the defect fill is difficult to determine but may be explained on the basis of tissue engineering. Bioactive glass in NovaBone can be considered a scaffold for delivery of growth factors in PRF. The negatively charged hydroxyl-carbonate apatite layer attracts proteins such as growth factors and fibrin which act like an organic glue attracting osteoblasts and stem cells to the layer which differentiates to produce bone. Collagen attaches to the surface and embeds in the hydroxyl-carbonate apatite layer, and this, in turn, inhibits epithelial migration. The PDGF and TGF in PRF may work in promoting the growth and differentiation of periodontal and alveolar bone cells rapidly.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p><p>Based on the results of our study, there was no difference when PRF and NovaBone putty were used alone. Hence, considering the cost-benefit ratio, PRF provides comparable regenerative therapy when compared to expensive alloplast materials such as NovaBone putty. NovaBone putty does not provide any clear cut additional benefit when used alone over PRF.</p><p>Certain limitations to the present study such as measurement of clinical parameters are subjective due to the absence of any objective measurable method. Due to ethical issues, re-entry of the surgical site was not possible; hence, the question whether the bone formed was a vital bone remains unanswered, and also, histological examination cannot be done to prove the evidence of clinical and radiological parameters.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that the combination of CPS putty (NovaBone putty) and PRF though effective in improving the radiologic parameters did not enhance the clinical outcome of the therapy compared to the PRF or NovaBone putty alone. Furthermore, PRF showed comparable regenerative potential with CPS putty when used alone. Thus, considering cost-to-benefit ratio, PRF proved better option for regeneration decreasing the cost of regeneration therapy, and placement of PRF is also less technique sensitive. However, the findings of study cannot be directly extrapolated as an outcome of periodontal regeneration as these are not supported by histologic evidence. So further, long-term clinical trials with large samples along with histological examination are needed to evaluate the regenerative potential of PRF and CPS putty.</p><sec
