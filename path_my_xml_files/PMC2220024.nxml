Ninety-five subjects underwent reduced-laxative (13&#x000a0;g senna/18&#x000a0;g magnesium citrate) CTC prior to same-day colonoscopy and were randomised to one of four tagging regimens using 20&#x000a0;ml 40%w/v barium sulphate: regimen A: four doses, B: three doses, C: three doses plus 220&#x000a0;ml 2.1% barium sulphate, or D: three doses plus 15&#x000a0;ml diatriazoate megluamine. Patient experience was assessed immediately after CTC and 1&#x000a0;week later. Two radiologists graded residual stool (1: none/scattered to 4: &#x0003e;50% circumference) and tagging efficacy for stool (1: untagged to 5: 100% tagged) and fluid (1: untagged, 2: layered, 3: tagged), noting the HU of tagged fluid. Preparation was good (76&#x02013;94% segments graded 1), although best for regimen D (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Across all regimens, stool tagging quality was high (mean 3.7&#x02013;4.5) and not significantly different among regimens.

Furthermore, fluid and electrolyte imbalance may occur following aggressive cleansing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A potential advantage of computed tomography colonography (CTC) over colonoscopy is the ability to reduce laxative requirements while maintaining diagnostic accuracy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Reduced laxative regimens often incorporate orally ingested contrast agents to &#x0201c;tag&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;label&#x0201d; residual fluid and faecal residue. The ideal tagging regimen remains controversial but must be safe, effective, simple and well tolerated.</p><p>In many respects, barium is an ideal tagging agent: it has an established safety profile, is relatively palatable, produces minimal side effects, and is effective for tagging solid residue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous work has shown adequate tagging may be achieved using low volumes of 40% w/v barium, although the ideal volume and dosing regimen has not been fully established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore efficacy for fluid tagging has been questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], with some investigators preferring iodine-based contrast either alone or in combination, claiming a more homogeneous fluid opacification better suited to digital subtraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. We aimed to establish the optimum barium-based reduced-laxative faecal- and fluid-tagging regimen, to assess patient acceptability, and to document diagnostic accuracy compared to an enhanced colonoscopic reference standard.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Full ethical committee approval was obtained, and all subjects gave written informed consent.</p><p>Consecutive patients were recruited from those scheduled to undergo afternoon diagnostic colonoscopy for symptoms suggestive of colorectal neoplasia (change in bowel habit, rectal bleeding, unexplained weight loss or palpable abdominal mass) from one of three institutions. Patients were excluded if below age 50 or if they had a known diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Eligible patients were invited to undergo CTC at 8&#x000a0;am, prior to same day colonoscopy and were randomised via a computer random number generator to one of four reduced-laxative regimens using barium-based faecal tagging [20&#x000a0;ml 40% w/v barium sulphate suspension (Tagitol V, EZEM, Lake Success, NY)] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For each of the regimens, patients followed a low-residue diet 2&#x000a0;days before the CTC (avoiding fatty food, milk and vegetables). The day prior to CTC, all patients were allowed a low-residue meal kit (Nutraprep, EZEM), and ingested the same reduced-laxative protocol [13&#x000a0;g sachet of senna granules (Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare, Hull, UK) at 7&#x000a0;am and 18&#x000a0;g magnesium citrate (Lo-So prep, EZEM) at 7&#x000a0;pm]. This laxative regimen was defined as &#x0201c;reduced&#x0201d; given the normal laxative preparation prior to colonoscopy at the recruiting institutions includes an additional 18&#x000a0;g of magnesium citrate (see below). Overall fluid intake was restricted to 2.1&#x000a0;l the day prior to CTC for all four regimens.

Segmental unblinding was used as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], using the sealed CTC report. In brief, the CTC report was handed to the endoscopy nurse accompanying the patient. CTC findings were revealed to the colonoscopist by the nurse on a segmental basis (caecum to rectum) once examination of each colonic segment was deemed complete during extubation of the colon. If CTC suggested a lesion had been missed, the segment was re-intubated and a second segmental examination performed. There was no time limit imposed on the colonoscopist for this second look. All polyps were photographed, their sizes estimated by direct comparison to adjacent open biopsy forceps, and then excised for histology where possible.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Polyp correlation</title><p>Polyps found at CTC were deemed true positive if a corresponding polyp was found in the same or adjacent segment at endoscopy and if the estimated size of the polyp was within 50% of the endoscopic measurement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patient experience</title><p>Immediately following CTC a questionnaire was administered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] investigating patient experience of the reduced-laxative tagging regimen (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

For each colonic segment, the slice with the most residual stool was used to assign the score.

For each colonic segment, the slice with the most residual fluid was used to assign the score. Scores were as follows: 1: no fluid, 2: &#x0003c;25% AP diameter, 3: &#x02265;25 to 50% AP diameter, 4: &#x0003e;50% AP diameter.</p><p>The quality of tagging for solid residue and fluid was scored using a system adapted from Lefere at al.

Residual stool was divided into that measuring &#x02264;5&#x000a0;mm and &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm (based on 2D measurement using electronic calipers), and the number of stool balls &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm was counted for each patient. Readers assessed the percentage of total residual stool volume (for each size category) that had been tagged for each colonic segment. Scores were assigned as follows: 1: all residual stool untagged, 2: 1 to &#x0003c;25% tagged, 3: 25 to &#x0003c;50% tagged, 4: 50 to &#x0003c;75% tagged, 5: 75 to 100% tagged.</p><p>Tagging of residual fluid was scored as follows: 1: fluid untagged, 2: layered tagging (a mix of tagging densities in one fluid level with a denser dependent layer and visibly less dense non-dependent layer (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), 3: fluid homogeneously tagged (single tagging density). The density of tagged fluid (in HU) was also recorded by taking the average of three regions of interest drawn in the deepest fluid pool for each colonic segment. If fluid was layered (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), the minimum and maximum HU was recorded. Finally observers recorded their confidence using a percentage score that, based on the bowel preparation, they would be able to exclude a polyp &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm in day-to-day clinical practice for each colonic segment.

Scores for solid residue tagging were grouped into those of &#x02264;4 or 5. Fluid tagging scores were grouped into scores of 1/2, or score of 3. Logistic regression was then applied, adjusting for colonic segment, to compare the four regimens overall, and to compare the distal (rectum, sigmoid, descending) and proximal colon (transverse, ascending and caecum). In addition, the prevalence of layering within tagged fluid was compared on a per-patient basis using the chi-squared test. Tagged fluid attenuation was compared using linear regression following log transformation of the data. Confidence scores for excluding a polyp &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm were grouped as either &#x0003c;100% or 100%, and compared using logistic regression. For all regression analyses, robust standard errors were employed to account for interdependency between colonic segments and scan position (supine/prone) in the same patient.

We defined the laxation used as &#x0201c;reduced&#x0201d; in comparison to the endoscopic preparation used at our institutions which includes an additional 18&#x000a0;g of magnesium citrate. We also used senna rather than bisacodyl as used by Lefere et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Both are stimulant laxatives with a similar mode of action and effect at the doses administrated, although senna was preferred as it is widely used at our institutions. However a combination of 13&#x000a0;g of senna and 18&#x000a0;g magnesium citrate clearly produces relatively strong purgation, reflected in the induced symptoms (77% of patients opened their bowels over five times) and marginal patient preference. It would therefore seem reasonable to study reduced laxation further, perhaps omitting the senna and/or reducing the dose of magnesium citrate. It is however important to realise that whereas normally patients took no solids by mouth for 24&#x000a0;h prior to colonoscopy, in the present study they were permitted to eat from a low-residue diet kit, an issue we did not specifically address with our questionnaires, thereby potentially underestimating this benefit.</p><p>Recent data have questioned whether CTC is actually better tolerated than conventional colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but because full bowel purgation is often cited by patients as the worst part of any colonic examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], it is assumed that reduced laxative CTC will improve patient compliance (notably in a screening setting). However this assumption has not been proven in prospective trials, and we cannot extrapolate the preferences we found into increased compliance with CTC. Indeed it could be argued the laxative regimen we used would have relative little impact on compliance in a screening setting, given the side-effect profile.</p><p>The overall quality of bowel preparation was good, with all four regimens producing at least 76% of segments with either no or scattered residue only. This is similar to data reported by Lefere et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], who combined 16.5&#x000a0;g of magnesium citrate with biscodyl tablets and suppository. Interestingly, regimen D, which included 15&#x000a0;ml meglumine amidotrizoate, resulted in significantly better preparation than the other regimens, possibility due to a &#x0201c;washing effect&#x0201d; of the iodine-based contrast, incorporating solid residue into a more fluid solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Although we used a small dose, meglumine amidotrizoate is also known to have a laxative effect that may also have added to the superior cleansing.</p><p>Tagging of solid residue was in general good, with no significant difference between the regimens tested. This suggests barium-based tagging can be simplified to a 1-day regimen only, when combined with reduced cathartic preparation. Similarly all regimens produced an average tagged fluid density of around 500&#x000a0;HU. Recent phantom data suggest that although submerged polyp conspicuity is optimised at 700&#x000a0;HU, it remains good at 500&#x000a0;HU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We did however demonstrate that fluid tagging could be manipulated by additional oral agents on the morning of CTC. As it is non-miscible with water, barium often produces a layering effect with lower attenuation fluid sitting above denser barium. Although there was no significant difference in layering among the regimens, the addition of morning 2.1% barium sulphate or meglumine amidotrizoate significantly increased the attenuation of the non-dependent fluid layer. It is arguable whether this will have significant impact clinically, not least because fluid moves between supine and prone positions, but it may have implications for subtraction software. Zalis et al. have recently demonstrated suboptimal subtraction when high-density barium is used as the sole tagging agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It is interesting to speculate whether manipulation of fluid tagging could optimise subtraction. It should also be noted our regimen mildly restricted fluid intake the day prior to CTC, which may have influenced our fluid tagging results.</p><p>One major advantage of barium as a tagging agent is its inert nature and safety. Although iodinated contrast medium produces more homogeneous fluid tagging, this is mainly of clinical importance if subtraction software is being used. While the risks of allergy to oral iodinated contrast are minimal, adverse events do occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Our data suggest good results can be achieved using only barium.</p><p>Ultimately, diagnostic performance is the best measure of the success of any reduced-laxative protocol. Reassuringly overall, we prospectively found high diagnostic performance when compared to colonoscopy. Our data confirm again that full bowel preparation is not required to maintain diagnostic accuracy for CTC, assuming adequate reader training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Importantly, there were only four false positive polyps over 6&#x000a0;mm, and across all regimens the positive predictive value for patients with any lesion &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mm and &#x02265;10&#x000a0;mm was 0.9 and 1.0 respectively (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>).</p><p>Our study does have weaknesses. It could be argued that we used a relatively harsh laxative regime given that good results have been reported without any laxative at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However the vast majority of CTC worldwide is still performed using full bowel preparation, and in the authors&#x02019; opinion, significant changes in practice are most likely to follow gradual reduction of purgation, which allows radiologists to become comfortable with this approach. However we acknowledge that if there was good evidence of acceptable performance data using CTC without prior laxation, this may well rapidly become widely implemented by the CTC community. We compared patient symptomatology with a historical cohort, and although well-matched in demographic terms, we cannot exclude bias completely. We did not instruct colonoscopists to grade the quality of bowel preparation and, in particular, the influence of retained barium on mucosal visibility, although no endoscopy failed due to incomplete bowel preparation. It could be argued that reduced preparation regimens are best suited to increase compliance in asymptomatic screening populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However for pragmatic reasons we used symptomatic patients, as we do not have access to a large screening population. Finally, although we were able to show high diagnostic performance for reduced-preparation CTC overall, given the relatively low number of polyps, we were unable to meaningfully compare across regimens.</p><p>In conclusion, a combination of reduced laxatives and a simple tagging regimen based on 40% barium sulphate the day prior to CTC maintains acceptable diagnostic accuracy. Three doses of 20&#x000a0;ml 40%w/v barium sulphate are as effective as more complex regimens, but fluid tagging can be manipulated by addition of dilute barium or meglumine amidotrizoate on the morning of CTC, the latter also reducing the volume of residual stool.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The work was supported by an educational grant from EZEM, Lake Success, NY, and by a pump-priming grant from the Royal College of Radiologists, London, UK.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ristvedt</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>McFarland</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinstock</surname><given-names>LB</given-names></name><name><surname>Thyssen</surname><given-names>EP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Patient preferences for CT colonography, conventional colonoscopy, and bowel preparation</article-title><source>Am J Gastroenterol</source><year>2003</year><volume>98</volume><fpage>578</fpage><lpage>585</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1111/j.1572-0241.2003.07302.x</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Ristvedt SL, McFarland EG, Weinstock LB, Thyssen EP (2003) Patient preferences for CT colonography, conventional colonoscopy, and bowel preparation.
