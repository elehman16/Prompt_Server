</p><p>One hundred patients were divided into dexmedetomidine group (group D) and control group (group C) of 50 each using computer-generated random list. All the patients were pre-loaded with 10 ml/kg of lactated Ringer's solution/normal saline. Immediately after subarachnoid block with 3 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, group D patients received a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine IV by infusion pump over 10 min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h till the end of surgery, whereas the other group (group C) received an equivalent quantity of normal saline as loading and maintenance dose IV by infusion pump. Vitals were recorded (heart rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub>, respiratory rate) immediately after the subarachnoid block and every 5 min till the end of surgery and for 30 min after completion of surgery in post-anesthesia care unit (PACU).</p><p>Sensory blockade was checked with an alcohol swab in midaxillary line, and the time taken for the highest level of sensory blockade, two-dermatomal regression from the maximum level, and regression to S1 level was noted. Sensory blockade was assessed every 2 min for the first 10 min and thereafter every 15 min during surgery and postoperatively. All the durations were calculated considering the time of spinal injection as time 0.</p><p>Motor blockade was assessed by <italic>modified Bromage scale</italic> (modified Bromage 0, the patient is able to move the hip, knee, and ankle; modified Bromage 1, the patient is unable to move the hip, but is able to move the knee and ankle; modified Bromage 2, the patient is unable to move the hip and knee, but is able to move the ankle; and modified Bromage 3, the patient is unable to move the hip, knee, and ankle). Time taken for motor blockade to reach modified Bromage scale 3 and regression of motor blockade to modified Bromage scale 0 was noted. Motor blockade was assessed every 2 mins before the onset of the surgery and every 15 mins in the PACU.</p><p>The level of sedation was evaluated using <italic>Ramsay level of sedation scale</italic> (1, patient anxious, agitated, or restless; 2, patient cooperative, oriented, and tranquil alert; 3, patient responds to commands; 4, asleep, but with brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; 5, asleep, sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus; and 6, asleep, no response). The level of sedation was evaluated both intraoperatively and postoperatively every 15 mins using Ramsay level of sedation scale till the patient was discharged from the PACU. Excessive sedation was defined as score greater than 4/6.</p><p>Hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg or more than 20% fall from baseline value) and bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;50/min) were treated appropriately. Intraoperative requirement of supplemental analgesia (up to 1 &#x003bc;g/kg body weight of fentanyl) and the time for first request for postoperative analgesic were noted. Also, 20 mg/kg (maximum up to 1.2 g) IV paracetamol was given initially when the patient complained of pain. Diclofenac 75 mg in 100 ml normal saline was given as intravenous infusion if the pain persisted after 30 min of paracetamol infusion. Tramadol 50 mg slow IV was given if the pain persisted after 30 min of diclofenac administration.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size of 50 in each group was estimated using nMaster software based on the study by Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>. who concluded that intravenous dexmedetomidine prolongs bupivacaine spinal analgesia, considering the sensory regression time to S1 segment in dexmedetomidine group (261.5 &#x000b1; 34.8 min) and control group (165.2 &#x000b1; 31.5 min).

Prolongation of spinal anesthesia after IV dexmedetomidine is by its supra-spinal action at locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus. There are three subtypes of &#x003b1;2 receptors: A, B, and C. Dexmedetomidine is a more selective &#x003b1;2-A receptor agonist than clonidine, with more sedative and analgesic effects. Activation of presynaptic &#x003b1;2-A receptors at locus ceruleus decreases norepinephrine release and causes sedative and hypnotic effects, whereas its effect on descending medullo spinal noradrenergic path way results in analgesia by terminating pain signal propagation. At substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, it decreases firing in nociceptive neurons and release of substance P, thus producing analgesia. So, dexmedetomidine has a role in modulating pain and inhibiting the transmission and perception of pain. Activation of post-synaptic &#x003b1;2-A receptors in CNS results in hypotension and bradycardia by decreasing the sympathetic activity. Activation of post-synaptic &#x003b1;2-C receptors in CNS results in anxiolysis, whereas activation of post-synaptic &#x003b1;2-B receptors in peripheral vasculature results in transient hypertension.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine group had higher level of sensory block compared to the control group in our study, similar to the study results of Kaya <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our study, the mean time for two-dermatomal regression of sensory blockade was significantly prolonged in the dexmedetomidine group (137.4 &#x000b1; 10.9 min) compared to the control group (102.8 &#x000b1; 14.8).

The 24-h mean analgesic requirement was less and the time to first request for postoperative analgesic was prolonged in group D than group C. As dexmedetomidine has a role in modulating pain, inhibiting the pain transmission and perception of pain, its role as a pre-emptive analgesic needs to be assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>IV dexmedetomidine significantly prolongs the duration of sensory and motor block of bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine causes decrease in heart rate and mean arterial/systolic/diastolic blood pressures. The incidence of bradycardia is significantly high when IV dexmedetomidine is used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine spinal anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine-induced bradycardia is transient and responds to atropine. The changes in blood pressure are without significant clinical impact and hypotension can be easily managed with bolus of IV fluids and mephentermine. Dexmedetomidine provides excellent sedation during surgery and sedation scores reach normal within 15 min after stopping the drug. Dexmedetomidine provides significant postoperative analgesia in first 24 h after surgery and prevents postoperative shivering.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Mustafa</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Badran</surname><given-names>IZ</given-names></name><name><surname>Abu Ali</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Barazangi</surname><given-names>BA</given-names></name><name><surname>Massad</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Ghanem</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intravenous dexmedetomidine prolongs bupivacaine spinal analgesia</article-title><source>Middle East J Anesthesiol</source><year>2009</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>225</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19583070</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Elcicek</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Tekin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kati</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The effects of intravenous dexmedetomidine on spinal hyperbaric ropivacaine anesthesia</article-title><source>J Anesth</source><year>2010</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>544</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20467879</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kanazi</surname><given-names>GE</given-names></name><name><surname>Aouad</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Jabbour-Khoury</surname><given-names>SI</given-names></name><name><surname>Jazzar</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Alameddine</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Yaman</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effects of low-dose dexmedetomidine or clonidine on the characteristics of bupivacaine spinal block</article-title><source>Acta Anesthesiol Scand</source><year>2006</year><volume>50</volume><fpage>222</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tekin</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Kati</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomak</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Kisli</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of dexmedetomidine IV on the duration of spinal anesthesia with Prilocaine: A double-blind, prospective study in adult surgical patients</article-title><source>Current Therapeutic Research</source><year>2007</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>313</fpage><lpage>24</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24692763</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Whizar-Lugo</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000f3;mez-Ram&#x000ed;rez</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cisneros-Corral</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Mart&#x000ed;nez-Gallegos</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Intravenous dexmedetomidine vs Intravenous clonidine to prolong bupivacaine spinal anesthesia.
