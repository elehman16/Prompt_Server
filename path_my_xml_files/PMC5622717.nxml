Introduction</title><p>The role of dietary protein on increasing satiation, satiety, and energy metabolism is well documented [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, eating behavior is modulated by not just meal or diet macronutrient composition, but also the interactions among physiological need (homeostatic), the rewarding properties of food, and our environments [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Changes to our food environment, coupled with the increase in adiposity over the last four decades, suggest that eating behavior is influenced more by nonhomeostatic contributors than homeostatic regulatory mechanisms. With the seemingly constant availability of energy-dense, highly palatable (enjoyable and appetizing) foods, understanding eating behavior beyond the physical need has become a priority [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. One factor that influences eating behavior is the reinforcing value of the foods available in an environment [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Moreover, food reinforcement is positively associated with obesity [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The reinforcing value of a food is a learned response that is associated with that food&#x02019;s reinforcement history (positive or negative) and has been shown to be modifiable depending upon baseline intake and the availability of the alternative choices [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, elucidating the motivating properties of food is essential in developing successful strategies that work to enhance homeostatic regulation of food intake.</p><p>Dietary protein has been posited to influence food reinforcement regulatory mechanisms. Data from animal and human magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies demonstrate that greater protein intake diminishes activation of central motivation and reward areas of the brain [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In animals, intragastric infusion of physiological amounts of protein decreased stimulation in the amygdala compared to a mixed nutrient meal or intravenous glucose infusion [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In humans, greater dietary protein reduces activation in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry (notably the insular cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and parahippocampus) [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential role of dietary protein in modulating food reinforcement. However, it is not clear if reduced activity in these reward areas of the brain translates into actual decreases in reward-driven eating behaviors. </p><p>Food reinforcement has been studied using a computer-based choice task (operant responding) in a variety of settings and is measured by the amount of operant responding (i.e., work) an individual will complete to earn a small portion of the food [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. If the food is highly reinforcing, it will support more work to earn access to that food [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The present study extends previous research by employing such an operant responding task to test the effects of increased dietary protein on actual motivated behavior and the reinforcing value of foods with specific taste profiles in healthy weight adults. We hypothesized that increasing dietary protein would decrease the reinforcing value for energy-dense, highly palatable snack foods.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-09-00957"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-09-00957" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Healthy weight women (<italic>n</italic> = 11; age = 25 &#x000b1; 2 years; Body Mass Index (BMI) = 21 &#x000b1; 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and men (<italic>n</italic> = 10; age = 22 &#x000b1; 1 years; BMI = 24 &#x000b1; 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited from the Greater Grand Forks area through the Grand Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC) website and flyers posted in local businesses for participation in the study. The study was approved by the University of North Dakota Institutional Review Board and registered at <uri xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">http://clinicaltrials.gov</uri> (NCT02211599). Informed written consent was obtained prior to participation. Participant eligibility was determined during a screening exam at the GFHNRC. Exclusion criteria included: BMI &#x0003c;18 and &#x0003e; 25kg/m<sup>2</sup>, allergies to any study foods, recent weight loss or gain, pregnancy, lactation, fasting glucose &#x0003e;100 mg/dL, active cancer or in short-term remission (less than three years), infectious diseases, alcohol or drug abuse, tobacco use, presence of acute illness, or taking medications known to affect appetite. Participants were instructed to continue all regular activities of daily living and maintain their usual diet.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-09-00957" sec-type="methods"><title>2.2. Experimental Procedures</title><p>Participants completed a randomized cross-over study at the GFHNRC to determine the impact of dietary protein (15% of energy intake (E) vs. 30% E) and gender on the reinforcing value of energy-dense snack foods. Study visits were separated by a minimum of one week. Women were scheduled on the same day of their menstrual cycle to control for possible confounding effects on food cravings. Participants completed a three-day food diary prior to each study visit to determine habitual macronutrient intakes.</p><p>Participants reported to the GFHNRC Metabolic Research Unit the evening before each testing day. All meals were prepared and weighed by the GFHNRC research kitchen. A standardized meal (57% carbohydrate, 15% protein, and 28% fat), to control for nutrient intake and timing, was provided at 19:00 h. The breakfast (08:00 h) and lunch (12:00 h) test meals were comprised of the same foods; however, the meals were presented differently at each meal to minimize monotony (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-09-00957-t001">Table 1</xref>). Each meal provided 500 calories; fat intake was set at 30% and carbohydrate intake was adjusted to maintain isocaloric conditions. Absolute protein intake was 19 g and 38 g per meal for the 15% E and 30% E protein diets, respectively. Participants were required to consume all foods.</p><p>Indices of appetite sensations were measured immediately prior to the food reinforcement task using a computer-based visual analogue scale [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The reinforcing value for sweet and savory snack foods was assessed 4 h after lunch using a computer choice task as previously described [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Briefly, two separate computer workstations were used to simulate a behavioral choice between energy-dense, highly palatable sweet and savory snack foods. On one computer, the participant played a slot machine like game to earn points for a small portion (70&#x02013;100 kcal) of their most liked sweet snack food. On the other computer, the participant played the same type of game to earn points for the same size portion of their most liked savory snack food (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-09-00957-t002">Table 2</xref>). Participants worked at their pace and could freely distribute their operant responding to the schedules. The behavioral cost to gain access to each snack food increased on independent and concurrent log<sub>2</sub>(x) reinforcement schedules. The reinforcement schedule used for this study was 4, 8, 16, 32, (&#x02026;), 1024 mouse clicks for each point. Participants received one reward each time five points was earned. The schedule of reinforcement advanced after the reward was earned. Participants&#x02019; most-liked snack food choices used as the food rewards were determined prior to start of study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-09-00957"><title>2.3.

The effects of gender and dietary protein on appetite sensations and the RRV of sweet to savory snack foods was assessed using a mixed model analysis of variance in which gender and dietary protein were fixed effects and the participant was treated as a random effect.

Discussion</title><p>The present study was conducted to examine the effect of normal (15% E) and high-protein (30% E) meals on the reinforcing values of energy-dense, highly palatable sweet and savory snack foods in healthy weight adults. To our knowledge, this is the first study to test the effect of protein intake on the amount of work an individual is willing to perform to gain access to a highly reinforcing food. Our results show that increasing dietary protein differentially altered food reinforcement in women and men. Most notably, increasing dietary protein intake decreased the reinforcing value of savory foods in women. </p><p>The present study is the first to demonstrate an effect of protein intake on the motivation to gain access to a highly rewarding food, as assessed by operant (behavioral) responding, and eating behavior. By demonstrating an effect of dietary protein on behavioral responses, it extends recent neuroimaging studies that have shown that increasing protein intake decreases activation in central motivation and reward areas of the brain; potentially decreasing reward-driven eating [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In overweight/obese late-adolescent girls, a high protein breakfast reduced brain activation responses to visual food cues in the anterior insular and mid-prefrontal cortex 3 h postprandial (pre-lunch) [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and in the hippocampus and parahippocampus regions 8 h after breakfast (pre-supper) [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared to a normal protein breakfast (40% E vs. 15% E, respectively). The reduced activation of the aforementioned brain regions coincided with a decrease in nighttime snacking on high-fat foods [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Furthermore, feeding healthy weight women a low-protein (7% E) or high-protein (25% E) diet for 16 days resulted in contrasting postprandial changes in reward-related areas of the brain [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specifically, increasing dietary protein resulted in decreased activation in the inferior orbitofrontal cortex in response to savory food cues [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Taken together, the results from these neuroimaging studies indicate that dietary protein may modulate reward-driven eating behavior in females. The findings of the current study expand upon the knowledge gained from these neuroimaging studies by demonstrating a significant interaction between dietary protein and gender on motivated behavior for energy-dense savory snack foods. Thus, in women, increasing protein intake modifies eating behavior, specifically, the consumption of savory foods. </p><p>The current results indicate that increasing dietary protein from 15% E to 30% E does not alter motivated behavior in men. These findings are supported by those of Frank et al. [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] who found that changes in neural responses in brain regions responsible for reward-seeking behavior were only visible in women, but not in the men [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, Sayer and colleagues [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] reported no differences in postprandial neural responses to visual food cues 3 h after consuming normal (12 g) and high-protein (25 g) breakfasts in overweight adults (6 women and 12 men). The disproportionate number of women and men in their participant pool may have led to their results more closely resembling the responses that the current and previous study [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] detailed for men. Taken together, these findings suggest that gender plays an important role in the neurobehavioral responses to dietary protein. Further investigation is necessary to continue to elucidate the effects of gender on eating behavior in response to alterations in dietary macronutrient composition.</p><p>Interestingly, increasing dietary protein from 15% E to 30% E did not alter the reinforcing value of sweet foods. This unexpected finding opposes our hypothesis that the reinforcing value of, and consumption of, sweet foods would be lessened after consuming meals containing 30% E compared to 15% E protein. Previous research had shown that increasing dietary protein from 15% E to 40% E [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or from 10% E to 25% E [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] decreases snacking on energy-dense sweet foods. On the other hand, Gosby et al. [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported no measurable differences in the intake of sweet foods when dietary protein was increased from 15% E to 25% E. Therefore, it can be postulated that an increase of at least 15% E, or an increase from a relatively low baseline protein intake of 10% E, is needed to elicit a reduction in the consumption of sweet foods. However, we found no effect of a 15% E increase in dietary protein on the intake of sweet foods. Therefore, a larger divergence between habitual and meal protein intake might be needed in order to alter motivated behavior for sweet foods. Future studies should systematically explore the possibility of a threshold at which motivated behavior is increased or decreased in response to changes in protein intake.</p><p>This study is not without limitations. First, only healthy weight adults were recruited for participation. Weight status influences the RRV of food and energy intake [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-09-00957" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], therefore, it is possible that overweight and obese individuals may exhibit different appetitive or motivational responses in response to changes in dietary protein. However, the current study of healthy weight adults provides an initial indication of how dietary protein can alter motivation for, and consumption of, energy-dense sweet and savory snack foods later in the day. Second, only a limited number of snack foods were studied. It is possible that the RRV of snack foods with different taste profiles than those tested here would have produced different results. Still, it is intriguing that increasing dietary protein decreased the RRV of foods with a savory taste profile in the women only. </p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-09-00957"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>Eating behavior is driven by the complex interrelationship between homeostatic and nonhomeostatic inputs. One implication of this research is that, for women, modulation of nonhoemostatic regulation of eating behavior by dietary protein is specific to foods with a particular taste profile. These results build upon the knowledge provided by neuroimaging studies on the response of reward-driven eating behaviors to increases in dietary protein.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank LuAnn Johnson for her assistance with the statistics, and Clint Hall, Doreen Rolshoven, and Jackie Nelson for their assistance with implementation of the protocol, data collection, and data entry.
