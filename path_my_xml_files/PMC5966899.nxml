Excessive sedentary behaviour adversely affects health in children and adults. As sedentary behaviour tracks from childhood into adulthood, the reduction of sedentary time in young people is key for the prevention of chronic diseases that result from excessive sitting in later life. The sedentary school classroom represents an ideal setting for environmental change, through the provision of sit-stand desks. Whilst the use of sit-stand desks in classrooms demonstrates positive effects in some key outcomes, evidence is currently limited by small samples and/or short intervention durations, with few studies adopting randomised controlled trial (RCT) designs. This paper describes the protocol of a pilot cluster RCT of a sit-stand desk intervention in primary school classrooms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par2">A two-arm pilot cluster RCT will be conducted in eight primary schools (four intervention, four control) with at least 120 year 5 children (aged 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years). Sit-stand desks will replace six standard desks in the intervention classrooms. Teachers will be encouraged to ensure all pupils are exposed to the sit-stand desks for at least 1&#x000a0;h/day on average using a rotation system. Schools assigned to the control arm will continue with their usual practice, no environmental changes will be made to their classrooms. Measurements will be taken at baseline, before randomisation, and at the end of the schools&#x02019; academic year. In this study, the primary outcomes of interest will be school and participant recruitment and attrition, acceptability of the intervention, and acceptability and compliance to the proposed outcome measures (including activPAL-measured school-time and school-day sitting, accelerometer-measured physical activity, adiposity, blood pressure, cognitive function, academic progress, engagement, and behaviour) for inclusion in a definitive trial. A full process evaluation and an exploratory economic evaluation will also be conducted to further inform a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The primary output of this study will be acceptability data to inform the development of a definitive cluster RCT designed to examine the efficacy of this intervention on health- and education-related outcomes in UK primary school children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12915848">ISRCTN12915848</ext-link> (retrospectively registered, date registered 9 November 2016).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s40814-018-0295-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sitting</kwd><kwd>Standing</kwd><kwd>Children</kwd><kwd>Sit-to-stand desks</kwd><kwd>Schools</kwd><kwd>Children&#x02019;s health</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001921</institution-id><institution>Public Health Research Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHR PHR 14/231/20</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par20">Technological advances and changes to our environment and lifestyle have led to increased time being spent in sedentary behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sedentary behaviour (sitting, lying, and reclining and expending &#x0003c;&#x02009;1.5 metabolic equivalents [METs] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]) is ubiquitous in modern society, with individuals of all ages exposed to environments that promote prolonged periods of sitting. Whilst it is acknowledged that physical activity is beneficial to health, sedentary behaviour has also been shown to adversely affect health. For example, high levels of sedentary behaviour have been independently associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and premature mortality in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Sitting is the most prevalent behaviour exhibited during waking hours in children from the UK, accounting for over 65% of their waking time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], with some children reportedly sitting for over 10&#x000a0;h/day (&#x0003e;&#x02009;70% of waking hours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Adverse associations between sedentary behaviour and cardio-metabolic health risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, cholesterol, insulin) have been reported in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Given this and as sedentary behaviours track throughout childhood into adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the reduction of sitting time in young people is pertinent for the primary and secondary prevention of chronic diseases that result from excessive sitting in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, with the emergence of an increased cardio-metabolic health risk profile being observed in the first decade of life in some ethnic groups in the UK (for example, higher levels of fasting insulin and triglycerides have been observed in 9&#x02013;10-years-old British South Asian children in comparison to white British children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], may suggest that these individuals could be more vulnerable to the adverse health effects of excessive sitting time. The early reduction of sedentary behaviour in children in such higher-risk groups could be an important strategy for reducing ethnicity-related health inequalities later in life.</p><p id="Par22">Children are increasingly exposed to environments and social norms that encourage prolonged sitting; for example, because the school classroom is equipped with standard desks and chairs, children are expected to sit throughout most lessons. To counter the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting on children&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], strategies are needed to reverse the trend of increasing levels of sedentary behaviour. A meta-analysis of interventions targeting reductions in children&#x02019;s sedentary behaviour reported an overall decrease of 18&#x000a0;min/day of sitting and reductions in body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whilst most studies were school-based, sedentary behaviour was targeted via behaviour change strategies within non-school settings (i.e. screen time at home). No included studies employed changes to the classroom environment. Classrooms are conducive to high volumes of sitting, with children typically sitting for longer during school hours than non-school hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Environmental change within the classroom is therefore an obvious means to target children&#x02019;s sitting time and may address health inequalities in that this environment is accessible to all children. One such strategy in which environmental change to the classroom can be achieved is through the introduction of sit-stand desks. Unlike traditional classroom desks, sit-stand desks are height adjustable and enable the user to alternate between sitting and standing postures.</p><p id="Par23">Rapid increases in sedentary time have been observed in children aged 11&#x000a0;years and above relative to younger age groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This trial will target year 5 classrooms, comprising children just below this age (9&#x02013;10-year-olds), with the goal of reducing the typical rise in sedentary time seen during the transition into adolescence, given sedentary behaviours track from childhood into adolescence and adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that children in year 5 upwards are active participants in their own learning, making them an optimal target for classroom interventions that may facilitate learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Early-phase studies have demonstrated the feasibility of incorporating sit-stand desks in primary school classrooms over the short term (&#x0003c;&#x02009;12&#x000a0;weeks) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. We have previously observed that sit-stand desks enable pupils (9&#x02013;10-year-olds) to alternate between sitting and standing, without disruption to teaching, learning or behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. International studies have shown sit-stand desks in school classrooms to be effective in increasing energy expenditure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and standing and movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] during the school day. Other research has shown that sit-stand desks in classrooms lead to improvements in children&#x02019;s posture and musculoskeletal comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and levels of academic engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Two studies have assessed the impact on sitting directly, both revealed reductions in children&#x02019;s daily sitting time of approximately 1&#x000a0;h/day over 4 and 9&#x000a0;weeks follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recent reviews have concluded that the use of sit-stand desks in school classrooms shows promise; however, the evidence to date is limited to relatively small-scale studies with short intervention periods, and a lack of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, limited research has examined the impact of this type of intervention on children&#x02019;s learning and academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This pilot RCT will build on earlier research by assessing the longer-term acceptability of this low burden environmental intervention in primary schools in the UK, along with the acceptability of a range of health and education-related outcome measures to inform a definitive trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim and objectives</title><p id="Par25">The aim of this study is to undertake a pilot cluster RCT of the introduction of sit-stand desks in primary school classrooms to inform a future fully-powered definitive trial. A definitive trial would examine the impact of the introduction of sit-stand desks over one school year on weekday sitting time (the primary outcome), health and education related outcomes, with sub-group analyses for ethnicity. To inform such a trial, key information needs to be established around school and participant recruitment, acceptability of the intervention and outcome measures, and attrition rates. The objectives of this pilot study are therefore to</p><p id="Par26">1. Establish and refine a recruitment strategy for schools and pupils.</p><p id="Par27">2.

This is a school-based, pilot two-armed cluster RCT with economic and process evaluations. Individuals (year 5 children, aged 9&#x02013;10&#x000a0;years) will be the unit of analysis and schools (clusters) randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (1) six manually adjustable sit-stand desks incorporated into the classroom environment (intervention condition), or (2) current practice (control condition). Baseline measurements will precede randomisation. The sit-stand desks will be installed into the intervention classrooms following randomisation. An identical set of outcome measurements will be taken from all participants approximately 6&#x000a0;months after the baseline measures, when participants are at the end of year 5. Observations, interviews and focus groups with teachers, children and parents will be conducted throughout the intervention period as part of a full process evaluation.

Bradford was chosen as the study location given its ethnic composition (predominantly South Asian and White British) and high levels of deprivation, health inequalities and childhood morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In 2016&#x02013;17, 38% of year 6 children in Bradford were overweight or obese according to the National Child Measurement Programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Half of all babies born in Bradford are of South Asian origin and 60% are born into the poorest 20% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], with elevated risk factors for chronic diseases seen in South Asian children in comparison to White children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The setting of this study therefore is fundamental in addressing the important issue of health inequalities, in that the intervention will be accessible to all children. In addition, the location enables us to pilot this intervention under challenging circumstances meaning that if it proves acceptable it is likely to be transferable to most schools.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par40">Eight primary schools, each with at least 15 child participants (approximately 50% of a typical class) will be recruited giving a minimum total sample of 120. This sample matches the minimum of four clusters per arm recommended for a cluster RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and the minimum sample size exceeds the recommendation for pilot trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Consequently, the sample will be sufficiently large to provide clear estimates of recruitment and follow-up for a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>School recruitment and inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par41">Government funded primary schools located in the City of Bradford will be invited to participate in the study following ethical approval. Private and designated special schools and schools with less than 25 pupils in year 5 will be excluded. Schools will also not be eligible for participation if they are running a sitting time reduction programme, or if they have a unique characteristic that prevents comparison with control schools. The study will be publicised to primary schools through existing local networks (e.g. Bradford Primary Improvement Partnership and Bradford&#x02019;s Public Forum for Education). We will aim to recruit four schools with predominantly South Asian pupils (&#x0003e;&#x02009;50%) and four schools with predominantly White British pupils (&#x0003e;&#x02009;50%). Interested schools will be followed-up via telephone and visits by the research team. Consent will be sought from school management (Head Teacher, Senior Teachers, Governors) and year 5 teachers to participate in the study. During recruitment, schools will be informed they may be randomised to a current practice control condition where they will be asked to maintain their usual classroom practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant recruitment and inclusion criteria</title><p id="Par42">All year 5 children (9&#x02013;10-years-old) within the participating schools will be eligible to participate. Parents will be sent a detailed information sheet about the study so that they can make an informed decision about their child&#x02019;s participation. They will also be invited to a school meeting outlining the study. Parental/guardian consent (through an opt-in form for their child to participate in the intervention evaluation) will be collected. Children will be asked to provide verbal assent at each data collection time point for the evaluation measures. Children without parental consent for their participation in the evaluation, or those who do not give their assent to participate in the evaluation, will be excluded from the evaluation measures described below. These children will however be able to use the sit-stand desks within their classrooms. Any children in the intervention schools with known contraindications (for example, a musculoskeletal injury, a wheelchair user) that would preclude periods of standing will be invited to participate in the evaluation measures and encouraged to use the sit-stand desk in a seated posture for inclusivity.

Two schools with predominantly South Asian pupils and two schools with predominantly White British pupils will be randomised into the intervention and control arms (four schools in each arm). Stratification of schools will enable us to examine whether there are ethnic differences in terms of participant recruitment and retention, adherence to the outcome measures, and preliminary effects of the intervention on outcome measures.

The research team will support teachers in the development of a rotation plan to ensure that all children in their class are exposed to the sit-stand desks for at least 1&#x000a0;h/day on average across the week. Stools or chairs will remain and children will be free to choose whether they sit or stand. Teachers and pupils in the intervention classrooms will receive training on sit-stand desk use by the research team. Teachers will also receive a Professional Development Manual containing information on the health benefits of reducing prolonged sitting and information on correct posture when standing at the desks.

During these observations, every 10&#x000a0;min the researcher will record the number of boys and girls who are sitting or standing when using the sit-stand desks.

The likely primary outcome in a definitive trial would be change in average daily school-day sitting time. Sitting will be measured objectively for seven consecutive days during each measurement period using the activPAL3 micro accelerometer. The activPAL3 will be waterproofed (using a nitrile sleeve and hypoallergenic Hypafix [BSN Medical] dressing) and participants will be requested to wear the device continuously (24&#x000a0;h/day) on the anterior aspect of their right thigh during each measurement period. Participants will be provided with a brief diary during each monitoring period where they will be requested to document time in bed and any periods of non-wear.</p><p id="Par50">The use of the activPAL to objectively measure sitting has increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the device has been successfully used as a primary outcome measure in previous school-based sedentary behaviour interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and is recommended for use in interventions when the primary outcome measure is sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It is regarded as the most accurate method of assessing sitting behaviour in free-living settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] and has been shown to be almost 100% accurate in measuring sitting, standing, walking and postural transitions in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Whilst total daily school-day sitting time is likely to be the primary outcome for a future trial, we will also extract classroom and leisure-time sitting, standing and stepping time, along with the number of transitions between sitting and standing from the activPAL data. Periods of non-wear and sleep time will be excluded from the analyses using an automated algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], supplemented with cross-checking against participant&#x02019;s diary entries. We will examine any positive (i.e. reductions in sitting) or compensatory effects (increases in sitting) of the intervention on children&#x02019;s behaviour out of school hours. The variability (standard deviation) of the data from the proposed primary outcome will be used to inform a sample size calculation for a definitive trial (objective 11).</p><p id="Par51">Proposed secondary outcomes for a definitive trial include objectively measured physical activity. While the activPAL provides a valid measure of posture, it has not been well validated for assessment of various physical activity intensities among children. Therefore, children will wear the ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometer on the waist continuously (24&#x000a0;h/day) for seven consecutive days, concurrently with the activPAL, during each measurement period. Periods of non-wear will be documented in a brief diary provided with the devices. Waist worn accelerometers have traditionally been considered the criterion measure of children&#x02019;s physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The ActiGraph is the most commonly used accelerometer in field-based research and has been shown to have acceptable reliability and validity in paediatric populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].

In a comparative study examining the classification accuracy of five different ActiGraph cut-points for determining children&#x02019;s and adolescent&#x02019;s physical activity intensity, against indirect calorimetry, the Evenson cut-points were highlighted as the most accurate across all intensity levels and are therefore recommended for use in this age group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

Body composition (percentage body fat and fat mass) will be assessed via bio-impedance analysis, using Tanita DC-360S body composition scales which contain specific algorithms for children.

The software will be installed on school computers enabling a group of students (those with parental consent to participate in the intervention evaluation) to undertake these assessments at the same time in the classroom under the supervision of two researchers. Participants will undertake a practise run through of the cognitive function test battery a day before the test day. The cognitive function test battery will take children approximately 15&#x000a0;min to complete and will include the Corsi block tapping test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], the Stroop test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and the rapid visual information processing (RVIP) task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The Corsi block tapping test is a measure of visuo-spatial working memory capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Performance on the Corsi block tapping test is linearly associated with age in typically developing children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>], and the original version has exhibited a test-retest reliability coefficient of 0.7 (Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient) in 11-year-olds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The Stroop test measures sensitivity to interference and the ability to suppress an automated response (reading colour names in favour of naming the font colour); it is a commonly used measure of selective attention and executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].

The impact of the intervention on pupil&#x02019;s behaviour will be assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties questionnaire completed by teachers at baseline and follow-up. This questionnaire, when completed by teachers, has been shown to provide a valid indicator of children&#x02019;s behaviour (convergent validity: Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient with the Rutter questionnaire&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]). Children will also report their engagement and disaffection with their own learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] (correlation coefficients between pupil and teacher reports of the components of engagement using this measure range from 0.26 to 0.44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]) and their postural comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

As sedentary behaviours track from childhood into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], reducing children&#x02019;s sitting time could reduce the risk of numerous chronic conditions linked to prolonged sitting in adulthood, including obesity, some cancers, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].</p><p id="Par64">The need for more, and more effective, interventions targeting the primary prevention of chronic diseases by encouraging healthy lifestyles in children has been explicitly acknowledged. The Chief Medical Officer for England&#x02019;s 2012 Annual Report, &#x02018;Our Children Deserve Better: Prevention Pays&#x02019; and the UK&#x02019;s &#x02018;Childhood Obesity Plan for Action&#x02019; highlight the importance of the school environment in promoting healthy behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. While there are examples of school-based sedentary behaviour interventions from Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>], New Zealand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], differences in school systems, curricula and cultures preclude direct translation of these findings to the UK. Schools are a crucial setting for addressing health inequalities, with classroom-based interventions being accessible to all children. The ethnically diverse and socio-economically deprived geographical location of this study allows us to test this type of intervention under challenging circumstances. If acceptable, it is likely to be transferable to most UK schools.</p><p id="Par65">This pilot trial will provide the detailed information and insight needed to design a definitive cluster RCT (if preliminary estimates of effectiveness are observed), which will examine the impact of sit-stand desks in the classroom environment on health- and education-related outcomes in UK primary school children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
