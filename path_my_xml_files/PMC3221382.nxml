Participants allocated to the information intervention only had access to the website during the 1- to 1.5-hour intervention session. The primary outcome measures were depression literacy (depression knowledge), personal stigma (personal stigma toward people with a mental illness), perceived stigma (participants&#x02019; views about the probable attitude of the general community toward people with mental illness), and depressive symptoms. Depression literacy, personal and perceived stigma, and depressive symptoms were assessed at preassessment, postassessment, and at a 1-week follow-up assessment. The trial was undertaken at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. Randomization and allocation to trial group were carried out using a computer-generated table.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For depression literacy, there was a significant difference between the MIDonline and the control group with those in the MIDonline intervention displaying higher depression literacy scores postassessment (F<sub>1,178</sub> = 144.99, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and at the follow-up assessment (F<sub>1,178</sub> = 129.13, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) than those in the control group. In addition, those in the MIDonline intervention showed a significantly greater decrease in mean personal stigma scores postassessment (F<sub>1,178</sub> = 38.75, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and at the follow-up assessment (F<sub>1,176</sub> = 11.08, <italic>P</italic> = .001) than those in the control group. For perceived stigma, there was no significant difference between the MIDonline intervention and the control group at postassessment (F<sub>1,178</sub> = 0.60, <italic>P</italic> = .44) and at the follow-up assessment (F<sub>1,176</sub> = 1.06, <italic>P</italic> = .30). For level of depression, there was no significant difference between the MIDonline intervention and the control group at preassessment (F<sub>1,201</sub> = 0.56, <italic>P</italic> = .45), postassessment (F<sub>1,178</sub> = 0.03, <italic>P</italic> = .86), or at the follow-up assessment, (<italic>F</italic>
                        <sub>1,175</sub> = 1.71, <italic>P</italic> = .19). Within group effect sizes for depression literacy were &#x02212;1.78 (MIDonline) and &#x02212;0.07 (control); for personal stigma, they were 0.83 (MIDonline) and 0.06 (control); for perceived stigma, they were 0.14 (MIDonline) and 0.16 (control); and for depressive symptoms, they were 0.10 (MIDonline) and 0.10 (control).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Current results suggested that the Internet may be a feasible and effective means for increasing depression knowledge and decreasing personal stigma in non&#x02013;English-speaking immigrant populations residing in English-speaking countries. The lack of change in perceived stigma in this trial is consistent with results in other trials examining online depression stigma interventions in English-speaking groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN76460837; http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN76460837 (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/5xjxva4Uq)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Depression literacy</kwd><kwd>depression-related stigma</kwd><kwd>immigrants</kwd><kwd>Internet-based interventions</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>randomized control trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Low levels of depression literacy (also called depression knowledge) and high levels of stigma associated with mental disorders may be barriers to seeking help from health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. Previous research has indicated that stigma associated with having a mental disorder is more prominent in non&#x02013;English-speaking immigrant communities, especially among people born in Greece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. In 2006, Australia was home to over 110,000 Greek-born and 199,100 Italian-born people, with Melbourne having the largest Greek-born population outside of Greece [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. In addition, the 2 most common of the 400 non-English languages spoken at home in Australia in 2006 were Italian and Greek, accounting for 1.6% and 1.3% respectively of the languages spoken at home among the Australian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. However, despite non&#x02013;English-speaking people comprising a substantial proportion of Australia&#x02019;s population, with Italian-born and Greek-born making up the third and sixth largest non&#x02013;English-speaking overseas-born groups living in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>], there is a lack of research into depression literacy and stigma related to depression in these groups.</p><p>Online psychoeducational interventions have been reported to be effective in increasing depression literacy and reducing personal stigma (stigma toward people with a mental illness) related to depression in English-speaking populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Online information and psychological interventions have also been found to be effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults (eg, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]) and in addressing stigma related to mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. However, there is a lack of culturally appropriate evidence-based educational interventions for depression for non&#x02013;English-speaking immigrant communities especially in the Australian context. There are good reasons to target such interventions to middle- and older-aged immigrants of a non&#x02013;English-speaking background, especially those who are Greek- and Italian-born. Compared with Anglo-Australians, people in these groups have been found to hold stronger stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness such as schizophrenia and depression, they tend to be at higher risk of developing depression, and they have been found to underutilize professional psychological services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]. In this study, we evaluated the impact of a new, open access, Web-based multilingual informational intervention, Multicultural Information on Depression online (MIDonline), on depression literacy, personal (personal stigma toward people with a mental illness) and perceived stigma (participants&#x02019; views about the probable attitude of the general community toward people with a mental illness), and depressive symptoms among Greek-born and Italian-born immigrants living in Melbourne, Australia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial Design</title><p>This was a single centre, cross-sectional, parallel group, randomized controlled trial with balanced randomization (ie, 1:1), and with stratification at level of country. The study was conducted at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were a community sample of 129 Greek-born and 73 Italian-born immigrants living in Melbourne, Australia. They were recruited between November 11, 2006, and June 6, 2009, by advertising the research project in Greek and Italian social and welfare clubs and in the print and radio media directed at Greek- and Italian-speaking residents of Melbourne. Eligibility criteria for the study included being 45 years of age or over and having been born in Greece or Italy. The total sample comprised 144 women and 58 men. The mean participant age was 65.4 years (SD 8.57, range 48 to 88 years). Monash University Committee on Ethics in Research Involving Humans granted approval for the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>MIDonline Intervention</title><p>The intervention comprised the consumer section of the MIDonline website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>], which provides online multilingual information about depression designed for middle- to older-aged consumers from a non&#x02013;English-speaking background. The material is available in Greek, Italian, and English. The website content incorporates information about symptoms and case studies of depression, how depression is diagnosed, related disorders, causes, treatment options, how to find a bilingual mental health professional and professional psychological care, stigma related to mental illness, and multilingual translated resources. The information is provided in a culturally relevant way. For example, case studies are representative of middle- to older-aged people of both genders who are Greek- and Italian-born.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Screenshot of the MIDonline website intervention in English</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i2e34_fig1"/></fig><fig id="figure2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Screenshot of the MIDonline website in Italian</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i2e34_fig2"/></fig><fig id="figure3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Screenshot of the MIDonline website in Greek</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i2e34_fig3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Control Condition</title><p>The control intervention consisted of a semistructured interview with a bilingual interviewer who asked open-ended questions relating to the participant&#x02019;s beliefs about depression including the causes, symptoms, course and development, treatments, and outcomes of depression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>Greek-born and Italian-born participants who opted to take part in the research contacted the researchers who were listed in the advertisements related to the study. The interviewers organized a suitable time for eligible participants to take part either in the MIDonline intervention or the depression interview. Each participant was assigned a bilingual interviewer who administered the preassessments, postassessments, follow-up assessments, and interventions. The investigators were not involved in conducting any of the interviews or interventions.</p><p>All participants took part in two face-to-face sessions. During the first session, participants were administered a face-to-face preintervention questionnaire followed by the MIDonline intervention or the depression control interview and then a face-to-face postintervention questionnaire. The second session included a follow-up face-to-face questionnaire administered 1 week later. Questionnaires were completed in an interview format with the bilingual researchers due to the suspected low literacy levels among participants. All participants who took part in the study completed the preintervention, postintervention, and 1-week follow-up questionnaires. The follow-up questionnaire was completed an average of 7.95 days (SD 2.34) after participants had completed the postintervention questionnaire. The project was conducted from November 11, 2006, through June 6, 2009. The intervention delivery and data collection took place in a consultation room located at Monash University.</p><p>Prior to the study, all bilingual interviewers attended a training session during which they were provided with instruction and written verbatim protocols for conducting both the MIDonline intervention and the depression interview control condition.</p><p>For the MIDonline intervention, the participant and interviewer sat together in front of a computer displaying the MIDonline website. In the first 10 minutes of this session, interviewers explained that the purpose of the website was to increase knowledge about depression and instructed participants on how to navigate through the main sections of the website. These sections included information on depressive symptoms, case studies, how depression is diagnosed, treatment options, and stigma related to mental illness. Participants were then given an hour to read through the online material by themselves. Although the interviewers remained in the room during this period, they were instructed not to discuss the material with the participants. Participants only had access to the MIDonline website during the intervention on this one occasion.</p><p>Participants in the control condition took part in an interview in which interviewers asked participants a set of open-ended questions relating to the participant&#x02019;s beliefs about the causes, important symptoms, course and development, treatments, and outcomes of depression. Both the MIDonline intervention and the control interview took 1 to 1.5 hours each to complete.</p><p>In all, six bilingual interviewers assisted participants through the MIDonline intervention or the depression attention control interview, four of whom spoke Italian and two of whom spoke Greek. All interviewers had experience conducting bilingual interviews and were registered psychologists (except for one Greek bilingual interviewer and one Italian bilingual interviewer, each of whom was a probationary psychologist). Both the intervention and the control interview were undertaken in the participant&#x02019;s language of choice (either Greek or Italian). All participants provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.</p><fig id="figure4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Flow of participants through research trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jmir_v13i2e34_fig4"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Participation</title><p>

All self-report scales were translated from English into Greek and Italian for the purpose of this study by the first author (LK) and other bilingual psychologists. All item translations were reconsidered by a second bilingual psychologist and researcher. More difficult or ambiguous items were examined for meaning with lay members of the Greek and Italian communities and other mental health professionals working with these communities at the time. This method was preferred over sequential/back translation methods by an interpreter as it capitalized on the expertise of bilingual mental health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. Validity was checked by examining the psychometric properties of the scales (factor structure and internal consistency) after data were collected and preceding any further analysis.</p><sec><title>Sociodemographic Variables and Clinical History</title><p>The following sociodemographic variables were measured: age in years, gender, marital status (married, widowed, separated, single), birthplace and currently working (yes/no), and length of stay in Melbourne (in years). Level of education was measured on a 7-point scale (did not attend school, did not complete primary, completed primary, completed some secondary school, completed all secondary school, completed some tertiary, completed tertiary). Occupation level was measured on an 8-point scale (never did paid work, unskilled/semiskilled work, qualified tradesperson, clerical/office work, manager of a small business/shop/farm, manager of a small organization/company, professional requiring some university education, professional requiring high level of university education). Current living situation was measured with a 5-point scale where participants were asked about whether spouse, children, siblings, in-laws, parents, or other relatives were living at home with them. The Greek or Italian identity respectively with responses measured on a 4-item scale (not at all, a little, much, very much) with higher scores indicating greater ethnic identification. Items examined how Greek or Italian the participant felt, how important being Greek or Italian was to them, and to what extent they maintained the Greek or Italian way of doing things. Using the same rating scales, all participants were asked to rate the extent to which they considered themselves as having an Australian identity, how Australian the person felt, how important being Australian was to them, and to what extent they maintained the Australian way of doing things. English language proficiency was measured with a 5-item scale with responses measured on a 5-point scale (poor, fair, good, very good and excellent). Items depicted situations of different communicative difficulty and included shopping, regular banking, attending an English-speaking doctor, discussing important finances with the bank manager, and writing on formal business. Memory functioning was measured with a 6-item scale that asked participants about their memory of people&#x02019;s names, stories, appointments, dates, news, and grocery lists. Responses were measured on a 5-point scale (much poorer than average, a little poorer than average, average, a little better than average, much better than average). Higher scores indicated better memory functioning. Participants were asked whether they were currently receiving treatment for an emotional or psychological problem (yes/no) and what type of treatment was being received and by whom. Level of depressive symptoms was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory&#x02013;II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measures were levels of depression literacy, personal and perceived depression-related stigma, and severity of depressive symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Depression Literacy</title><p>Depression literacy was assessed using translated and adapted versions of the D-Lit scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] which is a 22-item true/false test of knowledge about depression. A higher score on this scale indicated greater literacy. An example of an item on the D-lit is: &#x0201c;People with depression may feel guilty when they are not at fault<italic>.&#x0201d;</italic> Of the original items, 4 were replaced with the following items to better reflect the content of the MIDonline website. These items included: &#x0201c;Major depression is one of the leading causes of disability and loss of quality of life in the world,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Causes of depression range from genetics, our environment, personality, our biochemistry and having other medical conditions,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Nearly twice as many women as men are affected by depression,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Both antidepressants and talk therapies like CBT can be effective in treating depression.&#x0201d; The internal reliability analyses in the present sample indicated an alpha coefficient of .88 for the Greek version and .92 for the Italian version.</p></sec><sec><title>Depression Stigma</title><p>Changes in personal (reflecting participants&#x02019; personal attitudes) and perceived (reflecting participants&#x02019; beliefs about the attitudes of others) depression stigma were assessed using the 18-item Depression Stigma Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. Half of the items required participants to rate how strongly they personally agreed with a statement about depression (eg, &#x0201c;people with depression are unpredictable&#x0201d;). The other half of the items asked the participant to indicate what they thought most other people believed about the same issue (eg, &#x0201c;most people believe that people with depression are unpredictable&#x0201d;). Ratings were made on a 5-point Likert scale. Scores on the total scale range from 0 to 36 for the full scale and 0 to 18 for each of the two 9-item subscales, with higher scores indicating greater stigma. Cronbach alpha values for the total, personal, and perceived stigma scales were .68, .62, and .82 respectively for the Greek version. The correlation between the scores on the personal and perceived stigma scales was .13 (n = 129, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; .05). For the Italian version, Cronbach alpha values for the total, personal, and perceived stigma scales were .80, .76 and .72 respectively, and the correlation between the scores on the personal and perceived stigma scales was .39 (n = 73, <italic>P</italic> = .01).</p></sec><sec><title>Depressive Symptoms</title><p>Depression severity was measured with the Beck Depression Inventory&#x02013;II (BDI&#x02013;II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>], which is a 21-item instrument for measuring severity of depression in adults. Responses to items covered the &#x0201c;past two weeks, including today.&#x0201d; Responses on the BDI&#x02013;II items range from 0 to 6 with higher values indicating higher severity. The internal reliability analyses in the present sample indicated an alpha coefficient of .90 for the Greek version and .89 for the Italian version.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants were randomly assigned by the first author following a simple randomization procedure using a computerized list of random numbers to one of two intervention groups (either the MIDonline intervention (n = 110) or the control group (n = 92) using a 1:1 allocation with stratification at level of country).

The effect sizes for level of depression were 0.10 (MIDonline) and 0.10 (control).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrated that there were significant differences between the intervention group and the control group for depression literacy and personal stigma scores but not for perceived stigma or level of depression scores.</p><p>The finding that an educational intervention can increase depression literacy and reduce personal stigma related to depression has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate such benefits among non&#x02013;English-speaking immigrants to an English-speaking country. Strategies in the MIDonline website that may have contributed to the stigma reduction effect include the reinforcement of the message that depression is treatable and details of effective treatments, the use of culturally appropriate case studies, listings of bilingual mental health professionals, and information about culturally appropriate self-help strategies.</p><p>The identification of an intervention that will decrease personal stigma in this group is important given that the baseline levels of personal stigma for the two immigrant groups were higher than have previously been documented for the general, predominantly Anglo-Australian, adult population in previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and that previous research has found that personal depression stigma is higher in ethnic populations than English-speaking populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>].</p><p>The finding that the depression Internet intervention did not decrease perceived stigma levels in Greek-born and Italian-born immigrants is consistent with a previous Internet intervention study that reported similar outcomes for an English-speaking community sample with elevated depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]. The MIDonline website emphasizes that emotions can be changed by changing thoughts and behaviors, which may have led participants to perceive that others believe that depression is controllable by the depressed person and, hence, the fault of the depressed person. In addition, MIDonline described the history and current widespread stigmatizing beliefs about mental illness among Greek-born and Italian-born communities. This information may have reinforced the belief that stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness are still widely and strongly held in the wider Greek-born and Italian-born immigrant communities. These findings suggest that no single approach is likely to reduce all aspects of mental health&#x02013;related stigma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>].</p><p>The finding that the change in perceived stigma between postintervention and follow-up differed for the MIDonline and control groups is more difficult to interpret. Inspection of the scores suggests that the effect was primarily due to a reduction in perceived stigma among the control participants. It is conceivable that contact with interviewers among the control group led to a delayed reduction in the perception of stigma among that group, whereas, as noted above, the MIDonline content reinforced participants&#x02019; perceptions of stigma in others. Alternatively, the finding may be a spurious result attributable to statistical error associated with multiple comparisons. Further research is needed to investigate this finding.</p><p>Low literacy has previously been shown to be a barrier to finding health information for adults from an ethnic background, particularly on the Internet and independent of Internet and computer literacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]. Many people from a non&#x02013;English-speaking ethnic background worldwide lack access to mental health&#x02013;related information that meets their linguistic, cultural, or literacy needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]. The current study is a step toward addressing these issues by matching text readability more closely to the literacy levels of our target audience by using language targeted to school grade level 7 or 8.</p><p>Viewing the MIDonline website did not result in any changes to level of depression. This contrasts with findings from a systematic review that found that psychoeducational interventions were associated with reduced depressive symptoms relative to control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]. There are two possible explanations for this discrepancy. First, participants in the current study were not selected on the basis of depressive symptomatology or depression, and the average baseline symptom scores fell well below the BDI-II cutoff score of 14 for mild depression. More significantly, however, the 2-week time frame used in the BDI-II for assessing presence of symptoms was not appropriate for immediate and 1-week follow-up time frames. Further research is required to determine if informational interventions can reduce depressive symptoms among those with elevated depressive symptoms in this population.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The study has some limitations. The samples may not have been representative of the broader Greek-born and Italian-born ethnic communities. Both samples were obtained by advertising the study in ethno-specific welfare and social groups and included individuals who volunteered to participate and who were willing to undertake an Internet intervention to increase their knowledge of depression. The fact that this methodology excluded individuals who do not frequent such clubs and organizations may limit the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>As part of this study, instrumentation was translated and, where appropriate, modified for the purpose of examining depression literacy and stigma in Greek-born and Italian-born people. The translated instruments may have been measuring different concepts than those measured by the English version of the scale.</p><p>Previous studies have found that socially desirable responding influences symptom reporting in non&#x02013;English-speaking populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]. Such effects may occur for stigma measures. Future work is required to evaluate the effect of social desirability on the findings. Another limitation of the current study is that the same interviewer was used for the assessment and intervention phases of the study providing a potential source of bias. Similarly, the involvement of the first author in the randomization process had the potential to introduce allocation bias.</p><p>A final limitation of the study is that the posttesting and follow-up testing occurred soon after completion of the intervention. Longer follow-up periods are required to examine the sustainability of effects. In addition, an interviewer was present during the MIDonline intervention to assist participants in the navigation of the consumer section of the website. Hence, the current intervention involved some, albeit minimal, face-to-face interviewer guidance, and it is not known if automated distal delivery will yield similar findings in this population.</p></sec><sec><title>Future Research</title><p>The current study demonstrated the effectiveness of a culturally appropriate depression information intervention in increasing depression literacy and reducing personal stigma among Greek and Italian immigrant populations, who have been shown previously to hold strongly stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illness. Future work is required to examine whether such interventions are effective in reducing stigma among other non&#x02013;English-speaking immigrant populations and in those with a current or past history of depression or their family members. Future studies should also investigate the information technology literacy and health-related Internet use among the older, non&#x02013;English-speaking population.</p><p>In the current study, the magnitude of effect sizes for the Web-based intervention are very large, and in a public health context, these effect sizes could translate into large gains for large numbers of people at a low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>]. The intervention warrants further investigation as a method for delivering depression literacy and stigma reduction programs for depression in other non&#x02013;English immigrant groups, particularly in an automated format without guidance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The current study was funded by a major research grant by Beyondblue: the National Depression Initiative.
