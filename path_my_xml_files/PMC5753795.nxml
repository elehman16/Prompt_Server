Digital health tools and consumer technology offer promising opportunities for interventions, but few studies have evaluated how they might be incorporated into existing interventions or used to create new types of interventions. It remains unclear which approaches would be most beneficial for underserved pediatric populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To describe the design and rationale of a single-center randomized, controlled trial evaluating the effects of personal activity tracker (PAT) use by parents on weight-status improvement in both parents and overweight children enrolled in BodyWorks (BW), a comprehensive behavioral family-lifestyle intervention program (CBFLI), in a primary-care clinic serving a predominantly low-income Latino population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study is being conducted in the AltaMed general pediatrics clinic at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. Eligible participants are families (child and adult caregiver) in which the child is between 7 and 18 years of age, has a BMI &#x02265;85th percentile for age and sex, and has been referred to BW by their AltaMed pediatrician. BW consists of one weekly, two-hour session for 7 weeks. In a given cycle, the program is offered on two separate nights: Monday (Spanish) and Wednesday (English). Families self sort into one of two groups based on language preference. To ensure balanced allocation of language preference groups and prevent in-group cross contamination, block randomization is used to assign whole groups to either the intervention or control arms of the study. The control arm consists of usual care, while the intervention arm adds assigning a Fitbit PAT to the parents and training them in its proper use. Study personnel are blinded to group assignment during the analysis phase. Study outcomes include attendance rate, program completion rate, and changes in weight-status improvement, defined as change in weight and BMI for adults and change in BMI z-score for children. We hypothesize that the intervention arm will have better weight-related outcomes than the control arm. Study completion is anticipated in 2017, after the enrollment of approximately 150 families.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study aim is to evaluate the effects of PATs on weight-related outcomes in overweight children and parents participating in a CBFLI. The results will be important for determining whether wearable devices are an effective addition to weight loss interventions for overweight and obese children.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Childhood obesity</kwd><kwd>Fitbit</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Activity monitor</kwd><kwd>Family-based intervention</kwd><kwd>Wearable devices</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="nomen0010"><title>Nomenclature</title><def-list><def-item><term id="d0010">BW</term><def><p id="p0010">BodyWorks</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0015">CBFLI</term><def><p id="p0015">Comprehensive Behavioral Family Lifestyle Intervention</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0020">PAT</term><def><p id="p0020">Personal Activity Tracker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0025">PA</term><def><p id="p0025">physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0030">SRPA</term><def><p id="p0030">Self Reported Physical Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0035">OMPA</term><def><p id="p0035">Objectively Measured Physical Activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0040">CSHQ-A</term><def><p id="p0040">Children's Sleep Habits Questionnaire (Abbreviated)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0045">RAPID</term><def><p id="p0045">Research in Academic Pediatrics Initiative on Diversity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0050">NIDDK</term><def><p id="p0050">National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term id="d0055">FQHC</term><def><p id="p0055">Federally Qualified Health Center</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0060">Childhood obesity continues to be a global public concern, with rates of childhood overweight and obesity rapidly rising, and in some cases tripling, in low-, middle-, and high-income countries <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

CBFLI involves the child and at least one caretaker, and addresses all three major areas of weight-loss interventions: dietary intake, physical activity (PA), and behavioral strategies <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Educating and engaging the caretaker enables changes in the home environment, which facilitates child weight-loss or stabilization. Due to their comprehensive nature, CBFLI programs can be expensive to run and difficult to implement in low-resource settings, putting them out of reach of low-income families.</p><p id="p0075">A key component of pediatric weight loss programs in general, and CBFLIs in particular, is parent involvement.

Not enough is known, however, about whether PATs are effective in the management of childhood obesity <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. In this study, we incorporate OMPA via PAT into BodyWorks (BW), a national CBFLI program at an urban federally qualified health center (FQHC). Uniquely, we provide the PAT intervention to the parents in the family, as well as the child.</p><p id="p0085">This randomized, controlled trial is designed to 1) establish a baseline of enrollment, attendance, completion, and weight outcomes for BW, and 2) evaluate the effects of personal activity trackers on weight-related outcomes in overweight children and their parents. The primary study hypothesis is that children of families utilizing PAT will have improved weight-related outcomes, defined as either a stabilization or decrease of BMI z-scores, over the course of their participation in the BW program. Our secondary hypothesis is that participating parents who use PAT will have better weight-related outcomes at the end of the program. The trial will be open for 24 months.

Self-monitoring is an effective behavior change technique <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and has been demonstrated to increase PA in adults <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Digital PATs enable self-monitoring of PA while eliminating the burden of manual data entry. Parents enrolled in BW can use PATs to self-monitor PA, which should lead to increases in PA. This increase in parent PA leads to better role modeling for their children and better engagement in the program. These should have an overall impact in the child's PA and engagement. Joint participation and early successes will positively feedback to both parent and child, leading to overall improved weight-related outcomes for both members of the dyad (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>BW+PAT intervention conceptual framework.

We care for approximately 21,000 children and provide upwards of 85,000 patient visits a year. Almost 90% of patients are insured by Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.2"><label>2.3.2</label><title>The BodyWorks program</title><p id="p0110">Our clinic has three different weight-loss intervention programs predicated on the family's readiness for change. BW is the only CBFLI program offered in the primary care setting for overweight and obese children and their families. Primary care providers refer patients and their families based on family needs and motivation level. BW is typically selected by those with an interest in group participation, ability to commit two hours per week for seven weeks, and have multiple overweight children in one family. Once patients are referred, they are contacted by the program coordinator, who gives the family an overview of the program, explains the time commitment, and verifies the family's intent to participate. If the family is still interested, they are enrolled in the next available cycle of BW; the wait time is typically 2 months. The program is offered at no cost to the family.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.3"><label>2.3.3</label><title>Population of BodyWorks patients</title><p id="p0115">BW is available to all overweight children seen in the AltaMed@CHLA primary care clinic. Overweight is defined as a BMI &#x02265;85th percentile for age and gender. The adult enrollee may be a parent or other influential adult in the child's life. There are no age, developmental or health restrictions for participating in BW, except to the extent that they affect the child's ability to participate in the program.</p><p id="p0120">In addition to the primary child and adult enrollees, additional enrollees are permitted and encouraged. All siblings, whether patients of the clinic or not, are eligible to participate in BW. Other adults connected to the primary enrollee may also participate, including relatives, family friends, or parental friends. No other children beyond the primary enrollee's siblings, however, are permitted. Additional enrollees are generally 6 years or older to participate, engage, and tolerate the duration of the BW programs, but accommodations are made for families for whom child care is a barrier to participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3.4"><label>2.3.4</label><title>Study design, randomization, blinding, and addressing bias</title><p id="p0125">This is a prospective, open-label randomized controlled trial that follows the CONSORT reporting guidelines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.<fig id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0015">Fig. 2</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr2"/></fig></p><p id="p0130">There are two groups within every BW cycle, conducted on two separate nights. The Monday group is taught in Spanish and the Wednesday group is taught in English. This is based on staff availability. Patients and families choose their BW session based on convenience and language preference. To ensure balanced allocation of language groups and prevent in-group informational and behavioral cross-contamination, block randomization was used to assign whole groups to either the intervention or control arms of the study. Hence in cycles 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, the English-preference group receives the intervention, while in cycles 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, the Spanish-preference group receives the intervention.</p><p id="p0135">Once in a group, families are asked to attend all 7 sessions on the same night to reduce cross-contamination and maintain group cohesion. When a family has a scheduling conflict in a given week, however, they can attend the alternate night group. This is to ensure that they receive the full BW curriculum. Aside from the intervention (described below), the curriculum is identical for both groups.</p><p id="p0140">Because the intervention involves wearing a device, there is no practical way to blind participants or providers. The data is blinded to the data analysis team via a randomly assigned study identifier to minimize bias. Participants are instructed to limit potential co-interventions by refraining from herbal supplements or other &#x0201c;weight-loss&#x0201d; supplements/medications. They were also instructed to not purchase any other PAT during the 7-week period of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Control arm: BodyWorks with self-reported physical activity (SRPA)</title><p id="p0145">Control participants in BW completed a paper SRPA journal each week.

Enrollment began in July 2015 and is projected to continue through June 2017. Families are approached to participate in the study during their first session of BW. Because new families can join the group up to and including session 3, we actively recruit during the first 3 sessions. Families that join after week 3 are not approached to participate. All parents are approached to enroll in the study, whereupon the study goal, design, procedure, and incentives are explained. Bilingual study assistants are available to answer any questions. Incentives are provided at completion of the program and return of the PAT. Program completion is defined as attendance to 4 of 7 weekly BW sessions, including the final session. This definition corresponds with the threshold of involvement at which point behavioral changes have been observed based on the experience and opinion of the BW team. Study participants are eligible for a $15 gift card upon program completion. Participants with PATs receive a $50 gift card per family upon PAT return.</p><p id="p0160">Inclusion criteria were kept broad and exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum so that our study would be reflective of the actual clinical program. We enroll families that meet the following eligibility criteria: the primary child is 7&#x02013;18 years old, has a BMI &#x02265;85% for age and gender, and has at least one parent or caretaker able to attend the sessions with the child. BW patients are excluded from the study if they are &#x0003c;7 years old, unable to wear a PAT as described in the study protocol, unwilling to wear a PAT, or unwilling to participate in the study.

Participants are weighed in light indoor clothing without shoes. These scales are calibrated weekly using the same technique. Height is measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;cm using a wall-mounted Seca Height-Rite model 225 stadiometer (Seca, Chino, CA, USA). BMI is calculated for each session using the following formula: [patient weight (kg)/height<sup>2</sup> (m<sup>2</sup>)]. Heart rate and blood pressure measurements are taken using a Welch Allyn Spot Vital Signs LXi device (Welch Allyn, Skaneateles Falls, NY, USA). Measurements are taken at rest while the patient is in a seated position with the back supported, feet flat on the floor, and arm at heart level.</p><p id="p0185">After measurement of resting heart rate and blood pressure, participants are asked to perform a 3-minute step test during the first and last sessions.

As financial, clinical, and temporal resources are limited, improving the effectiveness of existing weight loss interventions is valuable from a personal, professional, and societal perspective. As noted by the Children's Health Fund, mobile health technologies enable new care models, and such disruptive innovations have the potential to reduce pediatric health disparities <xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>.

Due to significant participant dropout with an 8-week program length, BW was shortened to 7 weeks. In condensing the curriculum, however, addressing important topics was difficult, especially with the addition of new health topics. In practice, this manifested as difficulty staying within each class meeting's time limits. The BW program adapted by focusing on operational improvements for more efficient sessions and training staff to ensure a positive participant experience. For example, nutrition and occupational therapy (OT) students were given explicit instructions for class session and role-playing activities days in advance. Before, students were given instructions the day of class sessions; the new structure resulted in greater student familiarity with class activities. Additionally, front desk staff and medical assistants were trained to emphasize good patient interaction and bedside manner. Obtaining consent was also shifted to the orientation session so that there was more time to complete the educational activities, as the process can be time-consuming.</p><p id="p0300">By adjusting not only lesson content, but also how it was delivered, BW improved the overall curriculum to better engage participants. For example, participants showed little enthusiasm for the BW video, preferring in vivo activities during the sessions. In response, BW provided the video as a DVD in each participant's program packet, and utilized the time instead for a grocery store tour. This tour was possible due not only to the reallocated time, but also due to the relationship developed between the BW team and grocery store management. The store was adjacent to CHLA, enabling the team to seamlessly incorporate the activity after didactic lessons. Additionally, management at the grocer accommodated activities that engage and excite the children, offering children opportunities to select produce to taste test in a produce exhibit. This encouraged participants to try new, healthy food options. BW also aims to enroll several families per group so as to promote group unity, cohesion, and accountability.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.2"><label>5.1.2</label><title>High coordinator turnover</title><p id="p0305">The involvement of nutrition and OT student interns presented its own challenges in program continuity and consistency. OT student interns were actively involved in teaching BW during the school year, and could obtain class credit. During the summer, however, they conducted fieldwork, limiting their involvement in BW and restricting expertise in play-based learning. Additionally, nutrition interns were only involved with BW for several weeks. Each cohort of interns was trained for 2&#x000a0;h prior to involvement, resulting in a relatively frequent, recurring time commitment from the BW lead.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.3"><label>5.1.3</label><title>Challenges related to serving an underserved population</title><p id="p0310">BW participants came from predominantly low socioeconomic status families, which may have been a marker for decreased access to and familiarity with technology. Many of the participants did not own computers, nor had regular access to one, and some did not have smartphones. As a result, they were unable to use the Fitbit smartphone or desktop computer application to sync and review their activity data. For this reason, we synced Fitbits for all users once a week during class and provided them access to their data. This was a different user experience than intended by the manufacturer, and indeed from others who did have access to the necessary pairing technology. Over the course of the year, however, we noted that more and more families had smartphones, so future iterations of the intervention will incorporate allowing participants to sync Fitbits to their personal devices.</p><p id="p0315">Although the BW program is a mature weight-management program that operates outside of the study, it continues to struggle with participation. It is estimated by the program lead that only 25% of contacted patients appear for the first class. Additionally, although classes are scheduled to occur outside of standard business hours, some parents had irregular work hours and were unable to attend the same weekday session from week to week. BW was first and foremost a community-based intervention meant to support these families, so every attempt was made to accommodate this variability in schedule even at the expense of clear segregation and blinding between the intervention and control groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.4"><label>5.1.4</label><title>Challenges related to PAT usage</title><p id="p0320">Improper usage and loss of PATs is observed among some participants. Adult participants lose or damage PATs during work or everyday life. To date, our 60 devices have been loaned to participants 101 times; 1 has been lost; 3 have been damaged; and 14 are accounted for but have not been returned to program coordinators. Additionally, some participants have difficulty wearing PATs as instructed or keeping PATs charged. Gaps in PAT data typically indicated a lack of charging, and in such instances, the participant is typically unaware that the PAT was inactive. The frequency of such behavior is being recorded, and is an interesting area for future study to further understand the mechanism by which PATs interact with behavior. It is likely that if patients had access to their PAT data on mobile devices, they may have been more aware of whether the PAT was charged or not. Unfortunately, funding mobile devices for participants is beyond the scope of this study.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.5"><label>5.1.5</label><title>Legal restrictions on pediatric research</title><p id="p0325">The active intervention was limited to children &#x02265;13 years old due to factors outside of the control of the BW team. Federal law in the US prevents the creation of online accounts for children &#x0003c;13 years old without parental permission <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. Although the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) has been amended since its original passage in 1998, it still requires parental permission for certain online registrations and activities, and Fitbit policies prohibit the creation of accounts for children&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;13 years old <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. This regulation creates some additional difficulties in studying any technology with an online component in a pediatric population. The interpretation and enforcement of the terms of use by manufacturers and research institutions, however, has been highly variable, with several published studies reporting the use of Fitbit and other devices in children &#x0003c;13 years old <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. Until there is further clarification of this law, researchers, IRBs, and manufacturers must continue to clarify roles and agreements on a study-by-study basis.</p><p id="p0330">Our institution has decided that COPPA applies to this and other device studies, which required that our original study design (having all parents and all children, regardless of age, use PATs) be amended after obtaining funding and IRB approval to limit device use to children 13 years of age or older. While this creates some heterogeneity in the intervention group (some parent-child dyads have two devices users while other have one), because we believe the primary mechanism of action of PATs is through the parent, it is reasonable to analyze all intervention families as one group. Over time, a sufficiently large <italic>n</italic> may allow us to conduct sub-group analyses to evaluate the impact of one vs. two PAT users within the parent-child dyad.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.6"><label>5.1.6</label><title>Future directions</title><p id="p0335">Our conceptual framework is informed by theory and anecdotal experience, but lacks empiric evidence. We intend to conduct additional qualitative research to better understand how PATs affect weight loss-related behavior change in this patient population. Our current study limits the participants' ability to track their own data to just using the LED display on the device; future studies will give full, real-time data access to participants, thereby enabling comprehensive self-monitoring. Expanding to other sites and enrolling different populations would improve the generalizability of our intervention. As digital health interventions proliferate, several studies and clinical programs have started combining multiple modalities: wearable devices, text messaging, mobile applications, etc. We hope to study whether a more comprehensive &#x0201c;digital ecosystem&#x0201d; may have a larger effect than just a single device. Understanding if there is a &#x0201c;dose effect&#x0201d; with technology interventions will be valuable for intervention design and budget allocation, particularly in resource-limited settings. Finally, working closely with our institution, manufacturers, and legal counsel, we hope to arrive at a reasonable approach to studying digital health interventions in pediatric populations that is both in keeping with federal regulation and reflective of real world use.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0340">Pediatric weight management is a complex and multidisciplinary endeavor, and there is an array of new, affordable technologies that may augment and improve existing clinical programs. Although research in the efficacy of these technologies is still early, it is important to ensure that researchers and clinicians consider how they may be evenly applied to all patients, including the underserved. Working with this population entails its own unique challenges regarding resource availability, technology familiarity, and language barriers. As the existing BW program demonstrates, however, proper preparation and staffing enable programs to operate effectively. The BW study has implications for the use of PATs in conjunction with weight-management programs as objective measures of activity as well as potential sources of motivation, which may influence program completion rates and weight-related outcomes. With our planned sample size, age range, and patient diversity, we are well positioned to gain valuable insights regarding the effects of PATs on weight outcomes for overweight children enrolled in a weight-management program at an FQHC.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>World Health Organization</surname></name></person-group><chapter-title>Global Status Report on Noncommunicable Diseases 2010</chapter-title><comment>Geneva</comment><year>2011</year><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789240686458%7B_%7Deng.pdf" id="intref0015">http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789240686458%7b_%7deng.pdf</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Onis</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bl&#x000f6;ssner</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Borghi</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global prevalence and trends of overweight and obesity among preschool children</article-title><source>Am.
