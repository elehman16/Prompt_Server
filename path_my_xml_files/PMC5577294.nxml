Since an increased availability of recombinant GH (rGH) for the treatment of GH-deficient patients, GH has been abused in sports and it is prohibited. &#x0201c;GH-isoform&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;biomarkers&#x0201d; tests are currently available for detection of GH abuse in sports, however both methods suffer from shortcomings. Here, we report on a proteomic approach to search for novel protein biomarkers associated with rGH administration in non-elite athletes. In this study, participants received either placebo or rGH for 8 weeks, and were followed over a 6-week washout period. We used 2-D DIGE and iTRAQ LC-MS/MS analyses to expose rGH-dependent marker proteins. Eight rGH-dependent plasma proteins namely apolipoproptein-L1, alpha-HS-glycoprotein, vitamin D-binding protein, afamin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-ALS, lumican and extracellular matrix proteins 1 were identified. Apolipoprotein L1 and alpha-HS-glycoprotein were validated by Western blots to confirm their identities and expression patterns in rGH- and placebo-treated subject cohorts. Independent confirmation of these putative GH-responsive biomarkers would be of value for clinical practices and may have sports anti-doping utility.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Human growth hormone (GH) is a naturally occurring, 191 amino acid peptide hormone secreted by the pituitary gland which consists of several isoforms, mainly 22&#x02009;kDa and 20&#x02009;kDa isoforms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. There are splice variants of pituitary GH<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, and proteolytic fragments have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In addition to various isoforms, post-translational modifications of the pituitary GH such as deamidation, acetylation, and phosphorylation have been reported<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Owing largely to its anabolic, lipolytic and growth promoting properties, there is a widespread misuse of GH as a performance enhancer in competitive sports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The recombinant form of human growth hormone (rGH) produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria principally for the clinical treatment of endocrine disorders is a 22&#x02009;kDa protein that has identical amino acid sequence with the principle pituitary GH isoform. Consequently, analytical methods to detect exogenous GH misuse in sports remains extremely challenging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) prohibits the use of any form of exogenous GH and growth factor products in sports<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. GH is listed in the prohibited list under class S2 of peptide hormones, growth factors and related substances and mimetics. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has banned the use of exogenous GH in sports since 1989, followed by WADA listing GH as a prohibited substances in 1999<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, an adverse finding of GH abuse was only identified for the first time in 2010<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Currently, there are two approaches used by the WADA-accredited laboratories for detection of GH abuse in sports: <bold>A</bold>) GH isoform test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, and <bold>B</bold>) GH biomarkers test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. The isoform test is based on two immunoassays that distinguish between the 22&#x02009;kDa GH isoform and all other endogenous GH isoforms using specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Administration of exogenous GH increases the concentration of the 22&#x02009;kDa GH isoform only, disrupting the ratio of 22&#x02009;kDa isoform to all pituitary isoforms, which allows identification of GH abuse in athletes. Although this direct isoform detection method is technically robust, it has some inherent limitations, such as: i) the time window for detection is very narrow, up to 36&#x02009;h after the last injection depending on the administered dosage concentration and athlete gender<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>, and ii) cannot detect commercially available purified pituitary derived GH administration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The Biomarkers test is an indirect method which is based on measuring increased levels of GH-responsive proteins such as insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and pro-collagen type III amino-terminal pro-peptide (P-III-NP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, there were some concerns that ethnicity and potential effects of sport injuries may alter the production rate of biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Later study confirmed both biomarkers (IGF-1 and P-III-NP) varied minutely between ethnicity, whereas sport injury did not significantly affect the biomarkers test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A major advantage of using the biomarkers test is the wider time window of detection compared to the isoform test<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The concentration of IGF-1 and P-III-NP markers progress at different rates; the former generally increases to its maximum within two weeks following GH injection, while the latter progresses gradually and usually peaks within 4&#x02013;6 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. After cessation of GH administration, IGF-1 levels decrease rapidly within a week to homeostatic levels whereas P-III-NP decline more slowly, returning to baseline by six weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. This provides an opportunity to use the biomarkers test for both &#x02018;in and out of competition&#x02019; stages.</p><p id="Par6">Despite having an advantage of a wider time window for detection, the biomarker test contains some weaknesses, such as concentration of IGF-1 in circulation is largely age and gender dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and partially sport and exercise dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. To address this variability, several criteria (age, gender, sport, ethnicity etc.) need to be taken into consideration in order to identify exogenous GH administration accurately. This variability has contributed at least in part, for the limited number of positive GH abuse cases in sports to-date.</p><p id="Par7">In this study, we took an unbiased proteomic screening approach aimed to find novel biomarker proteins of GH administration in athletes. New or different analytical techniques or approach are likely to identify novel biomarkers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>; hence, we have employed 2-D DIGE and iTRAQ LC-MS/MS proteomic approaches to search for novel GH biomarker which may strengthen the current biomarker test.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Immunodepletion and 2-D DIGE analysis of plasma proteins</title><p id="Par8">Plasma samples obtained from non-elite athletes whom were administrated with 2&#x02009;mg/day rGH or placebo for 8 weeks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> was analysed by 2-D DIGE following immunodepletion of the top seven most abundant plasma proteins (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Pairwise comparisons were made in three groups; unpaired student t-test was performed for comparison between rGH-treated and placebo-treated groups (<bold>Group A</bold>) whilst paired student t-test was performed to compare temporal changes within the rGH-treated (<bold>Group B</bold>) and temporal changes within the placebo-treated group (<bold>Group C</bold>). For group A, differences were examined at &#x02018;each&#x02019; time point separately, to identify &#x02018;any&#x02019; time dependence.

There were some unique and common spots between the three goups in both phases. The variation in numbers of differentially expressed spots in Phase 1 and Phase 2 is commonly experienced with 2D gel image analysis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and can be attributed to inter-individual subject variation, as each Phase examined different individuals. The 134 and 61 differentially expressed spots were then further analysed by a mixed linear model with a fixed time and treatment effects and a random patient effect. The criteria used for selection of candidate spots were (a) mixed model p-value&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for either the time effect, treatment effect or their interaction, and (b) relative fold-change in the rGH-treated samples along the time course &#x0003e;50% OR between rGH-treated and placebo-treated samples &#x0003e;50%, and (c) relative fold-change in the placebo-treated samples along the time course &#x0003c;30% (described in detail in Supplementary Information page 9).

Out of 52 spots analysed by MS, 39 spots were identified as follows: from the Phase 1 analysis, 20 differentially expressed spots matched to 12 proteins (Supplementary Information Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>).

Further evaluation showed that both KNG-1 and VN demonstrated different expression patterns between Phases 1 and 2 so were excluded from further evaluation. We suspect this is due to variability amongst individuals analysed in the two separate Phases. We also identified apolipoprotein A-1, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and inter-alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 proteins as differentially expressed in one of the analysis Phases only, so, were not evaluated further. Interestingly, previous studies have reported these three proteins to be differentially expressed in rGH or CJC-1295 (an analogue of growth hormone releasing hormone), administered subjects, so while they were not followed further by us, some concordance was observed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>iTRAQ LC MS/MS analysis</title><p id="Par14">As an independent approach to 2-D DIGE we used iTRAQ-LC-M/MS for peptide detection and quantification (experimental design and search results in Supplementary Dataset).

Additionally, for iTRAQ analysis, samples for given time points and groups were pooled due to limited sample availability, whereas in the 2D-DIGE experiments each sample was independently assessed. 385 proteins were identified from six iTRAQ LC-MS/MS runs of HAP immunodepleted plasma. 101 proteins were differentially expressed in <bold>Group A</bold> comparison (i.e. differentially expressed between rGH-treated vs placebo-treated) and 93 proteins in <bold>Group B</bold> comparison (i.e. differentially expressed within rGH-treated, baseline vs other time points) based on +/&#x02212; 1.2-fold change (p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05) during rGH administration period.

Further, using a subset of samples from each treatment group, we conducted 2-D Western blot analysis. A subset of samples randomly selected based on the availability of remaining plasma. 2-D Western blotting was carried out to: i) observe the expressional differences in various isoforms, and ii) correlate the location of the proteins by western blotting with the results obtained by 2D DIGE gels.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>APOL1</title><p id="Par17">Three isoforms were observed in the 1D Western blot that ranged from approximately 35&#x02013;45&#x02009;kDa, and it appeared that these isoforms differed between subjects and also between treatment groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>).

Densitometric analysis showed that the heavier and lighter isoforms were up-regulated in the rGH treated subjects. We further investigated APOL1 in placebo and rGH-treated samples by 2D western blots as it was apparent from the 1D western blots that differential expression pattern exists amongst the heavier and lighter isoforms. These experiments showed that the 40&#x02009;kDa isoform is up-regulated in rGH administered subjects based on the intensity and number of the protein spots (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>).

The spatial locations of gel spots 531 and 1062 (Phase 2) matched with 2-D Western blots however, the molecular weights of spots 1921 (Phase 1) and 1021 (Phase 2) were higher and slightly acidic on DIGE gels compared to the spots detected on the 2-D Western blots. It is noteworthy that AHSG and Kininogen 1 proteins were concurrently identified from spot 1921, and AHSG and Vitronectin proteins were identified from spot 1021. Identification of two proteins from a single 2-D gel spot suggests concurrent migration of two proteins on the gel which may have altered their locations on the 2-D gels.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par19">We applied an unbiased proteomic approach using two independent techniques in a search for protein biomarkers associated with GH administration in non-elite athletes.

Bias correction was selected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Western blot analysis for validation of plasma biomarkers</title><p id="Par32">1-DE and 2-DE Western blot analyses were carried out to validate the two candidate GH plasma marker proteins: APOL1 and AHSG. For 1-DE, 20&#x02009;&#x000b5;g of neat plasma proteins was resuspended in 4x LDS buffer containing 10&#x02009;mM DTT, heated at 95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x02009;min, and separated on 8&#x02013;16% Criterion Tris-HCl pre-cast gels (Bio-Rad). 2-DE separation was carried out as described above using 11&#x02009;cm long IPG strips in the first dimension and 8&#x02013;16% Criterion Tris-HCl pre-cast gels in the second dimension. 1-DE and 2-DE separated proteins were transferred onto pre-equilibrated PVDF membranes using the Bio-Rad Turbo Transfer apparatus (25&#x02009;V, 2.5&#x02009;A for 10&#x02009;min). Blots were blocked in 3% (w/v) skim milk for 1&#x02009;h, washed 3x in TBS/T, and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-APOL1 and anti-AHSG [LifeSpan Biosciences Inc.]) in 3% (w/v) BSA in TBS/T overnight at 4&#x02009;&#x000b0;C. After incubation, membranes were washed 3x with TBS/T, followed by incubation with Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG-HRP for 1&#x02009;h. Blots were incubated for 5&#x02009;min in ECL reagent (Merck-Millipore) and imaged using a FujiFilm LAS 3000 CCD camera (Japan). Densitometry analysis was conducted using ImageJ software (v1.47; National Institute of Health).</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="Par33">For gel image analysis: raw gel images were uploaded into Progenesis &#x0201c;SameSpots&#x0201d; software (Nonlinear Dynamics. UK) and an automated spot detection method was performed. Three different experimental designs were set in Progenesis for spot detection. One design compared between the placebo and rGH-treated subjects at each sample collection time point (<bold>Group A</bold>), one design compared baseline vs all other time points within rGH-treated group only (<bold>Group B</bold>), and the other design compared baseline vs all other time points within placebo-treated group only (<bold>Group C</bold>). Automatic analysis was performed to detect all the spots in all the experiemnts. Each selected spot was verified and manually edited if necessary. Normalized volumes were used to identify spots that were differentially expressed. A cut-off ratio greater than 1.5-fold was imposed and student t-test (unpaired or paired where appropriate) was used to examine the differences (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). For selection of potential GH plasma biomarkers from gel analysis: further statistical analysis was carried out first at phase levels and then combined analysis followed by final candidate spot selection. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the log-transformed spot data was performed, as well as hierarchical clustering of log-transformed spot data using correlation based distance and complete linkage (Supplementary Information Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref> and description of criteria for selection of candidate spots). The results of both approaches showed that the data from the same subjects clustered together, thus the inter-individual effects were strong. As a consequence, when looking for time or treatment differences we employed a mixed effects linear model with fixed time and treatment effects, and a random subject effect, ran separately for each spot. For iTRAQ MS/MS analysis: detected protein threshold (unused ProtScore) was set as larger than 1.3 (better than 95% confidence). Differentially expressed proteins were categorised in two groups such as differentially expressed between rGH-treated vs placebo-treated (<bold>Group A</bold>), and differentially expressed within rGH-treated- baseline vs other sample collection time points (<bold>Group B</bold>). For top scored protein identification in each group, the following two criteria were utilised: i) proteins needed to be &#x0003c;0.83-fold or 1.2-fold differentially expressed with statistical significance p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> during rGH administration period (rGH treatment weeks 4 and 8); and ii) the same proteins identified in all sample collection time points (baseline, rGH treatment weeks 4 and 8, and all washout time points).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
