Because the definite pharmacokinetic study may not incorporate a pharmacodynamic component, Minto <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] proposed an approach for combining pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamics based on the peak effect time, T<sub><sc>PEAK</sc></sub>.

The patients with known or suspected cardiac, liver, renal, neurologic disorder, long- or short-term intake of any sedative, analgesic and psychoactive drug and any known adverse effect to the study drug were excluded. After overnight fasting, the patients were brought to a quiet operating room where a cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein for the injection of propofol and for fluid replacement, and another cannula was inserted into contralateral radial artery for the measurement of invasive blood pressure. Routine monitoring included electrocardiogram, heart rate, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and oxyhemoglobin saturation throughout the study.

Once the pump had injected the mass of propofol necessary to achieve this effect site concentration and while the infusion was stopped, the target concentration was reset to 0 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml. Observer's assessment alertness/sedation (OAA/S)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] were determined every 15 s from the start of infusion. Loss of responsiveness (LOR) was defined as an OAA/S score equal to 0 (<italic>i.e</italic>., no response to painful trapezius squeeze) by an author (Huang), who did not know the propofol delivery scheme. The time of LOR and BIS was recorded. No attempt was made to rouse the subjects until recovery of responsiveness (OAA/S=5, <italic>i.e</italic>., response readily to name spoken in normal tone) and/or BIS 80 or above. This was the end of the first anesthetic cycle.

For comparison, we also examined the integrated propofol pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model with ke0 adapted to T<sub><sc>PEAK</sc></sub> of BIS = 96 s reported by Schnider <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The predicted effect site concentrations should be time independently and unequivocally related to hypnotic effect with an appropriate ke0 value for propofol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Therefore, any individual should achieve LOR at the same effect site concentration of propofol in different stages of the current study. Given the large interindividual variability (and that of intraindividual) relative to population typical ke0 value (and that pharmacokinetics),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] the mean effect site concentration should be similar in a population. Furthermore, we used the same concentration, so the mean peak BIS should be comparable with the mean lowest BIS in both steps. In addition, the relations of effect site concentration-BIS should not show hysteresis loop pattern.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] However, we failed to observe the above-mentioned phenomena, which suggests that the ke0s used in this study had poor performance.</p><p>Mu&#x000f1;oz <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] found that the implementation of the T<sub><sc>PEAK</sc></sub> (65 s) of BIS in the Paedfusor's and Kartaria's models of propofol to target the effect site resulted in a clinically acceptable performance in children. They made the conclusion on the basis of the difference between the predicted peak effect site concentration time and the measured peak BIS time (t<sub>error</sub>), which has also been used in previous studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] We did not use t<sub>error</sub> as the primary outcome measurement because it was not a sensitive indicator to detect ke0 difference. Although biased t<sub>error</sub> of -5 s was found, predicted effect site concentration-BIS hysteresis still occurred as reflected in our results. In view of the variable time delay of BIS and the acute change in BIS with loss of consciousness,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] we also did not use the BIS difference at the time of LOR as primary outcome measurement.</p><p>We did not clinically validate the accuracy of ke0 based on the peak BIS time (74 s) reported by our previous study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Interestingly, we also cannot validate the accuracy of ke0 (T<sub><sc>PEAK</sc></sub>= 96 s, ke0 = 0.46 min<sup>-1</sup>) which was validated by Struys <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The reasons leading to failure of ke0s might be the followings. First, the ke0 is dependent on the underlying pharmacokinetic model, and if the pharmacokinetic model is biased, the estimate of ke0 will bias by that error.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The three-compartment model of Schnider <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] was selected because previous studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] have shown that the model performed well under the condition of constant infusion. An additional advantage of using the Schnider model as a pharmacokinetic basis would have been that we could compare the ke0s derived from different sources with each other. However, as pointed out by Coppens <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] the central compartment volume of propofol appears to be a determinant of a quicker increase in plasma concentration (and that effect site concentration), especially in the first few seconds after bolus injection.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] So, the possible differences of pharmacokinetics will inevitably affect the results. In the second place, it is related to the influence of propofol infusion rate on plasma-effect site equilibration. If the pharmacokinetics is correct, this is perhaps the most important factor. Our ke0 was derived (&#x02248;7200 ml/h) and validated (&#x02248;780 ml/h) in different propofol administrated rate. Struys <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] found that propofol plasma-site equilibration occurs more rapidly after a bolus than after rapid infusion. The t<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> ke0 should be approximately 1.2 min (ke0 = 0.58 min<sup>-1</sup>) when propofol was administered at bolus rate &#x02248;6300 ml/h. Compared with their rate, we actually used a faster rate in our original study. However, Masui and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] reported a ke0 0.414 min<sup>-1</sup> with infusion rate 10-160 mg&#x022c5;kg<sup>-1</sup> &#x022c5;h<sup>-1</sup> (much less than the administration rate of our original study). They suggested that the failure of the ke0 performance is an expected consequence of a flawed assumption with conventional mammillary compartmental models of instantaneous mixing in the central compartment.</p><p>Several critics might be raised. First, effect compartment is a theoretical compartment; its parameters are often dependent on index of observed signs. The BIS and LOR are different signs. Their ke0s may be different. Therefore, we simultaneously measured BIS and LOR in order to avoid this bias. Second, this study used two targets of 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml and 8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml. As the accuracy of ke0 might be different for different effective concentrations, if so, the inter-group comparison might be biased. One might suspect that 8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml and 10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ml whether or not are appropriate to titrate for obtaining LOR in 95% of the cases in respective group. However, these concentrations were determined on the basis of simulation with 2&#x000d7;ED<sub>50</sub> dose (rounded to integer) for female Chinese patients reported by Short <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Moreover, the mean propofol dosage measured at LOR was similar between both groups. Third, for consistency purpose, we correct the time delay of the BIS with 7 s as our previous study. However, the exact time delay is unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] although Struys <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and Masui and colleagues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] found that the lag time of 10 s and 19.7-20.3 s resulted in the best fit in their studies. Fourth, we did not measure plasma concentration, so it is difficult to know exactly the source of the difference. However, we wanted to evaluate the clinical performance of the TCI system using the most common pharmacokinetic model, which is available to the clinician. Similar studies have also been performed without measurement of the Cp of propofol.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study tried to test the ke0 based on the peak effect time of bispectral index from our previous study to target-controlled infusion system of propofol. Unfortunately, we failed to validate clinically the accuracy of application of ke0 (T<sub><sc>PEAK</sc></sub> = 74 s of BIS) with Schnider propofol pharmacokinetic model.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful for the attending anesthetists and nurses of the operating room for their support of this study and all the patients who participated in the trial.
