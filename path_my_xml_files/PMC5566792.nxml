It requires high concentration and high levels of coordination, for example. Studies demonstrated that physical activity connected to high levels of coordination have a positive effect, especially on cognitive control.<xref rid="b11-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Moreover, rock climbing can activate intense positive emotions.<xref rid="b12-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Since the difficulty level can be flexibly varied according to individual fitness, climbing is particularly suitable to prompt a sense of goal achievement and self-efficacy.<xref rid="b12-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Moreover, rock climbing also requires and trains the cooperation between individuals within small groups, as the climbing person always has to rely on safety measures provided by others with switching roles throughout the climbing session.</p><p>To date, acute changes in emotions associated with rock climbing in depressive patients have not been researched explicitly. Some case reports and observational studies and one controlled pilot trial demonstrated positive general therapeutic effects of rock climbing on depressive and anxiety symptoms and self-efficacy in depressive patients.<xref rid="b13-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> None of the mentioned studies, however, examined the immediate changes after a single rock climbing experience in different kinds of negative emotional states in depressive individuals. Accordingly, central aims of this nonrandomized, controlled trial were to examine if negative emotional states decrease and positive emotional states or coping emotions (CE; eg, pride, self-confidence) increase in persons with MDD during a 2.5-hour rock climbing session in comparison to an active control condition (relaxation training).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Participants and study procedure</title><p>This pilot trial included a total of 40 adult inpatients receiving a psychologic and psychiatric inpatient treatment in the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Tuebingen (Germany). Eligible participants had to fulfil the criteria of an MDD or a bipolar disorder, with most recent episode of depression, according to the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Patients suffering from a psychotic disorder were excluded. Presence of other comorbid mental disorders such as anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, or posttraumatic stress disorder was, however, not an exclusion criterion.</p><p>Eligible participants were not randomized, but had free choice of joining either the experimental intervention &#x02013; climbing therapy (climbing group [CG]; n=20) &#x02013; or the control condition (relaxation group [RG]; n=20) &#x02013; progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) by Jacobson.<xref rid="b17-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The study procedure was the same for both interventions. Participants were asked to fill in the self-report questionnaire on depression and different emotional states, 30 minutes before the intervention started (T1) and immediately after the end of the intervention (T2). All subjects participated in the intervention for the first time during their hospitalization. A written informed consent was obtained from each participant at T1. The study was approved by the ethics commission of the Medical Faculty of the Eberhard Karls University and the University Hospital T&#x000fc;bingen. Data were collected between March 2013 and September 2013.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>In order to assess PA and NA, the Positive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) was administered.<xref rid="b19-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The PANAS consists of a list of words describing different emotions and feelings (eg, upset). Participants were instructed to rate on a 5-point Likert scale if they had experienced these emotional states over the last week. The PANAS contains two subscales, PA and NA. The internal consistency of the PANAS subscales (PA: Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.89; NA: Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.85) has been proven and was sufficient in the current sample at both pre- and post-assessment (PA: Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.90&#x02013;0.95; NA: Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.83&#x02013;0.91).<xref rid="b19-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In order to assess depressiveness and CE, the authors of this article created further items which were rated on the same answering scale (5-point Likert scale: 1=very slightly or not at all, 5=extremely) and had the same instruction (&#x0201c;Indicate the extent you have felt this way over the past week&#x0201d;) as the PANAS items. Depressiveness was assessed with the following three emotion words: worthless, depressed, and hopeless. CE were measured with the following 11 items: confident, optimistic, brave, strong, determined, proud, interested, valuable, safe, secure, and grateful. For both scales &#x02013; depressiveness and CE &#x02013; the internal consistency was analyzed at the pre- and post-assessment in order to check if the items could be summarized in a scale mean score. Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> values appeared to be satisfactory (depressiveness: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.77&#x02013;0.88; CE: <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.90&#x02013;0.95).</p><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The climbing session took place once a week in a private climbing hall and lasted 2.5 hours. It included 8&#x02013;12 participants who were guided by at least two specialized nurses trained in climbing therapy. Every session followed the same agenda: After warming up exercises, the climbing equipment was presented. Games were played at the climbing wall in jump height to familiarize the patients with certain kinds of movement. The patients were taught the safety knots before they started climbing with a nurse as belay partner. At the end, the patients and the therapists shared their thoughts and feelings concerning the intervention. The control condition was based on PMR. The intervention took place in the hospital and was implemented by a psychologist. After explaining the principles of PMR to the participants, the relaxation exercise was conducted, lasting between 25 and 35 minutes. After the relaxation exercise, patients were invited to share their feelings about the relaxation exercise and their experiences.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data analyses were conducted using SPSS 21.0. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test and chi-square test were applied in order to check for between-group differences in demographic and outcome variables at baseline.

In order to break up the interaction effects on depressiveness, CE, NA, and PA, Bonferroni-corrected post hoc univariate mixed 2&#x000d7;2 analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs; according to Bonferroni correction and number of analyses=4, &#x003b1; error level was 0.0125) and pairwise comparisons of cell means were conducted. Significant between-group differences in sociodemographic variables or outcomes were entered as covariates in the univariate ANCOVAs.

Results showed that rock climbing was significantly more related to a positive emotion regulatory effect regarding depressiveness, NA and PA, and CE, in contrast to a relaxation intervention. These findings are in accordance with general mood-improving effects of physical activity as well as the results of a pilot trial which explicitly examined the therapeutic effect of a rock climbing intervention on depressive symptomatology.<xref rid="b8-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b18-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b21-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Different mechanisms through which rock climbing could probably act on emotional states in depressive patients are discussed subsequently. First, high levels of concentration and coordination which are required by this type of sport can counteract the cognitive deficits and biases in depressive patients, for example, by helping them to overcome difficulties in disengaging from negative stimuli.<xref rid="b5-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Second, in this trial, the rock climbing intervention was supervised and took place in a group. Thus, it provided a setting of interpersonal experiences. According to a model of the role of social support in depression by Marroquin, interpersonal influences can function as emotion regulation strategy by effects on attentional deployment (eg, encouraging reorientation to positive features of a situation) and on cognitive changes (eg, supplying information which is inconsistent to cognitive schema).<xref rid="b23-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Third, Beck defines in his cognitive theory of depression the cognitive triad comprising a negative view on the self, the world, and the future.<xref rid="b24-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Since rock climbing can foster experiences of self-efficacy and goal achievement, it could act as emotion regulatory strategy by targeting negative cognitive schemas about the self.<xref rid="b12-prbm-10-277" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first controlled study that examined acute changes of emotions after rock climbing in patients with MDD. Results, however, have to be interpreted cautiously due to several limitations such as a nonrandom assignment of patients to study groups, significant between-group difference in PA at baseline, a small sample size, a missing no-intervention control group, lack of control for participants&#x02019; previous climbing experiences, lack of an objective measure of physical fitness, missing follow-up assessments, the use of scales that were not sufficiently validated, and differences in the duration between the interventions.</p><p>However, in summary, our findings demonstrate that types of sport requiring high levels of concentration and coordination and being associated with an early experience of goal achievement are probably associated with short-term emotion regulatory effects. Our results should be replicated with a randomized study design which overcomes all limitations of the current pilot trial. In the context of a randomized allocation to the study conditions, it should be especially examined if the effects we found can be attributed to the climbing activity and how long the effects endure. Furthermore, more attention should be paid to potential mechanisms of action of rock climbing in regard to emotion regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors
