Taking previous studies[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] into consideration, the expected difference between the arms was taken to be 25% (reduction of pain score from 80% to 55% by honey). Considering &#x003b1; (type I error rate) and desired power (1&#x02212;&#x003b2;, where &#x003b2; &#x0003c; 0.2) to be 0.05 and 80% respectively, the desired sample size comes out to be 35 in each arm. Additionally adding dropout rate of 10% in each arm (four patients in each group), the final sample size came up to total 78 patients. In our set up, approximately 90 patients with HNC requiring upfront RT turn up every year and taking attrition and lost to follow-up into account, so all the patients agreeing to participate in the study were randomized during the first 10 months of the study period which was the period for recruitment. Primary end point was the occurrence of grade &#x02265;3 vomiting, an anaphylactic reaction that is not attributable to entities other than honey beyond doubt.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients having age between 18 and 70 years, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) scale &#x0003e;70, carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx planned to receive radical chemoradiation with directly visible oral or oropharyngeal mucosa in radiation field (Stage III, IVA and IVB), planned to receive RT by conventional fractionation schedule with normal hematological investigations.

Patient's performance and nutritional status were assessed and documented. Detailed oral, oropharyngeal, laryngeal examination to evaluate the extent of the primary disease with also an emphasis on the oral, and dental hygiene was done. Investigations included complete blood picture (complete hemogram/RFT/LFT), biopsy from the primary tumor and/or fine-needle aspiration cytology of metastatic lymph nodes, dental evaluation, dental prophylaxis, chest X-ray (posteroanterior view), X-ray mandible (panorex/lateral oblique view), and computed tomography scan neck (base of skull to clavicle).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Description of intervention</title><p>Test group patients were treated with Cobalt-60 teletherapy unit of 80 cm source to surface distance (Theratron Elite 80, MDS Nordion Ontario, Canada). Initial tumor volume consisted of the primary tumor, involved lymph nodes, and probable sub-clinical disease. The irradiation field was reduced after 46 Gy to spare the spinal cord. Posterior neck electron boost to a dose of 24 Gy in 12 fractions were given in selected cases. The patients were immobilized with thermoplastic masks, in the supine position with shoulder retraction. All patients were treated with two parallel opposed lateral fields. Simulation X-ray film with lead wire markings was taken for verification of radiation portals and necessary corrections according to the standard portals were made before the start of treatment. RT was given as conventional RT. Treatment commenced on Monday, continued up to Friday and Saturday, Sunday being the rest days. Patients received a total of 6600&#x02013;7000 cGy/33&#x02013;35 fractions, 200 cGy/fraction over 6.5&#x02013;7 weeks (47&#x02013;49 days). Primary and involved nodes received a dose of 6600&#x02013;7000 cGy. Posterior neck electron boost was given in selected cases with N3 node or nodes in level V, which were not covered in off cord field. The drug cisplatin was used as a single agent concurrently with EBRT in the dose of 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/week for 5&#x02013;6 cycles. All patients were evaluated by fasting and postprandial blood sugar level. All patients in the test group received 20 ml of honey 15 min before, 15 min after, and 6 h after RT. Patients were advised to rinse honey on the oral mucosa and then to swallow slowly to smear it on the oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Written protocol in their language was given to all patients. Fasting and postprandial blood sugar levels were monitored for all test group patients every week during RT. Along with the honey, the patients were advised to do salt-soda and benzydamine mouth gargles alternatively, every 3 h as the standard oral protocol. They were advised to do this protocol throughout the radiation treatment and 3 months post-RT along with advice on adequate fluid intake, with a high protein diet, oral and dental cares.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Control group</title><p>All patients were treated with same radiation and chemotherapy protocols as test group patients.

All patients were closely monitored during their entire treatment course every day. Every attempt was made to maintain adequate hydration, protein and caloric intake, and oral hygiene for all the patients during the entire treatment course. Pain scores were documented on a weekly basis using visual analog scale [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] by two independent observers. Timely interventions in the form of oral or intravenous antibiotics after oral swab/sputum culture sensitivity testing; short course steroids for extensive grade 3 mucositis, gentian violet local application for moist desquamations of skin were administered.

Sixty-nine patients were analyzed as nine patients (four in test and five in control) discontinued treatment or lost to follow-up. The majority of patients were aged 51&#x02013;70 years. Both groups were matched for age, gender, literacy, KPS, and grade of the tumor [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Smoking was the most prevalent and chewing pain was the least prevalent habit in both groups. All Patients had the locally advanced disease. Approximately, 72% of patients in both groups had T3, T4, and Stage IVA disease [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>].

Concurrent chemoradiation improves survival[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and organ preservation at the cost of significant toxicities such as grade 3&#x02013;4 mucositis and mucositis induced pain. Mucositis associated pain is the most debilitating symptom that reduces their oral intake and tolerability to complete the RT schedule and reducing the local control and survival.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This study was intended to evaluate the role of honey as a therapeutic measure for radiation-induced pain in HNC patients receiving definitive concurrent chemoradiation by conventional fractionation with weekly cisplatin.</p><p>In this study, all patients in both the groups were matched for variables such as age, gender, education status, KPS habits (smoking, chewing paan, tobacco, etc.). Most common site affected in both the groups was oropharynx (36% in test group and 40% in control group) which may be attributed to the fact that though oral cavity cancers are the most common HNC in India, but majority of them undergo surgery, which was an exclusion criteria for our study. Majority (72%) had Stage IVA disease amongst the included stages in the study.</p><p>Both groups received a mean dose of 69.7 Gy. Majority had received 6 cycles of cisplatin (90% in the test and 93% in controls). Mean over-the-top was 49.61 days in the test group and 53.18 days in the control group. This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and may be attributed to less treatment breaks in test group due to less pain.</p><p>Honey has potent antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Sonis <italic>et al</italic>. has described that analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity of honey are due to inhibition of the signal amplification by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The analgesic property of honey is well confirmed in our study as shown in the tables. Unequal use of steroids and antibiotic use was two likely biases, but both of them were eliminated as steroids were used in only extensive grade 3 mucositis as predefined criteria and antibiotics were given in patients irrespective of the arms whenever infection was documented and confirmed by oral swab culture. Honey showed minor insignificant side effects such as dyspepsia, nausea, and vomiting which were manageable.</p><p>Despite promising and convincing results, our study had some limitations. In our study, we have advised the patients to take honey according to our protocol but they were free to choose any honey from the market as it wasn't provided from us, but they were strictly prohibited to use raw honey or nonpackaged honey to ensure its safety. Patients were also instructed to maintain strict hygiene while using honey to avoid contamination. The microbiological culture was done to assure the safety, whenever a new honey bottle or source was used by the patients but the chemical analysis of the honey was not done which was beyond the scope of the study. Our study had limited study period, smaller sample size and short duration follow-up, and hence multicentric randomised controlled studies with larger number of subjects are needed to further strengthen the analgesic effect of honey for mucositis associated pain in HNC patients receiving concurrent chemoradiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Honey is effective in reducing pain associated with radiation-induced mucositis.
