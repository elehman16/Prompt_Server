Caffeine is a common additive to SSB, and through dependence effects, it has the potential to promote the consumption of caffeine-containing foods. The objective of the present study was to assess the influence that caffeine has on the consumption of SSB. Participants (<italic>n</italic> 99) were blindly assigned to either a caffeinated SSB (C-SSB) or a non-caffeinated SSB (NC-SSB) group. Following randomisation, all participants completed a 9&#x000a0;d flavour-conditioning paradigm. They then completed a 28&#x000a0;d <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake intervention where they consumed as much or as little of C-SSB or NC-SSB as desired. The amount consumed (ml) was recorded daily, 4&#x000a0;d diet diaries were collected and liking of SSB was assessed at the start and end of the intervention. Participants (<italic>n</italic> 50) consuming the C-SSB had a daily SSB intake of 419 (<sc>sd</sc> 298)&#x000a0;ml (785 (<sc>sd</sc> 559)&#x000a0;kJ/d) over the 28&#x000a0;d intervention, significantly more than participants (<italic>n</italic> 49) consuming the NC-SSB (273 (<sc>sd</sc> 278)&#x000a0;ml/d, 512 (<sc>sd</sc> 521)&#x000a0;kJ/d) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;001). A trained flavour panel (<italic>n</italic> 30) found no difference in flavour between the C-SSB and NC-SSB (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0&#x000b7;05). However, participants who consumed the C-SSB liked the SSB more than those who consumed the NC-SSB (6&#x000b7;3 <italic>v.</italic> 6&#x000b7;0 on a nine-point hedonic scale, <italic>P</italic>=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;022). The addition of low concentrations of caffeine to the SSB significantly increases the consumption of the SSB. Regulating caffeine as a food additive may be an effective strategy to decrease the consumption of nutrient-poor high-energy foods and beverages.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sugar-sweetened beverages</kwd><kwd>Caffeine</kwd><kwd>Free-living populations</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p>

Despite the limited evidence for a role in flavour, the amount of caffeine delivered in 500&#x000a0;ml common cola soft drinks (approximately 53&#x02013;65&#x000a0;mg, 0&#x000b7;55&#x02013;0&#x000b7;67&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc>) is high enough to modify consumption behaviour, potentially increasing the consumption of the beverage as a form of caffeine redosing<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">

<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. When caffeine is redosed, the reversal of caffeine-withdrawal symptoms increases the preference for the food/beverage. To date, no studies have shown that caffeination of a beverage increases its consumption in a free-living population, although laboratory-based studies have shown that caffeine-deprived participants increase the liking and consumption of caffeinated beverages<sup>(</sup>

Redosing with caffeine becomes a problem when the form of redosing is high in energy, promoting increased energy intake.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to assess in a free-living population whether caffeine, at levels found in common cola SSB, increased SSB consumption compared with a flavour-equivalent non-caffeinated SSB.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study was a double-blind 6-week dietary intervention study.

Participants were randomly assigned to either a C-SSB (0&#x000b7;57&#x000a0;m<sc>m</sc>-caffeine) or a non-caffeinated SSB (NC-SSB) group.

SSB were delivered weekly to all the participants and empty bottles returned, and participants recorded SSB consumption daily during the study. Consumption of the SSB (in ml) was the primary outcome measure. At the end of the study, the true nature of the study was disclosed to the study participants who were informed that two beverages were used in the study, one non-caffeinated and one containing levels of caffeine comparable to commercially available cola beverages.

A research dietitian explained how to accurately complete the SSB and 4&#x000a0;d diet dairies to all the participants. Participants would open a new bottle (600&#x000a0;ml) of SSB each day and record the volume of SSB consumed during the day by assessing the number of bottles and the volume remaining in the SSB container at the end of each day. For the 4&#x000a0;d food diaries, participants were asked to, where possible, weigh the foods they consumed, or use measuring cups, spoons or common serving sizes (e.g. one slice of bread), and to be specific, such as reporting the brand of food consumed, type of food (e.g. white or wholemeal bread), whether fat was added (e.g. oil or butter) and the cooking methods (e.g. baking, frying, steaming). If the food consumed was from a recipe, the subject was asked to include the recipe with the record and to state how much of it they consumed (e.g. whole, half). Participants were also supplied with the Otago University Booklet of Diet Assessment Photos to aid them in supplying measurable information on portion sizes. Diet diaries were completed over three weekdays and one weekend day. Participants were asked not to consume any other SSB during the intervention period and were instructed that the study SSB were only for their individual consumption. SSB were delivered weekly to the participants' home or collected from Deakin University, whichever was more convenient. Weekly SSB consumption records were collected at the time of SSB delivery, and were checked by a dietitian for accuracy; any questions raised by the participants could be answered at the time. Foods and the amount of food consumed were entered into Food Works 2009 (Xyris Software) and analysed using the AUSNUT 2007 database for foods, brands and supplements.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Liking of sugar-sweetened beverages</title><p>Liking of the SSB was assessed at the start and end of the study.

Allowing caffeine to be added with little regulation to a growing number of products<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup> appears a recipe for overconsumption.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Public health and policy implications</title><p>There are many factors that combine to promote the overconsumption of SSB including aggressive marketing, low satiation effect and decreased ability to compensate for liquid energy. In addition to these factors, the inclusion of caffeine as an additive in the formulation of these beverages may be considered a strategy to enhance the consumption of these products. As SSB are highly consumed, therefore, relatively small changes in composition have the potential to have significant benefits, reducing the development of overweight and obesity. We have previously calculated that removing caffeine from SSB, along with 10&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;% of sugar, has the potential to reduce body weight of adults by 600&#x000a0;g, without any change in SSB consumption<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. The present study adds to the &#x02018;caffeine&#x02013;energy effect&#x02019; as we report that caffeine also increases the consumption of SSB. Taken together, caffeine as an additive in SSB has a significant influence on energy intake.</p><p>The results of the present study must be discussed in the broader context with a view to some limitations and future directions. The present study was not designed to determine any changes in weight or BMI as a 28&#x000a0;d intervention plus 9&#x000a0;d flavour conditioning was not a sufficient period of time for a significant weight change. Additionally, the study was not sufficiently powered to observe significant differences in energy intake between the groups. Future studies may wish to extend the intervention period to assess weight gain over a period longer than 28&#x000a0;d.</p><p>In summary, caffeine increases the consumption of SSB in comparison to a flavour-equivalent NC-SSB. As SSB are associated with the development of overweight and obesity, regulators and health professionals should increase the pressure on food companies to remove caffeine from formulations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Saxbys Soft Drinks for providing the SSB for the study, and Diabetes Australia Research Trust for funding the study.
