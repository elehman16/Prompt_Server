The study was terminated early due to slow patient accrual. At day 60, there was one death in the vancomycin arm and none in the daptomycin arm. The median time to microbiological clearance was 4 days in both arms (IQR 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days in the vancomycin arm and 3&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days in daptomycin arm). Only one patient in the vancomycin arm had recurrence of bacteremia. Rates of adverse events were similar in both arms. There was one case of musculoskeletal toxicity and one case of drug-related nephrotoxicity - both events occurred in the daptomycin arm.

Infections caused by methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureas</italic> (MRSA) are associated with increased mortality and morbidity and increased length and cost of hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, because MRSA is multidrug resistant, it leaves clinicians with few effective antimicrobial options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Treating <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> infections has become increasing challenging in recent, with the emergence of highly virulent MRSA strains.</p><p id="Par17">Vancomycin, a tricyclic glycopeptide, is the standard first line treatment for patients with MRSA bloodstream infections (BSI). Consensus guidelines, however, recommend clinicians to consider alternative agents for MRSA infections when the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is &#x0003e;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, especially when clinical failure is suspected with vancomycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One such alternative agent is daptomycin - a calcium-dependent cyclic lipopeptide that is rapidly bactericidal against many gram-positive organisms including MRSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A number of recent studies have also suggested that vancomycin use, especially in infections caused by MRSA with high vancomycin MICs, may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes when compared with an alternative anti-MRSA agent such as daptomycin; however, these were retrospective and non- randomized studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">To date, there has been no head-to-head randomized trial comparing the safety and efficacy of daptomycin and vancomycin in the treatment of BSIs due to MRSA with high vancomycin MICs. Clinicians are often faced with the dilemma of using the cheaper standard treatment, i.e. vancomycin, or switching to a newer and more expensive alternative such as daptomycin in treating such serious infections. This study was designed as a phase 2B randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of daptomycin versus vancomycin in reducing all-cause mortality in the treatment of MRSA BSIs due to isolates with high vancomycin MICs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par19">This study was an open-label randomized controlled phase 2B trial conducted in a tertiary hospital in Singapore.

Patients were excluded if they were allergic to vancomycin or daptomycin, pregnant or breastfeeding, unable to comply with study treatments and procedures, unable to provide consent or had no legally authorized representatives, currently enrolled in or had participated in an interventional antibiotic or vaccine trial within the past 3 months, expected to have less than 24&#x000a0;h of life expectancy, polymicrobial bacteremia, pneumonia, receiving treatment with linezolid, tigecyline or ceftaroline for more than 96&#x000a0;h prior to enrolment, receiving vancomycin or daptomycin treatment for more than 5 days prior to enrolment, or if they had baseline serum creatine kinase (CK) more than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, presence of prosthetic heart valves, or any other significant condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, compromise the patient&#x02019;s safety or outcome of the trial. The study exclusion criteria were amended from the published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] on 7 August 2014 after consultation with the trial steering committee in an effort to improve recruitment, without compromising the rigor of the study design. When the trial was first commenced, patients were also excluded if they were on vancomycin or daptomycin for more than 96&#x000a0;h prior to enrolment, were on linezolid, tigecycline or ceftaroline immediately prior to enrolment, had previous blood cultures positive for MRSA in the preceding month, or if there was more than 48&#x000a0;h between enrolment and reporting by the microbiology laboratory of MRSA BSI with vancomycin MIC &#x02265;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Antimicrobial therapy</title><p id="Par21">Participants were randomized to receive either intravenous daptomycin or vancomycin.

Patients who were on vancomycin prior to study inclusion had their doses adjusted accordingly to achieve a vancomycin trough of 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml. This dosing regimen was based on a consensus statement of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, the IDSA, and The Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists on guidelines for vancomycin dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Patients randomized to the daptomycin arm with uncomplicated bacteremia received 6&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight of daptomycin infused over 30&#x000a0;min every 24&#x000a0;h.

Some experts however do recommend a higher dose of 8&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight in complicated infection or treatment failure due to the concentration-dependent effect of daptomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Hence, daptomycin was dosed at 8&#x000a0;mg/kg body weight every 24&#x000a0;h in patients with complicated bacteremia or endocarditis. In patients with creatinine clearance &#x0003c;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;ml/min or in patients on hemodialysis, daptomycin was administered every 48&#x000a0;h as per manufacturer&#x02019;s guidelines.

Uncomplicated bacteremia was defined as the isolation of MRSA from enrolment blood cultures in patients without endocarditis and without evidence of spread to other organs. Complicated bacteremia without endocarditis was defined as the isolation of MRSA from blood cultures beyond 4 days from initial positive culture, the presence of spread of infection, or infection of prostheses not removed within 4 days. The definition of &#x0201c;definite&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;possibl&#x0201d; endocarditis (complicated bacteremia) was determined using the modified Duke criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study outcomes</title><p id="Par24">The primary objective of this pilot study was to compare the efficacy of daptomycin versus vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA BSIs due to isolates with high vancomycin MICs (i.e. &#x02265;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) in terms of all-cause mortality 60&#x000a0;days from the time of index blood culture.

A vancomycin trough level was also measured pre the third or fourth dose of vancomycin and then weekly in patients in the vancomycin arm. An echocardiogram was performed within the first 10 days of randomization to look for evidence of infective endocarditis. All participants had a follow-up assessment 60&#x000a0;days after the index culture, to determine mortality status.

A total of 21 participants per arm were needed so as to guarantee a 90% probability of correctly selecting the daptomycin arm as superior to the vancomycin arm if it was truly superior by a margin of 15%. This was calculated assuming a survival rate of 75% at 60 days post index blood culture in the vancomycin arm compared to a survival rate of 90% in the daptomycin arm, based on previously published retrospective case&#x02013;control and cohort studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Demographic characteristics and other baseline characteristics (such as clinical measures taken at baseline) were summarized using descriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) or frequencies (expressed as a fraction of the number of subjects), as appropriate) by treatment group in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis population. The frequencies of deaths by 60&#x000a0;days post index culture, microbiologic failure, recurrence of MRSA BSI, nephrotoxicity, musculoskeletal toxicity, the need to discontinue study drug due to toxicity and/or worsening infection, the need to add a second anti-MRSA agent due to worsening infection, and the time to microbiological clearance were summarized by treatment group and overall in the ITT analysis population. The ITT analysis population was defined as all randomized patients. The treatment group of patients in the ITT analysis population was the planned treatment group, i.e. according to the randomization list planned prior to the study commencement.

This phenomenon has been termed &#x0201c;MIC creep&#x0201d;. Patients with MRSA BSI with a vancomycin MIC &#x02265;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml tend to have higher treatment failure rates (ranging from 50 to 90%) compared to those with lower MIC values [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A number of studies have also suggested that vancomycin use, especially in infections caused by MRSA with high vancomycin MICs, may be associated with poorer clinical outcomes when compared with an alternative anti-MRSA agent such as daptomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Fowler and colleagues conducted a prospective open-label randomized controlled trial to compare the success of treatment with daptomycin versus standard treatment with vancomycin plus gentamicin in patients with <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> bacteremia and endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In subset analysis daptomycin had a greater success rate (although not statistically different) among patients with MRSA BSI when compared to standard treatment (44% with daptomycin vs. 31.8% with standard treatment; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.28). However, almost all of the MRSA isolates in this study had an MIC &#x02264;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, hence it is difficult to conclude from these results whether daptomycin is truly superior to vancomycin in the treatment of MRSA infections with high vancomycin MICs. Four retrospective studies comparing daptomycin and vancomycin for BSIs due to MRSA with a high vancomycin MIC demonstrated that daptomycin was associated with a more favorable outcome in terms of both clinical success and mortality, compared to vancomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, these were retrospective studies so the results need to be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="Par40">In our randomized study, there was only one death and one case of recurrence of MRSA BSI in the vancomycin arm and none in the daptomycin arm. There were no cases of microbiological failure in either treatment arm. Overall outcomes in both arms were better than previously reported in MRSA BSI with a high vancomycin MIC. Earlier studies, which have used varying definitions, have reported a success rate of 61to 73% in patients with MRSA BSI with high vancomycin MICs treated with either vancomycin or daptomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. There are a number of possible factors that may have led to this improved observed outcome. In our study, vancomycin trough levels were measured at strict intervals to ensure levels were maintained within the therapeutic window of 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg/ml. In patients whose trough levels were below target, dose adjustments were made in consultation with an infectious disease pharmacist. As such, vancomcyin under-dosing, which has been associated with poorer outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], was avoided. Patients with concomitant pneumonia, prosthetic valve endocarditis and those with less than 24&#x000a0;h of life expectancy were excluded from our study. These are all conditions that have been associated with poorer overall outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, all patients were managed by an infectious disease physician - at least two studies have shown that this is associated with improved outcomes in patients with MRSA BSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, due to the small sample size we acknowledge that the improved overall outcome observed may have merely been due to chance.</p><p id="Par41">One patient in the daptomycin arm developed elevated CK compared to none in the vancomycin arm (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This is consistent with previous studies where CK elevations were more common in the daptomycin group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our study, three patients in the vancomycin treatment arm had dermatologic manifestations. This is not unexpected, as cutaneous adverse effects have been reported to be the commonest adverse events related to vancomycin use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nephrotoxicity is often a concern with vancomycin, especially in patients with underlying renal insufficiency. However, none of the patients in the vancomycin arm developed significant increases in serum creatinine despite the majority having chronic kidney disease. In our study, vancomycin trough levels were monitored regularly and maintained within a tight therapeutic window of 15&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;g/ml. In addition, none of the patients received concomitant treatment with an aminoglycoside, which has been shown to increase rates of nephrotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In contrast, one patient in the daptomycin arm experienced nephrotoxicity, which was deemed by the study investigators to be &#x0201c;possibly related&#x0201d; to daptomycin. To our knowledge, daptomycin induced nephrotoxicity has not been previously reported. This patient was concomitantly receiving high-dose diuretics, which may have led to dehydration and pre-renal impairment. In addition, the patient&#x02019;s serum creatinine returned to baseline without cessation of study drug. Hence, it remains unclear if the patient&#x02019;s renal impairment was truly caused by daptomycin.</p><p id="Par42">This study was initially designed as a multicenter study involving three sites. Although 224 patients were prescreened in the three institutions, all 14 patients were eventually recruited from a single institution. None of the 54 patients with MRSA BSI prescreened from the other two institutions were eligible for the study - 52 patients had MRSA BSI with vancomycin MIC &#x0003c;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, one patient had polymicrobial bacteremia and one patient died before he could be recruited. Of the 170 patients prescreened from the eventual recruiting institution, close to 50% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;82) had MRSA BSI with vancomycin MIC &#x02265;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml but eventually only 14 patients were randomized. The most common reasons for exclusion were concomitant pneumonia in 18% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15), exceeding the time allowed on vancomycin prior to enrolment in 13% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) and polymicrobial bacteremia in 10% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8). There were 18 patients who were eligible for the study but declined to participate.</p><p id="Par43">The overall recruitment rate of the study was lower than expected with fewer patients than initially projected being eligible for the study. An attempt was made mid-way through the study to improve recruitment by modifying the exclusion criteria (as described earlier) but this did not have a significant impact on improving recruitment rates and the investigators felt that allowing further modifications to the exclusion criteria would adversely affect the safety and integrity of the study. Nine patients were recruited after modification of the exclusion criteria and of these, four patients would have been previously excluded. Of note, 11 patients were excluded because they exceeded the duration allowed on vancomycin prior to enrolment (this was initially capped at 96&#x000a0;h and subsequently increased to 5 days mid-way through the study to try and improve enrolment). As part of our institutional practice, a large proportion of patients are prescribed empirical vancomycin therapy on admission if they have signs of infection and have had recent healthcare contact. Many of these patients would have received more than 4&#x02013;5 days of vancomycin therapy by the time the vancomycin MIC result was known, making them ineligible for the study. The investigators felt that extending the period allowed on vancomycin therapy beyond 5 days would make it impossible for daptomycin efficacy to be assessed with sufficient rigor. Attempts were also made to increase the number of enrolment sites but these proved unsuccessful, mainly due to the small baseline numbers of patients with MRSA bacteremia at these smaller sites. After consultation with the trial steering committee, a decision was made to terminate the study early as it was felt that it would not be realistically possible to achieve the target sample size within the allocated funding period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">In summary, based on current available evidence, it remains unclear if alternative, newer and more expensive agents such as daptomycin are truly superior to vancomycin in the treatment of BSI due to MRSA with high vancomycin MIC. The question of what should be the optimal recommended treatment for such infections remains important to answer, and more studies are urgently needed. However, randomized controlled trials evaluating this are complicated and difficult to execute - primarily due to the heterogeneous and complex patient profile associated with MRSA BSI. Enrolment rates are likely to be low and multicenter trials providing a large patient pool will be needed to achieve sufficient patient recruitment for an adequately powered study. An alternative to such conventional randomized controlled trials may be pragmatic adaptive platform trials - such novel methodologies are already being employed successfully in oncology trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Platform studies make use of a universal trial master protocol to study the optimal treatment for a disease and its subgroups, while the pragmatic design embeds the trial in routine provision of care and allows for minimal exclusion criteria, in turn improving recruitment rates. In addition, the use of response-adaptive randomization results in greater probability of patients in a particular sub-group being randomized to interventions that are performing better within that sub-group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Thus, better therapies move through the evaluation process faster, resulting in greater trial efficiency. Investigators interested in evaluating the optimal treatment for MRSA bacteremia may wish to consider employing such novel trial methodologies, so as to ensure a greater chance of success.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AEs</term><def><p id="Par6">Adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BSI</term><def><p id="Par7">Bloodstream infection</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIRB</term><def><p id="Par8">Centralized Institute Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CK</term><def><p id="Par9">Creatine kinase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FBC</term><def><p id="Par10">Full blood count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par11">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par12">Intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MIC</term><def><p id="Par13">Minimum inhibitory concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRSA</term><def><p id="Par14">Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCRI</term><def><p id="Par15">Singapore Clinical Research Institute</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the Singapore Clinical Research Network (SCRN) for their support throughout the study, in particular Ms Ding Ying and Ms Siew Hwa Soh.
