Impaired mental health of employees in healthcare occupations can have serious adverse effects, endangering the health and safety of not only themselves but also their patients. A study by G&#x000e4;rtner and colleagues found that impaired mental health in nurses and allied health professionals affects several aspects of their work functioning, including cognitive aspects (e.g. staying alert) and causing incidents at work <xref rid="pone.0072546-Grtner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Another study by Letvak and colleagues showed that depression in nurses was associated with presenteeism, which is in turn associated with patient falls, medication errors, and lower self-reported quality of care <xref rid="pone.0072546-Letvak2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Adding to this, increased levels of psychological distress, even in a mild form, have been found to be associated with an increased likelihood of obtaining a disability pension in later life <xref rid="pone.0072546-Rai1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. To sustain nurses' and allied health professionals' mental health and to enable them to remain healthy and well-functioning in their profession until retirement age, it is crucial to periodically screen these employees and provide interventions to improve their mental health and work functioning.</p><p>A potentially promising method for the early detection of impaired mental health and subsequent treatment in nurses and allied health professionals, is offering a mental module for workers' health surveillance (WHS). Although attention has been paid to the occupational hazards of healthcare employees <xref rid="pone.0072546-Hood1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, WHS targeting work functioning and mental health of nurses and allied health professionals has, to our knowledge, not been reported before.</p><p>WHS is an important component of occupational healthcare <xref rid="pone.0072546-Koh1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. It is a means to implement preventive action by identifying and treating health complaints relevant to work, and it should be an essential component of programmes aimed at the protection of employees <xref rid="pone.0072546-International1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In the Netherlands, it has three aims: 1) to prevent the onset, recurrence, or worsening of work-related diseases, 2) to monitor and promote work-related health, and 3) to monitor and improve work functioning and employability <xref rid="pone.0072546-NVAB1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It can be used to periodically monitor employees' health and work functioning to detect impairments early and to bring timely interventions into action to prevent further impairment. It is recommended to apply a job-specific assessment, to allow for tailoring of interventions to the specific detected work functioning impairments as fitting as possible <xref rid="pone.0072546-Sluiter1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this study, we detect early signs of impaired mental health and impaired work functioning in nurses and allied health professionals, and offer interventions using an e-mental health approach.</p><p>E-mental health (EMH) is the use of information and communication technology, and in particular the many technologies related to the Internet, to support and improve mental health <xref rid="pone.0072546-Riper1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Applying EMH might be a useful and feasible approach to perform a mental module for WHS. Online screening is a practical and efficient method to screen for self-reported impaired work functioning and impaired mental health. Furthermore, EMH offers possibilities regarding the subsequent interventions. Ritterband and colleagues defined Internet interventions as typically focused on behavioral issues, aiming to institute behavior change and subsequent symptom improvement, usually self-paced, interactive, and tailored to the user, and making use of the multimedia format offered by the Internet <xref rid="pone.0072546-Ritterband1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. EMH interventions exist which target a wide variety of common mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, panic, phobias, and various addictions. Unguided self-help EMH interventions have been found to have positive outcomes for a variety of mental health aspects (e.g. Warmerdam et al. <xref rid="pone.0072546-Warmerdam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>; Farrer et al. <xref rid="pone.0072546-Farrer1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>; Riper et al. <xref rid="pone.0072546-Riper2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>; Blankers et al. <xref rid="pone.0072546-Blankers1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>; Billings et al. <xref rid="pone.0072546-Billings1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>), although to our knowledge their effects on work functioning have not been studied in a specific working population such as nurses and allied health professionals. Moreover, EMH interventions have thus far only been offered as stand-alone interventions for a specific mental health complaint. In our study, we offer a choice of EMH interventions, tailored to the specific complaints as indicated by the individual's screening results.</p><p>In this paper, we study the effect of an EMH-approach to WHS targeting work functioning and mental health of hospital-employed nurses and allied health professionals, on their work functioning, distress, work-related fatigue, posttraumatic stress, and work ability in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. We hypothesized that WHS, consisting of online screening on impaired work functioning and impaired mental health followed by personalised feedback and a tailored offer of self-help EMH interventions, will improve work functioning and mental health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072546.s002">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072546.s003">Protocol S1</xref> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/290">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/290</ext-link>).</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam approved this study (for approved protocol see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0072546.s004">Protocol S2</xref>).

The complete trial included two intervention groups and one control group <xref rid="pone.0072546-Grtner2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The present study compared one of the intervention groups, the e-mental health approach (EMH-approach) group, to the control group.

After six months, more participants in the EMH-approach group than in the control group had improved relevantly compared to baseline, in both the positively screened sample (EMH 36%; control 28%) and the total sample (EMH 40%; control 30%).

On distress and work-related fatigue, the EMH-approach group had a larger overall improvement than the control group (non-significant). In the LMM analyses on distress, work-related fatigue, posttraumatic stress, and work ability in the positively screened sample, no statistically significant differences were found between the EMH-approach group and the control group (main effect of group .36&#x02264;p&#x02264;.62; interaction effect of group*time .12&#x02264;p&#x02264;.83). Effect sizes in both groups were fairly similar, small to non-relevant.</p><p>In the LMM analyses on the secondary outcomes in the total sample of participants (data not shown in table), no significant differences were found between the EMH-approach group and the control group either (.31&#x02264;p&#x02264;.97).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of our study suggest that an e-mental health (EMH) approach of workers' health surveillance (WHS), consisting of online screening on impaired work functioning and impaired mental health followed by personalised feedback and a tailored offer of self-help EMH interventions, shows no significant improvement in impaired work functioning, distress, work-related fatigue, posttraumatic stress, and work ability to a larger extent than a control group. Compliance to the EMH interventions was low, which impedes drawing a conclusion about the effect of this part of the intervention. Screening and personalised feedback was received by all participants in the intervention group. Although the study had insufficient power, the low effect sizes do not give reason to expect a relevant effect of screening and feedback. The outcomes may be of value for future meta-analytic work.</p><p>One third of the employees who were invited, participated in the study. Of these participants, more than 80% screened positive for at least mild impairments in work functioning and/or mental health. Both the intervention group and the control group improved over time on work functioning, distress, work-related fatigue, and posttraumatic stress, with no statistically significant difference between the groups. However, when including all participants in the analyses and not only those who had screened positive on impairments at baseline, the work functioning of the EMH-approach group showed a significantly different pattern compared to the control group, as the EMH-approach group further improved between three and six months after baseline while the control group did not. After six months, a relevant improvement of work functioning was found for 36% of positively screened participants in the intervention group and 28% in the control group, but the difference between the groups was non-significant.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Interpretation of results</title><p>First of all, our study had a high percentage of participants who screened positive for at least mild impairments. This included screening positive on impairments in work functioning, on one or more mental health complaints or both. In choosing our cut-off points, we aimed for high sensitivity, since we did not want to miss participants who might need help. The cut-off points that we applied for the mental health complaints were all validated. However, high sensitivity generally comes at the expense of high specificity, which might have led to higher numbers of false positives in our study. We formulated the online feedback mildly, careful not to speak of <italic>diagnosis</italic> or <italic>mental health problems</italic>, to prevent incorrect interpretation. Additionally, the relatively high number of screening instruments might have led to a high overall percentage of participants who screened positive for at least one of the screeners.</p><p>Our intervention consisted of two parts. First, the participants in the intervention group underwent online screening on impaired work functioning and impaired mental health, followed by personalised feedback on their screening results. Subsequently, they were offered a tailored offer of EMH interventions. In addition, participants with impaired work functioning received an onscreen educational leaflet on how to improve their work functioning. Two scenarios might explain our not finding an effect of the intervention: <italic>programme failure</italic> and <italic>theory failure</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0072546-Kristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>: the intervention was not carried out as intended (programme failure), or the intervention is not effective (theory failure).</p><p>The process evaluation that was carried out alongside this randomised controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0072546-Ketelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref> offers some information on potential programme failure. The personalised feedback was received by all participants in the intervention group, since it appeared onscreen immediately after filling out the baseline questionnaire and was sent to the participants' e-mail address automatically. The onscreen educational leaflet on how to improve work functioning was also sent automatically to participants with impaired work functioning. However, the compliance to the subsequently offered self-help EMH interventions was low. Only 28 participants logged into an EMH intervention, and 6% (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) of the positively screened participants in the intervention group started an EMH intervention to at least some extent. Regarding the second part of the intervention (the EMH interventions), program failure may therefore have occurred.</p><p>Participants offered no explanation why they did not follow an EMH intervention <xref rid="pone.0072546-Ketelaar1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Three explanations are conceivable. Firstly, there is a reported trend in the literature of a low perception of need for mental health interventions. Lexis and colleagues found that 43% of employees who were identified with mild to severe depressive complaints, did not report to experience health complaints themselves <xref rid="pone.0072546-Lexis1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Codony and colleagues found that merely a third of those who had a mental disorder in the past 12 months, had a perceived need of mental healthcare <xref rid="pone.0072546-Codony1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Since our study regarded a preventive setting and we chose for high sensitivity in our screening, perhaps the perceived need of our participants was insufficient to motivate them to log into and follow an EMH intervention. Secondly, some of the participants (N&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9) reported problems with logging into the interventions, due to technical problems and/or inadequate computer skills, which might have posed a problem for more participants. A third explanation is that the channelling from the personalised feedback towards the EMH interventions might not have been attractive enough to encourage participants to follow an EMH intervention.</p><p>The possibility of theory failure should also be considered. The intervention consisted of screening and personalised feedback on screening results including channelling towards EMH interventions, an onscreen educational leaflet on how to improve work functioning (if applicable), and following the EMH interventions. Most of the EMH interventions that were used in our study have been found effective to reduce symptoms of impaired mental health in previous research <xref rid="pone.0072546-Warmerdam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072546-Riper2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072546-Bolier2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0072546-Spek2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, supporting our hypothesis that an EMH-approach to WHS, including EMH interventions (if complied to), might be effective in improving mental health and improving work functioning. However, it should be noted that for these previous studies, most participants had actively responded to advertisements targeting people who wanted to work on their depressive symptoms or their mental fitness. Therefore, these participants actively sought help and improvement through EMH interventions. This differs considerably from our setting, as our participants took part in WHS targeting work functioning and mental health and might not have been as much aware that they would be offered EMH interventions.</p><p>However, since the intervention was not carried out as intended, we cannot conclude that the complete EMH-approach to WHS targeting work functioning and mental health of healthcare employees is ineffective. Moreover, we found that when looking at the total sample of participants, both groups improved over time, but the EMH-approach group continued to improve between three and six months after baseline while the control group slightly deteriorated in this time interval. Possibly, we were able to find a significant effect in this total sample, because the number of participants was higher in this group and the analysis was therefore better powered to find existing differences. Since the EMH interventions themselves were hardly followed, this suggests that the other elements of the complete EMH-approach &#x02013; possibly increasing awareness - might have had some (delayed) effect on work functioning. However, the results in this total sample of participants are not easily interpreted, since only the personalised feedback was received by all participants in the intervention group, and the observed effect did not occur until later in time.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Limitations</title><p>Several limitations of our study can be noted. First of all, we did not meet our required sample size for sufficient power, set at 189 participants in each group who completed participation. This increases the chance of finding non-significant p-values despite trends for differences. The data show that, regarding impaired work functioning, a higher percentage of participants in the EMH-approach group than in the control group improved to a relevant degree compared to their own baseline scores, but this difference was not statistically significant, which might have been a result of insufficient power. However, the observed effect sizes were very small, and in most cases were fairly similar between the groups.</p><p>A second limitation of our study was the fairly high and selective drop-out rate of participants, especially in the intervention group. Drop-outs had higher scores on impaired work functioning at baseline and three months follow-up than participants who did not drop out of the trial. We do not know why this occurred, since we did not assess reasons for drop-out. We received mixed reactions to the personalised but automatic feedback on screening results and the for some participants unexpected offer to follow an EMH intervention. We suppose this might have led to resistance and the higher drop-out in the intervention group. The high and selective drop-out may have introduced bias, although we have no way of knowing in which direction this possible bias occurred.</p><p>Thirdly, as discussed before, the compliance to the offered EMH interventions was low, complicating studying the effect of the complete EMH-approach to WHS.</p><p>Lastly, we studied the effects of the EMH-approach in a group of positively screened participants, regardless of what they screened positive for. Since not everyone screened positive for every impairment of complaints and the offered intervention was tailored to each individual, it might not be reasonable to expect an improvement for every impairment or complaint if examining the total group.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for practice and further research</title><p>Our study confirms that preventive actions are essential for nurses and allied health professionals, since we identified that more than 80% of participants show at least some level of impaired work functioning and/or symptoms of mental health problems.</p><p>We endeavoured to improve work functioning and mental health through online screening, personalised feedback, and a subsequent tailored offer of self-help EMH interventions. We think that targeting work functioning is an important approach, as the ultimate goal of occupational healthcare is to keep employees functioning well and as healthy as possible. However, we were unsuccessful in studying the EMH-approach, because very few participants followed an EMH intervention to at least some degree. Therefore, we recommend further research on two aspects. First, it is essential to identify the specific needs and wishes that nurses and allied health professionals have regarding their work related health and to study how they want to be supported to stay healthy and well-functioning at work. Possibly, a more comprehensive WHS including important other factors of their work, such as physical aspects (e.g. musculoskeletal complaints), would increase their interest and participation. Secondly, it should be investigated whether EMH interventions are suitable and acceptable for a WHS setting for nurses and allied health professionals, and if they would prefer some degree of contact with a healthcare provider. It is recommended to explore the possibility of &#x0201c;blended care&#x0201d;, i.e. combining an offer of an EMH intervention with several coaching sessions. Moreover, it could be useful to apply elements of persuasive design to encourage employees to follow an EMH intervention <xref rid="pone.0072546-Fogg1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0072546-Kelders1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0072546.s001"><label>Algorithm S1</label><caption><p>
