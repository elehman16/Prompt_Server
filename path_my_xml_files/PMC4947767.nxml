As rates of T2DM rise, the need for effective dietary and other lifestyle changes to improve diabetes management become more urgent. Low-glycaemic index (GI) diets may improve glycaemic control in diabetes in the short term; however, there is a lack of evidence on the long-term adherence to low-GI diets, as well as on the association with surrogate markers of CVD beyond traditional risk factors. Recently, advances have been made in measures of subclinical arterial disease through the use of MRI, which, along with standard measures from carotid ultrasound (CUS) scanning, have been associated with CVD events. We therefore designed a randomised, controlled, clinical trial to assess whether low-GI dietary advice can significantly improve surrogate markers of CVD and long-term glycaemic control in T2DM.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>169 otherwise healthy individuals with T2DM were recruited to receive intensive counselling on a low-GI or high-cereal fibre diet for 3&#x02005;years. To assess macrovascular disease, MRI and CUS are used, and to assess microvascular disease, retinal photography and 24-hour urinary collections are taken at baseline and years 1 and 3. Risk factors for CVD are assessed every 3&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study protocol and consent form have been approved by the research ethics board of St. Michael's Hospital.

Given its prevalence and heavy healthcare and quality-of-life burden,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> there is a great need for better treatment options. In uncontrolled T2DM, the macrovascular (cardiovascular disease, CVD) and microvascular (eye and kidney) risks are increased. T2DM reduces the lifespan by 10&#x02005;years,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> chiefly due to CVD deaths, which are twofold higher in men and fourfold higher in women than in those without diabetes.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Further, 40% of new end-stage renal disease is accounted for by diabetic nephropathy and diabetes is a major cause of renal transplants.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Damage to retinal vessels can result in diabetic retinopathy (retinopathy), and macular oedema, which are major causes of vision loss in Western Nations.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The cost of medical care for those with diabetes in Western Nations is two to three times higher than those without diabetes, and has doubled over the past decade,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> largely related to CVD. To reduce the risk of these complications, there is a continued focus on controlling elevated blood glucose levels through lifestyle and pharmaceutical means. Prospective cohort studies and large clinical trials have demonstrated that good glycaemic control in diabetes is associated with a reduced risk of microvascular complications.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;14</xref> However, the results of three large randomised trials published in 2008 (ACCORD, ADVANCE and VADT)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> failed to show significant CVD benefit for improved glycaemic control over a 3-year to 5-year period. At the same time, concern about the cardiovascular safety of rosiglitazone and other antidiabetic medications led the US Food and Drug Administration to require demonstration of the cardiovascular safety of all new antidiabetic agents.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Longer term follow-up of some of these trials (UKPDS&#x000a0;and VADT),<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> as well as the recently published EMPA REG OUTCOME study<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> with the SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, have demonstrated CVD benefit. Acarbose has shown promise in reducing CVD and incident hypertension<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> when assessed as a secondary outcome in a large randomized controlled trial in participants with pre-diabetes, and a larger CVD study with acarbose in patients with diabetes is underway. Acarbose converts dietary carbohydrate into a slow release or low-glycaemic index (GI) food by inhibiting pancreatic amylase and small intestinal brush border sucrase-isomaltase. Low-GI foods, although recommended for diabetes control by many diabetes agencies,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> have not been tested specifically on vascular outcomes despite cohort studies suggesting that low-GI diets, especially in women, are associated with reduced CVD.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Additionally, a randomised trial, the PREDIMED study, that reduced the GI and GL of the diet<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and included the use of nuts and olive oil to achieve this effect also reduced CVD, especially stroke.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> We have demonstrated the greater effectiveness of low-GI diets in reducing HbA1c and blood pressure in T2DM.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> We therefore designed a randomised, controlled, clinical trial to assess whether dietary advice on either a low-GI or a high-cereal fibre diet will make a significant difference on carotid plaque burden and other surrogate markers of CVD, microvascular disease and long-term glycaemic control in high-risk participants with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Recruitment</title><p>In 2010, potential T2DM participants were recruited through newspapers and subway advertisements, and by phoning previous study participants from our research centre who had expressed interest in further studies. After initial telephone screening, information sessions were arranged at St. Michael's Hospital. Those interested, attended a screening visit at the clinic for a blood test to determine eligibility (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="bx1">box 1</xref>). All participants gave informed consent prior to participating in any screening procedures. Physicians were contacted to ensure that those responsible for diabetes care approved participation. Those satisfying initial eligibility criteria were scheduled for a screening 2D carotid ultrasound (CUS) to assess carotid artery thickening by intima media thickness (IMT). Our original screening cut point was a maximum IMT &#x02265;2.0&#x02005;mm; however, a larger than anticipated number of participants were ineligible (&#x0223c;66% ineligible). Therefore, in early 2012, the cut point was reduced to &#x02265;1.5&#x02005;mm (&#x0223c;44% ineligible) in accordance with the Mannheim carotid IMT consensus<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> where &#x02265;1.5&#x02005;mm defined the beginning of atheromatous changes. It was later further reduced in late 2012 to &#x02265;1.2&#x02005;mm (&#x0223c;23% ineligible), the median between the Mannheim consensus (1.5&#x02005;mm) and the European Society of Hypertension and the European Society of Cardiology Practice Guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension (0.9&#x02005;mm).<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> These changes allowed completion of recruitment by June 2013, while including participants with some carotid thickening. At the screening CUS scan, if the maximum IMT measure was greater than or equal to the inclusion cut point of 1.2&#x02005;mm (or the cut point at the time of CUS scan), the sonographer also completed a 3D CUS scan.

A gadolinium contrast agent, Gadovist (gadobutrol, Bayer, Mississauga, Canada), approved by Health Canada and one of several products commonly used for contrast during MRIs, was used after three safety procedures were passed. First, participants had to consent after being informed of the risks. Second, MRI safety forms were completed with the participant and reviewed by the study physician and staff at Sunnybrook. Third, forms were reviewed again by study staff at Sunnybrook immediately before the MRI. If it was deemed safe to proceed, MRI was undertaken with Gadovist. The same safety procedure was repeated for each of the two additional MRI scans at years 1 and 3 of the study. If Gadovist is deemed unsafe or the participant declines consent, the MRI scan is done without the use of Gadovist.</p><p>A baseline retinal examination was conducted by a vitreoretinal subspecialist ophthalmologist at the Department of Ophthalmology at St. Michael's Hospital and each participant had standardised seven-field diabetic retinal photographs taken.</p><p>Two baseline clinical visits occurred at St. Michael's Hospital, on average 2&#x02005;weeks apart, but no more than 5. At the first baseline clinic visit, anthropometric and fasting blood measures were obtained and if HbA1c was &#x02265;6.5%, participants could proceed. If HbA1c was &#x0003c;6.5%, participants could return for a retest after 2&#x02005;weeks. Participants were given detailed instruction on how to complete a 7-day food record and 24-hour urine collection using the kit provided; both were returned at the second visit.</p><p>At the second baseline clinic visit, anthropometric and fasting blood measures were again obtained and each participant was randomised to receive dietary advice on either a low-GI or high-cereal fibre diet. Randomisation was stratified by sex, HbA1c (&#x02264;7.1%, &#x0003e;7.1%), smoking (yes or no) and statin use (yes or no) as documented during the first baseline visit. Participants were provided with a dietary instruction sheet based on the diet to which they were randomised (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> figures S1 and S2). These diets were reviewed in detail with a study dietitian in a 30&#x02005;min discussion.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012220.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012220supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Blinding the participants or the dietitians delivering the dietary advice is not possible due to the very different nature and physical form of the foods. However, it was stressed to the participants that both treatments have been considered to confer benefits in cohort studies in order to balance participant expectation of treatment benefit. To remove the possibility of bias, physicians and technical staff who are obtaining measurements are blinded to the treatments, as was the statistician who randomised the coded participants and who will analyse the data. Participants were randomised after the baseline (zero week) blood sample to avoid randomising participants who for any reason did not intend to start the study.

Participants are centred at the index carotid artery bifurcation as determined by carotid IMT (ie, &#x02018;index&#x02019; is the side of the artery, left or right, with the highest IMT), and a shim coil covering a 10&#x02005;cm region over the neck is used to improve magnetic field homogeneity. With a standardised protocol, six contrast weightings of the carotid artery are obtained: 2D precontrast and postcontrast enhanced T1-weighted (T1W), proton density weighted, and T2-weighted sequences, as well as 3D T1W gradient recalled echo and time of flight MR angiography sequences. Images are obtained of the left and right carotid arteries. Gadobutrol (Bayer) is used as the contrast agent when criteria are met at an intravenous injection of 0.1&#x02005;mmol/kg (0.2&#x02005;mL/kg). Sequence parameters are described in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> table S1.

The cardiovascular imaging software, VesselMASS (Medis, the Netherlands), is used for image analysis. Image grading is performed during the analysis (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> table S2) and images with poor quality (grade &#x0003c;3) or with missing images will be excluded from analyses.

We believe this will open the way for other investigators to use vascular MRI in their research and for use in clinical practice as a diagnostic tool and especially for follow-up. It is also the longest trial to date to assess the effect of altering the dietary GI and will also provide invaluable data on the natural history of vascular disease. In view of the global rise in the incidence of T2DM and the associated vascular complications, including increased CVD risk, therapeutic approaches that address microvascular and macrovascular risk factors are now urgently required.</p><p>At present, diabetes is an immense burden on the healthcare system of Western Nations, projected to continue to increase, and largely related to CVD and microvascular complications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A 25% sparing of T2DM microvascular complications would result long term from a 0.9% reduction in HbA1c according to the UKPDS data.<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> We achieved a 0.5% reduction in HbA1c in our previous 6-month randomised, controlled trial of similar low-GI dietary advice in those with T2DM,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> so we expect a similar reduction in this investigation. The economic (let alone social) impact of even one-third the reduction in HbA1c seen in the UKPDS<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> is likely to be considerable. If low-GI diets can be shown to reduce macrovascular disease risk factors in addition to reducing microvascular disease, results will not only increase understanding of the role of diet and nutrition in macrovascular disease development in T2DM but will also influence guidelines for the treatment of diabetes&#x000a0;and the nature of the products produced by the food industry, and the savings in cost and suffering will be significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Rajeev Muni for his help as one of our vitreoretinal subspecialist ophthalmologists from the Department of Ophthalmology at St. Michael's Hospital.
