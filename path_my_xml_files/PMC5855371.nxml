According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a significant increase was observed for obesity among men and women from 1999 to 2010, with more than 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of adults in the US being considered overweight.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] This unhealthy body composition is associated with low quality of life and several other conditions.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Thus, due to the high prevalence of overweight people and negative impact on health, ways of improving body composition are needed.</p><p>Thermogenesis is the physiological process of generating heat. An important site of thermogenesis is the brown adipose tissue (BAT).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] BAT generates heat in response to cold temperatures for protection against hypothermia, as well as in response to feeding for dissipation of excess energy from food.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Since BAT can convert energy into heat, this body region can be considered a site for active metabolism. Particularly, BAT has been considered an organ that burns off excess fat, with an area of recent intense research, and an interesting target for improving body composition.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Diet-induced thermogenesis, and a potential stimulation of fat metabolism, can be achieved by consumption of certain foods. Capsinoids, which consist of capsaicin, capsiate, and dihydrocapsiate, are the naturally occurring spicy components in <italic>Capsicum annuum</italic> peppers, and known to activate thermogenesis via &#x003b2;3-adrenergic receptors[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1),[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] a downstream signal from &#x003b2;3-adrenergic receptors in BAT.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In clinical studies, capsinoid administration reduced body weight and fat.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The seed extract of <italic>Irvingia gabonensis</italic>, also known as African mango, was shown to reduce body weight and fat in clinical trials[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] by potentially modulating PPAR&#x003b3; and leptin genes.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Similarly, the root extract of the plant <italic>Coleus forskohlii</italic>, extensively known for its stimulation on intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate production, increases UCP1 mRNA and protein <italic>in vitro</italic>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and reduces weight gain and body fat in rodents and humans.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Finally, P-synephrine, the natural stimulant present in <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> and other citrus fruits, increases energy expenditure in humans.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Extensive research has also demonstrated that whey protein supplementation promotes satiety, improves body composition, and enhances weight loss.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Particularly, previous published preclinical research on the currently tested whey protein supplement revealed significant effects on biomarkers of fat burning, metabolism, and satiety in rats.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Due to this potential synergistic effect of whey protein and thermogenic foods, a novel supplement containing thermogenic food ingredients was tested alone and in combination with a whey protein supplement for effects on body composition and thermogenesis in this current pilot study in mice.</p><p>The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether a combination of the above-mentioned food ingredients (novel blend) reduces the gain in body weight and fat that is caused by high-fat diet. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that the addition of whey protein supplementation would improve the benefits of the novel blend in reducing body weight and fat without altering muscle mass. To test these hypotheses, we assessed body weight, fat mass, and muscle mass before and after treatment with novel blend alone or in combination with whey protein in mice fed a high-fat diet. We further carried out experiments to explore the potential mechanism by which novel blend attenuates body weight and fat gain. These experiments suggest that novel blend attenuates body weight and fat gain in response to high-fat diet mainly via stimulation of thermogenesis in BAT rather than reduction in appetite in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>C57BL/6J male mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) initially aged 4 weeks old were ear notched for identification and housed in individually and positively ventilated polysulfonate cages with high-efficiency particulate absolute-filtered air.

At 8 weeks of age, baseline measures were collected as described below, and subsequently animals were randomly assigned to receive daily dosing by oral gavage of vehicle, the novel blend alone or in combination with whey protein supplement. At 12 weeks of age, posttreatment measures were collected as described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Supplements</title><p>The test article is a blend that contains African mango (<italic>I. gabonensis</italic>) seed extract (daily human equivalent dose of 300 mg; Nutragenesis, Vermont, USA), citrus fruit extract from <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic>, <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>, and <italic>Citrus paradisi</italic> standardized to 5% synephrine and 80% bioflavonoids (daily human equivalent dose of 1000 mg; Novel Ingredients, NJ, USA), <italic>Coleus forskohlii</italic> root extract 10% forskolin (daily human equivalent dose of 500 mg; Suan Farma, NJ, USA), dihydrocapsiate (2.4 mg daily human equivalent dose; Glanbia, Ireland), and red pepper (<italic>Capsicum annuum</italic>) fruit extract 2% capsinoids (1.56 mg daily human equivalent dose). The novel blend was dissolved in 20-mL 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose at 250 mg/kg. Control group received 20-mL 0.5% carboxymethyl cellulose.

Protein supplement was administered once daily via oral gavage 4 h apart from novel blend treatment at the human equivalent dose of 10 g (2000 mg/kg mouse dose) dissolved in 10-mL deionized water. Novel blend was administered in the morning and protein supplement was administered in the afternoon. Due to a limited amount of gavage material a mouse can take, the supplements were not administered at the same time. The choice of administration of whey protein in the afternoon was to match previous rodent study that demonstrated that this particular whey protein supplement administered in the early afternoon to rats produces significant effects on markers of body composition.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Future studies are necessary to evaluate the impact of the timing of administration of novel blend on body composition.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Body weight and composition</title><p>Body weight was measured three times a week for the entire course of the study.

In clinical studies, <italic>I. gabonensis</italic> seed extract,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] capsinoids,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] forskolin,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and whey protein[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] administration showed reduction in total body fat in comparison to placebo. Furthermore, this finding is in agreement with previous clinical studies demonstrating that whey protein,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] particularly whey hydrolysate,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] reduces body fat.</p><p>Protein supplementation, without an exercise component, has also been shown to stimulate muscle protein synthesis in rats[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and increase muscle mass in humans.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In contrast, muscle mass was reduced in the novel blend + whey protein supplement group in comparison to novel blend alone and control groups. These effects potentially occurred due to the significant greater reduction in body weight gain observed in this group.</p><p>The mechanism through which the novel blend reduced fat mass can be in part explained by its thermogenic effect. Previous research has demonstrated that capsinoids and forskolin increase BAT temperature and the protein and mRNA expression of the thermogenic biomarker UCP1.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Furthermore, previous study demonstrated that oral administration of the whey protein supplement used in the current investigation increases other fat metabolism markers, namely, phospho-HSL and PGC-1&#x003b1; in rats.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In accordance with these prior studies, in the current investigation, the novel blend increased thermal imaging of BAT in comparison to vehicle control and this effect remained significant when the novel blend was administered with a whey protein supplement. In addition, the thermogenic biomarker UCP1 was increased in the novel blend + whey protein supplement group, but unexpectedly not in the novel blend alone. Unpublished data suggest that a higher dose of novel blend might be necessary for upregulation of UCP1 protein.</p><p>The satiety hormone leptin was investigated as another possible mechanism for the reduction in body weight gain. Previous clinical and preclinical studies have demonstrated that bitter orange reduces hunger cravings,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] <italic>I. gabonensis</italic> and capsinoids reduce blood leptin levels,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and <italic>Coleus forskohlii</italic> reduces food intake.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Furthermore, whey protein has also shown to reduce leptin levels in rodents,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] although not in humans.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In the current study, blood leptin levels at posttreatment were different in the novel blend + whey protein group in comparison to control and novel blend alone groups. However, since no significant effect was found in the novel blend-alone group, any effect in leptin levels may be due to the whey protein supplement as opposed to the novel blend. Another possibility for the lack of effect in blood leptin in the novel blend-alone group is that blood leptin levels were not significantly increased with 4 weeks of high-fat diet as seen in the within-group comparisons of posttreatment versus baseline in all the three groups. Further studies on the effects of novel blend on blood leptin during high-fat diet are needed to elucidate this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, oral administration to mice of a novel blend containing <italic>I. gabonensis</italic>, citrus fruit extract, <italic>C. forskohlii</italic>, dihydrocapsiate, and red pepper stimulated thermogenesis and attenuated the gain in body weight and fat in response to high-fat diet without affecting muscle mass. The novel blend increased thermal imaging of BAT, indicating that improvement in body composition potentially occurred due to a fat-burning effect. Furthermore, reduction in body weight and fat gain improved when novel blend was administered in combination with whey protein supplement. Particularly, novel blend + whey protein supplement increased UCP1 protein expression in BAT in addition to augmentation of BAT thermal imaging, suggesting that protein supplement provides a synergistic fat-burning effect.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>4Life Holdings, LLC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>All of the authors are currently employees of the funding organization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Flegal</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Carroll</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Kit</surname><given-names>BK</given-names></name><name><surname>Ogden</surname><given-names>CL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of obesity and trends in the distribution of body mass index among US adults, 1999-2010</article-title><source>JAMA</source><year>2012</year><volume>307</volume><fpage>491</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22253363</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><collab>CDC</collab><article-title>Adult Obesity Causes &#x00026; Consequences</article-title><source>16 June, 2015 edition.
