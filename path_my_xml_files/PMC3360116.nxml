Our aim was to replicate this association and investigate possible functional mechanisms. We observed similar associations between this haplotype and hydrochlorothiazide response in an independent sample of 746 Caucasians and African-Americans randomized to hydrochlorothiazide or atenolol treatment. The haplotype association was driven by variation at rs7297610, where C/C genotypes were associated with greater mean (systolic: 3.4mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0275; diastolic: 2.5mmHg, <italic>P</italic>=0.0196) responses to hydrochlorothiazide vs. T-allele carriers. Such an association was absent in atenolol-treated participants, supporting this as hydrochlorothiazide-specific. Expression analyses in hydrochlorothiazide-treated African-Americans showed differential leukocyte <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression between rs7297610 genotype groups at baseline (<italic>P</italic>=0.024), and reduced expression in C/C genotypes (<italic>P</italic>=0.009), but not in T-carriers.

Hypertensive participants (clinic DBP from 90 mmHg to 110 mmHg) were enrolled from the University of Florida (Gainesville, FL, USA), Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA) and Emory University (Atlanta, GA, USA). Males and females of any race between the ages of 17 and 65 with essential hypertension were recruited to participate and randomized to either HCTZ or atenolol. After a four-week antihypertensive washout, participants were initially given HCTZ 12.5 mg daily or atenolol 50 mg daily, with most receiving a dose escalation to 25 mg and 100 mg, respectively for blood pressure greater than 120/70 mmHg after four weeks. After nine weeks, blood pressure response was assessed and, if blood pressure remained above 120/70 mmHg, the other study drug was added for another nine weeks. To assure a four-week washout sufficiently erased any blood pressure effects of previous antihypertensive treatments, we confirmed that post-washout blood pressure levels in participants who had previously received antihypertensives, were nearly identical to those who were had never received antihypertensive medication. Participants were not given sodium restrictions, but were counseled to maintain consistent dietary intakes. The primary response phenotype of PEAR was home blood pressure, which participants were required to take seated, in triplicate upon rising and before retiring with a provided blood pressure monitoring device (BP 3AC1-AP Monitor, Microlife USA, Dunedin, FL, USA) at least five of seven days prior to their blood pressure assessment visit. Blood was drawn before monotherapy, after monotherapy, and after treatment with both study drugs. The 746 Caucasian and African-American participants who completed at least the monotherapy stage of the study were included in this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Genotyping</title><p id="P6">Genomic DNA from the PEAR study was isolated from blood using the FlexiGene DNA Kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) following the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol.

Genotypes were determined by pyrosequencing using the PSQ HS 96 genotyping platform (Biotage AB, Uppsala Sweden). Approximately 40 ng of genomic DNA was used for polymerase chain reaction under the following conditions: a strand separation at 95&#x000b0;C for 15 min, then 40 cycles of denaturation at 95&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, annealing at 59&#x000b0;C for 30 sec, and extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min, then one final extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 7 min. Genotypes were automatically called by PSQ HS 96 SNP software (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Approximately 5% of participants were genotyped in duplicate to confirm call reliability, with an agreement of 98%. Genotypes for 48,539 other SNPs across Chromosome 12 were later determined in PEAR by HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).

Our findings also represent one of the few replicated GWAS examples in the pharmacogenomics literature for a gene not involved in drug metabolism or drug transport. Specifically, we replicated the associations between rs317689/rs315135/rs7297610 haplotypes and HCTZ response in African-Americans. These data demonstrate that African-Americans with the ATT haplotype are more likely to have a smaller blood pressure response to HCTZ compared with those without this haplotype. Haplotype associations seem to be driven by the third SNP in the haplotype, rs7297610. Our data show clinically significant differences in blood pressure response to HCTZ based on rs7297610 genotype, with a 3.4 mmHg difference in mean systolic and a 2.5 mmHg difference in mean diastolic blood pressure reduction between C/C and T-carrier genotype groups. We also present evidence demonstrating rs7297610 is not a universal predictor of blood pressure response to all antihypertensives, but rather a thiazide-specific response locus, as we found no association of this genotype in the response of African-Americans randomized to the beta-blocker atenolol. Further, we found <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression significantly differs by rs7297610 genotype at baseline, and HCTZ treatment significantly decreases expression only in African-Americans with the C/C genotype.</p><p id="P17">Rs7297610 occurs in an intergenic region between YEATS domain-containing 4 (<italic>YEATS4</italic>) and fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (<italic>FRS2</italic>). In humans, the common C allele at rs7297610 varies from other mammals, which almost exclusively possess the T allele, indicating variation evolved recently in the human lineage. Also, because it is highly conserved in other species, this locus could have some yet unknown functional property. To develop a functional hypothesis for this SNP&#x02019;s association with HCTZ response, we investigated possible functional mechanisms <italic>in silico</italic>, but found no explanation for this association. Because no functional prediction could be made and linkage analysis produced no functional candidates, we measured associations between rs7297610 genotype and expression of the three nearby genes (<italic>LYZ</italic>, <italic>YEATS4</italic> and <italic>FRS2</italic>) in African-Americans treated with HCTZ. Interestingly, we found that baseline <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression was associated rs7297610 genotype. Upon HCTZ treatment, <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression significantly decreased in those with the C/C genotype, but T-carriers experience no significant change in expression. This association raises the possibility that differential expression of <italic>YEATS4</italic> may be involved in the greater blood pressure response to HCTZ seen in the rs7297610 C/C genotype. However, further research is needed to verify if this is the case, as the mechanism by which rs7297610 could affect <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression and HCTZ blood pressure response remain unclear at this time.</p><p id="P18">Our strongest hypothesis on why this SNP associates with variability in response to HCTZ is that rs7297610 tags another (or many rare), functional SNP(s). The two major reasons for this hypothesis are: (1) the blood pressure response to HCTZ was only observed in African-Americans and not Caucasians, and (2) the intergenic location of rs7297610 is not in any known coding or regulatory region of the genome. The original GWAS conducted by Turner and colleagues genotyped approximately 100,000 SNPs across the genome. Further, fine mapping analyses done by Turner and colleagues were only completed within the <italic>LYZ</italic>, <italic>YEATS4</italic> and <italic>FRS</italic> genes. So when nearly 1.1 million genotypes became available on each PEAR participant, a comprehensive linkage analysis could be completed in hopes of finding the functional SNP(s) in LD with rs7297610. When we measured linkage across Chromosome 12, we found two SNPs (rs10784780 and rs10878983) that were in high LD with rs7297610 and more strongly associated with HCTZ response. However, we found no association between rs10784780 or rs10878983 genotype and <italic>LYZ</italic>, <italic>YEATS4</italic> or <italic>FRS2</italic> expression changes after HCTZ treatment. These two SNPs also exist in the same intergenic region as the nearby rs7297610, with no known mechanism for gene regulation. Thus, rs10784780 and rs10878983 simply appear to be better tagSNPs for some still undiscovered polymorphism(s). Further sequencing of the Chromosome 12q15 region in a large number of HCTZ-treated hypertensives may discover the functional SNP(s) responsible for our observed associations with HCTZ response.</p><p id="P19"><italic>YEATS4</italic> encodes the protein GAS41, which knock-out studies have shown is essential for RNA transcription and cell viability.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> As with other YEATS domain-containing proteins, GAS41 plays a role in chromatin-modification and transcription, which may involve recognition of chromatin targets and recruiting modification complexes to affect transcription.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> While no reference was found in the literature connecting GAS41 with cardiovascular function, this protein has been implicated in mixed lineage leukemia (MLL), and is required for repressing the p53 repressor pathway during normal cellular proliferation.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Whether GAS41&#x02019;s effect on proliferation could play a role in hypertension-associated renal cell proliferation is unknown. However, this could be a potential mechanism where <italic>YEATS4</italic> could affect response to the diuretic HCTZ, which acts in the renal tubules. Further studies are needed to clarify if and how GAS41 impacts blood pressure homeostasis and HCTZ response.</p><p id="P20">The similarity in size and patient characteristics between PEAR and the previous GWAS population was a major strength in our validation effort, and thus, we predicted we would detect similar associations to those found previously, if the associations were real. A limitation to this study is that RNA expression profiles taken from whole blood may not be relevant to assess HCTZ response at the site of action. However, cells from the two primary hypothesized sites of HCTZ action, the kidney and the vasculature, are difficult to obtain from humans, and HCTZ was previously shown to be pharmacologically active in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p id="P21">To conclude, we report the first known validation of an antihypertensive pharmacogenomic GWAS, confirming a pharmacogenomic effect of rs7297610 on HCTZ blood pressure response in African-Americans. Further, our data demonstrate this is an HCTZ-specific effect, and suggest variation at rs7297610 is associated with differential <italic>YEATS4</italic> expression. Whether these expression differences play a role in the diminished blood pressure response we observed with HCTZ treatment remains unknown. If they do, this pathway could explain some amount of HCTZ response variability. However, <italic>YEATS4</italic> has not previously been linked to cardiovascular function or thiazide effect, so additional research is needed to elucidate the functional role of rs7297610, as well as the potential role of <italic>YEATS4</italic> in blood pressure response to HCTZ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S15"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><caption><title>Supplementary Figure 1</title><p id="P22">Species conservation at the rs7297610 locus.
