However, it is also used commonly in a prophylactic setting (without assisted delivery) to reduce the complications associated with OP delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a survey of obstetricians in Australia and New Zealand, 70% believed it was acceptable in a prophylactic setting; but only 38% had performed a manual rotation in the last year, and most of these had only performed one or two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

However, there was no control group of women for whom a manual rotation was not performed and it is not possible to know if this was due to the procedure itself or to underlying confounders such as a smaller fetus.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In a prospective cohort study with historical controls (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;61), the local labour ward policy was changed from not performing prophylactic manual rotation to routinely performing the procedure for OP position about &#x02018;half way&#x02019; into the second stage of labour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The operative delivery rate for fetuses in the OP position fell from 73% prior to the change in policy to 23% after the policy was implemented, but this study design is subject to a significant risk of bias.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Schaffer <italic>et al</italic>.

However, the authors had information on the fetal position at the time of birth but not earlier in the second stage of labour when the procedure was performed. Thus OP fetuses that were destined to rotate naturally to the OA position would have been included in the intervention group, but not the control group, which would result in an overestimation of the caesarean section rate in the control group and of the efficacy of manual rotation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Thus preliminary studies suggest that manual rotation reduces the risk of operative delivery but are susceptible to significant bias.

The following variables will be considered for the logistic regression model: maternal body mass index, maternal age, maternal height, maternal ethnicity, gestation, induction of labour, gestational diabetes, neonatal gender, and RCOG CTG classification in the second stage of labour. Parity, study site and the presence of epidural for intrapartum analgesia at the time of randomisation will not be included because randomisation is stratified for these variables. Only variables where <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.25 in the univariate regression will be included in the multivariate model. Continuous variables that do not show a linear association with the logit function will be divided into quartiles and treated as categorical. Interaction terms will be considered for treatment allocation versus each of the other variables and where clinically appropriate between non-treatment variables. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.01 will be considered evidence of interaction. Terms will be excluded from the model in a stepwise backward manner until all remaining terms are both statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05) and clinically significant (that is, removal of the term results in a clinically significant change in the estimate of the odds ratio of treatment allocation for the primary outcome). The analysis will be performed using SAS 9.2 (or a more recent version of SAS).</p><p>Subgroup analyses will be performed according to the technique of manual rotation employed (manual/whole hand versus digital/fingers) and according to operator ability (data will be divided into two approximately equal groups according to the success rate of the operator who performed the manual rotation).</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Data safety monitoring committee</title><p>Draft terms of reference for a data and safety monitoring committee provide for potential cessation of the trial if significant safety concerns are raised.

Due to the nature of the intervention, a number of issues are worthy of discussion.</p><p>First, empirical evidence suggests that blinding reduces bias in randomised controlled trials. However, blinding may be difficult in the case of procedural interventions. In this trial, we intend to assess the efficacy of blinding by asking the woman&#x02019;s carer to guess the treatment allocation after manual rotation or sham rotation has occurred. The purpose of this is to allow the reader to assess the risk of bias associated with knowledge of treatment allocation.</p><p>Second, the efficacy of procedural interventions may depend on the experience and training of individual operators. The &#x02018;success&#x02019; of manual rotation of individual operators will be assessed by recording the ultrasound determined fetal position after the manual rotation or sham procedure has been performed. We will report on any major differences between the success rates of individual practitioners.</p><p>Third, due to the ethics of consent in labour, consent will be obtained when it is unknown if the fetus will be in the occiput posterior position in the second stage of labour, which is an eligibility criterion. Thus, it is likely that only a minority of consented participants will be randomised, which will result in a large workload per randomisation (the pilot study was used as a reference).</p><p>Finally, women who progress rapidly in labour may give birth before they can be randomised and women with regional analgesia will have more opportunity to be consented. This could result in the study population having a higher background risk of the primary outcome than non-consented women who meet our eligibility criteria, which could impact the generalisability of our findings.</p><sec id="Sec49"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p>If modification to the study protocol is considered necessary, then permission will be sought from the ethics committee and the changes will be described in the final report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All the information collected from the study will be treated confidentially, and only the researchers will have access to it.
