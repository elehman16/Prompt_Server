Population health statistics shows that obesity in most of the industrial countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States have been increasing.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Energy balance equations indicate that weight gain can occur when there is a prolonged persistence of energy imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure. In recent years, increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity is significant in both developed and developing countries; it shows that the origin of this public health problem is complicated and multifactorial.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Sedentary lifestyle, macronutrient composition of the diet and increased energy density of foods are some factors that may contribute to the growth of obesity in the world.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The cause of many diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cancer, coronary heart disease, and sleep-breathing disorders are obesity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there is no single dietary or lifestyle intervention that is effective in reducing weight for a prolonged period. Traditional prescriptions for weight-loss decrease total fat and so often restrict nut consumption.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nuts are rich in many vitamins, minerals, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Because of nut's usefulness's regular consumption of them has been recommended as a part of a wholesome diet.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Nut consumption (such as almond) cause improvements in triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC),[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and so it has positive effects on various cardiovascular disease risk factors.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Moreover, observational studies show that nut consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It has been known that fiber and protein[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] are known factors of increase of the satiety of meals and prolong feelings of fullness;[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] moreover, nuts are also a dietary source of them[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and almonds also contain a high level of arginine, fiber, vitamin E, polyphenolic compounds, magnesium and monounsaturated fatty acids, and particularly oleic acid.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Although, nut consumption has the above-mentioned benefits, many individuals who are trying to lose weight due to nut's high energy density may consciously avoid their consumption.</p><p>Epidemiological studies have shown that the consumption of nuts (such as almond) is inversely related to body weight.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The effect of nut consumption in the context of a weight-loss program have been evaluated only by a few randomized studies and their results were somewhat contradictory.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Among nuts, almonds approximately have the highest amount of protein and fiber.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] This current study aims to find out the effects of a balanced hypocaloric almond-enriched diet (AED) in comparison to a balanced hypocaloric nut-free diet (NFD) on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors in women with body mass index (BMI) &#x02265;25 for 3-month.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 152 subjects volunteered to participate in this study. Participants were recruited through public advertisements and 108 cases that had inclusion criteria were selected. Inclusion criteria were BMI &#x02265;25, an age of 20-55 years and had no exercise (they had light physical activity: Doing household tasks, riding in a car, light activity while sitting.). The subjects were all premenopause females.</p><p>The individuals who had following criteria were not included to the study: Having a chronic illness (e.g., cancer, renal failure, cardiovascular disease, liver, and lung failure), uncontrolled hypertension (defined as a blood pressure &#x02265;180/100 mmHg), taking lipid-lowering medications or vitamin supplements, an inflammatory condition (e.g., lupus), diabetes or use of anti-hyperglycemic drugs, working night shifts, pregnancy or lactation, smoking, alcohol consumption or any known allergy or sensitivity to nuts. Additional criteria that cause subject not included in the study were being on weight control diets or any specific diets at the time, use of medications known to affect body weight or a weight-loss of &#x02265;5 kg in the preceding 6-month.</p><p>Also, participants who did not comply with their diet, did not do their recommended walking or did not intend to continue the study were excluded from the study. Subjects were asked to visit in valiasr charity clinic, Shiraz, Iran. This study was conducted from March to September 2013.</p><p>This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences and written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Furthermore, this trial was registered in Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with ID number of IRCT2013062313751N1.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design and diets</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial. A sample of 80 based on BMI was calculated to detect the predicted difference of eight between the means of two groups with a power level of 80% and the significance level set to 0.05 if the standard deviation (SD) was 12.7 and 12.8.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The calculated required sample size was 40 in each group. To allow for attrition, a sample size of 108 subjects was selected (54 from each group).</p><p>Participants were randomly assigned into almond and nut-free groups through the balanced block randomization method (block size of four). Three 24-h dietary recalls (2 weekdays and 1 for weekend day), for the assessments of food intake at baseline, end of the study and the end of each month were carried out from all participants.</p><p>At the beginning, balanced low calorie diets for both groups were designed (a balanced, restricted-energy diet should be nutritionally adequate except for energy: Approximately, 50-55% of total kilocalories for carbohydrates, 15-25% of total kilocalories for proteins and fat content should not exceed 30% of total calories[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Energy requirements were calculated according to the Harris Benedict equation. For everyone, 1000 kcal were reduced from the total calculated energy requirement. In both groups, the percentage of energy from macronutrients was the same (approximately 54% for carbohydrates, 16% for proteins, and 30% for fat). The almond group was requested to consume 50 g raw almond in the form of two snacks (approximately, 25 g raw almond in each snack) per day while the nut-free group were asked not to consume any nut. Instead of almond consumption, compensatory serving from the meat and fat exchange lists (like sunflower oil and corn oil) were used by the nut-free group participants. Supplies of prepackaged almonds (each package contain 50 g of almond) were given to participants who are going to the clinic monthly.</p><p>All participants were instructed to maintain their usual activity habits. Moreover, both groups were recommended to walk with medium speed 30-min every day. They were trained about their diet, healthy nutrition, and self-monitoring and stimulus control separately. All participants requested to comply with their diets for 3-month. They were called by phone every 15 days to ask about their situations and diet compliance. Also, suggestions to enhance compliance were provided. Moreover, intervention protocol and assessment of their compliance (including food intake and recommended walking) was checked by using 24-h dietary recalls.</p><p>Weight, waist and hip circumferences were determined by standard anthropometric methods in the beginning and after 3-month at the end of the study. Weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg on a seca electronic scale when the subjects were fasting, with no shoes and with light-weight clothing. BMI was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m<sup>2</sup>). Waist and hip circumference measurements were made to the nearest 0.1 cm by a tape measure. Waist circumferences (WC) were measured midway between the last rib and the ileac crest. Height was determined to the nearest 0.1 cm by using a stadiometer only at baseline.</p><p>Blood pressure was assessed by using a calibrated automatic digital monitor. After the participants sat quietly for 5-min, two blood pressure readings were made separated by a 1-min rest period. The average of the two readings was used to determine blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Biological sample collection and analysis</title><p>Participants were recruited for a blood sample collection on separate days. A volume of 10 ml blood samples were drown from arm after subjects had fasted overnight (12-h). In order to obtain plasma and to avoid clotting, 2 cc of blood samples were put in a tube containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid 5% (0.3 ml). Plasma separated by centrifugation at 1500 g for 10-min. Venous blood samples were taken using venous retention needles prior to and at the end of the study and analyzed for fasting blood sugar (FBS), TC, triglyceride, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and LDL-C concentrations. Lipid profiles (plasma total TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and triglycerides) and FBS were measured based on a photometric method (Autoanalyzer BT 1500, blotecnica Instruments, Italy).

Furthermore, the almond group had more reduction in BMI, WC and W/H than the nut-free group, all of which were significant. These findings are similar to the results obtained by Wien <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] where 65 overweight and obese subjects were randomized to consume complex carbohydrate enriched or an almond-enriched low calorie diets for 24 weeks under the free-living condition. The AED group consumed approximately 84 g/d of almonds. Both diet groups lost weight, but the almond group had greater reduction in weight, BMI, and WC.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In another weight reduction study by McManus <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] 101 overweight participants were fed either a low-fat (20% energy from fat) or a moderate fat diet (35% energy from fat) including several nuts. The moderate fat group experienced superior adherence and greater weight-loss and decrease in WC over 18-month while the low fat group regained weight progressively.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In contrast, a study examined by Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] examined the effects of a hypocaloric, AED compared with a hypocaloric NFD on body weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the context of an 18-month weight reduction program. One hundred twenty-three overweight and obese subjects were randomly divided to consume an AED or NFD. Both groups were trained in traditional behavioral methods of weight control. NFD group had slightly, but significantly more weight-loss than the AED group at 6-month, but there were no statistically significant differences in body weight between the groups at 18-month.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] These findings may be secondary to the NFD group choosing foods for snacks with lower calories than nuts; therefore, resulting in slightly greater energy deficits.</p><p>In other studies outside the context of weight reduction conducted by Spiller <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Sabat&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] revealed no changes in weights of subjects when they received almonds.

Firstly, nuts provide greater satiety. Nuts are energy dense foods with high fiber, protein, unsaturated fats, various phytochemicals, and low glycemic index; all of them are dietary factors that have been associated with satiety responses. Secondly, chronic consumption of nuts may lead to increased resting energy expenditure due to high unsaturated fatty acids, which may influence diet-induced thermogenesis. Thirdly, bioavailability of fatty acids in nuts may not be full, and it is likely because of the nut parenchyma cell wall's resistance to enzymatic degradation in the gastrointestinal tract which leads to the encapsulation of fat. However, the indicated mechanisms are not clear.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</p><p>Consumption of almonds has been shown to have health promoting benefits on lipid profiles. In a pooled analysis of 25 intervention trials study performed by Sabat&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] on 583 men and women with normolipidemia and hypercholesterolemia (who did not use lipid-lowering medications) indicated that a mean daily consumption of 67 g of nuts resulted in mean reduction in TC, LDL, LDL: HDL and TC: HDL. Triglycerides levels were reduced in individuals whose blood triglyceride levels were at least 150 mg/dL, and there was a correlation between the effects of nut consumption and dose related.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The results obtained in another study by Sabat&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] are similar to these results. In a randomized crossover design, 25 healthy subjects were recruited to comply with three isocaloric diets for 4 weeks. A Step I diet, a low-almond diet, and a high-almond diet were experimental diets that the participants followed in which almonds contributed 0%, 10%, and 20% (68 g) of total energy, respectively. Inverse relations between the percentage of energy in the diet from almonds and the subject's TC, LDL-C concentrations and the ratios of LDL to HDL-C were found.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>In agreement with these findings, Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] in a randomized cross-over study used three isocaloric (mean 423 kcal/d) supplements. Participants were 27 hyperlipidemic males and females that consumed supplements (included full-dose almonds (73 &#x000b1; 3 g/d), half-dose almonds plus half-dose muffins, and full-dose muffins) each for 4 weeks. The greatest reduction in levels of blood lipids were experienced in full-dose almonds.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>In a randomized, cross-over clinical trial performed by Tamizifar <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] 35 hyperlipidemic subjects were selected to consume almond (25 g) or a reference diet. Duration of each phase was 4 weeks. TC and LDL were reduced significantly in almond group, but the changes of HDL and triglycerides were not significant.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Results of Tamizifar's <italic>et al</italic>. study consist with other studies. Furthermore, this study suggested that consumption of almond had a favorable lipid-altering effect, even in lower dose than previous studies (25 g vs. 100 g).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed that in spite of a slightly smaller weight reduction at 6-month in the AED group, triglycerides, TC, and TC: HDL-C improved more in the AED group than in the NFD group. Regards HDL, LDL, and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels, no differences were found between the groups at 6- or 18-month.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>In this study, TC and triglycerides improved more in the almond group than the nut-free group like other studies, but an increase in HDL and a decrease in LDL in the nut-free group were significantly greater than the almond group. In our sample, the effect of almonds on LDL may have been attenuated due to higher levels of LDL in the almond group at baseline and perhaps the effect of almond on LDL are greater in subjects with lower LDL concentration. In addition, pooled analyses suggested that nut consumption were more effective in subjects with a lower MBI.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Therefore, the potential cholesterol-lowering effects of nut consumption may have restricted by the elevated BMI in our sample.</p><p>Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] indicated no differences in HDL between the groups and pooled analyses[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] proposed that no significant effect on the mean HDL were observed by nut consumption. In our study, HDL increased slightly in the almond group without significance, but significant differences were found between the two groups after 3-month. Furthermore, perhaps the nut-free group had more exercise than the almond group or the almond group did not do their recommended amount of walking, which resulted in greater improvement of HDL in nut-free group.</p><p>Although improvement of LDL and HDL in the nut-free group was more, greater improvement of TC: HDL-C, which has been recently suggested as a good or better indicator of predicting cardiovascular disease risk than LDL-C,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] were observed in the almond group. These results are in agreement with those obtained by Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Sabat&#x000e9; <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and are consistent with a cardioprotective effect.</p><p>Pearson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] suggested that if the reduction in triglycerides and cholesterol preserved over a long time, reduction in cardiovascular disease risk might be expected. The effect of almond mechanisms that help in causing improvements in triglycerides and TC remain unclear; however, they seem to be related to effects on VLDL metabolism. Unsaturated fatty acids are rich in almonds and can influence VLDL metabolism by either reduced hepatic VLDL production or increased VLDL lipolysis.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Fasting blood sugar decreased over the period of study in both groups, but greater significant reductions were observed in the almond group. In Wien's <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] fasting glucose decreased significantly in both dietary interventions by a similar extent, but an improvement in insulin sensitivity among participants consuming almonds were found. These findings were similar to results acquired in another study by Wien <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Rocca <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] have suggested that almond consumption was related to improvement of insulin sensitivity. High content of oleic acid in almonds may improve B-cell efficiency through enhanced intestinal secretion of glucagon-like-peptide-1.</p><p>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased with weight-loss in both groups after 3-month consistent with Foster <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but in Foster's study no differences were found between the groups. In our study, a significantly greater reduction in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the almond group at the end of study, but inversely, systolic blood pressure in the almond group had significantly less reduction compared to the nut-free group. That may be because subjects in the almond group had higher systolic blood pressure at baseline, so the effect of almond on systolic blood pressure was attenuated. In Wien's <italic>et al</italic>. study[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] diastolic blood pressure decreased similarly in both groups, but systolic blood pressure decreased only in the almond group. In other studies conducted by Spiller <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Jenkins <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and Wien <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] blood pressure did not change.</p><p>This study is not without limitations. Participants in our study were females; therefore, our results may not be generalized to males. In addition, it is possible that errors may have occurred in the participant's self-reported dietary intake. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate theories on the effects of almonds on weight-loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The balanced hypocaloric AED in comparison to the balanced hypocaloric NFD led to a greater weight-loss and better improvements in the studied cardiovascular disease risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>ZA carried out the design and all the experiments and prepared the manuscript.
