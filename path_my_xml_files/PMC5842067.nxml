&#x02002;Although new image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) technologies such as blue laser imaging (BLI), BLI-bright, and linked color imaging (LCI) have been developed, their utility for the detection of sessile serrated adenoma/polyps (SSA/Ps) is still unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the utility of BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI for SSA/P detection in still image examinations and in a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT).
</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>
&#x02002;A group of 6 expert and non-expert endoscopists read 200 endoscopic still images containing SSA/P lesions using white light image (WLI), BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI. Color differences were calculated using the color space method. A prospective RCT of tandem colonoscopy with WLI and LCI was performed. Patients with SSA/P and those with a history of SSA/P that had been endoscopically removed were enrolled and randomly allocated to WLI-LCI or LCI-WLI groups. Additional endoscopic detection rates for SSA/P were compared between the 2 groups.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>
&#x02002;LCI showed the highest SSA/P detection rate among the 4 modes for both expert and non-expert endoscopists. The detection rate with LCI for the 6 expert endoscopists (mean 98.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation 2.0&#x0200a;%) was significantly higher than that with WLI (86.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.0&#x0200a;%,
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01). Likewise, the detection rate with LCI for the 6 non-expert endoscopists (92.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;2.9&#x0200a;%) was significantly higher than that with WLI (72.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;11.5&#x0200a;%,
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01). The color difference of SSA/P with LCI was the highest among the 4 modes, and was significantly higher than with WLI (median 15.9, (interquartile range 13.7&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;20.6) vs. 10.2, (7.6&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;14.2);
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.0001). In the RCT, a total of 44 patients (WLI-LCI 22 vs. LCI-WLI 22) underwent colonoscopy. The additional detection rate for SSA/P in the second inspection in the WLI-LCI group (21.6&#x000a0;%, 8/37) was significantly higher than in the LCI-WLI group (3.2&#x0200a;%, 1/31;
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). The small, flat, non-mucus and isochromatic SSA/Ps in the transverse colon were detected more frequently in the second inspection with LCI.
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>
&#x02002;LCI was the most sensitive mode for SSA/P detection among WLI, BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI in the still image examinations. Our RCT strongly suggests that LCI is superior to conventional WLI for SSA/P detection during colonoscopy. UMIN000017599.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is 1 of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide
<xref rid="JR986-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
. Endoscopic surveillance for pre-malignant polyps in the colorectum is an important strategy for reducing CRC-related mortality. Evidence has accumulated showing that endoscopic resection of adenoma reduces the development of CRCs
<xref rid="JR986-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
. However, several reports indicate that 25&#x0200a;% to 28&#x0200a;% of colorectal polyps are missed in colonoscopic examinations
<xref rid="JR986-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
. In particular, colorectal polyps in the right-side colon are likely to be overlooked in colonoscopy
<xref rid="JR986-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
. In fact, many interval cancers have been reported, some of which were already at advanced or unresectable stages. Thus, overlooking pre-malignant or malignant lesions in colonoscopy remains a significant problem.
</p><p>
Recently, the serrated polyp-cancer sequence has received considerable attention. According to WHO criteria, serrated polyps are classified into 3 categories: hyperplastic polyp (HP), traditional serrated adenoma (TSA), and sessile serrated adenoma/polyp (SSA/P)
<xref rid="BR986-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
. Of these, SSA/P predominantly occurs in the right-side colon accompanied with B-RAF mutation and hypermethylation, and is considered to be a precursor lesion of microsatellite instability positive CRCs
<xref rid="JR986-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
. However, it is often difficult to detect SSA/P with conventional colonoscopy because the form of this lesion is typically flat and the color is similar to the background mucosa or more faded
<xref rid="JR986-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
. Studies have shown that SSA/P is often overlooked and that it accounts for a significant proportion of interval cancers
<xref rid="JR986-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
. Thus, it is important to improve diagnostic detection sensitivity for SSA/P lesions. Image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) technologies including narrow-band imaging (NBI), blue laser imaging (BLI), and BLI-bright have been newly developed
<xref rid="JR986-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
. A more recently developed IEE technology, linked color imaging (LCI), enhances reddish hues, which makes red areas appear redder and white areas appear whiter
<xref rid="JR986-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
. Dohi and associates reported that LCI could identify acute H. pylori infection by enhancing the redness of the fundic gland mucosa
<xref rid="JR986-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
. Moreover, Sun and associates reported that LCI had higher diagnostic accuracy for gastrointestinal lesions including gastric cancers and colorectal cancers compared with BLI and white light (WLI)
<xref rid="JR986-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
. Therefore, it is expected that these technologies may improve the ability to diagnose SSA/Ps. Only 2 randomized trials have investigated the utility of NBI for the diagnosis of SSA/P
<xref rid="JR986-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
. However, neither of these trials showed improvement in the rate of detection for SSA/P (serrated lesions) during colonoscopy. Moreover, recent clinical trials showed that BLI and LCI improved the detection of colorectal polyps and adenomas
<xref rid="JR986-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
. However, no clinical studies focusing on SSA/P detection with BLI, BLI-bright, or LCI have been reported to date. Therefore, in this study, we first tested the SSA/P detection ability of WLI, BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI by having endoscopists read multiple still images from each mode. Since LCI ultimately showed the highest detection rate for SSA/P among these modes, we next performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial of tandem colonoscopy with WLI-LCI and LCI-WLI to investigate the superiority of LCI to WLI for detection of SSA/P.

All examinations were carried out using a LASEREO laser endoscope system (Fujifilm Co., Tokyo,
Japan) consisting of high-resolution colonoscopes (EC-L590ZW and EC-L600ZP), a light source
(LL-4450), and a video processor (VP-4450HD). This system utilizes a semiconductor laser as the
light source and has narrow-band light functions, which can produce 4 types of imaging including
WLI, BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI

<xref rid="JR986-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR986-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
. BLI is performed with a
combination of strong laser light at a wavelength of 410&#x0200a;nm and weak laser light at a wavelength
of 450&#x0200a;nm. BLI-bright is set by controlling the power of the 2 lasers and an appropriate
combination of WLI and BLI. LCI is a novel image-enhancement technology based on images captured
under conditions similar to those of BLI-bright

Fifty sets of images of SSA/P that were histologically proven were used. 6 expert and 6 non-expert endoscopists in Tokushima University Hospital, who had not been committed to photographing SSA/P still images, randomly examined a total of 200 still images (50 sets for each mode) that include SSA/P lesions. We defined an expert as an endoscopist who had performed more than 5,000 colonoscopies and 300 withdrawal colonoscopies with LCI, and a non-expert as an endoscopist with less than 5,000 colonoscopies and 10 to 30 withdrawal colonoscopies with LCI. The rate of correctly detecting the SSA/P lesion (detection rate) in each imaging mode was evaluated. In order to evaluate detectability, each image was scored on a 4-point scale; 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;easily detectable; 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;reasonably detectable, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;barely detectable, and 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;undetectable. Individual image scores for each mode were then added to determine the detectability score. The kappa value was used to calculate the interobserver agreement in each mode.</p></sec><sec><title>Color difference</title><p>

</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial participants</title><p>All patients were recruited at Tokushima University Hospital. For inclusion, patients were required to have had SSA/P or a history of endoscopic resection of SSA/P that had been proven histologically. Patients receiving anticoagulant therapy or having a history of surgical resection of the right colon and inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. All patients gave written informed consent for examination and treatment before the procedures.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design of clinical trial</title><p>The prospective randomized controlled trial of tandem colonoscopy was performed at Tokushima University Hospital. Patients underwent modified back-to-back colonoscopies with WLI and LCI. Patients were randomly allocated to 1 of the 2 arms at a 1:1 ratio using a sealed envelope method: (1) WLI-LCI group: first inspection with WLI followed by a second inspection with LCI; (2) LCI-WLI group: first inspection with LCI followed by a second inspection with WLI. The protocol for this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Tokushima University Hospital. The study was registered at the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000017599).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>Colonoscopy was performed with patients under conscious sedation with midazolam. After reaching the ileocecal region, in the WLI-LCI group, the colonoscope was withdrawn from the cecum to splenic flexure and reinserted into the cecum under WLI, and then withdrawn again to the splenic flexure and reinserted into the cecum under LCI. In the LCI-WLI group, the colonoscope was withdrawn from the cecum to the splenic flexure and reinserted into the cecum under LCI, and then withdrawn again to the splenic flexure and reinserted into the cecum under WLI. Colonic mucosa was observed both backward and forward between the cecum and splenic flexure in each mode. Polyps detected during the first inspection were removed by snare or biopsied. Polyps detected during the second inspection were classified as additional polyps, and they were also removed by snare or biopsied.</p><p>
For all polyps, the number, location, size, and morphology were recorded. The total time during both examinations, excluding the diagnostic time, as well as the polypectomy time and biopsy time were recorded using a stop watch. The quality of bowel preparation was assessed by modified Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS)

, which includes a 4-point scoring system (0&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;3) applied to each of the 2 segments of the right colon (ascending and transverse). Patients were excluded in cases of poor bowel preparation (mBBPS score&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;4 or 1 segment score&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;2). All procedures were performed by 5 endoscopists who had previously performed more than 1,000 colonoscopies and had at least 6 months of prior training performing observations with each of the 4 imaging modes.
</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the study was the additional SSA/P detection rate for WLI-LCI (second inspection with LCI) and LCI-WLI (second inspection with WLI). The secondary outcomes were the positive detection rate per subject for additional SSA/P lesions in the second inspection and the morphological features of additionally detected SSA/Ps.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>In our previous pilot study, the additional detection rates for SSA/P in LCI-WLI and WLI-LCI groups were 6.3&#x0200a;% (1/16) and 33&#x000a0;% (5/15), respectively. To detect a difference between the 2 groups with a power of 80&#x0200a;% and &#x003b1;-error of 5&#x0200a;%, the sample size needed was calculated to be 66 SSA/Ps. Since the patients with SSA/P had had an average number of 1.7 SSA/Ps in our hospital, we planned to enroll 43 patients considering an expected 10&#x0200a;% dropout rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The detection rate and detectability score for SSA/Ps were compared between the WLI group and the BLI, BLI-bright, or LCI group using Dunnett&#x002bc;s test.

To investigate the value of BLI, BLI-bright, and LCI for diagnosis of SSA/P, we first determined the detection rate for SSA/P among expert and non-expert endoscopists using 200 still pictures taken under each IEE mode (
<xref rid="TB986-1" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;1</xref>
). The detection rate of SSA/P with LCI (mean 98.3&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviation (SD) 2.0&#x0200a;%) was significantly higher than that with WLI (86.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.0&#x0200a;%;
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01) for expert endoscopists. Conversely, the detection rate with BLI was significantly lower than with WLI (71.0&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;5.2&#x0200a;% vs. 86.7&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.0;

<xref rid="TB986-4" ref-type="table">Table&#x0200a;4</xref>
). The rates of SSA/Ps smaller than 10&#x0200a;mm, flat SSA/Ps, SSA/Ps without mucus, and isochromatic SSA/Ps were higher in the second inspection than in the first inspection, although the differences were not statistically significant between the 2 groups. In terms of the location of SSA/P lesions, interestingly, the frequency of SSA/Ps in the transverse colon was significantly higher in the second inspection than in the first inspection (

Moreover, this result was objectively supported by evaluating color differences between SSA/P and background mucosa; the average color difference was by far the highest in LCI mode. In addition, in the subsequent randomized controlled trial, we clearly showed that LCI is superior to conventional WLI with a significantly greater ability to detect SSA/P during colonoscopy. These results strongly suggest that endoscopic observation utilizing LCI mode improves the detection and diagnosis of SSA/Ps that may sometimes be overlooked with conventional WLI observation. Until now, no prospective study has investigated the utility of LCI for the detection of SSA/Ps. This is the first study to demonstrate the value of LCI for detecting SSA/P. 1 of this study&#x02019;s strengths is that it employed 2 different analyses (i.&#x0200a;e., still image analysis with color difference evaluation and a subsequent randomized clinical trial), which provided compatible results.</p><p>
In the analysis of still images, the detection rates for SSA/P in conventional WLI mode were 86.7&#x0200a;% among expert endoscopists and 72.7&#x0200a;% among non-expert endoscopists; a 14.0&#x0200a;% difference between the 2 groups. With LCI, the rates were 11.6&#x0200a;% and 19.6&#x0200a;% higher among expert and non-expert endoscopists, respectively. Thus, while both groups of endoscopists received significant benefit from LCI, the benefit was even greater for non-expert endoscopists. Moreover, BLI-bright also increased the detection rates for non-experts by 14.0&#x0200a;% but did not have an impact on the rates for experts. Similar results were obtained in the analysis of detectability scores for experts and non-experts. It is possible that expert endoscopists did not receive any benefit from BLI-bright because their rate of SSA/P detection with WLI (86.7&#x0200a;%) was fairly high compared with non-experts (72.7&#x0200a;%). Moreover, expert endoscopists might be more skilled in detecting SSA/P by utilizing other factors such as morphology, presence of mucus cap, etc. Furthermore, the color difference with LCI (median 15.9, IQR 13.7&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;20.6) was much higher, and the difference with BLI-bright (11.9, 8.6&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;15.1) was slightly higher, as compared with those for WLI (10.2, 7.6&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;14.2) and BLI (10.7, 7.8&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;15.0). These results for color difference also support the results obtained with respect to high detection rates and high detectability scores with LCI. Moreover, our results are also supported by a recent study indicating that visibility scores for colorectal nongranular flat lesions in LCI still images were higher than those in WLI still images

.
</p><p>
Our randomized controlled trial showed that the rate of additional detection of SSA/P in the WLI-LCI group (21.6&#x0200a;%) was significantly higher than that in LCI-WLI group (3.2&#x0200a;%,
<italic>P</italic>
&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.02). This indicates that our trial met the primary endpoint, which was to demonstrate superiority of LCI to WLI for SSA/P detection. In this trial, HP and adenomas were also additionally detected in the second inspection for the WLI-LCI and LCI-WLI groups. The rates of additional detection of HP and adenomas in the WLI-LCI group were also higher than in the LCI-WLI group.&#x0200a;Since these polyps are easily detectable due to their protruding morphology, detection by WLI may be sufficient
<xref rid="JR986-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
. The value of LCI for the detection of these polyps should be further investigated.
</p><p>
The analysis of features of additionally detected SSA/P in the second inspection with LCI revealed that the SSA/Ps with a small diameter (&#x0003c;&#x0200a;10&#x0200a;mm), with flat shape, without a mucus cap, and with the same color were more frequently detected despite the lack of a statistically significant difference. This result is quite reasonable and also consistent with previous reports that the presence of a mucus cap is an important finding for SSA/P detection
<xref rid="JR986-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
. Moreover, SSA/P lesions detected in the second inspection with LCI were predominantly located in the transverse colon than in the first inspection with WLI. This result may be partly explained by the fact that the transverse colon is not fixed to the retroperitoneum like the sigmoid colon, and therefore, lesions in the transverse colon are sometimes difficult to visualize squarely. In fact, it is reported that polyps in the transverse colon and sigmoid colon are most likely to be missed during colonoscopy
<xref rid="JR986-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
. These results suggested that SSA/P lesions in the transverse colon, particularly when small, flat, mucus cap-free, and of the same color are likely to be overlooked during colonoscopy with WLI.
</p><p>Limitations of this study are that the clinical trial was performed at a single institution and the number of enrolled patients was relatively small. Another limitation is that our trial recruited only patients with SSA/P and a history of endoscopic resection of SSA/P. Therefore, a multicenter, larger-scale trial recruiting a more general patient population to compare SSA/P detection with LCI and WLI could strengthen our results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our still image examinations suggested that LCI is the most sensitive mode for SSA/P detection during colonoscopy as compared with WLI, BLI, and BLI-bright modes. RCT data demonstrated that the rate of additional detection of SSA/P with WLI-LCI was significantly higher than with LCI-WLI. Thus, our data strongly suggest that LCI enhances the detection of SSA/P in colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary methods</title><sec><title>Calculation of color difference</title><p>
Color differences (&#x02206;E) between SSA/P lesions and background mucosae were calculated according to the color space method specified by Commission internationale de l'&#x000e9;clairage (CIE) in 1976
<xref rid="JR986-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
. The color of an arbitrary point is defined by a dark-light value (L* axis), red-green value (a* axis), and yellow-blue value (b* axis) in a 3-dimensional color space. The &#x02206;E*ab between color 1 (L*1,a*1,b*1) and color 2 (L*2,a*2,b*2) was calculated according to the following formula;

Each ROI was set roughly in the same regions in all 4 detection modes, sheering away foreign substances and halation. All ROIs were set by an expert endoscopist (N.M.). The color space (CIE L*, a*, b*) in each ROI of SSA/P and background mucosa was determined, and the &#x02206;E was calculated using the mean value of the color space (CIE L*, a*, b*) in 4 ROIs.</p></sec><sec><title>Bowel cleansing for colonoscopy</title><p>On the day prior to colonoscopy, patients received 24 mg sennoside (Pursennid; Novartis Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) as preparatory medication.
