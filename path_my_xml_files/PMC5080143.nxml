shoulder pain in office workers. [Subjects and Methods] Subjects included 38 office
workers who were randomly divided into two groups: a manual therapy group of 19 subjects
and a shoulder stabilization exercise group of 19 subjects. All subjects underwent
evaluation of the pressure pain threshold in the splenius capitis and upper, middle, and
lower trapezius muscles on both sides. The manual therapy used in the study was designed
to include soft-tissue mobilization, prone thoracic mobilization, prone selected thoracic
mobilization, cervical mobilization, and thoracic manipulation. Both groups underwent
training of two 40-minute sessions per week for 6 weeks. [Results] After the intervention,
both groups showed significantly increased pressure pain thresholds in the splenius

devices. Approximately 90% of white-collar workers use IT devices for more than 4 hours per
day<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Long-term use of computers can
cause stability muscle (spine erector) dysfunction and increase trapezius muscle activation,
which in turn generates cervical and axillary disorders<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, causing shoulder and cervical pain and a decreased pain
threshold<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For normal alignment and movement, the cervical spine and head cooperatively use a
combination of flexors (60%) and extensors (40%)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Flexion of the spine for extended periods, such as while using IT
devices, weakens the flexors and the serratus anterior, rhomboid, middle trapezius, and
lower trapezius muscles because of inhibition. On the other hand, the trapezius, levator
scapulae, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, and pectoral muscles shorten because of
facilitation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Shortened muscles move
faster than antagonists, causing upward rotation, protrusion, scapular elevation, and
forward head postures<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hyperactivity of the upper trapezius muscle results in decreased control of the lower
trapezius and serratus anterior muscles and is a cause of shoulder pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Instability of the scapular muscle and abnormal motion are
the primary causes of impact syndrome. To prevent this syndrome, recovery of scapular
stability and mobility is important<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Maintaining a fixed posture long-term can cause cervical and shoulder pain, which is treated
with therapeutic exercise, manual therapy, biofeedback, stabilization exercise,
electrotherapy, and heat therapy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Stabilization exercise is effective for cervical and shoulder pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Manual therapy is usually applied for cervical pain, low
back pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and myofacial pain syndrome<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, but some researchers have applied it for SCI<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This therapy alters the neurobiological condition and
length of the connective tissue, including autonomic and motor nerves<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, by activating the neural structure, it
controls pain and lengthens connective tissues, thereby increasing range of motion. Muscles
and connective tissues affect joint form and movement, determine the kinetics of
fibrocartilage tissue, and cause limited arthrokinematics by inducing resistance of the
ligament, articular capsule, and fascia to the tension and shear force<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Manual therapy can lengthen connective tissues, thereby
increasing movement and controlling pain. The purpose of this study was to determine the
analgesic effects of soft-tissue mobilization, thoracic and cervical mobilization, and
thoracic manipulation in office workers with shoulder and cervical pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects included in this study were 38 office workers (19 males and 19 females) who were
diagnosed with cervical and shoulder pain and were receiving physical therapy at Seoul H
Hospital. The selection criteria were: office workers aged 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;years who had shoulder pain
(visual analog scale score of &#x0003e;5) and who used IT devices for &#x0003e;8 hours per day. The
exclusion criteria were chest pain, dizziness, blood pressure of &#x0003e;160/110 mmHg, and the
inability to perform the exercise postures needed, such as the push-up posture. In order to
decrease bias, the subjects were randomly divided into a shoulder stabilization exercise
group (19 subjects) and a manual therapy group (19 subjects). The general characteristics of
the subjects in the experimental group were as follows: 19 office workers (6 males and 13
females), mean age of 36.16 &#x000b1; 5.53&#x02005;years, mean height of 168.00 &#x000b1; 8.10&#x02005;cm, and mean weight
of 57.79 &#x000b1; 11.34&#x02005;kg. Meanwhile, the general characteristics of the subjects in the manual
therapy group were as follows: 19 office workers (6 males and 13 females), mean age of 35.79
&#x000b1; 4.10&#x02005;years, mean height of 167.16 &#x000b1; 7.33&#x02005;cm, and mean weight of 60.16 &#x000b1; 14.23&#x02005;kg. No
significant differences were found between the groups for general characteristics.</p><p>The pressure pain threshold (PPT) in the splenius capitis, upper trapezius, middle
trapezius, and lower trapezius muscles was measured on both sides for all subjects. Manual
therapy and stabilization exercises for the shoulder were performed in two 40-minute
sessions per week for 6 weeks. The present study was approved by Sahmyook University
Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2015-014) and the objective of the study and its
requirements were explained to the subjects, and all participants provided written parental
consent; thus, the rights of human subjects were protected.</p><p>For manual therapy, soft-tissue mobilization was applied for 3 minutes on the upper
trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, pectoral, cervical deep
flexor, serratus anterior, rhomboid, and middle and upper trapezius muscles. Prone thoracic
mobilization, prone selected thoracic mobilization, cervical mobilization, and thoracic
manipulation were also applied.</p><p>Stabilization exercises for the shoulder joint were designed to correct abnormal scapular
location<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, such as by stretching
shortened muscles, including the upper trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital,
sternocleidomastoid, and pectoral muscles. Modified exercise programs developed by Verstegen
and Williams<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> and Arolta et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> were used to enhance and increase the
stability of the deep cervical flexor, serratus anterior, middle and lower trapezius, and
rhomboid muscles. The detailed procedure of the exercise program is as follows:</p><p>Stage 1: Stretching of the upper trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital,
sternocleidomastoid, and pectoral muscles and isometric contraction of the deep cervical
muscles were performed. The following postures were used: knee push-up, prone row, modified
prone cobra, cow posture, cat posture, cat postures for thoracic mobilization, dead bug, and
flank. Each exercise was performed for 10 seconds per session in 10 sets.</p><p>Stage 2: Deep cervical flexor isometric contraction exercises, supine row, flank, Y
exercise, supine pull, modified cobra posture, thoracic mobilization, and the dead bug
posture on a foam roller were performed, each for 10 seconds per session in 10 sets.</p><p>The PPT was used to assess the patients&#x02019; shoulder joint pain using the Wagner Force Ten
Digital Force Gauge (Model: FPX 25, 2010) in the splenius capitis and upper, middle, and
lower trapezius muscles while the subject was in the neutral prone position. Trigger points
were located in the bottom of the mastoid (splenius capitis), the middle of the spinous
process of the C7 vertebra and the acromion process (upper trapezius), between the scapular
spinae and spinous process at the same level (middle trapezius), and the middle of the
inferior angle of the scapula and the spinous process at the same level (lower trapezius).
The PPT meter was placed vertically on the skin&#x02019;s surface, and the subjects were instructed
to use a vocal signal when the pressure became painful. PPT was measured
in&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The pressure pain meter quantifies pain according to an accurate
trigger point for pain and the pressure sensitivity of the muscle. Therefore, the pressure
point is put into good use in the management of myofascial pain syndrome<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reported intra-rater reliability for
PPT was <italic>r</italic>=0.85, and the inter-rater reliability for PPT was
<italic>r</italic>=0.85<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
study, we used the mean value of three measurements taken at 30-second intervals.</p><p>SPSS 18.0 was used for statistical analyses. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine
the patients&#x02019; general characteristics and subject-related variables. The paired t-test was
used to compare pre- and post-test results within each group, and the independent t-test was
used to compare the two groups before and after training. P values&#x0003c;0.05 were considered
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in shoulder pain after the interventions are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

is activated to compensate, which increases scapular elevation. Therefore, stress in the
upper trapezius muscle at the cervical level is increased<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle activation of the upper trapezius muscle is increased,
which in turn increases pain in the cervical spine and shoulder<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study focused on the effects of manual therapy and shoulder stabilization exercise on
cervical pain in office workers. Both shoulder stabilization exercise and manual therapy
considerably increased PPT in the left and right splenius capitis and upper, lower, and
middle trapezius muscles (p&#x0003c;0.05) compared to that before the intervention. The left and
right splenius capitis, left upper trapezius, left and right middle trapezius, and right
lower trapezius muscles showed significant changes. The shoulder stabilization exercises
stretched the upper trapezius, levator scapulae, suboccipital, sternocleidomastoid, and
pectoralis major and minor muscles, which are shortened by active muscle training in the
process of strengthening the deep cervical flexor, serratus anterior, and middle and lower
trapezius muscles. Rhomboid shoulder joint stabilization increases, reducing muscle pain.
Moreover, active muscle contraction is suspected to increase muscle activation and thereby
sustains sensitivity to pain. This result was also reported in a previous study by LIuch et
al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> that used both passive and active
shoulder stabilization exercise. They evaluated pain using a numerical rating scale and the
PPT. Active shoulder exercise decreased the numerical rating scale score from 6.9 to 3.7. On
the other hand, passive shoulder exercise slightly decreased the score from 6.9 to 5.9.
Active stabilization exercise increased the PPT from 8.7 to 10.1&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>
(p&#x0003c;0.05). Cho et al.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> studied the
effect of shoulder stabilization exercises in middle-aged women and found that they
increased the women&#x02019;s ranges of motion and muscle strength.</p><p>Recently, Baker et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> applied typical
massage and soft-tissue massage as manual therapy in women aged 25&#x02013;45&#x02005;years who complained
of cervical pain lasting 3&#x02013;6 months and evaluated PPT in the sternocleidomastoid on both
sides. The typical massage considerably increased the PPT in the right sternocleidomastoid
from 14.72 to 15.73&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> and in the left sternocleidomastoid from 14.44 to
15.81&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Soft-tissue massage largely increased the threshold in the right
sternocleidomastoid from 13.16 to 13.76&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup> and in the left
sternocleidomastoid from 13.52 to 14.64&#x02005;kg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Thus, that study reported a
considerable difference between the two groups, similar to the results in our study.</p><p>As previously noted, manual therapy in our study was performed in two 40-minute sessions
per week for 6 weeks. The program consisted of soft-tissue mobilization, prone thoracic
mobilization, prone selected thoracic mobilization, cervical mobilization, and thoracic
manipulation. This manual therapy program is thought to be effective for tissue healing by
increasing blood flow. Passively performed manual therapy is considered to decrease
sensitivity to pain by applying pressure on muscles and decreasing muscle activity.
Therefore, applying manual therapy induces a neurobiological phenomenon and changes the
lengths of connective tissues, including autonomic and motor neurons<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Continuous manual therapy provides an analgesic effect
resulting from neural structure activation and increased range of motion from connective
tissue lengthening<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Gerr</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Marcus</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Monteilh</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Epidemiology of musculoskeletal disorders among computer
