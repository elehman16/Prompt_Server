With aging <italic>Dhatus</italic> undergo <italic>Kshaya</italic> (degeneration), thus leading to <italic>Vata Prakopa</italic> and making individual prone to <italic>Sandhivata</italic> (OA). It is the most common articular disorder which begins asymptomatically in the second and third decades and is extremely common by age of 70 years.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Almost all persons by age of 40 have some pathological changes in weight-bearing joint. Twenty-five percent females and 16% males have symptomatic OA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Till the age of 55, it occurs equally in both sexes; after 55, the incidence is higher in women. In modern medicine mainly analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs, and surgery are the options for the treatment of OA.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Although these treatment measures provide remarkable recovery, the patients have to take it lifelong causing adverse effects. Knee joint replacement is costly and even after surgery; the patient has to continue analgesics for a long time. <italic>Agnikarma</italic> is therapeutic thermal cauterization described in detail by <italic>Acharya Sushruta</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various materials can be used for performing <italic>Agnikarma;</italic> however, in this study, <italic>Panchadhatu Shalaka</italic> innovated by Prof. P.

The demographic data reveals that maximum numbers of patients (67.65%) were found in between 56 and 70 years age group. OA is degenerative arthritis and has a slow progressive degeneration process which becomes symptomatic after 50 years. 50% of the regular patients in this study were laborer which signifies that wear and tear to major joints occur due to excessive repetitive stress/load and later develops into OA. 50% patients were taking <italic>Vishamashana</italic> which leads to <italic>Vata Vriddhi</italic> and in turn impairs the <italic>Agni</italic>. 64.7% patients were accustomed to <italic>Atiruksha Ahara</italic> which causes <italic>Vata Dosha Vriddhi</italic> thereby <italic>Asthi</italic> and <italic>Sandhi</italic> (<italic>Ashraya</italic> of <italic>Vata</italic>) becomes vitiated and <italic>Sandhivata</italic> develops.

In 64.71% patients, OA was affected bilaterally as knee joint is weight-bearing joint which signifies that wear and tear affects both the joint equally.</p><p>Among chief complaints, <italic>Sandhishula</italic> (knee joint pain) was present in all the patients. In mild cases of OA, the joint pain may be due to the inflammation of the synovium or capsule, stretching of the ligaments, or muscle spasm. In some cases, it may be due to stretching of nerve endings in the periosteum covering osteophytes. In 94.11% patients, <italic>Sandhisphutana</italic> (crepitus on moving the joint) was observed that indicates the <italic>Vata Prakopa</italic> and crackling sensation likely occurs due to roughening of surfaces inside the joint. <italic>Sparshaasahyata</italic> (tenderness) was found in 91.17% patient's, and <italic>Akunchana Prasarana Vedana</italic> (difficulty in joint movements) was reported in 67.64% of patients occurs due to aggravation of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> and <italic>Kapha Kshaya.</italic> The pain and restriction during flexion and extension may be due to osteophytes or due to chronic synovitis and thickening of the joint capsule. <italic>Sandhigraha</italic> was seen in 61.76% patients, and <italic>Sandhishotha</italic> was observed in 61.64% patients. <italic>Shita Guna Vriddhi</italic> of <italic>Vayu</italic> can cause <italic>Sandhigraha</italic> (stiffness). The stiffness of the knee in patients with initial stages of OA is due to pain and muscle spasm. In patients with late OA, stiffness develops due to capsular contracture and incongruity of the joint surfaces. <italic>Sandhishotha</italic> (swelling) indicates that OA was advanced in these cases because swelling is a late feature. It occurs due to the effusion caused by inflammation of the synovial tissues. <italic>Sandhishotha</italic> as is an associate symptom in OA. The number of <italic>Bindu</italic> to be applied for <italic>Agnikarma</italic> is not fixed; it depends on the severity of pain of knee joint. Hence, 10&#x02013;30 <italic>Bindu</italic> type of <italic>Agnikarma</italic> was performed in this study and there was no correlation of number of <italic>Bindu</italic> and relief in sign and symptoms.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>In <italic>Sandhishula</italic>, 86% relief was found in Group A whereas 77.78% relief was obtained in Group B. <italic>Sparshaasahyata</italic> was reduced by 69% in Group A while 87.78% in Group B. 39% improvement was seen in <italic>Sandhisphutana</italic> in Group A while 46.67% relief was found in Group B.

In patients of Group B, relief in swelling was found to be 3.55% at mid-patella, 3.26% at two inch above mid-patella, and 2.73% at two inch below mid-patella, which was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). In OA, chronic and low-grade inflammation always exists. Joint swelling can be bony or soft-tissue swelling, and it may be due to synovitis, effusion, or bony hypertrophy. Synovial effusion, if present, is usually not large. OA can be divided into four stages, and swelling develops only in 3<sup>rd</sup> stage, in which there is gross osteoarthritic changes. Comparison between Group A and Group B did not show significant difference in percentage relief of knee joint swelling at all sites. Clinically also during the assessment at weekly interval, relief in swelling was almost similar in both groups.</p><p>The ROMs of knee joint that is flexion and extension was assessed using goniometer and measured in degrees.
