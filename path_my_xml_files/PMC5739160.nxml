Surgical resection in patients with non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may be associated with significant morbidity, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life. <italic>Objectives</italic>. The safety and feasibility of a preoperative and early postoperative rehabilitation program in patients operated for NSCLC was determined in a nonhospital setting, with focus on high-intensity interval exercise. <italic>Methods</italic>. Forty patients with biopsy-proven NSCLC stages I to IIIa referred for surgical resection at the Department of Cardiothoracic Surgery RT, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups (3 intervention groups and 1 control group). The preoperative intervention consisted of a home-based exercise program, while the postoperative exercise program comprised a supervised group exercise program involving resistance and high-intensity interval cardiorespiratory exercise 2 hours weekly for 12 weeks combined with individual counseling. The study endpoints were inclusion rate, adherence, and number of adverse events. <italic>Results</italic>. Forty patients (of 124 screened; 32%) were included and randomized into the 4 groups. The postoperative exercise was completed by 73% of the patients randomized to this intervention. No adverse events were observed, indicating that the early postoperative exercise program is safe. The preoperative home-based exercise program was not feasible due to interfering diagnostic procedures and fast-track surgery that left only 1 to 2 weeks between diagnosis and surgery. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. The early postoperative exercise program for patients with NSCLC was safe and feasible, but in a fast-track set up, a preoperative home-based exercise program was not feasible for this population.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>lung cancer</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>NSCLC</kwd><kwd>perioperative intervention</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735416635741"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the most common cancers, lung cancer has the highest mortality rate of cancer worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416635741" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Most cases are non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

Early, supervised, group-based high-intensity interval exercise is both safe and feasible. In the study setting, the preoperative home-based exercise was not feasible due to low recruitment rate and the short time interval between referral and surgery.

To ensure a higher inclusion rate, the preoperative exercise intervention has been omitted.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, suthorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was supported by grants from the Center for Intregrated Rehabilitation of Cancer Patients (CIRE), which was established by and receives support from the Danich Cancer Society and the Novo Nordisk Foundation.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-1534735416635741"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
