Interventions to support patients to effectively self-manage their condition have the potential to reduce the risk of costly and debilitating complications. The utilisation of mobile phones to deliver self-management support allows for patient-centred care at the frequency and intensity that patients desire from outside the clinic environment. Self-Management Support for Blood Glucose (SMS4BG) is a novel text message-based intervention for supporting people with diabetes to improve self-management behaviours and achieve better glycaemic control and is tailored to individual patient preferences, demographics, clinical characteristics, and culture. This study aims to assess whether SMS4BG can improve glycaemic control in adults with poorly controlled diabetes. This paper outlines the rationale and methods of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial will be conducted across New Zealand health districts. One thousand participants will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive SMS4BG, a theoretically based and individually tailored automated text message-based diabetes self-management support programme (intervention) in addition to usual care, or usual care alone (control). The primary outcome is change in glycaemic control (HbA1c) at 9&#x000a0;months. Secondary outcomes include glycaemic control at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months, self-efficacy, self-care behaviours, diabetes distress, health-related quality of life, perceived social support, and illness perceptions. Cost information and healthcare utilisation will also be collected as well as intervention satisfaction and interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide information on the effectiveness of a text message-based self-management support tool for people with diabetes. If found to be effective it has the potential to provide individualised support to people with diabetes across New Zealand (and internationally), thus extending care outside the clinic environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=367369">ACTRN12614001232628</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1305-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mHealth</kwd><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>Text message</kwd><kwd>Mobile phone</kwd><kwd>SMS</kwd><kwd>Self-management</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001505</institution-id><institution>Health Research Council of New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14/724</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whittaker</surname><given-names>Robyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001504</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Health, New Zealand</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Addressing increasing diabetes prevalence, its associated morbidity and health inequalities, is a current priority in New Zealand and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

Good diabetes self-management, including glucose monitoring, engaging in health behaviours, insulin administration, and healthcare provider contact, is associated with improved glycaemic control, and even small improvements in glycaemic control are associated with reduction in costly and debilitating long-term complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Mobile phones are ubiquitous, with increasing ownership and use across hard-to-reach populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Text message (short message service, SMS) volumes have remained high over recent years with nearly 14 billion SMS messages sent in New Zealand in the year ending June 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Mobile health (mHealth) is the use of mobile devices, including mobile phones, to deliver health services and information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Mobile phones have been used effectively to support healthy behaviour change and disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and offer an ideal way of providing patient-centred care at the frequency and intensity that patients desire. In addition there is potential for mobile phones to provide an effective way of providing support to patients in rural and remote areas where healthcare provider contact may be less accessible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of mobile phones in the management of diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], with previous studies showing positive impacts on glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], patient satisfaction with healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and self-management behaviours, e.g. adherence and blood glucose monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Although promising, many previous studies have lacked sufficient sample sizes, were of insufficient duration, or interventions lacked theoretical grounding. Learnings has identify that for this type of intervention to be successful it needs to be theoretically based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], individually tailored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], and to provide individual choice to increase patients&#x02019; sense of control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>In light of the increasing prevalence of diabetes in New Zealand, as well as increasing mobile phone penetration, we hypothesise that mobile-based tools are important options for self-management support in this population. A mobile phone-based text messaging programme designed to enhance self-management support for people with diabetes (SMS4BG: Self-Management Support for Blood Glucose) has been developed and piloted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Development of the SMS4BG followed the mHealth Development and Evaluation framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], with a focus on implementation, use of behavioural change theory, and engagement of key stakeholders including clinicians and patients. Conceptualisation, formative research and pretesting, including a pilot study, have been previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>SMS4BG was developed by a multidisciplinary team including public health and mHealth experts, psychologists, diabetes nurse specialists, a M&#x00101;ori advisory group, with review and input from diabetes specialists and primary care teams. The intervention is grounded in behaviour change theory to enhance people&#x02019;s self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>], and to promote accurate illness perceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It uses Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for a list of BCTs utilised in SMS4BG) to address the behaviours required for successful self-management and is made up of modules allowing for tailoring to the individual patient. The intervention content is designed to address the seven key self-management behaviours identified by the Association of American Diabetes Educations: (1) healthy eating, (2) being active, (3) monitoring, (4) taking medication, (5) problem solving, (6) reducing risks, and (7) healthy coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In addition the intervention includes versions for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific peoples incorporating concepts and elements specific to these cultures. Involvement of primary and secondary care teams throughout the development attempts to ensure integration into clinical pathways. The pilot study found the programme acceptable, useful, and culturally and age-appropriate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Feedback from the SMS4BG pilot study allowed for further development and refinement of SMS4BG including increasing the duration of the programme based on patient preference, the addition of new modules including a foot care module and a cardiovascular check reminder module, and increased tailoring to incorporate individual motivations and names of support people. While the pilot study yielded positive results, a larger-scale randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the effectiveness of SMS4BG is now required including the effectiveness of SMS4BG in urban, and rural and remote areas. The findings from this RCT will inform the decision on whether to scale up and implement the programme across New Zealand.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p>This study aims to determine the effectiveness of the mHealth diabetes self-management support programme (SMS4BG) in adults with poorly controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes, in addition to their usual diabetes care.

SMS4BG is tailored according to the needs and goals of the patient, their care plan, and demographic factors including ethnicity. As well as core motivational and support messages (available in M&#x00101;ori, Pacific and non-M&#x00101;ori/non-Pacific versions), participants can opt to receive additional modules such as a lifestyle module around healthy eating, physical activity or stress management. Where appropriate to their care, they can also receive reminders to check blood glucose levels, messages around insulin, foot care, managing diabetes as a young adult, and smoking cessation, and also messages encouraging preventive behaviours (e.g. cardiovascular risk assessment). Participants who opt to reply to glucose monitoring reminders, by sending in their blood glucose levels by text message, will be able to view their blood glucose levels graphically over time on a secure website. If at baseline they are identified as not having access to the Internet they will be mailed their graphs on a monthly basis. At registration the intervention group will be able to select the timing of their messages and blood glucose monitoring reminders, and to identify their support people and motivations for diabetes management for incorporation into the messages. The length of the programme will also be tailored to patient preferences from 3 to 9&#x000a0;months, and at 3 and 6&#x000a0;months participants will receive a text message asking if they would like to continue the programme for an additional 3&#x000a0;months and will be given the opportunity to re-select their modules.

The SEDM is an 8-item measure which respondents use to indicate, on a Likert scale from 1 (not at all confident) to 10 (totally confident), how confident they feel that they can carry out the listed tasks regularly at the present time. The score is calculated using the mean of the eight items with higher scores indicating higher self-efficacy.

The SDSCA is a brief self-reported questionnaire which asks respondents 11 items relating to five different domains of diabetes self-management: diet, exercise, blood-glucose monitoring, foot care, and smoking. The SDSCA has been shown to have good validity and reliability in research and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>], with higher scores on the scale indicating greater engagement in self-care behaviours</p></list-item><list-item><p>The presence of <italic>diabetes-related distress</italic> measured by the 2-item Diabetes Distress Scale (DDS2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] at baseline and at 9&#x000a0;months. This 2-item brief diabetes distress screening instrument detects diabetes-specific distress. Respondents indicate, on a 6-point Likert scale, to what degree each item has caused them distress over the past month with higher score indicating higher distress. The DDS2 has been shown to discriminate highly distressed patients from patients with low diabetes distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], with an average item score of 3 or more used as the cut off for high distress</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Cognitive and emotional representations of diabetes</italic> measured by the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] at baseline and at 9&#x000a0;months. The BIPQ is a 9-item self-reported measure which assesses consequences, timeline, personal control, treatment control, identity, concern, emotions, illness comprehensibility, and causes of diabetes. Each item (except causality) is rated using an 11-point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater agreement with the item. The causal representation is assessed via an open-ended item. The BIPQ has been shown to have good reliability and validity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], and has previously been used in a New Zealand diabetes population to assess differences in illness perceptions between Europeans, South Asians and Pacific Islanders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Health-related quality of life</italic> measured by the EuroQol 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] at baseline and at 9-month follow-up. The EQ-5D provides a descriptive profile of health status and a single index value for health status. Five dimensions of health are assessed in the descriptive system: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The respondent indicates under each dimension their health state by choosing the severity level most appropriate to themselves. A lower number indicates a better health status and quality of life. The EQ-5D visual analogue scale allows the respondent to mark, on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state), their health state. There is evidence to support the validity and reliability of the EQ-5D in people with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Perceived social support for diabetes management</italic> measured using a 4-item measure developed for this study at baseline and at 9-month follow-up.

All treatment evaluations will be performed on the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT), using the observed data collected from all randomised participants. Appropriate imputation methods will be applied to the missing data on the primary outcome. No imputation will be considered on other secondary outcomes. A per-protocol analysis may be conducted on the subset of participants who are more compliant with the protocol with pre-defined criteria.</p><p>Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Continuous variables will be summarised as numbers of observed values, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be described as frequency and percentage. Information collected on all primary and secondary outcomes will be first summarised using descriptive statistics at baseline and at 9&#x000a0;months as appropriate. Results will be presented for each of the two treatment groups separately. Linear regression model will be used to test the effect of intervention on the primary outcome between two groups, adjusting for baseline outcome value, health district category, type of diabetes, and ethnicity (i.e. the stratification factors). Model-adjusted means and their difference will be presented with 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals. As pre-planned, the analysis will also be conducted for each health district category separately as stratified, and the consistency of intervention effects will be tested in the main model using an interaction term between treatment group and health district category. A similar approach will be applied to other continuous secondary outcomes. Generalised linear regression models will be applied to categorical outcomes using an appropriate link function (e.g. a logit link for binary distribution).</p><p>Sensitivity analysis may be conducted on the primary outcome if the proportion of missing data is greater than 10&#x000a0;%. Both single and multiple imputations&#x02019; methods may be considered based on different assumptions on the missing data, in order to assess the robustness of treatment evaluation.</p><p>If enough participants are recruited, subgroup analyses by diabetes type and ethnic group will be conducted on the primary outcome and key secondary outcomes, to test possible interactions with the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the protocol for the SMS4BG trial to evaluate a text message-based diabetes self-management support programme compared with usual care. This type of intervention can provide tailored support between clinic visits for people with poorly controlled diabetes. This protocol builds on previous evidence for the role of mHealth in people with diabetes. The SMS4BG study has been designed to address limitations of previous diabetes text message studies. The intervention, developed by a multidisciplinary team, is comprehensive in design, individually tailored, and theoretically grounded, and the study design will allow for accurate assessment of the impact of this type of intention.</p><p>Findings from the pilot study of SMS4BG show that this type of intervention is acceptable and perceived as useful by people with diabetes in New Zealand although the effectiveness must be proven in a rigorously conducted trial. If found to be effective, SMS4BG has the potential to be implemented into health services across New Zealand and the potential to be adapted for other populations.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting: participants are currently being recruited and enrolled.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec14"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1305_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>List of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCT) utilised in SMS4BG by grouping (BCT Taxonomy v1).
