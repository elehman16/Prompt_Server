There is clear evidence that antenatal corticosteroids, both dexamethasone and betamethasone, given to women at risk of preterm birth substantially improve short-term neonatal health, increase the chance of the baby being discharged home alive, and reduce childhood neurosensory disability, remaining safe into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The type of antenatal corticosteroid to use in clinical practice remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Dexamethasone and betamethasone are both recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and widely used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Is dexamethasone better than betamethasone, or vice versa? Our meta-analysis, using the limited data available from randomised trials that have directly compared the two treatments shows that dexamethasone reduces the risk of the baby developing intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) to a greater extent than betamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. While reduced IVH is a very important outcome, achieving a reduction in long-term survival free of any disability is the most important goal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Data regarding the effects on long-term health are sparse.</p><sec><title>Preterm birth and antenatal corticosteroids</title><p>One of the major advances in maternal fetal medicine over the last 35 years has been the evaluation and implementation into clinical practice of administration of antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Corticosteroids remain the &#x02018;gold standard&#x02019; antenatal intervention to reduce the risk of fetal and neonatal mortality related to preterm birth.</p><p>Meta-analysis of the 21 randomised trials (14 using betamethasone, six using dexamethasone, one unknown, using a wide range of different treatment regimens, in 3885 women and 4269 infants) included in the Cochrane Systematic Review &#x0201c;Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] shows that, compared with placebo, both dexamethasone and betamethasone have large and clinically substantial beneficial effects compared with controls on the risk of fetal and neonatal death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and long-term neurological sequelae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thirty years after antenatal betamethasone treatment, health outcomes are generally good, apart from indirect evidence of possible mild insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but there have been no follow-up studies of similar duration for dexamethasone.</p><p>Clinical practice guidelines for the use of antenatal corticosteroids have been developed by many colleges and institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], often based on the NIH Consensus Panel Guidelines that were first released in 1994 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and again in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These guidelines state that &#x0201c;All pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks gestation who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days should be considered candidates for antenatal treatment with a single course of corticosteroids&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Corticosteroid type and regimen in current clinical practice</title><p>There is considerable variation between countries as to whether dexamethasone or betamethasone is used in clinical practice. There are likely to be many reasons for these differences including availability, costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] (dexamethasone is cheaper than betamethasone so is widely used in low-income countries), impact of non-randomised, observational studies on efficacy and safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and influence of opinion leaders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In Australia and New Zealand both preparations are used, betamethasone most frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The optimal treatment regimen to use for antenatal corticosteroids is uncertain. The current Cochrane review &#x0201c;Antenatal corticosteroids for accelerating fetal lung maturation&#x0201d; presents no evidence on an optimal dosing regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An earlier version of this Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] mentioned &#x0201c;a policy of administering corticosteroids (24 mg betamethasone, or 24 mg dexamethasone)&#x0201d;, without specifying treatment regimens in detail. The NIH Consensus Statement, based on information available in the late 1990s, recommended &#x0201c;two doses of 12 mg of betamethasone given intramuscularly 24 hours apart or four doses of 6 mg of dexamethasone given intramuscularly 12 hours apart&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since 2000 there have been four further trials, some using different treatment regimens, and these are now included in the Roberts systematic review with the review authors highlighting that &#x0201c;further research is required to determine the optimal dose to use&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Given this uncertainty it is not surprising to find a variety of different treatment regimens used in clinical care. For instance, to complete a course of antenatal corticosteroids, 48% of practitioners in Australia and New Zealand prescribe two injections at 12 hour intervals and 43% prescribe two injections at 24 hour intervals, with variation for both dexamethasone and betamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Practice is similarly varied in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. To complete a course of 24 mg dexamethasone over 24 hours, the treatment regimen varies between institutions, and even within institutions, and includes 8 mg for 3 doses 8 hours apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], 12 mg for two doses 12 hours apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], or 12 mg for two doses 24 hours apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence from non-randomised cohort studies using dexamethasone or betamethasone</title><p>There have been several recent non-randomised, retrospective human studies comparing antenatal dexamethasone and betamethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and particularly their effects on IVH and periventricular leukomalacia; both major precursors for cerebral palsy. Results are conflicting, with some studies reporting no differences in the risk of IVH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], periventricular leukomalacia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], but others report that dexamethasone is associated with an increase in periventricular leukomalacia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and neurosensory impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The inherent risk of bias with retrospective study designs should limit the conclusions drawn for clinical practice, but this caution is not always mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, it is possible that some effects of dexamethasone on periventricular leukomalacia may be attributable to the sulphite preservative used in some formulations rather than the drug itself, as shown in a mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Appraising the evidence - the cochrane review</title><sec><title>Evidence from randomised controlled trials using dexamethasone or betamethasone: effect on childhood health - reduction in neurosensory disability</title><p>Five randomised trials (908 children) with long-term follow-up are included in the Roberts Cochrane systematic review; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] three comparing antenatal betamethasone with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and two comparing dexamethasone with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Compared with placebo, both antenatal dexamethasone and betamethasone were associated with less developmental delay in childhood (Relative Risk (RR) 0.49, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.24 to 1.00, 2 trials, 518 children), and a trend towards fewer children having cerebral palsy (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.03, 5 trials, 904 children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Authors in the Roberts&#x02019; review emphasise that their review does not suggest evidence of a difference in risk of cerebral palsy between betamethasone and dexamethasone. Highlighting this research gap they state &#x0201c;Future studies are needed to determine the optimal drug&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Evidence from randomised trials: direct comparison of dexamethasone with betamethasone</title><p>We have conducted a Cochrane systematic review to assess the use of different corticosteroids and regimens for accelerating fetal lung maturation for women at risk of preterm birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Five trials met the inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. No health outcomes of relevance for the mother were reported from any of the trials. For the infant, antenatal exposure to dexamethasone was associated with a significantly lower risk of IVH than exposure to betamethasone (3.5% versus 6.9%, RR 0.44 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92, 4 trials, 717 infants). No significant difference was seen for respiratory distress syndrome, severe intraventricular haemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia or death. Information on childhood outcomes is limited to a single trial that reported one instance of neurosensory disability among only 12 infants admitted to neonatal intensive care unit and followed up at 18 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>We conclude from this systematic review that high quality randomised controlled trials comparing dexamethasone and betamethasone are needed.

Although this cost-effective treatment is widely used in practice throughout the world, there is uncertainty as to which drug treatment is of greatest benefit. Clearly, large, high quality randomised controlled trials are a priority to provide high-level evidence for clinical practice. If one drug clearly results in significantly fewer deaths and fewer disabled children then it should be used consistently in women at risk of preterm birth and would be of great importance to women at risk of preterm birth, their children, health services and communities.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ARD: Absolute risk difference; CI: Confidence interval; GMFCS: Gross motor function classification system; IVH: Intraventricular haemorrhage; RR: Relative risk; RRD: Relative risk difference; SD: Standard deviation</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>CAC, JEH, PFM, CCA, PA and JSR are all members of the ASTEROID Study Group.
