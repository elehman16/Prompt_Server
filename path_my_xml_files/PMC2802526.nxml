 a short course of training is no more efficacious than structured care.
 Natural remission is an unlikely explanation for improvements in people with
 chronic medically unexplained symptoms, but lack of a &#x02018;treatment as
 usual&#x02019; arm limits further conclusions. Further research on enhanced
 structured care, medical assessment and structured care incorporating simple
 elements of CBT principles is worthy of consideration.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Declaration of interest</bold></p></fn><fn><p>None.

 medically
 unexplained.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
 Cases that present in this way are heterogeneous and may be associated with
 depression, anxiety or somatoform
 disorders,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>
 but in some there is neither physical nor mental
 disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>
 Therefore, existing psychiatric classifications are unsatisfactory, and hinder
 understanding and management of this complex
 problem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>
 Many studies of medically unexplained symptoms have used selective entry
 criteria, resulting in samples with high rates of mental disorders, high
 service use or symptom
 syndromes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>
 Hence, the term &#x02018;medically unexplained symptoms&#x02019; is used in this
 study to capture the presentation of patients in a clinical
 setting,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>
 with no specific emphasis on a diagnostic category. There is evidence for the
 effectiveness of interventions for this demanding group using antidepressant
 medication and cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy
 (CBT),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>
 but few intervention studies have been conducted in primary
 care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></p><p>Medically unexplained symptoms have a similar prevalence and consequences
 across widely different cultural
 settings.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref> In Sri
 Lanka, patients with such symptoms were compared with other primary care
 attenders,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref> using
 the 30-item General Health Questionaire
 (GHQ&#x02013;30).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>
 The prevalence ratio was 2.38 (95% CI 1.78&#x02013;3.18) and the mean duration
 of illness was 39 months. Symptoms were not relieved in 72% of these patients
 in spite of 17 visits to different categories of doctor of their choice per
 year, compared with 4 visits per year in the control group.</p><p>A pilot randomised controlled trial preceding this study to test the
 effectiveness of an intervention based on CBT principles is the only published
 example of such an evaluation from a low- to middle-income
 country.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> The
 results of the pilot study indicated that brief CBT carried out by a
 psychiatrist in a primary care setting was efficacious compared with treatment
 as usual in reducing symptoms (difference in symptom count=2.3, 95% CI
 0.85&#x02013;3.7, <italic>P</italic>=0.001), psychological morbidity (GHQ score
 difference=4.1, 95% CI 0.5&#x02013;7.6, <italic>P</italic>=0.04) and consultation
 frequency (difference=4.8, 95% CI 1.3&#x02013;8, <italic>F=</italic>9.1,
 <italic>P</italic>=0.004). However, Sri Lanka has only 1.3 psychiatrists per million
 people.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref> The
 larger trial described here tests the same CBT intervention in more pragmatic
 circumstances, delivered by primary care physicians. The pilot trial, with
 treatment as usual as its control condition, was open to the criticism that
 the treatment effect might have been linked to non-specific elements, rather
 than being a specific effect of CBT. Therefore, we replaced treatment as usual
 by structured care, offering sessions with similar duration, frequency and
 attention given by doctors similar to those providing CBT. We tested the
 hypothesis that for patients with medically unexplained symptoms attending a
 general out-patient clinic, would be more efficacious than structured
 care.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was a randomised controlled trial, with individuals randomised to
 CBT or structured care. The primary outcome was psychological morbidity,
 measured by the GHQ&#x02013;30. Secondary outcomes were the number of symptoms
 reported by the participants, the score on the Bradford Somatic Inventory
 (BSI),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> and the
 number of patient-initiated visits to healthcare providers of their choice.
 The study received ethical clearance from the ethics committee at the
 Institute of Psychiatry and approval from the board of management of Sri
 Jayewardenepura Hospital in Sri Lanka.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The trial was conducted in a general out-patient clinic at Sri
 Jayewardenepura General Hospital, Colombo, where patients initiate their own
 visits without prior appointments. The clinic is a primary care facility with
 eight doctors, and patients use it as the first point of contact for
 healthcare. Consecutive attenders were screened to identify those meeting the
 inclusion criteria for the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Patients aged 16&#x02013;65 years who had had five or more medically
 unexplained symptoms for a period of at least 6 months were eligible for
 inclusion. Symptoms of shorter duration are particularly likely to resolve
 spontaneously, therefore such patients were
 excluded.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>
 Medically unexplained symptoms were defined on the basis of at least one of
 the following:</p><p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>incompatibility of the clinical presentation with a known physical
 illness</p></list-item><list-item><p>absence of relevant positive physical signs</p></list-item><list-item><p>laboratory investigations not supporting a diagnosis of a physical
 illness.</p></list-item></list>
 </p><p>Symptoms (e.g. pain) experienced at different anatomical sites were counted
 as separate symptoms, as were different symptoms at the same anatomical site.
 Those with dementia, psychosis or alcohol dependence were excluded from the
 trial, as were those currently receiving treatment for a psychiatric
 disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p>Recruitment took place among consecutive out-patient department attenders.
 The eight primary care physicians were instructed verbally as well as by a
 printed A4 sheet on how to recognise medically unexplained symptoms, and
 identified patients with repeated consultations for such symptoms. These
 patients were referred to the trial coordinator (A.S.) and the trial physician
 (S.S.), who made independent assessments to establish eligibility, each
 administering two open-ended questions (&#x02018;What are your symptoms?&#x02019;
 &#x02018;Are there any other symptoms/problems?&#x02019;) to elicit the number of
 symptoms and the number of visits over the previous 6
 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref> A
 comprehensive physical examination was carried out by S.S., who also reviewed
 previous laboratory investigation results. Patients with overt disease were
 excluded. If both A.S. and S.S. agreed that the patient was eligible to be
 recruited, non-clinical research assistants obtained informed consent.
 Patients who refused or who did not fulfil the inclusion criteria were
 referred back to the primary care doctor.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on the assumption that only a
 relatively large effect size associated with the intervention was likely to
 influence policy. The priorities for hard-pressed primary care services in Sri
 Lanka remain infectious disease, heart disease, hypertension and diabetes.
 Although repeated attendance of patients with multiple symptoms is a
 well-recognised problem, a psychological intervention would have to be highly
 efficacious to stand a realistic chance of being adopted. Therefore the sample
 size was set at 55 in each group to confer 80% power at 5% significance of
 detecting a true effect size of 0.5 (generally designated as a moderate
 effect) for detectable differences in mean scores on the primary outcome
 measure (the GHQ score) between the two groups. Allowing for 30% attrition, 72
 patients were needed in each group, rounded to 75 in each arm. In the pilot
 trial a large effect size was observed when the psychiatrist provided CBT. We
 assumed such a larger effect size was unrealistic when primary care doctors
 provided the therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>The six doctors comprised four who were entirely based in the out-patient
 department and two who were employed in the hospital but also worked as
 general practitioners in the community. The doctors were allocated at random
 to deliver CBT or structured care, in such a way that three doctors were
 allocated to each intervention, with two hospital-based physicians and one
 general practitioner in each group.</p><p>Trial participants were first randomised to the two intervention groups
 using a random permuted block design, with a block size of four. Next,
 participants were randomly allocated to one of the three doctors selected to
 deliver the intervention to which they had been allocated. Randomisation codes
 were generated by a statistician in the UK and passed on to the independent
 epidemiologist (M.R.N.A.) in Sri Lanka, who executed the random allocation of
 treatment condition.</p><p>Throughout the trial both the physician (S.S.) and the research assistants
 for the project remained masked to the group status of the patients. Details
 of allocation of all patients were concealed from them until the end of the
 trial. The research assistants did not know which primary care doctors
 provided which treatment. Neither the primary care doctors who delivered the
 interventions nor the patients who received them could be masked to their
 allocation because of the nature of the interventions. Similarly, the trial
 coordinator (A.S.) was not masked to the group status. However, he was not
 involved in registration, randomisation, treatment allocation, data collection
 or main outcome analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial procedures</title><p>The primary care physician was responsible for arranging the subsequent
 treatment sessions. An administrator facilitated the appointments and
 follow-up assessments. The full baseline assessment was repeated 3 months, 6
 months and 12 months post-baseline. A part assessment was done at 9 months to
 maintain continuity. Patients who were not present for re-assessments were
 sent reminders by post or were contacted over the telephone. If they were
 unable to attend, assessments were carried out at the person&#x02019;s home.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments and instruments</title><p>The trial physician (S.S.) and the trial coordinator (A.S.) ascertained the
 number of medically unexplained symptoms using the procedure described above.
 Participants also completed the following clinical assessments.</p><sec><title>General Health Questionnaire</title><p>The GHQ&#x02013;30 is a scalable measure of psychological morbidity, and was
 used as a continuous variable because it is useful for comparisons across
 groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> This
 questionnaire has been translated into Sinhala,
 validated,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>
 and used successfully in previous studies in primary
 care.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Bradford Somatic Inventory</title><p>The BSI is a structured assessment of the presence and the severity of 21
 commonly occurring somatic
 symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref> The
 symptoms were derived from psychiatric case-notes of British patients of
 indigenous and Pakistani origin, with clinical diagnoses of anxiety,
 depression, hypochondriasis and somatoform disorders. It has been validated in
 Britain and Pakistan, and used widely in the detection of psychiatric
 disorders among Asian patients presenting with somatic symptoms. Symptoms are
 coded as absent (0), or present on less than 15 days (1) or more than 15 days
 (2) in the past month. Possible scores range from 0 to 42. The BSI was also
 adapted and validated for Sri Lanka by
 A.S.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title>Assessment as part of the interventions</title><p>The Semi-Structured Explanatory Model Interview (SEMI) developed by Lloyd
 <italic>et al</italic> is a framework for eliciting salient information relevant to
 the management of medically unexplained
 symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref> The
 SEMI was part of both the CBT and the structured care intervention. Using the
 SEMI for exploration of the patient&#x02019;s and clinician&#x02019;s explanatory
 model is valuable in developing culturally appropriate
 interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>
 This instrument uses open-ended questions to elicit patients&#x02019;
 explanatory models. It generates data on the respondents&#x02019; assumptions,
 beliefs, thoughts about their illness and its causes, and fears about their
 future. It includes details of healthcare utilisation, and patients&#x02019;
 expectations of treatment and satisfaction with their care. Both groups were
 interviewed at baseline by A.S. using the SEMI, and its case vignettes and
 information were passed on to all the primary care physicians with the
 case-notes. In addition, the physicians providing CBT received a summary and a
 formulation based on SEMI findings prepared by A.S. and were trained to use
 this information to inform the strategy for their CBT intervention.</p><p>Two diaries were issued to every participant for the period of the
 intervention. The first was for any doctor consulted over the period of the
 trial to record consultations, symptoms, investigations and treatment. The
 other diary was for participants to record their own symptoms, associated
 cognitions and behaviours. For participants in both study groups the diaries
 afforded a mechanism for expressing distress. Information in the diary was
 available to the physicians in both study arms. In the CBT intervention the
 doctors were trained to use the participants&#x02019; diaries to identify
 dysfunctional cognitions and to monitor symptoms. The doctors who provided
 structured care were not given training as to the purpose or potential
 therapeutic use of the diaries.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapy</title><p>The intervention strategy was based on the therapy developed and manualised
 for the previous pilot
 trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>
 It aimed to contain the patient&#x02019;s help-seeking behaviour by offering
 structured regular visits to one health professional, thus reducing
 unstructured visits to different practitioners who might reinforce
 dysfunctional cognitions and behaviours through inappropriate advice and
 investigations. The treatment was based on the principles of CBT and
 reattribution
 technique,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>
 modified to suit the local socio-cultural context. Where possible, the support
 of the spouse or other close relative was elicited to discourage inappropriate
 discussions with ill-informed relatives and friends, who could reinforce the
 patient&#x02019;s preoccupation with fears of serious
 illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref> A
 treatment manual was used to standardise the
 intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> In
 the pilot study we offered six therapy sessions; however, 90% of the
 participants who attended three or more sessions stayed in the study, improved
 and also were available for outcome assessment. Hence, in this study, CBT was
 offered in three half-hourly structured sessions over the 3 weeks following
 the baseline assessment; these sessions were mandatory and those who did not
 complete them were considered non-adherent. A further three optional
 fortnightly follow-up sessions were offered.</p><p>The CBT training was a short course consisting of five sessions covering
 the basis of medically unexplained symptoms; the relevance of the explanatory
 model, elicited by the SEMI, to the CBT model of such symptoms; and the CBT
 treatment approach. Training was accomplished through lectures by P.d.S. and
 A.S., supplemented by case vignettes and role-play of therapeutic sessions by
 simulated patients based on case scenarios from the pilot trial, all with
 reference to the intervention manual. To ensure that CBT was delivered
 appropriately, the three doctors in the intervention arm received regular
 supervision from A.S.</p></sec><sec><title>Structured care</title><p>The components of the treatment packages and follow-up assessments received
 by the two groups differed in only one respect: participants in the structured
 care group did not receive CBT components detailed in the
 manual.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> The
 structured care also consisted of six half-hour appointments with one primary
 care physician. As in the CBT intervention, the first three weekly sessions
 were mandatory and the next three fortnightly sessions were optional. Another
 similarity was the use of diaries, which provided a mechanism for expressing
 distress. The three physicians were free to manage the patients as they wished
 within the sessions. No training or supervision was provided for these
 doctors, and the intervention was not manualised.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>At the end of the intervention, participants in both groups received a
 written summary of their history and the intervention and were asked to
 produce this if they consulted any other doctor within the next 12 months. No
 further appointment for CBT or structured care was booked, but participants
 had the option of visiting the doctor who offered the intervention or to visit
 any other doctor of their choice. This is the usual practice in Sri Lanka, as
 a formal general practice system does not exist. However, an administrator
 facilitated the appointments for follow-up outcome assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An interim analysis was not done. M.D., who was masked to randomised group
 allocation, analysed the scores from the four fixed time points (3 months, 6
 months, 9 months and 12 months after randomisation) using a mixed effects
 model. We included as fixed effects group allocation, baseline score, time,
 and the interaction of group and time. Time was coded as months after the
 3-month time point, giving values of 0, 3, 6 and 9, so that in the presence of
 the interaction the effect of group represents the difference at 3 months. We
 included the patient as a random effect. We also fitted models with a random
 effect of time, with various covariance patterns, with treating doctor as an
 effect, and pattern mixture models to allow for the different drop-out
 patterns. We report here the simpler models as they fit as well as any of the
 more complex ones. We also examined model residuals. A mixed effects model was
 used as this enables effective use of all the information even from
 participants who had some missing scores. We used <italic>r</italic> for the
 analysis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref> with
 the nlme package for fitting the mixed effects
 models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 150 participants were recruited, 75 each randomly allocated into
 the CBT and the structured care groups
 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). The baseline
 characteristics of participants in the two groups are given in
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. A large majority were
 women. Ages ranged from 16 years to 58 years with a mean of 35 years. Most
 participants were well educated, with 61% completing GCE Ordinary Level
 examination (11 years of education) and another 27% Advanced Level (13 years
 of education). As expected, trial recruits were chronically ill and high users
 of healthcare services. The mean duration of symptoms was 42 months (95% CI
 35.5&#x02013;48.3). Only 40% of participants were employed, and 95% reported
 requiring one or more assistants for help in their day-to-day activities. The
 SEMI findings revealed that 95% had considerable illness worries; 37% believed
 their symptoms indicated moderately serious illness and 58% thought they
 indicated very serious illness. More specifically, 33% harboured fear of
 death, 20% fear of paralysis, 13% fear of having cancer and the rest had
 fearful concerns about unspecified incurable illness. There was no substantial
 difference in baseline characteristics between the groups allocated to CBT and
 structured care.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of baseline characteristics between the two study

 Coefficients were estimated for the fixed effects of group allocation,
 baseline score, time and the interaction of group and time. In the presence of
 an interaction the group coefficient represents the difference at 3 months.
 For both groups, mean scores for all outcomes declined sharply from baseline
 to the first 3-month outcome assessment, and then remained essentially
 constant over time thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig.
 2</xref>). As can be seen from the coefficients, none of the group
 differences at 3 months was statistically significant, nor was there any
 difference in the effect of time (after the 3-month outcome) between groups
 (i.e. none of the interactions between time and group was statistically
 significant). Given the observed changes in outcome over time, we calculated,
 <italic>post hoc</italic>, the effect sizes for the change scores between baseline and
 3 months for each outcome, with each randomised allocation. These indicated
 substantial and statistically significant reductions from baseline

 between the two groups at 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and 12-month follow-up for
 the primary clinical outcome measure (GHQ score) or for the secondary outcome
 measures (BSI score, numbers of symptoms and visits). However, for both groups
 all outcome measures showed substantial and statistically significant
 reductions after 3 months compared with baseline, which were maintained for up
 to 12 months.</p><p>Potential explanations of these findings are natural remission of symptoms
 in both groups and higher baseline scores regressing to the mean. However, in
 a recent cohort study of patients presenting with physical symptoms to primary
 care, those with medically unexplained symptoms were unlikely to improve at 5
 years if they initially had poor functioning, longer duration of symptoms and
 illness worries.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>
 Similarly, in a 10-year follow-up study of patients with chest pain who had
 negative coronary angiography, 75% remained symptomatic and
 disabled.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref> Natural
 remission or higher baseline scores regressing to the mean are therefore
 unlikely to be the most plausible explanations, because patients in this trial
 had a mean duration of symptoms of 42 months, poor functioning (95% requiring
 one or more assistants for help in their day-to-day activities) and
 considerable illness worries (harboured by 95%).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study outcomes for the cognitive&#x02013;behavioural group (group 1) and the
 structured care group (group 2). BSI, Bradford Somatic Inventory; GHQ, General
 Health Questionnaire.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="56f2c"/></fig></p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, the lack of a trial arm allocated to
 treatment as usual is an important disadvantage, as the significant change
 scores for both groups cannot be directly compared with currently available
 treatment in Sri Lanka. Such treatment is usually symptomatic, with no
 structured care, so that these patients make around seven visits to 4&#x02013;10
 different categories of doctors of their choice over 6
 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></p><p>Assuming both interventions to be equally efficacious, lack of a difference
 between the groups at follow-up should not be interpreted exclusively as equal
 effect of both treatments, because it might be due to a type II error,
 resulting from inadequate power to detect small differences. Hence, our
 findings need to be interpreted cautiously. The earlier pilot trial, conducted
 in a similar setting on a smaller sample with similar
 characteristics,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>
 indicated a substantial and statistically significant treatment benefit
 associated with CBT delivered by a psychiatrist, when compared with treatment
 as usual (no structured care), using for the most part the same outcomes
 studied in this trial. The characteristics of the pilot trial and the present
 trial are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">Table 5</xref>,
 because the setting, recruitment, inclusion criteria, assessment instruments
 (including the use of SEMI) and the outcome measures were the same. Although a
 direct comparison cannot be made between the two trials, the effect sizes
 associated with CBT on primary and secondary outcomes are similar in both,
 despite the CBT intervention being administered by primary care physicians in
 one study and by an experienced psychiatrist in the other. Indeed, the effect
 on GHQ&#x02013;30 and BSI scores was larger for the physician-administered CBT.
 However, the effect sizes associated with structured care given by primary
 care physicians are similar to those achieved by the CBT intervention in both
 the pilot trial and the present trial, and are much superior to treatment as
 usual in the pilot trial. The differences between the findings of the pilot
 trial and the present trial are therefore more parsimoniously explained by the
 relative effectiveness of structured care than by an ineffectiveness of CBT
 when administered by primary care doctors following minimal training.
 Alternatively, the failure of CBT to show a clear superiority could be due to
 insufficient treatment intensity or duration (i.e. dosage) or an inadequacy of
 competency (i.e. duration of training or background knowledge). Also, there
 was no assessment of CBT fidelity to protocol. The short training provided for
 doctors might have resulted in a technique-based competency with little
 understanding of cognitive and behavioural sciences. This might have resulted
 in a lack of flexibility in treatment to produce the maximum treatment effect.
 Alternatively, primary care physicians might not be good
 cognitive&#x02013;behavioural therapists. In a randomised controlled trial on
 chronic fatigue, CBT given by general practitioners did not have any effect
 compared with the control group (who did not have
 CBT).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref> In a
 systematic review there was no strong evidence for the effectiveness of
 psychosocial interventions by general
 practitioners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>
 Another possibility is that CBT is not indicated. Unexplained symptoms may be
 puzzling and distressing, and the patient might simply need the doctor to be
 honest about uncertainty and provide simple reassurance, without attempting to
 change cognitions through CBT.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Comparison between the pilot trial and the current trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left"/><th colspan="2" valign="top" align="center"> Pilot trial<sup>a</sup></th><th colspan="2" valign="top" align="center"> Current trial

 arms of our study should not undermine the clinical importance of its
 findings, in particular the potentially positive impact of structured care. We
 cannot directly establish that such care was more efficacious than treatment
 as usual. However, the comparison of effect sizes between the pilot trial and
 this study suggests that this is a possibility. Further development of
 structured care, as a less onerous and cheaper but possibly equally effective
 alternative to
 CBT,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref> requires
 some consideration of the elements that were common to both the interventions
 provided in this trial. These were as follows.</p><p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>The recruitment process into the trial included the explanation of
 medically unexplained symptoms provided in the information sheet.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The initial physical examination and case review were carried out by the
 experienced specialist physician (S.S.).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The exploration of patient explanatory models, cognitions and behaviours in
 the SEMI by the psychiatrist (A.S.) was available to the physicians providing
 structured care, although they were not provided with a summary of the
 findings or trained to use it. It is possible that participants might have
 gained insight through the SEMI alone, and might have brought some of this
 awareness into the subsequent structured care sessions. There is ample
 evidence that comprehensive clinical assessments alone may have beneficial
 effects on clinical outcomes; an assessment itself without formal
 psychotherapy might have therapeutic
 effects.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>The diaries given to participants to record their symptoms, associated
 cognitions and behaviours might inadvertently have introduced an element of
 CBT, reducing the distinctiveness of the two interventions. By the same token,
 these elements may highlight the potential for a feasible and effective
 intervention based on structured care without the need for the additional
 complexity and cost implied in manualisation, training and supervision for
 CBT.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Structured appointments were available with a primary care physician,
 regardless of whether or not this option was taken up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Therapeutic engagement with the primary care doctor took place over three
 to six half-hour sessions (routine primary care consultations would typically
 last around 5&#x02013;10 min in Sri Lanka). Therefore, simple unambiguous
 reassurance that did not use specific CBT techniques would have had some
 effect.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Consistent care was provided by a single doctor, with the consequent
 opportunity to avoid contradictory and ambiguous advice from different care
 providers, which is one of the most important determinants of perpetuation of
 symptoms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Regular structured assessment procedures (BSI, GHQ, SEMI) were offered
 during follow-up every 3 months.</p></list-item></list>
 </p><p>The use of placebo medication was a unique component in the structured care
 intervention.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>Contamination (or a spillover effect) of the interventions might have
 occurred given that the doctors administering both worked in the same primary
 care centre. Doctors providing structured care might have picked up on
 cognitive&#x02013;behavioural techniques from the doctors who provided CBT. Most
 of the doctors who referred patients for the trial also treated them. This
 might have biased the inclusion in such a way that only highly motivated
 patients or patients fitting the treatment were recruited. However, this
 selection bias would not affect the comparison between the two interventions,
 but could contribute to the high effect sizes of both interventions.
 Generalisability to routine primary care may be limited by recruitment
 confined to chronically ill patients with multiple complaints and repeated
 visits enrolled from a single clinic. Similarly, even if both interventions
 were equally efficacious, they were relatively demanding (three to six 30 min
 sessions) and therefore of questionable generalisability.</p></sec><sec><title>Study implications</title><p>Either CBT or structured care may improve symptoms of patients with chronic
 medically unexplained symptoms and frequent attendance to many different
 healthcare providers. These interventions were not studied directly against
 treatment as usual in this trial, but the observed change was larger than that
 seen in a previous trial and deserves further study in comparison with usual
 treatment. Treatment of patients with medically unexplained symptoms is a
 complex process, consisting of different components, which may act both
 independently and
 interdependently.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 However, the active component may not be easily defined. Therapist and patient
 characteristics, delivery, frequency and timing of the trial procedures;
 recruitment into a trial <italic>per se</italic>, the information leaflet, the consent
 process, non-specific effects of structured appointments and the regular
 structured follow-up assessment all may be active ingredients.</p><p>Findings of this trial support the importance of evaluating the
 &#x02018;effectiveness of medical assessments augmented by inclusion of proven
 cognitive&#x02013;behavioural
 elements&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>
 Hence, future research should consider enhanced structured care; medical
 assessment and structured care incorporating simple elements of CBT principles
 that can be used by doctors without specific training or CBT skills.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We dedicate this paper to Padmal De Silva, internationally renowned
