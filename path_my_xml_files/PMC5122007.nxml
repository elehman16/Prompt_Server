Support and care for older subjects are often provided by a network of informal caregivers composed of family, friends and neighbors, who are essential in helping older persons to continue living at home. It has been shown that the extent and diversity of informal tasks may jeopardize the physical, mental and social wellbeing of caregivers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The aim of the Informal Carers of Elderly cohort is to define, through a longitudinal study, profiles of caregivers of older patients with a diagnosis of one of the following diseases: cancer (breast, prostate, colorectal), neurodegenerative diseases (Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and similar diseases), neurovascular diseases (stroke), sensory diseases (age-related macular degeneration (AMD)) and heart disease (heart failure). Patients must be at least 60&#x000a0;years old and living in the region of Burgundy-Franche-Comte (France). By following the different phases of the caregiving relationship from the announcement of the diagnosis, it will be possible to assess the quality of life of caregivers, coping strategies, levels of anxiety and depression, social support and the extent of their burden. We will also evaluate the efficacy and efficiency of the implementation of a pragmatic intervention by a social worker to help informal caregivers, through a randomized interventional trial nested in the cohort. Qualitative approaches aimed at studying the caregiver/patient relationship, and situations leading to breakdown of the caregiver relationship will be also undertaken.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Through an analytical and longitudinal definition of profiles of informal caregivers, this study will gather detailed information on their life courses and their health trajectory by identifying consequences associated with the concept of their role as carers. In addition, the randomized interventional trial will explore the relevance of the implementation of a supportive intervention by a social worker to help caregivers. These data will help to identify strategies that could be used to improve the existing sources of aid and to propose new approaches to help caregivers. This study will provide the opportunity to identify the most relevant means of support adapted to caregivers, and provide an impulse for new health care policies.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02626377">NCT02626377</ext-link>.

The topic of informal caregiving has become a key issue with regard to care and support for, and consequently maintenance at home of, chronically ill older people, and the features and progress of their dependence. Caregivers play an essential role in providing support to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Different reasons lead people to become caregivers of a patient, such as chronic disease (51&#x000a0;%), older age (44&#x000a0;%), physical handicap (30&#x000a0;%) and mental handicap (13&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Among the various diseases, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease is the most frequent cause of becoming an informal caregiver (17&#x000a0;%), followed by age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (15&#x000a0;%), heart failure (14&#x000a0;%), hypertension (13&#x000a0;%), cancer (12&#x000a0;%), stroke (10&#x000a0;%), diabetes (9&#x000a0;%), osteoporosis (8&#x000a0;%) and Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (4&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Over the last few years, informal caregivers have been classified as a frail population with an increased risk of health problems themselves. Psychological components of the informal caregiver role, especially chronic stress, are associated with an increased risk of depression, mortality and cardiovascular or neurovascular morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The mean duration of informal caregiving situations is about 7&#x000a0;years, and the delivering of care often has deleterious effects on the caregiver&#x02019;s general health. Forty percent of caregivers believe themselves to be in poor health, although 90&#x000a0;% of caregivers say that they can cope with the difficulties arising from the care relationship. However, they report a deterioration of their family life (35&#x000a0;%), marital life (41&#x000a0;%), mood (49&#x000a0;%), physical condition (57&#x000a0;%) and leisure activities (70&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The psychological distress felt by informal caregivers seems to be directly related to the care provided: the time devoted to care and support, the nature of the care, and behavioral disorders. Such distress could be generated by the effects of personal investment in the role of caregiver, namely a reduction in personal leisure time, loss of social links, family conflict and financial difficulties. The care relationship leads to an increase in workload, which is likely to accentuate any latent health problem of the caregiver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The &#x0201c;adjustment&#x0201d; must be made at the cost of time devoted to family, friends or work. Accordingly, 29&#x000a0;% of caregivers think that there is a lack of moral and emotional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The difficulties experienced by caregivers may, therefore, have a direct impact on the quality of the care provided to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It thus seems essential to identify caregivers&#x02019; profiles through a longitudinal follow-up of their life course, to study the course of their quality of life, to understand the context in which care is provided, to identify factors that amplify or attenuate &#x0201c;burn-out,&#x0201d; to measure the impact of support on the caregiver&#x02019;s life, to understand strategies for coping with the stress, and to identify psychological issues. Another important issue is the identification of the most appropriate type of support that could prevent the deterioration of the caregivers&#x02019; physical and mental health, and preserve their social environment, thereby ensuring the continuity of therapeutic care to patients. Various forms of support for caregivers are currently available. Previous studies have underlined the efficacy of these interventions for both caregivers and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The effects varied according to the age and gender of the caregiver, the social link between caregivers and patients, the duration, the frequency of the &#x0201c;work/care&#x0201d; and the type of intervention. The patient&#x02019;s disease is also a key component.</p><p>To date, few longitudinal studies of caregivers have been conducted. As a result, there is a lack of data to identify caregivers&#x02019; profiles in a dynamic construct perspective. Thus, there is a clear need for scientifically validated knowledge of this population. This is a key step in identifying interventional strategies that could be applied and tailored to the caregivers&#x02019; profiles. Our hypothesis is that caregivers represent a heterogeneous group of individuals with different needs and different coping strategies. As suggested by previous reports, the support proposed to informal caregivers should be varied and adapted to the individual. In this respect, the Eurofamcare study underlined the need for a systematic evaluation of the role and needs of caregivers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, a meta-analysis showed the importance of screening for burn-out in caregivers on a 6-monthly basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other studies have shown how the circumstances in which a person comes to take on the role of caregiver can affect the caregiver-patient relationship. Indeed, in the long term, the relationship devoted to care may be compromised. In this regard, proactive interventions initiated from the earliest stages of the caregiving relationship seem essential in promoting optimized coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>These points led us to undertake a longitudinal cohort study to follow the informal main caregivers of patients who are in the early phase of a diagnosis of breast, prostate or colorectal cancer, Alzheimer&#x02019;s or similar diseases, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, stroke, AMD or heart failure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This research project is a prospective, multicenter, longitudinal cohort study incorporating two types of study, namely an observational study and a nested randomized interventional trial among caregivers included in the observational study.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Observational study</title><p>The primary objective of the observational study is to evaluate, using quantitative approaches, the patterns of informal caregivers for patients aged 60&#x000a0;years and older according to the evaluation of their health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (as assessed by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form-36 items (MOS SF-36) and the CareGiver Oncology Quality of Life (CarGOQoL) questionnaires (only for caregivers of the group of cancer patients), coping strategies (as assessed by the coping scale developed by Borteyrou, Truchot and&#x000a0;Rascle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), anxiety and depression (as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), social support (as assessed by the Social Support Questionnaire (SSQ6)) and caregiver burden (as assessed by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview) during the first 5&#x000a0;years of their role as caregivers.</p><p>Using qualitative approaches, the secondary objectives are: (1) to evaluate the caregiver/patient relationship and changes in this relationship over time as the patient&#x02019;s disease progresses, (2) to describe the specificities of the attachment relationship between a caregiver and a patient with behavioral disorders (Alzheimer-type dementia in particular) and (3) to study the situations leading to a breakdown in the role of caregiver (nursing home placement, death or disease remission) during the 5&#x000a0;years of participation in the cohort duration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventional study</title><p>A randomized interventional trial in a 1:1 ratio will be conducted within this cohort to evaluate the effect of a pragmatic supportive intervention on caregivers, provided by a social worker and an information booklet (intervention arm) versus the control arm, where caregivers will only receive the information booklet, without social worker support. The intervention will be conducted during the first 2&#x000a0;years of entrance into the caregiver&#x02019;s role. The intervention proposed here mobilizes social workers of the Departmental Councils, of the General National Retirement Fund (CARSAT Burgundy-Franche-Comt&#x000e9;) and of the Community Social Action Association (CCAS of Dijon). All institutions providing social workers are officially involved in the study and all social workers are trained in the management of older people, characteristics of caregiving relationships and in ICE cohort study procedures. The structure and purposes of the social worker&#x02019;s intervention are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The main objective is to compare the mental and physical health summary scores on the MOS SF-36 at 1&#x000a0;year between the two groups. Secondary objectives are to compare the following parameters between groups: (1) the mental and physical health summary scores of the MOS SF-36 at 2&#x000a0;years, (2) all HRQoL dimensions of the MOS SF-36 at 1&#x000a0;year and at 2&#x000a0;years, (3) longitudinally: all HRQoL dimensions of the MOS SF-36 and the CarGOQoL questionnaire (only for caregivers of the cancer patient group), (4) coping strategies (as assessed by the coping scale developed by Borteyrou, Truchot and&#x000a0;Rascle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]), (5) anxiety-depression (as assessed by the HADS), (6) social support (as assessed by the SSQ6) and the perceived caregiver burden (as assessed by the Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview) and (7) to assess from a societal perspective the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the intervention of a social worker for caregivers. The ICER will be expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained based on a utility score that will be calculated based on the EuroQoL EQ-5D questionnaire, the SF-6D which is composed of 11 items of the SF-36 questionnaire and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaires and economic survey.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content and purposes of the pragmatic intervention by a social worker in the intervention group of the nested randomized trial for caregivers</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Format of the intervention:</td></tr><tr><td>For each caregiver randomized to the intervention arm of the trial, a social worker will conduct an individual interview with the caregiver</td></tr><tr><td>Purposes of the interview:</td></tr><tr><td>To simply listen to the caregiver and allow them to express their complaints (and to be attentive to unspoken complaints)<break/>To evaluate the level of difficulty experienced by the caregiver in their daily routine, being attentive to their personal situation<break/>To respect and respond to any needs and/or requests expressed by the caregiver, and provide active support; guarantee confidentiality of the conversations and ensure that the caregiver participates willingly, without intruding in their life<break/>To provide any resources that are lacking in the caregiver-patient relationship; provide information about available solutions for respite care, and other solutions specific to each case (accommodation, health care pathway, logistic/material support for the caregiver/patient)<break/>To help the caregiver to more quickly apprehend and come to terms with their commitment of being a caregiver<break/>To be attentive to any alert signals and prevent deterioration towards crisis situations (burn-out, abuse); to alert third parties if the caregiver is found to be in a critical situation<break/>Through their interactions with the caregiver, the social worker will provide accompaniment and support, offering pertinent information and orientation towards appropriate structures of care depending on the situation the caregiver describes.

Principal caregivers who are under guardianship, curatorship or under the protection of justice will be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Inclusion procedure</title><p>Inclusion will be performed in two steps. First, patients will be identified, during a clinical consultation in the context of a diagnosis for one of the diseases being investigated, by clinicians involved in the ICE cohort study who had participated in the reflection phase on inclusion strategies for the different diseases, the procedures to recruit caregivers and the logistic support to set up. At the first consultation, which is a medical visit planned at hospital within the scope of the patient&#x02019;s pathology, the clinician will indicate the presence or not of a potential informal primary caregiver. They will ask the patient to come to the next consultation with their caregiver (the timetable is defined according to the inclusion strategy, depending on the patient&#x02019;s pathology). Then, at the second consultation, two possibilities for the inclusion of informal caregivers exist, namely patients are either accompanied by their caregiver or they attend unaccompanied. If the patient comes to the second consultation with their caregiver, as requested, both the patient and their caregiver will be informed of the study, complete the identification questionnaire with the health care facility CRA involved in the study, and receive the Consent Form.

One score is generated per dimension, and normalized on a scale of 0 (worst HRQoL) to 100 (best HRQoL). Physical and mental health summary scores are also generated.</p><p>HRQoL will also be evaluated for caregivers of cancer patients using the CareGoQoL questionnaire. This self-administered questionnaire includes 29 items assessing 10 HRQoL dimensions, namely: psychological wellbeing, burden, relationship with health care professionals, financial and administrative management, coping, physical wellbeing, self-esteem, leisure activities, social support and private life. For each individual, scores for a dimension are computed if at least half of its contributive items are answered. The score of each dimension is obtained by computing the mean of the item scores for that dimension. An index is computed as the mean of the dimension scores. All dimension scores and the index are linearly transformed and standardized on a scale of 0&#x02013;100 (the higher the score, the better the HRQoL).

The societal perspective consists in aggregating all expenditure, regardless of its nature and source of funding (social security, private health insurance, out-of-pocket expenses) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The choice of this perspective is justified by the diversity of the expected consequences of the intervention of a social worker. Only direct medical costs will be taken into account.

Social security benefits received by caregivers will also be taken into consideration, as well as costs associated with caregiving time and out-of pocket expenses. Productivity costs will not be estimated because it is usually considered that they are included in the QALY estimation. However, the impact of the informal caregiving on the caregivers&#x02019; professional situation will be evaluated using the economic survey. QALYs will be calculated based on the use of utility score from the EQ-5D, a multiattribute generic questionnaire composed of six attributes: mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression.

This study should make it possible to improve our knowledge concerning the life course of caregivers (by identifying profiles of the caregivers and understanding the mechanisms involved in changing this profile), to identify their needs and their expectations (in terms of professional support, financial assistance, information and advice to assist in caregiving) and to envisage optimized support for patients with chronic disease who live at home.</p><p>The consideration of patients&#x02019; social environment is essential in an integrative approach to the management of their disease. In this respect, the difficulties encountered by caregivers may have direct implications on the quality of the care they provide. This study will allow us to identify factors associated with modifications in patient management support. Improved knowledge of the difficulties that caregivers face in their everyday lives could contribute to identifying potentially high-risk situations in the care relationship (e.g., mistreatment) and make it possible to implement timely support for caregivers at risk of psychological, physical or social distress.</p><p>The purpose, in terms of public health, is to avoid the health deterioration of caregivers, and thus indirectly, to improve the patient&#x02019;s health status through optimized management that is potentially inexpensive and economically acceptable for society. The intervention study is based on the hypothesis that early intervention during the initial phase of the care relationship is likely to improve the caregivers&#x02019; HRQoL and the quality of the support provided. The hypothesis of the associated efficacy study is that the intervention of a social worker, through their role in listening, alerting, advising and guiding, may improve the wellbeing of informal caregivers, and thus reduce their potential consumption of health care resources, and consequently, the expenditure related to their care mission. Improving caregivers&#x02019; HRQoL and preventing degradation of their health will make it possible to positively influence the patients&#x02019; HRQoL, and as a result, their health, autonomy and capacity to continue living at home. To ensure the homogeneity of the intervention across the Burgundy-Franche-Comt&#x000e9; region, all registered social workers in the region will undergo study-specific training. The intervention to be provided in the context of this study by social workers is explained in detail and formalized in a partnership agreement signed by all the social services employing social workers in the region.</p><p>The ICE cohort may lead to the formulation of health recommendations and serve as a basis for the development of services that offer support to caregivers to reduce the potential risk of social inequalities related to caregiving.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of manuscript submission, a feasibility study conducted to test the inclusion mechanisms in the clinical departments, as well as the questionnaire concerning the designation of the principal caregiver, has been completed.
