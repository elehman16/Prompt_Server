The Delphi technique requires participants to rate the importance of items in sequential questionnaires (or rounds) with feedback provided in each subsequent round such that participants are able to consider the views of others. This study examines the impact of receiving feedback from different stakeholder groups, on the subsequent rating of items and the level of agreement between stakeholders.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Randomized controlled trials were nested within the development of three core sets each including a Delphi process with two rounds of questionnaires, completed by patients and health professionals. Participants rated items from 1 (not essential) to 9 (absolutely essential). For round 2, participants were randomized to receive feedback from their peer stakeholder group only (peer) or both stakeholder groups separately (multiple). Decisions as to which items to retain following each round were determined by pre-specified criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Whilst type of feedback did not impact on the percentage of items for which a participant subsequently changed their rating, or the magnitude of change, it did impact on items retained at the end of round 2. Each core set contained discordant items retained by one feedback group but not the other (3&#x02013;22&#x000a0;% discordant items). Consensus between patients and professionals in items to retain was greater amongst those receiving multiple group feedback in each core set (65&#x02013;82&#x000a0;% agreement for peer-only feedback versus 74&#x02013;94&#x000a0;% for multiple feedback). In addition, differences in round 2 scores were smaller between stakeholder groups receiving multiple feedback than between those receiving peer group feedback only. Variability in item scores across stakeholders was reduced following any feedback but this reduction was consistently greater amongst the multiple feedback group.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the development of a core outcome or information set, providing feedback within Delphi questionnaires from all stakeholder groups separately may influence the final core set and improve consensus between the groups. Further work is needed to better understand how participants rate and re-rate items within a Delphi process.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The three randomized controlled trials reported here were each nested within the development of a core information or outcome set to investigate processes in core outcome and information set development.

A COS requires incorporation of patient opinion as well as that of health professionals to ensure that outcomes are patient centred and relevant to healthcare. The widespread implementation of such sets will reduce heterogeneity in reported outcomes and better enable data synthesis. Methods to develop COSs have been promoted by the COMET initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and have also been used for the development of core information sets (CISs) (a minimum set of information to use in all consultations as a baseline for information provision for treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]). The methods for developing CISs and COSs are very similar and both involve working with key stakeholders to prioritise large numbers of items (outcomes or information) and achieve agreement as to the core set.</p><p>A recent review of studies developing core outcome sets for use in clinical trials, found that 31&#x000a0;% incorporated a Delphi process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The Delphi technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (when used within questionnaire surveys) requires participants to anonymously rate the importance of different items in sequential questionnaires or &#x02018;rounds&#x02019; sent by post or electronically. After each round, responses for each item are summarized and fed back (anonymously) within the subsequent questionnaire (the next round), enabling participants to consider the views of others before re-rating the item and can therefore change their initial responses based on the feedback from the previous rounds. Previous research outside the context of core sets has demonstrated that both the iteration of questionnaires, enabling participants to reflect on their own previous responses, and the influence of feedback, improve accuracy of responses and agreement amongst participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Whilst accuracy cannot be assessed in the context of a core set, since there is no &#x02018;correct&#x02019; result, ensuring some degree of consensus is paramount.</p><p>Research in social psychology has suggested that different presentations of feedback will lead to differences in change of opinion between rounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], however evidence-based guidelines on how best to provide this feedback do not exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whilst most Delphi present feedback in the form of summary statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the majority of research has focussed on the impact of the presentation of rationale in addition to summary statistics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], rather than comparing different presentations of quantitative data.</p><p>In the context of core sets and elsewhere, the selection of participants or stakeholders in a Delphi is crucial to ensure diversity in views [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. With no communication between participants the presentation of feedback is the only mechanism for reconciling different opinions of participants. However, the responses from such a heterogeneous group of participants are generally fed back as an overall average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], which will be heavily dependent on the participant mix and will conceal any disparate views between stakeholders. The process could, alternatively, be performed for each stakeholder group separately, presenting feedback from a participant&#x02019;s own stakeholder group only and differences in items prioritised using these two methods have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A better approach may be to feedback to all participants the average responses of each stakeholder group separately such that items with no consensus can be deliberated further. In a recent study, by Harman and colleagues, health professionals completed multiple rounds which included feedback from different stakeholder groups in different rounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The results suggested that the responses of parents and children and other health professional groups had a different impact on the perceived importance of outcomes compared to those of their peer group alone. This now needs to be evaluated in a randomized study.</p><p>This study presents exploratory work to consider the following hypotheses, in the context of Delphi studies for core set development:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>There is a difference between peer group only and multiple group feedback in terms of subsequent responses and the magnitude of change</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a difference between peer group only and multiple group feedback in terms of items retained at the end of a Delphi study</p></list-item><list-item><p>There is a difference between peer group only and multiple group feedback in terms of the level of agreement between stakeholder groups</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This methodological work employed three parallel randomized controlled trials, nested within the development of three core sets: a COS for surgery for colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; a COS for breast reconstruction surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; and a CIS for surgery for oesophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For all three studies, Delphi questionnaires were developed after identification of a long list of all possible outcomes from a literature review and interviews with patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The long list was mapped into outcome/information domains, which were included as individual items in a round 1 questionnaire to use in the Delphi study. Items were written in lay terms with medical terms in brackets so that they could be understood by all. Participants were asked to rate the importance of each item from 1 (not essential) to 9 (absolutely essential). For each of the core sets the Delphi process consisted of two rounds of questionnaires, completed by patients and health professionals.</p><p>Within each study, patients and professionals completing round 1 received a second questionnaire (round 2) which included, for each item, the individual&#x02019;s own score from round 1 and group feedback from round 1 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For the group feedback, participants (who were not deceased) were randomized, using a computer-generated schedule (developed by the study statistician), to receive summary data from their own stakeholder group only (&#x02018;peer&#x02019; feedback) or from both patients and health professionals separately (&#x02018;multiple&#x02019; feedback) in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization for each of the three studies was stratified by stakeholder group. The allocation schedule was used (within a mail-merge) to automatically generate the allocated questionnaire for each participant. For the colorectal and oesophageal studies feedback from round 1 consisted of mean scores, chosen for simplicity. The mean scores for each item were calculated for all patients completing the round 1 questionnaire and all health professionals completing round 1 separately. For the breast reconstruction study (which was the last to occur) the percentage scoring between 7 and 9 was used, which was felt to better demonstrate differences between the stakeholder groups than mean scores. Participants were asked to consider the feedback and re-rate the items. Decisions as to which items should be retained following each round were determined by pre-specified statistical criteria (see below). Items retained at the end of round 2 were considered further in subsequent face-to-face consensus meetings and a final core set agreed; these are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Feedback presented in round 2 questionnaires, example from oesophageal core information set (CIS).

Since analyses were conducted in three separate datasets, relating to different clinical scenarios, this also afforded some opportunity to explore whether the effects observed differed depending on the initial level of agreement between stakeholders.</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p>The nested trials were based on opportunistic samples participating in the Delphi processes of core set development, rather than any pre-determined calculation for this methodological work. As a consequence statistical testing is largely exploratory and formative.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Criteria for retaining items</title><p>At the end of round 1, items were retained for round 2 if they were scored between 7 and 9 by 50&#x000a0;% or over of respondents and between 1 and 3 by less than 15&#x000a0;%. These criteria were considered separately for patient and health professional groups. For the oesophageal core information set (which was the first set developed by the team), different versions of the round 2 questionnaire were created depending on the intended stakeholder group. The round 2 questionnaire for patients randomized to peer feedback included only items retained by patients in round 1; the questionnaire for professionals randomized to peer feedback included items retained by professionals in round 1; and all participants randomized to multiple feedback received a questionnaire including all items retained by either group. It subsequently became apparent that for the purposes of this methodological work it would have been advantageous for all participants to have received the same round 2 questionnaire. Hence, for the colorectal and breast reconstruction core sets all participants received a round 2 questionnaire including all items retained by patients or professionals.</p><p>Items to retain at the end of round 2 were considered with stricter cut-off criteria; retaining items scored between 7 and 9 by 70&#x000a0;% or over and between 1 and 3 by less than 15&#x000a0;%. Retained items were identified for patients and professionals separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Initial agreement between stakeholders</title><p>Initial agreement between patients and professionals in round 1 scores was assessed in two ways. First, for each item in turn, the percentage scoring 1 to 3, 4 to 6 and 7 to 9 was calculated for patients and professionals separately. Items were ranked depending on the percentage of participants scoring the item between 7 and 9 (defined as &#x02018;essential&#x02019;) and the &#x02018;top 10&#x02019; items compared between stakeholder groups. Second, items to be retained for round 2 (using the pre-specified criteria) were identified, and the percentage of items for which there was agreement between stakeholder groups was calculated (that is, the percentage of items retained by neither stakeholder group, or both stakeholder groups).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Differences between peer group and multiple group feedback in terms of subsequent scores and the magnitude of opinion change (hypothesis 1)</title><p>The percentage of items for which a participant changed their score between rounds 1 and 2 was calculated, along with the mean absolute change in score (ignoring the direction of change) for each participant. These were then compared between randomization groups using independent <italic>t</italic> tests. Analyses were considered separately for patients and professionals. In addition, for each item, a linear regression compared round 2 scores between feedback groups, adjusting for round 1 scores. Given the number of statistical tests performed 5&#x000a0;% of tests were expected to result in a <italic>P</italic> value&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 by chance; we therefore examined the percentage of tests with <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.05 in relation to this expected percentage.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Differences between peer group and multiple group feedback in terms of items retained at the end of the Delphi (hypothesis 2)</title><p>For each stakeholder group two-by-two contingency tables categorised the number of items retained at the end of round 2 by (i) both the peer and multiple feedback groups; (ii) the peer feedback group only; (iii) the multiple feedback group only; and (iv) neither feedback group. The percentage of items for which there was agreement between the feedback groups was calculated along with the percentage of discordant items, retained by one feedback group but not the other. This was performed separately for patients and professionals.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Differences between peer group and multiple group feedback in terms of the level of agreement between stakeholders (hypothesis 3)</title><p>For each feedback group two-by-two contingency tables categorised the number of items retained by (i) both stakeholder groups; (ii) patients only; (iii) health professionals only; and (iv) neither stakeholder group. The percentage agreement and percentage of discordant items were calculated.</p><p>To further explore the impact of feedback on subsequent consensus between stakeholders the following analyses were employed. Amongst participants randomized to peer feedback only, for each item, the absolute difference (ignoring direction) in mean patient round 2 score and mean professional round 2 score was obtained using linear regression. The regression adjusted also for participants&#x02019; round 1 score for that respective item. This was then repeated amongst participants randomized to the multiple feedback group and again the absolute difference in means between stakeholders generated for each item. The unit of analysis then became questionnaire item rather than participant, with each observation an aggregate summary statistic. Absolute mean differences (between stakeholders) across the questionnaire items were compared between the peer and multiple feedback groups using a paired <italic>t</italic> test.</p><p>Finally, responses of patients and professionals were amalgamated within each of the randomization arms (that is, completely ignoring stakeholder group) and the standard deviation calculated for each item, as a measure of the spread in responses across stakeholders, for each feedback group. This was done separately for round 1 and round 2 and the reduction in each item&#x02019;s variability between rounds calculated. Again, the unit of analysis became item with each observation an aggregate summary statistic. The mean reductions in standard deviation were then compared, across all items, between the peer and multiple feedback arms using a paired <italic>t</italic> test.</p><p>For all statistical tests 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals and <italic>P</italic> values were derived and all analyses were performed in Stata version 13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Results</title><p>The round 1 questionnaire contained 93 items for the colorectal cancer study, 34 for breast reconstruction and 67 for oesophageal cancer.

As expected given the categorisation of data, some larger differences were seen between the peer and multiple feedback groups in terms of the percentage rating an item 7&#x02013;9 (there was less than a 10&#x000a0;% difference between feedback groups for 71&#x02013;91&#x000a0;% of items across the three sets; and less than a 15&#x000a0;% difference for between 86&#x000a0;% and 99&#x000a0;% of items).

Providing feedback on both patient and professional opinion (multiple feedback group), rather than a participant&#x02019;s peer stakeholder group only, did not lead to any more or less items being re-rated in round 2 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Neither was there an impact on the average amount by which item scores were changed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There was some evidence of an impact however on actual item scores in round 2 in the two cancer surgery studies, suggesting that the direction of change in scores between rounds was related to feedback received. The differences observed did not always lead to disparity in whether items were subsequently retained (for example, where the percentage scoring 7&#x02013;9 remained&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;% in both feedback groups irrespective of differences in mean actual scores).</p><p>Items retained at the end of the Delphi process were however influenced by feedback group (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The extent of this was dependent on the initial level of agreement between stakeholder groups; with a greater impact amongst studies where initial agreement was poorer. Within the two cancer studies the impact was also dependent on stakeholder group; for example, type of feedback had a bigger impact amongst colorectal patients than professionals.</p><p>Also explored within this current work was whether providing feedback from both stakeholder groups improved overall agreement. Following feedback, differences in item scores and variability in scores between patients and professionals were smaller amongst those receiving feedback from both stakeholder groups rather than their peer group only (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref> and <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>). Again, of more importance was that agreement between patients and professionals in terms of the items retained was greatest amongst those receiving feedback from both stakeholder groups for all three studies (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).</p><p>These findings agree with and extend previous non-randomized methodological work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We are only aware of one previous study that randomized participants to receive feedback from different stakeholder groups within a Delphi process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Campbell and colleagues randomized physicians and health care managers, assessing quality indicators for primary care, to receive peer group only or whole group feedback (as opposed to both groups separately). They also observed differences between feedback groups in terms of items considered as valid measures.</p><p>In the present study, the reasons for discrepancies in items retained between the feedback groups were not always clear. For approximately a third of the discrepant items across each core set, differences between the feedback groups were minor (less than 5&#x000a0;% difference in percentage rating an item 7&#x02013;9). Some reasons for larger discrepancies were more transparent than others. For example, in round 1 of the colorectal set, patients rated passing blood higher than professionals (mean scores of 7 versus 5). In round 2, patients, seeing professional as well as patient feedback (multiple feedback) were less likely to rate it as essential than those receiving patient feedback only (55&#x000a0;% compared to 79&#x000a0;%); patients potentially reducing their initial scores in line with health professionals&#x02019; views. The reasons for other discrepancies were less clear: for example, within the colorectal set, lymph node harvest was rated lower in round 1 by patients than professionals (mean score 7 versus 8), so one might expect patients receiving professionals&#x02019; feedback to rate the item more highly in round 2. However, in round 2 only 56&#x000a0;% of the patient multiple feedback group rated it as essential compared to 74&#x000a0;% of patients in the peer feedback group. There were also examples where patient and professional feedback were identical, but subsequent discrepancies were seen between the randomization groups in round 2 scores; and examples where large differences in the round 1 feedback resulted in very little difference between the randomization groups in round 2 scores. These findings agree with work by Campbell and colleagues who conducted interviews with stakeholders involved in a Delphi exercise to develop a set of quality indicators for the organisation and delivery of primary mental health care. They found that the processes involved in interpreting a question and formulating an answer were complex and that participants often had different reasons for giving the same response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Bardecki examined the psychological structures involved in opinion change within the Delphi and suggested that the degree of cognitive dissonance (where a participant is confronted with new information that conflicts their existing beliefs) played an important role in judgements being shifted towards the summary statistic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Rowe and Wright conceptualized change in opinion as resulting from both internal Delphi process factors, such as the degree of expertise and confidence of a participant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], and external factors such as the nature of the feedback and whether the task is &#x02018;intellective&#x02019; or &#x02018;judgmental&#x02019;.</p><p>We did not collect data on participants&#x02019; understanding of core outcome sets (or for example whether professionals were also academics with familiarity in outcomes research) and differences in knowledge may lead to different prioritisation of items. Previous research has suggested that higher expertise is associated with less change in opinion between rounds and that the extent of this may depend on the nature of feedback [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Degree of change may also be associated with level of confidence in a participant&#x02019;s judgements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the present study, due to the randomization, knowledge and confidence are likely to be balanced between the randomized groups and so are unlikely to impact on our findings. This is, however, an area for further research.</p><p>For the two cancer studies, feedback was presented as a mean value (integer) in order to be easily understood. For the breast reconstruction set the percentage rating an item 7&#x02013;9 was presented as it better demonstrated discordant views between stakeholders. The actual summary statistics used may also impact on opinion change &#x02013; Bardecki describes the credibility of the summary measure (the &#x02018;communicator&#x02019; or &#x02018;anchor&#x02019;) and suggests that a perfectly credible anchor would be more likely to induce &#x02018;assimilation&#x02019;, that is a shift in judgement towards the anchor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Hence opinion change may also depend on the respondents&#x02019; perception of the credibility of the summary measure.</p><p>It has been suggested that rationale for responses should also be fed back to participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], or that only rationale should be presented to prevent participants simply conforming with the majority [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Indeed, as described earlier, the majority of feedback research has focussed on the inclusion of rationale. Meijering and colleagues randomized participants to receive rationale only or rationale plus summary statistics and found no impact on the degree of change in opinion, but interestingly less agreement amongst those receiving rationale only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We are not aware of any research comparing summary statistics with summary statistics plus rationale and it would be interesting to see if the addition of rationale impacted on subsequent rescoring.</p><p>In each of the three studies in this work there was a degree of attrition between rounds (ranging from 11&#x000a0;% to 26&#x000a0;%) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Previous research suggests that those with minority opinions are more likely to drop out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In this study, participant beliefs are likely to have been balanced between the randomized feedback groups (indeed there were few differences between the randomized groups in terms of round 1 scores) and the rate of dropout was similar within the groups (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). However, there is still some potential for attrition bias and this could be investigated further.</p><p>We chose cut-off criteria for retaining items after discussions with other academics developing core outcome sets and members of the COMET Initiative; but the definition of what constitutes consensus varies widely across studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Items retained after each round of a Delphi exercise are entirely dependent on the definition of consensus used, so consideration is needed of how different criteria might have impacted on the results. Since differences were observed in actual item scores following receipt of the peer-only and multiple feedback, there would most likely also be disagreement between the feedback groups in terms of which items should be retained, whatever consensus criteria was used.</p><p>Consideration should also be given to the participants included in the three studies. Patients and health professionals were the only stakeholders recruited as these were considered the key groups to inform the core sets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Delphi participants need to have relevant expertise in the condition or treatment to be able to prioritise items and other stakeholders such as methodologists, regulators and industry representatives may be unable to carry out this task (although they may add value to other stages of the development of a core set, such as the decision of how to measure an outcome or the implementation of a core set). The majority of participants in the three studies were from the UK, again it is plausible that in different countries patients and health professionals may react differently to feedback from each other&#x02019;s stakeholder groups, although we are unaware of any empirical evidence to support this. At present, this study provides the best evidence on which to base recommendations, but should be repeated in other settings and countries.</p><p>Feedback is a key characteristic of the Delphi process; understanding how participants perceive and use this feedback is paramount to the future optimal design of such methodology. Future qualitative work might further improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms influencing opinion change between Delphi rounds in the context of core outcome or information sets. For example, &#x02018;Think aloud&#x02019; cognitive interviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], conducted whilst participants complete a Delphi questionnaire, might focus on how a respondent makes the decision to initially score an item and how responses are subsequently influenced by feedback from different stakeholder groups. This would further inform the most appropriate methods to be used in the future.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the development of a core outcome or information set, the level of agreement between stakeholder groups depends on the feedback presented, even when initial agreement between stakeholders is high. Type of feedback will also impact on the items subsequently retained at the end of a Delphi process (used to inform subsequent consensus meetings and the final core set). We would recommend providing all participants with feedback from each stakeholder group separately, since this may improve agreement between stakeholder groups by enabling reflection on other groups&#x02019; views. Further work is needed to better understand this process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CIS, core information set; COS, core outcome set; REC, Research Ethics Committee</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1479_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Top 10 items rated essential in round 1.

All patients in each study (and health professionals within the colorectal cancer study) were informed about the study and invited to participate. Only those returning a completed consent form were then posted a round 1 questionnaire. For professionals within the breast reconstruction and oesophageal cancer studies a round 1 questionnaire was provided with initial study information and invitation to participate; in this instance the return of a completed questionnaire was deemed consent to participate, as agreed by the local ethics committee.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Williamson PR, Altman DG, Blazeby JM, Clarke M, Devane D, Gargon E, Tugwell P.
