This can be avoided by using higher doses of bupivacaine which again can produce cardiac toxicity. Studies have shown that duration of analgesia due to bupivacaine in spinal anesthesia can be prolonged by using adjuvants such as midazolam, opioids, neostigmine, dexmedetomidine, and clonidine.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Almost all opioids have been used as adjuvants intrathecally.</p><p>Most commonly used opioid in regional anesthesia is fentanyl citrate which is a &#x003bc;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003bc;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonist. It is a highly potent drug because of its high lipophilicity. It is preferred as an adjuvant in spinal anesthesia because of its rapid onset and short duration of action with minimal cephalic spread.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] However, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, respiratory depression, and urinary retention are other common side effects for which search for ideal nonopioid adjuvants goes on.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Clinical studies have suggested that intrathecal clonidine, an &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-receptor agonist, prolongs sensory and motor block in spinal anesthesia and provides prolonged postoperative analgesia. Clonidine has beneficial effects such as antiemesis, reduced postspinal shivering, anxiolysis, and sedation, thereby avoiding unwanted opioid-related side effects such as pruritus and respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Literature is divided regarding efficacy of both intrathecal clonidine and fentanyl in providing prolonged postoperative analgesia. Studies by Khezri <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Chhabra <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Sharan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] opined that intrathecal clonidine was more potent in providing prolonged analgesia compared to intrathecal fentanyl. Study by Mahendru <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that intrathecal fentanyl and clonidine were comparable regarding requirement of first analgesia request.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Another study by Bathari <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that intrathecal fentanyl was superior to intrathecal clonidine in knee arthroscopy.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hence, all the above studies differ in their postoperative sensory and motor block characteristics. Hence, the present study is being undertaken to evaluate and compare the effects of clonidine and fentanyl as intrathecal adjuvants to hyperbaric bupivacaine in patients undergoing lower limb orthopedic surgery. The primary objectives of this study were to evaluate and compare the effects of clonidine and fentanyl on time of request of first dose of rescue analgesic. Secondary objectives were to compare the effects of clonidine and fentanyl on time of onset and duration of sensory and motor block, hemodynamic status, and side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This randomized controlled study was carried out from January 2016 to January 2017, after obtaining approval from the Hospital Ethics Committee and written informed consent from the patients. Eighty patients of the American Society of Anesthesiologists Classes I or II of either sex and of age 20&#x02013;60 years of age posted for lower limb orthopedic surgery were randomly divided into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 40) using computer-generated program. Assigned random group was enclosed in a sealed envelope to ensure concealment of allocation sequence. The anesthesiologist, who was not involved in the study, opened the envelope in operation theater and prepared the drug accordingly. The observation was done by the anesthesiologist who was blinded to the drug. Patients having severe systemic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, allergy to bupivacaine, spine deformity, increased intracranial pressure, neurological disorders, hemorrhagic diathesis, and infection at the puncture site were excluded from the study. Group C &#x02013; Received hyperbaric bupivacaine (2.5 ml) +50 &#x003bc;g clonidine (diluted to 0.5 ml) administered intrathecally. Group F &#x02013; Received hyperbaric bupivacaine (2.5 ml) + fentanyl 25 &#x003bc;g (diluted to 0.5 ml) administered intrathecally. Total volume of study drug was 3 ml. Preanesthetic checkup was done, and visual analog scale (VAS) was explained to all patients. All the patients were kept nil orally for 6 h before surgery. After shifting the patients to operation theater, intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted, and preloading was done with Ringer solution (10 ml/kg). Preoperative parameters such as pulse rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were recorded. Under all aseptic precaution, spinal anesthesia was administered at the level of L3&#x02013;L4 intervertebral space in sitting position using midline approach by 25-gauge Quincke spinal needle. The anesthesiologist who administered anesthesia was blinded to the group allocation. Pulse rate, respiratory rate, electrocardiogram, SpO<sub>2</sub>, and blood pressure were monitored. Pulse rate and blood pressure variations more than 20% of baseline were noted in both groups. Bradycardia and hypotension were treated with IV atropine and ephedrine, respectively. Sensory and motor block was monitored at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 min, and after that at 15 min interval. Sensory block was tested by pinprick method. The motor block was assessed according to the modified Bromage scale: Bromage 0: Patients able to move hip, knee, and ankle, Bromage 1: Patients unable to move hip but able to move the knee and ankle, Bromage 2: Patient unable to move hip and knee but able to move the ankle, Bromage 3: Patient unable to move hip, knee, and ankle.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The onset of sensory block was taken from the time of intrathecal injection till loss of pin prick sensation at T10. Duration of sensory block was taken as time from maximum height of block till regression to Level 1. The onset of motor block was defined as time from intrathecal injection to motor blockade Level 2 in Bromage scale. Duration of motor blockade was taken as time from intrathecal injection till no motor weakness (Bromage 0). Duration of analgesia was defined as time from intrathecal injection till administration of first rescue analgesic. Any side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pain, shivering, pruritus, sedation, hypotension, bradycardia, and respiratory discomfort were noted. Patients were assessed for degree of sedation, and scoring was done with Campbell sedation score as: 1: Wide awake, 2: Awake and comfortable, 3: Drowsy and difficult to arouse, and 4: Not arousable.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Postoperatively, the pain score was recorded by using VAS between 0 and 10 (0 = no pain, 10 = severe pain).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Injection paracetamol (1 gm) was given intravenously as rescue analgesic when VAS was &#x0003e;5. Time of administering the first dose of rescue analgesia was noted.</p><p>Power analysis suggested that a sample size of forty patients per group was required to achieve a power of 80% and a level significance of 0.05 to be able to detect a difference in the mean duration of analgesia by 60 min between the groups. Interpretation of the data was carried out and analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 19, IBM Corp, NY, USA). Data was represented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation for continuous data and frequency (percentage) or median (range) for nonparametric (categorical) data. The two groups were compared using analysis of variance. The proportion of adverse effects was compared using Chi-square test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 was considered highly statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Both groups were comparable with respect to their demographic profile, baseline hemodynamic parameters, and duration of surgery [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-11-589-g001"/></table-wrap><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> compares onset and duration of sensory and motor block and duration of postoperative analgesia.

In our study, we found that intrathecal clonidine as adjuvant to bupivacaine provided prolonged analgesia compared to intrathecal fentanyl. Khezri <italic>et al</italic>. in their study concluded that intrathecal clonidine 75 &#x003bc;g with bupivacaine prolonged the time to first analgesia request compared to fentanyl which was similar to our study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Bajwa <italic>et al</italic>. in their study concluded that addition of clonidine (50 &#x003bc;g) to intrathecal bupivacaine provided prolonged postoperative analgesia in comparison to fentanyl (25 &#x003bc;g), but clonidine provided more sedation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] We have found similar finding in our study.
