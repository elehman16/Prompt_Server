Moreover, there is evidence demonstrating a significant increase in muscle blood volume after supplementation with 6 g of L-arginine orally (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These results suggest that supplementation with L-arginine may promote vasodilatation via NO-independent mechanisms.</p><p>Giugliano et al. (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) demonstrated that intravenous infusion of L-arginine (1 g min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 30 min) in healthy subjects increased blood flow and inhibited platelet aggregation. According to the authors, these effects were partially mediated by an increase in endogenous insulin (stimulated by L-arginine).</p><p>In addition to the alleged effect of increased NO synthase, L-arginine has also been studied as a possible stimulator of GH secretion. GH stimulates the production of insulin-like growth factor 1(IGF-1), which acts as an anabolic hormone by increasing protein synthesis. Colombani et al. (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) supplemented fourteen trained males with 15 g/day arginine aspartate, or placebo for 14 days before a marathon. On the day of the marathon, blood samples were collected before and after the 31 km race, and 2 h post marathon race. The authors observed a significant increase in plasma GH only in the group supplemented with L-arginine. Moreover, Fayh et al. (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) supplemented 17 subjects with 7 g of L-arginine orally for 7 days and observed no significant change in the levels of GH and IGF-1 at the end of the supplementation period.</p><p>Considering the increasing demand among physically active individuals (i.e. runners) for nutritional ergogenic aids to enhance physical performance, as well as the inconsistent data on the effectiveness of L-arginine-based nutritional supplements, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of L-arginine supplementation on the production of insulin, GH, IGF-1, and cortisol in trained runners. Moreover, the possible effect of supplementation on exercise performance as measured by the total running time (TRT) was also investigated.</p><p>It was hypothesized that L-arginine supplementation will promote changes in the hormonal (increases in insulin, GH and IGF-1 and decreases in cortisol) parameters in response to running exercise, resulting in improved exercise performance.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Sample</title><p>Fifteen physically active and healthy volunteers (four women), with at least 1 year's experience in running exercise, participated in this study.

On the day of the study, upon arriving at the training center, the volunteers remained at rest for 10 min. Blood samples were then collected for measuring the baseline (T0). Once the blood samples were collected, volunteers were immediately given a supplement that consisted of a single oral dose of 12 capsules containing 500 mg of L-arginine hydrochloride or corn starch (as placebo) each (total 6 g) in 500 mL of deionized water. Thirty minutes after supplementation, the volunteers underwent two running exercise tests that consisted of 5 km time trial (5K-TT), meaning that the volunteers were instructed to run 5 km in the shortest time possible. The recovery period between tests was 10 min and exercise performance was evaluated by measuring the TRT. In addition, blood samples were collected immediately after the first 5K-TT (T1), immediately after the second 5K-TT (T2), and after 20 min of rest (T3) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>). The experimental procedures were performed in the period from 06:00 to 09:00, and the volunteers were advised fast for at least 8 h before each visit. The volunteers were not advised to control the ingestion of macronutrients (i.e. protein, lipids, and carbohydrates) from their diet on the day before the experimental procedures. However, during this period, the volunteers did not consume any food, except water.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Overview of experimental design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="FNR-58-22569-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Analysis of blood samples</title><p>Blood samples were collected in vacuum tubes containing separator gel and clot activator and centrifuged immediately at 3,000 g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C to separate serum and were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for later analysis.

Giugliano et al.

However, during the present study, L-arginine supplementation did not affect insulin levels when compared to the placebo group over the time period of the study. The supplementation dosage and the route of administration may have influenced the lack of significant changes in insulin levels after L-arginine supplementation. Previous studies have suggested that L-arginine administered orally does not reach systemic levels because almost 40% is catabolized in the small intestine (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), which may be a possible explanation as to why some studies involving oral arginine supplementation have failed to show a significant change in the secretion of this hormone (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>There is evidence reporting exercise as a potent stimulator of GH secretion and explaining the mechanisms involved in this process (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Furthermore, some studies have suggested that the amino acid L-arginine stimulates the secretion of GH by suppressing the secretion of somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits GH release (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These studies reported that L-arginine supplementation affects the exercise-induced GH response; however, such results are controversial (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>).</p><p>The present study showed a significant increase in GH concentration in both ARG and PLA groups after running exercise, with no significant difference between the groups. It appears that the response in GH release was mediated only by exercise, and that L-arginine supplementation induced no additional changes in this hormone when associated with running exercise. This result is consistent with a study by Zajac et al.

Similarly, Forbes et al.

Since we did not observe any significant effect from acute L-arginine supplementation on the hormonal parameters investigated in the present study (e.g. increases in insulin or GH concentrations), no improvement in exercise performance could have been expected. However, it is important to point out that with the very small sample size of 15 volunteers, the present study lacked sufficient power to detect any significant effect on serum concentrations of insulin, GH, IGF-1, and cortisol between the ARG and PLA groups, even if they exist in reality. Furthermore, because three of the four women who participated in the study were randomly allocated to the L-arginine group, and the other in the placebo group, no gender effect associated with the L-arginine supplementation was possible to determine.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, it appears that oral L-arginine supplementation stimulates neither the production of insulin, GH, and IGF-1 nor the reduction of cortisol.
