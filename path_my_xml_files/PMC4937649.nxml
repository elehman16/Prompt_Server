Surgical manipulation of the bowel leads to POI<xref rid="C1">1</xref>,<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. It has been theorized that endogenous stimulation of opioid receptors can contribute to this neurally mediated reflex<xref rid="C3 C4 C5">3&#x02013;5</xref>. POI affects the entire GI tract<xref rid="C1">1</xref>,<xref rid="C6">6</xref> and is associated with prolonged hospital stays at an estimated cost of more than $1 billion annually<xref rid="C7">7</xref>.</p><p>Most patients who undergo major bowel surgery have moderate-to-severe pain requiring opioid analgesics. Opioids exacerbate and prolong POI by binding to &#x000b5;-opioid receptors in the gut, resulting in decreased propulsive peristaltic waves and delayed intestinal transit<xref rid="C1">1</xref>,<xref rid="C2">2</xref>,<xref rid="C6">6</xref>,<xref rid="C8">8</xref>,<xref rid="C9">9</xref>. Conventional treatments, including nasogastric suction, prokinetic agents, early enteral feeding, and the use of minimally invasive surgical techniques, have not been proven effective in preventing or alleviating POI<xref rid="C1">1</xref>. A pharmacologic agent that selectively antagonizes the peripheral binding of opioids in the intestine while preserving central analgesia may be a useful treatment for POI. Peripheral &#x000b5;-opioid receptor antagonists show promise in meeting these needs.</p><p>Naloxone has been shown to effectively reverse opioid-induced constipation<xref rid="C10 C11 C12">10&#x02013;12</xref>. However, because it crosses the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, it also reverses the analgesic effect of opioid treatments and produces withdrawal symptoms<xref rid="C2">2</xref>,<xref rid="C13">13</xref>. Methylnaltrexone, a peripheral &#x000b5;-opioid receptor antagonist, is a quaternary derivative of naltrexone (<xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>). Methylnaltrexone has restricted access to the blood&#x02013;brain barrier as a result of this modified structure<xref rid="C9">9</xref>,<xref rid="C14 C15 C16">14&#x02013;16</xref> and, thus, preserves central analgesia while reducing GI effects<xref rid="C1">1</xref>,<xref rid="C9">9</xref>,<xref rid="C13">13</xref>. Subcutaneous methylnaltrexone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation in patients with advanced illness who are receiving palliative care, when response to laxative therapy has been insufficient<xref rid="C17">17</xref>. Studies have demonstrated rapid laxation compared with placebo in patients with advanced illness and opioid-induced constipation<xref rid="C18">18</xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Chemical structures of morphine, the non-selective opioid antagonist naltrexone, and the selective opioid antagonist methylnaltrexone.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijda-2-127.01"/></fig><p>The present study was conducted to assess the safety and activity of intravenous (IV) methylnaltrexone used to shorten the duration of POI in patients who underwent open segmental colectomy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This multi-center randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study was conducted in hospitals from July 2003 to December 2004.

All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were attributed to an underlying disease. For vital signs and ECGs, the changes from baseline within the treatment group and the differences between treatment groups were relatively small, consistent with postoperative recovery in these patients, and not indicative of any clinically relevant effect of the investigational drug.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, patients receiving methylnaltrexone had a more rapid recovery of bowel function than those receiving placebo.</p><p>Notably, the mean time to first bowel movement was accelerated by 20&#x02009;h in patients treated with methylnaltrexone compared with those receiving placebo. Patients receiving methylnaltrexone also had shorter times to first tolerance of full liquids and solids compared with those receiving placebo, although the differences between groups did not reach statistical significance. The mean time to antiemetic use was longer for patients receiving methylnaltrexone compared with those receiving placebo, although this difference did not reach statistical significance. Many patients did not require antiemetics during the 7-day study period. The increased and earlier use of antiemetics among patients who received placebo is consistent with the increased incidence of GI AEs, such as nausea and vomiting, compared with patients who received methylnaltrexone. The use of individual endpoints of gastrointestinal function allow for a better characterization of the effect of methylnaltrexone on upper and lower bowel recovery. These results suggest that IV methylnaltrexone may improve postoperative recovery of both upper and lower GI functions.</p><p>Time to discharge eligibility was significantly shorter among patients receiving methylnaltrexone compared with placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.049 log-rank test). The difference between the treatment groups is clinically relevant and may have an added economic benefit of reducing post-surgical hospital stays. Time to discharge eligibility is a composite endpoint, defined as the ability to tolerate solid foods, passage of at least one bowel movement, normal body temperature, and the absence of major complications. Because actual discharge may be influenced by factors unrelated to POI or by factors unrelated to medical status, discharge eligibility is a more meaningful measure in this study.</p><p>Overall, methylnaltrexone was well tolerated. Patients receiving placebo were more likely to report GI AEs, as well as headache, hypoxia, hypertension, and dyspnea, compared with those receiving methylnaltrexone. Hypotension was the only AE reported notably more often among patients receiving methylnaltrexone compared with placebo. Pain, as assessed by patients using the verbal numeric scale, was similar and generally decreased over time in both treatment groups during the study. Opioid use was also similar between both treatment groups. The similarity in pain intensity rating and opioid use between the treatment groups supports the peripheral &#x000b5;-opioid receptor action of methylnaltrexone and preservation of central &#x000b5;-opioid receptor activity.</p><p>It is interesting to note that although nausea and vomiting were reported as AEs twice as often in the placebo group compared with methylnaltrexone, between-group differences were not evident on patient assessments recorded using the verbal numeric scale. The apparent inconsistency between the patient assessments and reported AEs may be explained by differences in how the data were captured. Whereas AEs were collected through spontaneous patient reports, direct questioning, laboratory assessments, and physical examination findings, the verbal numeric scale evaluated the level of nausea, vomiting, cramping, and itching specifically at the time of the assessment.</p><p>In this study, treatment with IV methylnaltrexone at a dose of 0.30&#x02009;mg/kg administered every 6&#x02009;h for up to 7&#x02009;d in patients after segmental colectomy appeared to be well tolerated. The lower incidence of GI AEs in patients treated with methylnaltrexone compared with placebo is consistent with the activity of methylnaltrexone in shortening the time to recovery from POI.</p><p>Clear identification of the return of normal bowel function following GI surgery is a challenge. Typically, motility is believed to be restored within 24&#x02009;h after surgery in the stomach and small bowel and within 48&#x02013;72&#x02009;h in the colon<xref rid="C27">27</xref>,<xref rid="C28">28</xref>. However, there is no standard definition of persistent ileus, the typical period for ileus to last, or endpoints to determine recovery of bowel function<xref rid="C7">7</xref>. Endpoints that are typically used, such as time to first tolerance of food or time to first flatus, are based on studies involving small numbers of patients. Further complicating the selection of endpoints for GI recovery is the recurrence of POI more than a day after it has resolved<xref rid="C7">7</xref>. The specific GI efficacy endpoints used in our study are intended to provide a broad characterization of complete GI recovery.</p><p>These current findings are consistent with another &#x000b5;-opioid receptor antagonist, alvimopan, which is approved in the US for acceleration of the time to upper and lower GI recovery following partial large or small bowel resection surgery with primary anastomosis<xref rid="C29">29</xref>. In clinical trials, alvimopan exhibited advantages in some GI recovery endpoints while failing to reach significance in others<xref rid="C30 C31 C32">30&#x02013;32</xref>. In contrast, results of two phase 3 studies of IV methylnaltrexone, each with &#x0223c;500 patients undergoing open segmental colectomy, failed to show an improvement in time to first bowel movement and in other GI recovery endpoints<xref rid="C33">33</xref>. The reasons for these findings are unclear, although issues related to the dose, timing of the first dose, and choice of primary outcome measure have been discussed previously<xref rid="C33">33</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this phase 2 study, IV methylnaltrexone significantly decreased the time to postoperative bowel recovery, as evidenced by a reduction in time to first bowel movement and discharge eligibility. Additional research is necessary to further assess the conditions under which methylnaltrexone may show benefit in patients with postoperative ileus.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Transparency</title><sec id="s10a"><title>Declaration of funding</title><p>This study was sponsored by Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., which has a proprietary commercial interest in methylnaltrexone.
