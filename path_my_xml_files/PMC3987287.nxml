This study aimed to determine the effects of increased RS consumption on insulin sensitivity and glucose control and changes in postprandial metabolites and body fat in T2DM. Seventeen individuals with well-controlled T2DM (HbA1c 46.6&#x000b1;2&#x0200a;mmol/mol) consumed, in a random order, either 40&#x0200a;g of type 2 RS (HAM-RS2) or a placebo, daily for 12 weeks with a 12-week washout period in between. At the end of each intervention period, participants attended for three metabolic investigations: a two-step euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with an infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose, a meal tolerance test (MTT) with arterio-venous sampling across the forearm, and whole-body imaging. HAM-RS2 resulted in significantly lower postprandial glucose concentrations (<italic>P</italic>=0.045) and a trend for greater glucose uptake across the forearm muscle (<italic>P</italic>=0.077); however, there was no effect of HAM-RS2 on hepatic or peripheral insulin sensitivity, or on HbA1c. Fasting non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic>=0.004) and NEFA suppression was greater during the clamp with HAM-RS2 (<italic>P</italic>=0.001). Fasting triglyceride (TG) concentrations and soleus intramuscular TG concentrations were significantly higher following the consumption of HAM-RS2 (<italic>P</italic>=0.039 and <italic>P</italic>=0.027 respectively). Although fasting GLP1 concentrations were significantly lower following HAM-RS2 consumption (<italic>P</italic>=0.049), postprandial GLP1 excursions during the MTT were significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>=0.009). HAM-RS2 did not improve tissue insulin sensitivity in well-controlled T2DM, but demonstrated beneficial effects on meal handling, possibly due to higher postprandial GLP1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp</kwd><kwd>GLP1</kwd><kwd>flux</kwd><kwd>stable isotopes</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is estimated that 25.8 million children and adults in the USA have diabetes (8.3% of the population), equating to a health cost of $218 billion (&#x0223c;10% of total healthcare expenditure). Lifestyle interventions, predominantly modulations to dietary intake, are the first-line strategy in diabetes treatment and remain a constant theme throughout management.</p><p>Traditionally, dietary fibers have been used to manage blood glucose concentration and have been linked to improved glycemic control in both healthy groups and those with diabetes through various meta-analyses <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">(1)</xref>. The USDA-recommended fiber intake is 14&#x0200a;g/1000&#x0200a;kcal in healthy individuals, with evidence currently lacking to recommend a higher intake in people with diabetes. This was highlighted in a scientific advisory committee (SACN) statement on nutrition that stated, although cereal fiber intake has been associated with a reduced incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and metabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance, the majority of evidence relates to T2DM prevention. While this is important given the current obesity epidemic, it cannot necessarily be translated into health benefits for those patients with T2DM <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">(2)</xref>.</p><p>Resistant starch (RS) is a type of cereal fiber and has been shown to have beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity and fatty acid (FA) metabolism in both healthy individuals and those with metabolic syndrome <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3, 4, 5, 6, 7)</xref>. However, the efficacy of RS in individuals with T2DM has not been investigated.</p><p>Animal studies have consistently shown that RS improves glucose and insulin metabolism through increased postprandial GLP1 secretion due to stimulation of the colonic enteroendocrine cells <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">(8, 9)</xref>. This can result in improved insulin secretion. Most recently our own data has shown restored first-phase insulin secretion in metabolic syndrome <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">(10)</xref>; however, the lack of translational work has recently been highlighted <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">(11)</xref>. The ADA position on RS states &#x02018;there are no published long-term studies in subjects with diabetes to prove benefits from the use of resistant starch&#x02019; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">(12)</xref>, whereas the Diabetes Nutrition Study Group of the EASD <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">(13)</xref> makes no mention of RS, stating that &#x02018;total dietary fiber should ideally be more than 20&#x0200a;g/1000&#x0200a;kcal&#x02019;. The current USA and UK fiber intakes equate to &#x0223c;7&#x0200a;g and 6&#x0200a;g/1000&#x0200a;kcal, respectively, falling short of even modest guideline daily amounts (GDA).</p><p>The primary aim of the study was to translate the beneficial effects of RS feeding reported in healthy and insulin resistant groups, into similar observations in a T2DM cohort. Using an integrated, whole-body approach, stable isotope tracers to differentiate between changes in hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake, body composition analysis using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate changes in body fat depot distribution, and a meal tolerance test (MTT) combined with arterio-venous (A-V) sampling across muscle tissue, for the first time we investigated the efficacy of increasing RS intake to achieve total fiber intakes above the GDA in individuals with T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Seventeen individuals with T2DM (12 males, five females; mean age 55 (<sc>s.e.m</sc>. 2.4) years, mean BMI 30.6 (<sc>s.e.m</sc>. 1.3) kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were enrolled in this study. All participants had well-controlled diabetes (mean HbA1c levels of 46.6 (<sc>s.e.m</sc>. 2) mmol/mol at screening) and were diet and exercise controlled (2/17), taking metformin (13/17) or metformin and pioglitazone (2/17), were weight stable, and excluded if they had a history of gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or other endocrine diseases.</p><p>The study was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures were approved by the Kent NHS Research Ethics Committee (10/H1101/29) and the University of Surrey Research Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This trial was registered via the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number 10727538.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>The study was carried out as a single-blind, randomized dietary intervention crossover study, comparing RS derived from maize with a placebo that was matched for available carbohydrate content. Participants were supplied with supplements labeled either &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B&#x02019; and were not made aware of their composition. Each supplement was consumed daily for 12 weeks with a 12-week washout period between interventions. During the last week of each intervention period, participants completed a 7-day food and drink diary and a 7-day bowel habit and symptom diary. Participants attended for three study visits at the end of each intervention: i) a two-step euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp combined with an infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose, ii) a MTT with A-V sampling across the forearm muscle, and iii) a MRI scan. The first two studies were conducted at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, UK and the third at the MRC Clinical Sciences Center, Hammersmith Hospital, UK. Before each study visit, patients consumed a standard evening meal and then fasted for 12&#x0200a;h. They were instructed to avoid strenuous exercise and alcohol for the preceding 24&#x0200a;h.</p><p>Participants were randomized to either 67&#x0200a;g Hi-maize 260 (comprising 60% RS and 40% rapidly digestible starch (RDS) providing 40&#x0200a;g type 2 RS derived from maize, as measured by The Association of Official Analytical Chemists for total dietary fiber method 991.43) or 27&#x0200a;g Amioca (100% RDS). Both supplements were supplied by Ingredion, Inc. (Bridgewater, NJ, USA) in ready-to-use sachets that were mixed into a beverage, and participants were required to consume two sachets daily to obtain the correct dosage. In the results and discussion, the Hi-maize supplement will be referred to as HAM-RS2 and the Amioca supplement as placebo.</p><sec><title>Euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp with stable isotopes</title><p>Participants arrived fasting and following voiding, body weight and composition were measured by bioimpedance (Tanita, Arlington Heights, IL, USA). An i.v. cannula was inserted into each arm for blood sampling and for the glucose, insulin, and isotope infusions. An initial blood sample was collected and a primed continuous infusion of [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose (170&#x0200a;mg; 1.7&#x0200a;mg/min) commenced. Once a steady state had been reached, five blood samples were taken between 100 and 120&#x0200a;min. At 120&#x0200a;min, the two-step euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp was started. Step one assessed hepatic (endogenous) glucose production (EGP) and involved an insulin infusion (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) of 0.3&#x0200a;mU/kg per min (low dose) for 120&#x0200a;min. Step two assessed insulin sensitivity of glucose uptake (disposal, Rd) and involved an insulin infusion of 1.5&#x0200a;mU/kg per min (high dose) for a further 180&#x0200a;min. Plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at fasting levels through a variable infusion of 20% dextrose spiked with [6,6-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>2</sub>] glucose (8&#x0200a;mg/g for low dose and 10&#x0200a;mg/g for the high dose). Blood samples were taken every 10&#x0200a;min and blood glucose concentrations measured immediately by the glucose oxidase method using the YSI 2300 STAT Plus (YSI Life Sciences, Fleet, UK). Additional samples were taken during the steady state of the low (210&#x02013;240&#x0200a;min) and high (390&#x02013;420&#x0200a;min) dose steps.</p><p>Owing to difficulties with venous access in some individuals, the data for the euglycemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinemic clamp are presented for <italic>n</italic>=15 only.</p></sec><sec><title>MTT with A-V sampling</title><p>Following a rest of 10&#x0200a;min, carotid&#x02013;femoral pulse wave velocity, brachial pulse wave analysis (including measures of mean arterial pressure, aortic pulse pressure, augmentation index, stroke volume, systolic and diastolic aortic blood pressures, and total peripheral resistance), and blood pressure were assessed using the Vicorder system (Smart Medical, Inc., La Mirada, CA, USA).</p><p>To assess the metabolism of skeletal muscle <italic>in vivo</italic>, the A-V difference across the forearm muscle was assessed as described previously <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref>.

Based on 15 participants completing this crossover study (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.05), there would be an 82% probability of detecting a treatment difference of 73.7&#x0200a;mmol/l per min in glucose area under the curve (AUC) 0&#x02013;120&#x0200a;min, based on the assumption of a treatment <sc>s.d</sc>. of 84, with postprandial glucose tolerance as the primary outcome measure. Both A-V uptake and MRI scanning were not performed due to problems with vascular access and unforeseen claustrophobia in a number of patients. Based on the actual participant numbers, the retrospective power estimate for detecting a difference in the A-V glucose uptake into muscle was 84%, based on a treatment <sc>s.d</sc>. of 58 and a measured treatment effect of 111&#x0200a;mmol/l per 100&#x0200a;ml tissue. For the MRI measures, the inter-individual variability found in this T2DM cohort was much higher than expected based on data available from those without diabetes. As such, this secondary outcome was significantly underpowered during the study, with only 21% power (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>=0.05) due to a very high treatment variable <sc>s.d</sc>. of 4.2.</p></sec><sec><title>Calculations and statistical analyses</title><p>LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">(17)</xref>.

There were no other significant differences between interventions for liver, pancreatic or AT fat depots, assessed by MRS scanning.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Although consumption of HAM-RS2 has been extensively investigated in healthy groups and those with the metabolic syndrome <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10)</xref>, this work represents the first attempt at translation of these findings into an efficacious dietary treatment for human T2DM. In individuals with well-controlled diabetes (mean HbA1c, 46.6&#x0200a;mmol/mol and target UK level for T2DM, 48&#x0200a;mmol/mol), taking oral hypoglycemics, HAM-RS2 intake resulted in a significant improvement in the meal glucose handling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) without a change in medication, habitual diet, exercise, or indeed weight loss. There was, however, no change in the HbA1c following supplementation, but as the intervention was relatively short at 12 weeks in patients already at target HbA1c levels, a longer period may be required for this to become evident.</p><p>Although a primary aim of this work was to translate positive results from individuals at increased risk of diabetes into those with the condition <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3, 7)</xref>, it is evident that there are clear differences in the responsiveness between the patient groups to the dietary change. Unexpectedly, intravenous insulin sensitivity as assessed by the hyperinsulinemic clamp technique was not affected by HAM-RS2 intake, despite a positive improvement in oral glucose handling. This disparity between i.v. and oral glucose disposal might imply a gut-mediated factor to be responsible for the effects, a phenomenon often attributed to GLP1. Indeed, GLP1, a well-defined incretin, was found to be elevated postprandially after HAM-RS2 intake, again a finding which was not found in our previous published work in those without diabetes <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">(23)</xref> but has been reported in studies of RS in animal models <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">(24)</xref>. Interestingly, there was no effect of this elevated GLP1 on postprandial insulin levels and so any effect on postprandial glucose disposal may have been through insulin-independent mechanisms. GLP1 has been shown to directly increase muscle glucose uptake in rodent models <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">(25)</xref>, with the GLP1 receptor recently localized to human skeletal muscle <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">(26)</xref>. GLP1 acutely raises nitric oxide (NO) levels and so acute changes in both microvascular recruitment <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">(27)</xref> and endothelial function <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref> at the level of the muscle are believed to be involved in this effect. In the current study, glucose uptake across forearm muscle measured directly using A-V sampling was increased following HAM-RS2 intake and against a background of elevated GLP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>) although failing to reach statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>=0.077) in the 12 patients in whom arterialized blood samples were obtained. Interestingly, on comparing data obtained from those with T2DM with results obtained using an identical technique in metabolic syndrome patients <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>, it appeared that HAM-RS2 intake improved muscle glucose uptake in T2DM patients to levels found in pre-diabetes/metabolic syndrome patients. As HAM-RS2 intake in metabolic syndrome has been shown to normalize glucose uptake to &#x02018;healthy&#x02019; levels, it could be hypothesized that a longer period of supplementation would have the potential to improve meal glucose tolerance further in T2DM than achieved during this initial 12-week investigation.</p><p>Other metabolic effects attributed to HAM-RS2 intake, such as an improved anti-lipolytic activity of insulin in AT lipolysis, have now also been confirmed in the present study. Both at fasting and under insulin stimulation during the clamp, NEFA concentration was significantly decreased, an effect previously attributed to both stimulation of AT FFA2/3 receptors directly by products of microbial fermentation <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">(29)</xref> and to changes at the transcriptional level <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>. However, it should be noted that HAM-RS2 consumption did not increase fasting serum SCFA in this study; indeed butyrate and propionate levels were significantly lowered. This may be counterintuitive, but earlier work using the same supplement in healthy individuals also found no impact on fasting SCFA concentrations <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref> and, indeed, does not discount a change in fecal/luminal concentrations, which may be involved in the increased stimulation of GLP1 through the FFAR 2/3 receptor. Indeed, recent work using microbial transfer has demonstrated that increasing butyrate-producing bacterial species, for example, does not necessarily result in an increase in butyrate production, implying that the impact of both microbes and dietary fibers is more complex than that of simple SCFA levels <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">(30)</xref>. An explanation for the lower level of propionate could be the increased clearance into peripheral tissue as demonstrated previously <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">(5)</xref> although has yet to be demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic> in diabetes. Although historically the focus of the reduction in NEFA with fiber feeding has always been in relation to AT content, paradoxically perhaps, a significant increase in S-IMCL was found despite an improvement in glucose tolerance. We have also previously shown this in people with the metabolic syndrome in whom there was a substantial nonsignificant increase (50% increase) in S-IMCL <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3)</xref>. Ectopic fat storage <italic>per se</italic> does not cause insulin resistance <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">(31)</xref> and it is hypothesized that the increased partitioning of FAs toward TG storage in a neutral-lipid droplet may be beneficial in blunting the lipotoxicity of lipid species such as ceramides, diacylglycerol (DAG), and fatty acyl coA <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">(32)</xref>. Indeed, both a single-exercise session <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">(33)</xref> and prolonged fasting <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">(34)</xref> have been shown to partition more FA toward TG synthesis in skeletal muscle, whereas weight-loss alone does not <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">(35)</xref>. In this study, the reduction in fasting plasma NEFA correlated significantly with the increase in IMCL in soleus muscle (<italic>P</italic>=0.022). Although the peripheral rate of glucose disposal from the clamp study (Rd) was not significantly different with HAM-RS2 intake, the change in Rd correlated significantly with the change in FA flux into forearm muscle. Combining these lines of evidence suggests that skeletal muscle is a major metabolic target for HAM-RS2 in T2DM, as was found previously in metabolic syndrome. It would be interesting to speculate whether the molecular changes within muscle tissue parallel those found with exercise training such as improved mitochondrial content/function <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">(36)</xref>.</p><p>In accordance with previous data from our group <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">(5, 7)</xref>, the metabolic impact of HAM-RS2 intake in diabetes would appear to be confined to the periphery (AT and muscle). A new finding in this group of individuals with diabetes was a reduction in obesity-associated inflammation independent from any changes in body fat volume <italic>per se</italic>. Again, as in our previous work in metabolic syndrome <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">(3, 7)</xref>, our current study found no evidence for an effect on hepatic TG storage or the ability of insulin to inhibit hepatic glucose output (EGP). However, it should be noted that not all the effects observed on lipids could be considered beneficial/neutral. A significant increase in plasma TG was observed in these individuals with T2DM, nonsignificant increases in TG have been observed by our group previously, when RS is used in large doses. In the current study, the increase although statistically significant is unlikely to be clinically significant as participants had TG levels within the reference range. However, the implication for individuals with baseline hyperlipidemia is unknown and warrants investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first RS feeding study in human T2DM where the metabolic effects of RS (rather than a manipulation of dietary glycemic index/glycemic load <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">(37)</xref>) have been investigated. HAM-RS2 intake improved meal glucose tolerance in patients with existing good diabetic-control due to a mechanism which appears to involve increased muscle uptake of FAs and increased S-IMCL. However, as a caveat, changes in both ectopic TG distribution and plasma TG were found, the clinical significance of which is unknown. Further work is now warranted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms within muscle tissue attributable to HAM-RS2, which would be vital in terms of recommending diet/exercise interventions to maximize the benefits for muscle glucose uptake. A larger scale intervention should now be undertaken in patients using high-fiber foods, with less well-controlled diabetes and over a longer time frame before a change to the evidenced-based dietary guidelines could be proposed.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contribution statement</title><p>C L Bodinham conducted the clinical experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript; L Smith assisted with the conduction of clinical experiments, analysis of data, and edited the manuscript; E L Thomas acquired and analyzed the data and edited the manuscript, J D Bell edited the manuscript; J R Swann acquired and analyzed the data and edited the manuscript; A Costabile acquired and analyzed the data; D Russell-Jones supervised the clinical work; A M Umpleby analyzed the data and edited the manuscript; M D Robertson assisted with the conduction of clinical experiments, analyzed the data, and wrote the manuscript.
