It causes various symptoms due to urethral obstruction and changes in the bladder musculature.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Various drugs are used in the medical treatment for BPH used singly or in combination. Alpha-adrenergic blockers, five-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARI), anticholinergics, and recently beta-3 adrenergic agonist are available in the armamentarium of the urologist for the management of patients with BPH.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Alpha-blocker and 5ARI have been shown to be beneficial in other population groups, but there is paucity of studies in the Nigerian population.

Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics committee of the hospital and written informed consent was obtained from each patient</p><p>The patients were randomized into three groups by simple random sampling. Group A (tamsulosin monotherapy), Group B (finasteride monotherapy), and Group C (combination therapy of tamsulosin and finasteride). The patients were blinded to the specific group they were in. Group A had tamsulosin 0.4 mg daily; Group B had 5 mg of finasteride daily while the combination group had both drugs. Patients on any of the drugs before this time were given a washout period of 2 weeks. The IPSS and maximum urine flow rate (Qmax) were assessed before commencement of therapy and after 3 and 6 months of therapy. The primary endpoint of the study is statistically significant improvement in IPSS, maximum urine flow rate, and reduction in prostate volume at the end of 6 months. A patient is deemed to have met a surrogate endpoint in the study if he develops acute urinary retention or withdraws from the study before the complete duration of the study. The Qmax was determined using a rotating-disc uroflowmetry by Urodyn by Mediwatchref-U2A1002-UK. The prostate volume was assessed using transabdominal ultrasound technique at the beginning, 3 months and 6 months of the study using a 3.5 MHz convex probe of Belson 200 machine by a single sonologist. The sonologist was blinded to the specific group of the patient. The prostate was measured in three dimensions (length, breadth, and height) and this is multiplied together using the prolate ellipsoid formula for volume multiplying with a factor of 0.52.</p><p>The sample size was calculated using the following formula:[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="NJS-23-5-g001.jpg"/></p><p>&#x003c3; = Standard deviation = 36</p><p>&#x003b1; = 5% level of significance = 0.05</p><p>1&#x02212;&#x003b2; = Power at 90%</p><p>d = difference observed in prostate volume[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of groups = 41</p><p>When &#x003b1; = 0.05, &#x003b2; =0.10 then (z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b1;/2</sub> + z<sub>1&#x02212;&#x003b2;</sub>)<sup>2</sup> = 10.51</p><p>Sample size was 16 by calculation but increased to 30 per group and 90 patients in all to account for attrition.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done with the aid of SPSS 20 (IBM corporation, Armonk, NewYork, United states of America). The IPSS score, prostate volume, postvoid residual (PVR) urine volume, and peak flow rate were computed and presented in table and graphical format. The categorical data were cross-tabulated and Chi-square determined for significance. For numeric data, descriptive statistics were analyzed and thereafter analysis of variance done to determine significant difference in the mean between the different groups.

For a long period, surgery was the only effective modality of treatment, but medical therapy has now been established as an effective alternate treatment.</p><p>Alpha-adrenergic blockers (A1RB) are known to cause smooth muscle relaxation in the prostate stroma and thereby relieve the dynamic cause of obstruction in BPH.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The effect of dihydrotestosterone on prostatic tissue is blocked using 5ARI. Castration prevents the development of BPH and androgen suppression causes regression of established BPH.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies in Nigerian men have evaluated the efficacy of A1RB.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] These studies, however, utilized doxazosin a nonuroselective alpha-blocker unlike the present study where the uroselective tamsulosin was used. Furthermore, the role of the 5ARI finasteride and its combination with tamsulosin was evaluated in the present study.</p><p>There was an overall improvement in IPSS in all groups studied. This is consistent with report of other workers (at 6 months) who had utilized similar agents.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The percentage reduction in IPSS at 3 months is 42.59%, 41.85%, 40.61% and at 6 months is 47.88%, 56.88%, 62.25% in the Group A, B, and C, respectively. This reduction in IPSS was statistically significant within each group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). This observation suggests that each form of therapy was effective in the reduction of IPSS. Even though no single group was better than the other; there was no statistically significant difference between the three group in efficacy of reduction in IPSS (3 and 6 months <italic>P</italic> = 0.72 and 0.97, respectively). The reduction in IPSS was most noticeable in the combination arm of the study which may represent synergism in the effect of A1RB and 5ARI.</p><p>Patients in Groups A and B experienced comparable improvement in their quality of life. Group C patients did not achieve a similar level of improvement in the quality of life scores despite achieving better reduction in IPSS. A possible explanation for this may be the higher incidence of side effects in the group.</p><p>There was progressive improvement in the flow rate in all groups at 3 and 6 months. The change in flow rate was most noticeable in Group C at 3 months and this improvement was maintained at 6 months. This early improvement may be due to the synergistic effect of the tamsulosin and finasteride. The monotherapies had a gradual increase in flow rate at 3 and 6 months. Group A had the greatest increase in flow rate while Group B had the least increase at 6 months.</p><p>The mechanism of action of A1RB which causes rapid relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate within 24 h compared with 5ARI causes a reduction in prostate volume over months by inhibiting the production of dihydrotestosterone may be responsible.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Other studies have also reported better flow rates in patients on combination therapy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In this study, the flow rate was better in Group C at 3 months; however, they were similar in Group A and C at 6 months.</p><p>This study documented a reduction in prostate volume in the Group B and C at 6 months which is consistent with the report of others.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The short duration of this study may, however, be the reason for failure of this to achieve statistical significance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. Combination therapy group (Group C) achieved similar reduction in prostate volume as the finasteride monotherapy group (Group B); thereby reinforcing the belief that the reduction in prostate volume is being mediated by the 5ARI.</p><p>Finasteride is known to induce epithelial involution in the prostate gland and thereby cause a reduction in prostate volume. There was, however, a gradual increase in prostate volume in Group A at 3 and 6 months, this implies that tamsulosin does not cause involution of the prostate. This is in keeping with the known mechanism of action of A1RB in the prostate.</p><p>A study by Gormley <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated an 19% reduction in prostate volume over 12 months in patients given 5 mg of finasteride. He utilized magnetic resonance imaging for his measurements. Another study by Nacey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] recorded most of the reduction in the prostate volume occurring in the first 3 months; he demonstrated a reduction in prostate volume of 27% at 12 months in patients on 5 mg of finasteride. We have demonstrated a reduction in prostate volume in Groups B and C of 10.22% and 11.83%, respectively, at 6 months although further comparison to these other studies may be limited by the shorter duration of this study. We utilized transabdominal USS while other studies[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have utilized transrectal USS. However, Malemo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] has demonstrated that transabdominal USS and transrectal USS have similar accuracy in the assessment of prostate volume. We elected to use transabdominal USS because it is easily available and more convenient for the patient.</p><p>Only 72% of patients completed the study. This high attrition rate is noted in similar studies although these were for longer periods.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Study protocol violation with concomitant use of herbal concoction was common in Nigerian patients. Although patients experienced various side effects only erectile dysfunction in two patients in the combination arm led to withdrawal from the study. This is similar to findings in a longer study where withdrawal due to drug-related side effects was more in the combination arm and erectile dysfunction was also noted more in the combination arm.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Overall side effects including headaches, reduction in ejaculate volume, loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction were more in Group C. Similar observation was also reported in the CombAT study.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The CombAT study,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] however, utilized dutasteride while finasteride was used in this study.</p><p>The conclusions drawn from the study may be limited by the fact that there was no placebo arm and the study duration was limited to 6 months. Therefore, only short-term effects could be assessed. We would recommend longer studies with a placebo arm in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>onclusion</sc></title><p>Tamsulosin monotherapy is recommended in men who want rapid improvement in flow rate but wish to avoid side effects of 5ARI.
