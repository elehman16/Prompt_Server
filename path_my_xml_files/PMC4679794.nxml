Usually, it requires at least a short-term hospitalization and is associated with significant risk of serious complications, such as aortic dissection, bleeding, stroke, heart attack or death. Currently, approximately 50% of all invasive coronary angiographies do not end with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) because of the absence of significant coronary artery lesions. It is desirable to eliminate such situations.</p><p>In 2010 Patel <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] stated that CAD can be diagnosed in only 37.6% of patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography. The Board of Association of Cardiovascular Interventions of the Polish Cardiac Society reported that approximately 45% of all invasive coronary angiographies (88 993 procedures) carried out in 2011 in Poland did not end with PCI. More recent data from the ACROSS Registry show that significant stenoses are found in 51% of patients undergoing coronary angiography and that PCI is performed in only 46.7% of patients undergoing the invasive examination [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>There is an alternative, non-invasive method useful for exclusion of significant CAD, which is coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). It is currently recommended for individuals with intermediate CAD pre-test probability (15&#x02013;50%). Higher pre-test probability of CAD is currently a contraindication to CCTA. Limitations associated with the use of CCTA are explained by insufficient predictive value of currently used standard hardware, which is a 64-row CT scanner. The latest CT scanners (more than 64 rows) are characterized by spatial resolution of 0.3 mm (Somatom Definition FLASH, Siemens, Forchheim, Phillips Brilliance ICT), which is very similar to the level of invasive angiography resolution of 0.2 mm.</p><p>Similarly to invasive coronary angiography, during CCTA the patient is exposed to iodine contrast and X-rays. The effective dose of radiation and contrast amount in the non-invasive study carried out with the use of a modern CT scanner is often even lower than during the invasive examination, amounting to 5&#x02013;6 mSv and 50&#x02013;80 ml of contrast agent.</p><p>The dynamic development of CT techniques, increased spatial resolution, reduced artifacts, and reduction of radiation dose and contrast amount, allow more accurate and safer imaging of coronary arteries [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>The Institute of Cardiology was one of the first centers in the world to show the usefulness of CCTA in planning of coronary interventions [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In cardiac centers developing an extensive program of CT-based CAD diagnosis, a reduced number of uncompleted coronary interventions is noticeable.</p><sec id="S20002"><title>Review of ESC guidelines</title><p>Current ESC recommendations concerning stable CAD indicate invasive coronary angiography as the first choice method in patients with a high pre-test probability of CAD. It is assumed that patients meeting the above criteria in most cases are candidates for further interventional treatment of CAD. Optimally, invasive investigation should not be undertaken unless further invasive treatment of CAD is not necessary. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, the traditional diagnostic model results in a high proportion of invasive coronary angiographies, which do not result in further therapeutic procedures (around 50%). The reason for that may be the lack of significant stenoses, the presence of significant stenoses which are not eligible for interventional treatment, or inadequate preparation of the patient for ad-hoc percutaneous treatment.</p><p>We hypothesize that use of CCTA as the first choice method in the diagnosis of patients with high pre-test probability of CAD may reduce the number of invasive coronary angiographies not followed by interventional treatment. The CCTA also seems not to be connected with additional risks and costs of the diagnosis. Confirmation of these assumptions may impact cardiology guidelines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S0003"><title>Aim</title><p>This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, single center trial designed to evaluate superiority of CCTA to classic invasive coronary angiography (concerning effectiveness and safety) in the diagnosis of patients with high pre-test probability of stable CAD according to ESC recommendations.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0012"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on the literature, it appears that the use of modern CT systems in patients with high pre-test probability of CAD, as well as appropriate clinical interpretation of the imaging study by invasive cardiologists, enables precise planning of invasive therapeutic procedures. The proposed diagnostic schema, with the use of CT as the first choice method in CAD diagnosis, may substantially reduce the number of invasive procedures. Moreover, it can enable more precise planning of potential treatment options, increase the comfort and safety of patients, and reduce the time and cost of the diagnostic and therapeutic cycle. Achieving these objectives should be possible by simplifying the diagnostic path and eliminating invasive procedures not followed by intervention. Our randomized study will provide data to verify these assumptions.</p><p>Clinical Trials number: NCT02591992.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S0013"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Patel</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><name><surname>Peterson</surname><given-names>ED</given-names></name><name><surname>Dai</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Low diagnostic yield of elective coronary angiography</article-title><source>N Engl J Med</source><year>2010</year><volume>362</volume><fpage>886</fpage><lpage>95</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20220183</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Borges Santos</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>de Ara&#x000fa;jo Goncalves</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Diagnostic yield of current referral strategies for elective coronary angiography in suspected coronary artery disease-an analysis of the ACROSS registry</article-title><source>Rev Port Cardiol</source><year>2013</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>483</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23746396</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0003"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Ara&#x000fa;jo Gon&#x000e7;alves</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Jer&#x000f3;nimo Sousa</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Cal&#x000e9;</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Effective radiation dose of three diagnostic tests in cardiology: single photon emission computed tomography, invasive coronary angiography and cardiac computed tomography angiography</article-title><source>Rev Port Cardiol</source><year>2013</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>981</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24287017</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0004"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pregowski</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kepka</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Kruk</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comparison of usefulness of percutaneous coronary intervention guided by angiography plus computed tomography versus angiography alone using intravascular ultrasound end points</article-title><source>Am J Cardiol</source><year>2011</year><volume>108</volume><fpage>1728</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21906708</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0005"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Opolski</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name><name><surname>Kepka</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Witkowski</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Coronary computed tomographic angiography for prediction of procedural and intermediate outcome of bypass grafting to left anterior descending artery occlusion with failed visualization on conventional angiography</article-title><source>Am J Cardiol</source><year>2012</year><volume>109</volume><fpage>1722</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22481017</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0006"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Task Force Members</collab><name><surname>Montalescot</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Sechtem</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Achenbach</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>2013 ESC guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease: the Task Force on the management of stable coronary artery disease of the European Society of Cardiology</article-title><source>Eur Heart J</source><year>2013</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>2949</fpage><lpage>3003</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23996286</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
