For patients with mild-to-moderate hyperglycemia, postprandial blood glucose is a better predictor of HbA<sub>1c</sub> than fasting blood glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Both gastric emptying and the action of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are major determinants of postprandial glucose excursions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Gastric emptying determines the rate of nutrient delivery to the small intestine, accounting for approximately one-third of the variation in the initial rise in glycemia after oral glucose in both healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and those with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). GLP-1 and GIP, released predominantly from the distal and proximal gut, respectively, are the known mediators of the incretin effect, whereby much more insulin is stimulated by enteral compared with intravenous glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In type 2 diabetes, the incretin effect is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), related at least partly to a diminished insulinotropic effect of GIP, while that of GLP-1 is preserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In addition, GLP-1 slows gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suppresses glucagon secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and reduces energy intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Therefore, incretin-based therapies for diabetes have hitherto focused on GLP-1.</p><p>One promising strategy to stimulate endogenous GLP-1 is the &#x0201c;preload&#x0201d; concept, which involves administration of a small load of macronutrient at a fixed interval before a meal so that the presence of nutrients in the small intestine induces the release of gut peptides, including GLP-1, to slow gastric emptying and improve the glycemic response to the subsequent meal. Fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) preloads achieve these goals but entail additional energy intake. We recently demonstrated in healthy subjects the potential for poorly absorbed sweeteners, which yield little energy, to stimulate GLP-1 secretion and slow gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p><sc>d</sc>-Xylose is a pentose sugar, which is incompletely absorbed by passive diffusion in human duodenum and jejunum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), with the remainder delivered to the ileum and the colon, where bacterial fermentation occurs, producing hydrogen that can be detected in the breath (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). We recently showed that oral consumption of <sc>d</sc>-xylose stimulates GLP-1 secretion to a greater and more sustained degree than glucose in healthy older subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), consistent with the principle that the length and region of small intestine exposed to carbohydrate are important determinants of GLP-1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). <sc>D</sc>-Xylose also slowed gastric emptying compared with water, with efficacy similar to that of the glucose load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Intact GLP-1 is short-lived in the circulation largely because of rapid degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and orally administered DPP-4 inhibitors, such as sitagliptin, increase postprandial plasma concentrations of intact GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). However, the concept of stimulating endogenous GLP-1 with enteral nutrients and then optimizing its action with a DPP-4 inhibitor has received little attention. Moreover, little consideration has been given as to whether the composition of the diet influences the efficacy of DPP-4 inhibition to lower postprandial blood glucose.</p><p>The current study was designed to determine, in patients with type 2 diabetes, whether a <sc>d</sc>-xylose preload would slow gastric emptying, stimulate GLP-1 secretion, and improve postprandial glycemia and whether these effects could be enhanced by DPP-4 inhibition.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve patients with type 2 diabetes (9 males and 3 females), managed by diet alone, were studied after they had provided written informed consent. The mean &#x000b1; SE age was 66.2 &#x000b1; 1.4 years, BMI 28.9 &#x000b1; 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.6 &#x000b1; 0.2% (48.9 &#x000b1; 2.5 mmol/mol), and duration of known diabetes 4.9 &#x000b1; 1.1 years. None had significant comorbidities, were smokers, or were taking any medication known to affect gastrointestinal function. The protocol was approved by the human research ethics committee of the Royal Adelaide Hospital and was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki as revised in 2000.</p><p>Each subject was studied on four occasions, separated by at least 3 days, in randomized double-blind fashion. On the evening before each study day (&#x0223c;1900 h), each subject consumed a standardized evening meal (McCain&#x02019;s frozen beef lasagna, 2,170 kJ; McCain Foods Proprietary, Victoria, Australia). At &#x0223c;2200 h, subjects took a tablet of either 100 mg sitagliptin (Januvia; Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme) or matching placebo, and compliance was reinforced with a reminder phone call that evening.</p><p>Subjects then fasted until the following morning, when they attended the laboratory at &#x0223c;0800 h and were seated comfortably for the duration of the study. An intravenous cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein for repeated blood sampling. On each study day, between <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;40 and &#x02212;38 min, they consumed a 200-mL preload drink containing either 50 g <sc>d</sc>-xylose or 80 mg sucralose (a control of equivalent sweetness, which we have shown not to stimulate GLP-1 secretion or slow gastric emptying in healthy humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]), so that the four treatments were sitagliptin plus <sc>d</sc>-xylose (SX), sitagliptin plus control (SC), placebo plus <sc>d</sc>-xylose (PX), and placebo plus control (PC). Forty minutes later (between <italic>t</italic> = 0 and 5 min), they ate a solid meal consisting of 65 g powdered potato (Deb Instant Mashed Potato; Continental, Epping, Australia) and 20 g glucose, reconstituted with 200 mL water and 1 egg yolk containing 100 &#x003bc;L <sup>13</sup>C-octanoic acid. Breath samples were collected immediately before and every 5 min after meal ingestion in the first hour and every 15 min for a further 3 h for the measurement of gastric emptying. Venous blood samples and additional breath samples before the preload drink (at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;40 min) and at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;20, 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min were taken for the measurements of blood glucose, insulin, intact GLP-1, and breath hydrogen.</p><p>Blood samples for insulin were collected in serum tubes. For the measurement of intact GLP-1, venous blood was collected into ice-chilled EDTA tubes containing DPP-4 inhibitor (DPP4-010; Linco Research, St. Charles, MO) (10 &#x003bc;L/mL blood). Samples were mixed six times by gentle inversion and stored on ice before centrifugation at 3,200 rpm for 15 min at 4&#x000b0;C within 15 min of collection.

The magnitude of the reduction in postprandial blood glucose achieved by the combination of <sc>d</sc>-xylose preload and sitagliptin in our group of patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes was substantial (i.e., reduction in peak blood glucose of &#x0223c;2.5 mmol/L), and moreover, there was a marked reduction in indices of glycemic variability; the latter is associated with oxidative stress and may independently increase cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>We chose <sc>d</sc>-xylose as the preload, since it is incompletely absorbed and poorly metabolized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and, accordingly, additional energy intake is minimized in contrast to preloads such as fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Consistent with our previous report in healthy older subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), ingestion of <sc>d</sc>-xylose resulted in a modest increase in blood glucose and serum insulin, possibly as a result of enhanced gluconeogenesis. Sucralose was selected as a sweet-tasting negative control, since we have shown that this artificial sweetener when given acutely has no effect on either the secretion of GLP-1 or gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>), and indeed in the current study, there was no increase in intact GLP-1 before the meal on the days when sucralose was given. The osmolarity of the preloads could not readily be matched without changing the taste and this may have contributed to the effect of the <sc>d</sc>-xylose preload on gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) but is unlikely to account for differences in GLP-1 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>As expected, <sc>d</sc>-xylose was associated with stimulation of GLP-1 in advance of the meal. It has been postulated that intestinal fermentation to form free fatty acids represents an important mechanism for the stimulation of GLP-1 release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>); the latter could be indirectly quantified by resultant hydrogen production in breath samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our demonstration of a relationship between GLP-1 concentrations and hydrogen production is consistent with this concept. However, the fact that GLP-1 concentrations began to increase within 20 min of <sc>d</sc>-xylose ingestion suggests that other mechanisms, involving, for example, the passage of <sc>d</sc>-xylose through the monosaccharide transporters GLUT2 and GLUT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), are likely involved. It may appear surprising that plasma intact GLP-1 levels after the potato meal did not differ between the <sc>d</sc>-xylose and control preload study days, when sitagliptin was not given. However, the magnitude of GLP-1 secretion is dependent on the rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) and load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) of nutrient entry to the small intestine, so that the slowing of gastric emptying induced by the <sc>d</sc>-xylose preload may well have attenuated the component of the postprandial GLP-1 response attributable to the meal.</p><p>We observed that the magnitude of the initial postprandial glycemic excursion was inversely related to the gastric half-emptying time, consistent with evidence that the rate of gastric emptying is a major determinant of postprandial glycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In the absence of sitagliptin, the reduction in postprandial glycemia by <sc>d</sc>-xylose is probably attributable mainly to the slowing of gastric emptying, since postprandial intact GLP-1 concentrations were no greater than on the control day. The observed decrease in postprandial insulin concentrations after <sc>d</sc>-xylose in contrast to control, particularly when corrected for differences in blood glucose (i.e., the insulin-to-glucose ratio), is consistent with what would be expected when gastric emptying of the potato meal is slower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The slowing of gastric emptying after the <sc>d</sc>-xylose preload was associated with stimulation of GLP-1 in advance of the meal, although postprandial intact GLP-1 concentrations were not increased in the absence of sitagliptin. Since endogenous GLP-1 is known to slow gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), the elevated GLP-1 may have contributed to the slower gastric emptying after <sc>d</sc>-xylose, at least during the initial phase. Nevertheless, the combination with sitagliptin, which increased plasma concentrations of intact GLP-1, had no additional effect on the rate of gastric emptying&#x02014;a finding that is consistent with our recent report of the lack of effect of 2-day dosing with sitagliptin on gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This is likely to be because gastric emptying is modulated by multiple mechanisms. For example, acute hyperglycemia, even within the physiological range, is known to slow gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), and sitagliptin, particularly when combined with <sc>d</sc>-xylose, potently decreased postprandial glycemia. Moreover, peptide YY (PYY), which is cosecreted with GLP-1 from enteroendocrone L cells, has the capacity to slow gastric emptying. PYY 1-36 and 3-36 are the predominant biologically active forms in the circulation; the latter is formed from degradation of PYY 1-36 by DPP-4 and is reportedly more potent at retarding emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Therefore, DPP-4 inhibition might, to some extent, blunt PYY- mediated slowing of gastric emptying.</p><p>In contrast, addition of sitagliptin did not affect gastric emptying but was associated with lowering of postprandial glycemia. Despite the fact that plasma intact GLP-1 concentrations were increased after sitagliptin, particularly when given in combination with <sc>d</sc>-xylose, the insulin response to the meal did not increase in parallel. This is partly accounted for by the fact that the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 is glucose dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), but there is also evidence that mechanisms other than insulin secretion are likely to be important in mediating the glucose-lowering effect of GLP-1; the latter include suppression of both glucagon secretion and endogenous glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and enhancement of peripheral glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>).</p><p>It is noteworthy that there has been little consideration of how dietary intake interacts with the actions of DPP-4 inhibitors. The current study is therefore novel in demonstrating how consumption of a specific nutrient can improve the efficacy of a DPP-4 inhibitor for reducing postprandial glycemia. Although the number of subjects studied was relatively small, the observed effects were consistent between subjects and were in keeping with previous observations relating to the slowing of gastric emptying by <sc>d</sc>-xylose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and glucose lowering by sitagliptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our study represents an acute intervention in a relatively well-controlled group of patients with type 2 diabetes managed by diet alone. In view of the positive outcomes, it would be of particular interest to investigate this approach in type 2 diabetic patients taking metformin, given the synergistic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors with metformin for increasing intact GLP-1 and improving glycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), and to extend our observations to larger and more diverse groups of type 2 diabetic patients over a longer duration.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
