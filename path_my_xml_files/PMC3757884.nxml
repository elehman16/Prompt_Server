All teeth were free of any caries, breakage or enamel problems at buccal or lingual surfaces. Following rinsing with water, the teeth were kept in 0.5% chloramine-T solution. Depending on the rinsing angle, the teeth were divided into six groups as follows: Group I (with a rinsing angle of 90&#x000b0;); Group II (with a rinsing angle of 75&#x000b0;); Group III (with a rinsing angle of 60&#x000b0;); Group IV (with a rinsing angle of 45&#x000b0;); Group V (with a rinsing angle of 30&#x000b0;); and Group VI (with a rinsing angle of 15&#x000b0;). Following this division, the teeth in each of the groups were sub-divided into two groups as follows: Buccal (five teeth) and palatal (five teeth) randomly. Next, the teeth roots were mounted in plaster blocks (Vel-Mix Stone, Kerr, Italy) with a diameter of 2.5 cm and a height of 2 cm. They were mounted in such a way that the height of contour of the surfaces were almost in vertical positions. Tow fissures, one vertically and one horizontally were cut by a high speed hand piece to indicate the location, which was etched and rinsed. By means of a low speed hand piece, the examination sites on the teeth were cleaned or 10 sec. In this step, the teeth were microscopically tested for a second time to find any enamel problems. In order to clarify the rinsing angle exactly, a syringe on a moving protractor in a distance of 2 cm of the tooth surface was fixed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. A barometer, on the water pouring system, helped to uniform the water pressure, pouring on all samples. After 20 sec of etching (by Scotch Bond, 3M, St Paul, MN, USA), the teeth surfaces were rinsed for 20 sec at each of the angles mentioned above. The teeth were dried in such a way that the chalky-white enamel surface was visible. To put the sealants (Concise, 3M, ESPE, USA) on the etched surfaces, transparent plastic pipes with an internal diameter of 3.6 mm and a height of 4 mm were used. Finally, following sealant placing in the plastic cylinders and curing them, the plastic matrix was dissected by the scalpel blade and finally separated. A cylinder with a diameter of 3.5 and a height of 4 mm was remained on the buccal or palatal surface of the teeth. The roots were dissected from 2 cm below the C.E.J. by a diamond discus (D and Z diamond, Germany) and separated. All samples were kept in distilled water for 24 h, before being prepared for micro tensile bond test.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A water syringe mounted onto a protractor to determine the exact rinsing angle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-4-213-g001"/></fig><p>The teeth were sectioned in X and Y directions to obtain bonded sticks with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1.0 mm<sup>2</sup>, measured to the nearest 0.01 mm with a digital caliper (Mitutoyo Corp, Japan).</p><p>The samples were then fixed on the plate of the micro tensile test machine (Bisco Inc., USA) conforming to the midline of the plates.

A move in this direction is needed as the interest of the dental profession in preventive dentistry is increasing. Considerable research has been undertaken to optimize the bond strength between resin based dental materials and dental enamel. The ability of the resin to penetrate between the enamel crystallites and rods is a determinant of the bond strength between the resin and the etched enamel.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] To enhance the enamel surface free-energy and resin penetration, it is important to remove all etched remnants in the enamel porosity.</p><p>Here, we showed that a general trend exists between reduction in bond strength and the rinsing angle from 90&#x000b0; to 15&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. It seems that the increased tensile bond strengths, associated with the more thorough washing, were due to the increased rinsing angle. As shown in [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>], at 90&#x000b0;, the complete evacuation of the etching products can be achieve while the persistence of deposit remnants on enamel surface might possibly be a consequence of reduction in the rinsing angle. These data; therefore support the hypothesis that failure to remove the etched enamel surface deposits markedly reduces bonding between the sealant and the enamel. Indeed, scanning electron microscopy of etched enamel surfaces has shown the presence of such deposits after inadequate washing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>The possible effect of different rinsing angles on removing the etch products.

In our study, the mean micro tensile bond strength varied between 23 Mpa and 24.98 Mpa [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In spite of such high bond strength, no cohesive failure was observed in the enamel. This behavior may be attributed to the micro tensile test characteristics, which have been shown to produce a more homogeneous stress distribution and to the prismatic orientation of the intact enamel surface, which is mostly perpendicular to the enamel periphery and parallel to the applied stress.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] These will result in higher bond strength and fewer cohesive failures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] A possible explanation for the cohesive failures occurred in Groups I and II [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>] may be the higher bond strength in these groups, which was probably stronger than the ultimate tensile bond strength of the adhesive,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] leading to failures in sealant material. A reduction in the rinsing angle was coupled with more adhesive failures, which would be attributable to the lower bond strength observed in the acute angles.</p><p>Light stereo microscopy of the specimens revealed that the presence of more sealant remnants at the failure site when a rinsing angle of 90&#x000b0; was used. Furthermore, the percentage resin remnants decreased with a reduction in the rinsing angle. This indicates that bond failures in acute angles occur more frequently at the enamel adhesive interface consistent with the other findings in this study, showing that rinsing at 90&#x000b0; results in improved adhesion of sealant to the enamel surface. It should be further noted that in view of the fact that many researchers consider a clinically successful bond as being between 15 Mpa and 35 Mpa,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] it seems that there was acceptable bond strength in the acutest rinsing angles. Since many variables encountered in the clinical cases cannot be controlled for <italic>in-vitro</italic>, we are unable to make direct inferences from the information obtained in this study to the clinical cases. Therefore, future clinical trials that assess the longevity of sealants placed subsequent to washing with different rinsing angles are necessary.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of this <italic>in-vitro</italic> study, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>
