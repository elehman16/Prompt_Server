Failure to support teachers adequately may lead to serious long-term mental disorders, poor performance at work (presenteeism), sickness absence and health-related exit from the profession. It also jeopardises student mental health, as distressed staff struggle to develop supportive relationships with students, and such relationships are protective against student depression. A number of school-based trials have attempted to improve student mental health, but these have mostly focused on classroom based approaches and have failed to establish effectiveness. Only a few studies have introduced training for teachers in supporting students, and none to date have included a focus on improving teacher mental health. This paper sets out the protocol (version 4.4 20/07/16) for a study aiming to address this gap.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Cluster randomised controlled trial with secondary schools as the unit of randomisation. Intervention schools will receive: i) Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) training for a group of staff nominated by their colleagues, after which they will set up a confidential peer support service for colleagues ii) training in MHFA for schools and colleges for a further group of teachers, which will equip them to more effectively support student mental health iii) a short mental health awareness raising session and promotion of the peer support service for all teachers. Comparison schools will continue with usual practice. The primary outcome is teacher wellbeing measured using the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS). Secondary outcomes are teacher depression, absence and presenteeism, and student wellbeing, mental health difficulties, attendance and attainment. Measures will be taken at baseline, one year follow up (teachers only) and two year follow up. Economic and process evaluations will be embedded within the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an intervention that supports secondary school teachers&#x02019; wellbeing and mental health, and improves their skills in supporting students. It will also provide information regarding intervention implementation and sustainability.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN95909211">ISRCTN95909211</ext-link> registered 24/03/16</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3756-8) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cluster randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Secondary school</kwd><kwd>Mental health</kwd><kwd>Wellbeing</kwd><kwd>Teacher</kwd><kwd>Adolescence</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Health Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>13/164/06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kidger</surname><given-names>Judi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002141</institution-id><institution>Public Health England</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Public Health Wales</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Bristol City Council</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Teacher mental health and wellbeing</title><p>Teachers are consistently reported to be at increased risk of common mental health disorders compared to other occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Findings from the WISE pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] showed secondary school teachers scored approximately 0.5 standard deviations lower than the general working population on the Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further, 19.4&#x000a0;% of the sample scored as moderately to severely depressed on the 9 item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) compared to a general population prevalence of 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Failure to attend to heightened levels of stress and distress may lead to longer term mental health problems, poor performance at work (presenteeism), sickness absence, and health-related retirement in teachers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This has implications not only for teachers&#x02019; own health, but for the quality of staff-student relationships and for student health. Teachers with poor mental health have been reported to find it difficult to manage classes effectively, and to develop supportive relationships with students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Difficult teacher-student relationships in secondary school have been found to predict psychiatric disorder and exclusion from school three years later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Conversely, supportive teacher-student relationships predict lower student depression, and higher student classroom engagement, leading to higher achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Young people in the UK have amongst the worst wellbeing in Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] with almost 10&#x000a0;% having a clinically diagnosed mental health condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and as many as 18&#x000a0;% of 16&#x02013;17 year olds engaging in self-harm behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Teachers are the professionals who have the most contact with children and young people regarding mental health issues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and therefore are in a prime position to provide support. However, where teachers experience poor wellbeing this reduces their belief that they can help students with emotional or behavioural problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further, teachers report a lack of training in how to support such students effectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], which is a source of stress in itself.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>School-based mental health interventions</title><p>A number of school interventions have focused on improving student mental health in recent years, but these have primarily used classroom based psychological or educational programmes. Two systematic reviews found that such interventions had modest effects on reducing student depression and anxiety, but that more evidence is needed beyond small efficacy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One large scale implementation study recently conducted in the UK, aiming to reduce depression among secondary school students using cognitive behavioural therapy, found no effects, with the authors concluding that there is insufficiently strong evidence to support such universal, classroom-based approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Fewer studies have focused on intervening in aspects of school life beyond curriculum content. Two high quality randomised controlled trials evaluated the impact of a &#x02018;whole school approach&#x02019; on student mental health - in which attempts were made to change the school climate alongside curriculum content - neither of which found positive results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It has been suggested that designing a very broad and flexible approach, such as that taken in these studies, creates too much variability in intervention implementation across schools, which may limit effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Interventions may be more effective if they focus on changing a smaller number of more specific components of school life that are known to be important to mental health.</p><p>As noted above, two potential areas for intervention which may improve both teacher and student mental health are increasing support for teachers themselves and developing teachers&#x02019; skills in supporting students. The Incredible Years Teacher Classroom Management programme focuses on improving teacher support for positive student behaviour through increasing their skills in supportive classroom techniques within primary schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Pilot trials in the UK have reported promising results in terms of reduced negative behaviours among children with poorer mental health, a reduction in teachers&#x02019; negative behaviours towards such children, improved teacher self-efficacy and improved teacher emotional health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. No randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have examined such an intervention at secondary school level. However, two studies have evaluated the effect of delivering mental health training to secondary school teachers. The SEYLE study, a three arm cluster RCT across ten European countries, compared the effectiveness of training teachers to recognise and support students at risk of suicide, with i) raising student awareness about mental health and suicide and ii) screening by professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Only the student training intervention showed statistical evidence of an impact on suicide ideation and attempts, and the authors suggest that the ineffectiveness of the teacher training element may have been due to poor teacher wellbeing reducing their ability to support students. An earlier RCT evaluated the impact of delivering youth Mental Health First Aid (youth MHFA) training to school staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. MHFA was developed in Australia with the aim of equipping lay people to recognise the signs and symptoms of common mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Youth MHFA has the same aims but is targeted at individuals who work with teenagers. This study found positive changes in staff mental health knowledge, attitudes and confidence in helping, but no change in reported helping behaviours or student mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. However, as with the SEYLE study, there was no intervention to support the mental health of the teachers themselves.</p><p>In summary, there is a need to develop and evaluate secondary school mental health interventions that focus on both teacher mental health and wellbeing, and the support that teachers are equipped to provide to students. We piloted such an intervention in a small cluster randomised trial (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;six schools) where: i) a group of secondary school staff were trained in standard Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), and set up a confidential peer support service for their colleagues ii) a further group of staff within the same school received youth MHFA training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable to schools, although suggestions for improvement were made: reducing the length of the youth MHFA training and targeting tutors and classroom teachers to attend, ensuring the peer support service was promoted sufficiently and supported by senior leaders, and making certain that peer supporters were not overloaded with the extra responsibility. The pilot study also enabled us to test the feasibility of key aspects of the trial design. We found that schools from a range of socioeconomic catchment areas were able to be recruited and retained, it was possible to collect self-report measures of staff and student wellbeing and mental health, and staff presenteeism and absence, and high response rates were achieved if data collections were organised during staff meetings/class time. Following the Medical Research Council&#x02019;s (MRC) framework for the evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], we concluded that it would be feasible and justifiable to conduct a full RCT of the intervention, to evaluate its impact on teacher and student outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study aim</title><p>To evaluate the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of an intervention that provides peer support for secondary school teachers, and teacher training in Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) for Schools and Colleges, using an RCT design with embedded process and economic evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary objective</title><p>To establish if the WISE intervention leads to improved teacher emotional wellbeing compared to usual practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>To address the following research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Does the WISE intervention lead to lower levels of teacher depression, absence and presenteeism, improved student wellbeing, attendance and attainment, and reduced student psychological difficulties compared to usual practice?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Do any effects of the intervention differ according to geographical&#x000a0;area and the proportion of children receiving free school meals (FSM &#x02013; an indicator of the deprivation of the catchment area) in a school, or according to individual level baseline mental health, gender, ethnicity and FSM (for teacher and student outcomes)?</p></list-item><list-item><p>What is the cost of the WISE intervention, and is it justified by reduced teacher absenteeism/presenteeism or improvements to teacher wellbeing and other teacher and student outcomes?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does the WISE intervention work according to the mechanisms of change hypothesised in the logic model?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Is the WISE intervention sustainable?</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a cluster RCT, with embedded economic and process evaluations. Schools are the unit of allocation because the intervention is school-wide. There will be two study sites, one in South West England and one in Wales, which will enable consideration of the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>In Wales, eligible schools will be drawn from two administrative areas (consortia) (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;88), and within each area will be stratified into three levels according to FSM (high, medium and low). Two schools will be randomly selected from each stratum in each area, giving a total of 12 schools. A relevant senior manager in each school, e.g., a deputy head in charge of pastoral care, will be approached by the study team and their school invited to participate in the study. Any schools that decline will be replaced by a randomly selected school from the same stratum and geographical area.</p><p>In England, the study will be advertised by local public health teams to senior leaders and healthy schools contacts at all eligible schools within a 30 mile radius of one city (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;64), and schools will then be followed up by the study team. Those who express interest in participating will be grouped by administrative area (city local authority [LA]/LA outside the city) and stratified into three levels according to FSM (high, medium and low). The aim will be to recruit two schools per stratum in each area, so if a stratum has more than two interested and eligible schools within the time frame, two will be randomly selected to give a total of 12 schools.</p><p>The sampling frame includes two administrative areas in each site to ensure a large enough sample is obtained. Schools will be stratified by area and FSM to ensure balance across study arms, in case administrative area or FSM status is associated with mental health outcomes. Including schools from different areas and with different levels of FSM eligibility will also help ensure the generalisability of the findings. If difficulties are encountered due to lack of interested or eligible schools in a particular stratum, two strata will be merged for that area.

The 8&#x000a0;% of staff with the most nominations - ensuring a mix of gender and teaching/non-teaching role by moving down the list until this mix has been met &#x02013; will be invited to attend the 2 day standard MHFA training and to then set up a confidential peer support service for colleagues to access as and when required, with the aim of providing a listening ear and signposting to other services as appropriate. Anyone invited who does not want to do this will be replaced by the person matching their gender and role with the next highest number of nominations, and numbers of individuals not consenting to take part will be noted. The peer support service will be advertised through an initial awareness raising event and refresher one year later (see point 3), and also through posters, staff emails, and at staff meetings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>MHFA for Schools and Colleges training for teachers:</bold> A minimum of 8&#x000a0;% of all teaching staff (up to a maximum of 16) who have pastoral duties such as tutors or heads of year will receive this 1 day training, which is based on the youth MHFA course, but targeted to meet the needs of educational environments. Trained teachers will then continue with their usual teaching and pastoral roles within school, but will apply the MHFA for Schools learning in their day to day interactions with students; responding to signs and symptoms of distress and providing initial help and support to individuals they identify as at risk of mental health difficulties.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>Mental health awareness raising session for all teachers:</bold> All teaching staff will receive a one hour awareness raising session, which will introduce the peer support service and focus on the importance of mental health issues in schools.

This will be measured via self-report questionnaires during staff meetings, using the WEMWBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The WEMWBS is a comprehensive (incorporating elements of both subjective and psychological wellbeing) 14-item survey, responsive to change and validated among community samples of adults in the UK. It will be measured as a continuous variable. Scores range from 14 to 70.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Secondary outcomes &#x02013; teachers</title><p>Teacher depression, absence and presenteeism will be measured within the same self-report questionnaire. Depression will be measured using the 8 item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The PHQ-8 is suitable for measuring levels of depressive symptoms in population-based studies and is short enough to be used in self-report surveys. Unlike the 9-item version it does not contain a question about thoughts of self-harm &#x02013; due to such a low number of participants in the pilot reporting suicidal thoughts, it was decided that measuring suicidality as an outcome was not necessary. Sickness absence and presenteeism during the last 4&#x000a0;weeks will be measured using questions adapted from the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment questionnaire (WPAI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Teacher absence days, retirement and resignations will also be measured at one and two years using routine data collected by schools.</p><p>Teacher PHQ-8 will be measured as continuous variable, and as an ordinal variable (a score of 0&#x02013;4 indicating no depressive symptoms/5&#x02013;10 indicating mild symptoms/10&#x02013;14 indicating moderate symptoms/15&#x02013;19 indicating moderately severe symptoms 20&#x02013;24 indicating severe symptoms) and a binary variable, with a cut-point of 10 or more indicating depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Teacher absence and presenteeism will be treated as binary (any vs no absence in the previous four working weeks and health problems having 0 effect vs 1&#x02013;10 effect on work over the previous four working weeks), and each variable will also be categorised and treated as ordinal, to examine whether the intervention has a differential effect on increasing levels of absence and presenteeism. Teacher absence, retirement/resignation and student attendance and attainment as reported by schools, will all be reported as a school level %.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Secondary outcomes &#x02013; students</title><p>Student wellbeing will be measured using the WEMWBS, and psychological distress using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), using a self-report questionnaire administered during class time. The WEMWBS has been validated among teenagers from thirteen years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the SDQ is a widely used measure among this age group, with well-established norms for a UK population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It is a 25-item scale measuring emotional and behavioural difficulties, with a self-report version for 11&#x02013;16 year olds.

In this study we have built in time after the initial data collection sessions to follow up missing participants. Where possible second data collection sessions will be planned with students. It will be harder to ask schools to set aside more than one staff meeting for data collection, so teachers absent from the data collection session will be followed up by email and given the option of completing either an online survey or posting a paper one back to the study team. A certain number of participants will be lost to follow up due to leaving the school between baseline and follow up. For this reason our primary analysis will use a repeated measures design that includes all participants with any data (see below).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Data management</title><p>Outcome data will be entered onto REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Checks will be built into the database to disallow entry of impossible values. A randomly selected 10&#x000a0;% of the questionnaires entered will be checked by a second person to ensure data quality. Only the study team will have access to the final trial dataset.

A change of 3 points is also close to the difference in mean baseline scores between the highest and lowest ranked schools in the pilot study. Sample sizes were calculated using the clustersampsi command within Stata, which accounts for the clustered nature of the data by including intracluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) in the calculation. Based on the pilot data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] we assumed a WEMWBS ICC of 0.01 (0.00, 0.05), a mean of 50 teachers followed up per school (with a coefficient of variation of sample size of 0.5), and a standard deviation for WEMWBS of 8.4. A sample size of 24 schools (12 intervention and 12 control) will achieve 83&#x000a0;% power at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level for an ICC of 0.05 (the highest of the confidence intervals in the pilot ICC); this would rise to 98&#x000a0;% for an ICC of 0.02.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses will take account of clustering by school and repeated measures using random effect or robust standard errors for clustering and random effects for repeated measures.

Logistic regression models will be used to examine differences by study arm at follow up, adjusted for baseline scores, school-level FSM and geographical area. We will examine whether baseline measures of these variables moderate the effect of the intervention by including the appropriate terms in the analysis model &#x02013; however this is purely an exploratory analysis as power will be low, and there is always the potential for unmeasured confounding of the association between moderator/mediator and outcome. We will also examine the extent to which the MHFA training appears to have impacted on mental health, wellbeing and helping behaviour. We will use a Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE) approach (using Instrumental Variable analysis or Principal Stratification) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] to compare those who completed the training in the intervention schools with those in the control schools who would have completed the training, had they been offered it (based on matching their gender, role in the school and years of experience with those who were trained).</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Reach</title><p>Follow up teacher surveys in the intervention schools will ask about use of the peer support service and participation in the MHFA training.</p><p>In addition, the following qualitative data will be collected:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Interviews with the head teacher and an audit at each school at baseline and two year follow up to explore the school&#x02019;s current activities in relation to mental health and wellbeing, any existing mental health improvement activities or plans and sustainability of the intervention.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Termly meetings with the peer supporters to discuss service use and any harms.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Observations of the training and interviews with the MHFA trainers to examine fidelity and acceptability.</p></list-item><list-item><p>In four case study intervention schools the following will be held: focus group discussions with peer supporters, attendees of the MHFA for Schools and Colleges training, potential users of the peer support service, and year 9 students, and interviews with teachers who have used the peer support service.
