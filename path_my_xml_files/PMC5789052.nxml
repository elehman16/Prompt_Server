To identify the brain mechanisms underlying these orexigenic effects, 14 healthy women participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Functional magnetic resonance brain images were acquired for 50&#x02009;minutes interprandially. Intravenous infusion of erythromycin (40&#x02009;mg) or saline started 10&#x02009;minutes after the start of scanning. Blood samples (for glucose and hormone levels) and hunger ratings were collected at fixed timepoints. Thirteen volunteers completed the study, without any adverse events. Brain regions involved in homeostatic and hedonic control of appetite and food intake responded to erythromycin, including pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, caudate, pallidum and putamen bilaterally, right accumbens, hypothalamus, and midbrain. Octanoylated ghrelin levels decreased, whereas both glucose and insulin increased after erythromycin. Hunger were higher after erythromycin, and these differences covaried with the brain response in most of the abovementioned regions. The motilin agonist erythromycin increases hunger by modulating neurocircuitry related to homeostatic and hedonic control of appetite and feeding. These results confirm recent behavioural findings identifying motilin as a key orexigenic hormone in humans, and identify the brain mechanisms underlying its effect.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The bidirectional neural and hormonal communication system between the brain and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is known as the &#x02018;brain-gut axis&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. It is part of an integrated interoceptive system which continuously conveys homeostatic information about the physiological state of the body to the brain.</p><p id="Par3">GI hormones are important mediators of these gut-brain interactions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. One of these hormones, motilin, is a 22-amino-acid gut peptide secreted by endocrine M cells in the small intestine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Motilin is a physiological regulator of the migrating motor complex (MMC), a cyclical contraction pattern with different phases of activity (phase I-III) originating in the stomach or duodenum and migrating distally in the fasted state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Phase III is characterized by strong contractile activity. In healthy humans, gastric but not duodenal phase IIIs are preceded by a motilin peak and exogenous administration of motilin induces a premature gastric phase III<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, which has recently been associated with increases in hunger ratings and with the occurrence of hunger peaks during fasting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Although motilin has thus been associated with the induction of these so-called hunger contractions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, the brain mechanisms underlying the putative role of motilin in regulating appetite and eating behavior have not been studied until now. This is partially due to the limited availability of appropriate animal models to study its effect, as motilin and its receptors only exist as pseudogenes in rodents and are not functional<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Therefore, the gut-brain signaling mechanisms underlying the putative orexigenic effect of motilin can only be studied in humans and other non-rodent species. Furthermore, as intravenously administerable motilin is no longer available for human research, motilin receptor agonists need to be used to study its physiological effects in humans. Two decades ago, Itoh <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> first found that the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin mimics the effect of exogenous motilin on GI contractile activity in dogs. Later, this was also observed in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup> and erythromycin was shown to be an agonist of motilin receptors in the human duodenum and colon<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Recent studies by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup> showed that i.v. infusion of a low dose (40&#x02009;mg) of erythromycin induces gastric phase III contractions accompanied by peaks in hunger ratings, not only after prolonged fasting but also in the interprandial state (120&#x02009;minutes after a 250&#x02009;kcal meal). Moreover, subjects requested a meal more often after erythromycin administration compared to placebo<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Cholinergic blockade by atropine suppressed both gastric phase III contractions and hunger peaks associated wih erythromycin administration. Nevertheless, the mechanism behind the induction of hunger by motilin receptor stimulation is incompletely understood. However, it is conceivable that this orexigenic effect is due to changes in activity in brain circuits involved in the control of appetite and food intake through the gut-brain axis.</p><p id="Par6">Our primary aim was therefore to identify the brain mechanisms underlying the orexigenic effects of motilin receptor activation through erythromycin infusion. We hypothesized that intravenous erythromycin administration would increase hunger ratings and hedonic food intake compared to placebo, and that these effects would be accompanied by changes in activity in homeostatic and hedonic brain regions. Further, it has been shown in animal models that the orexigenic GI hormone ghrelin is essential for motilin-induced gastric contractions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and motilin (or its agonists) increase plasma insulin levels in both healthy humans and animals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. A second aim was therefore to explore the putative role of ghrelin and insulin in these effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study participants</title><p id="Par7">Fourteen eligible volunteers with a mean age of 26&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2 years and mean BMI of 21.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were recruited (June 2015&#x02013;February 2016).

Further, we demonstrated for the first time that this leads to increased hedonic food intake 50&#x02009;minutes after the start of the infusion (although it should be noted that only a non-significant trend was found, which may be due to the late administration of the test relative to infusion, see below). Finally and most importantly, we investigated the brain responses to the motilin agonist erythromycin using the pharmacological MRI design, which has been developed and widely used to measure the brain responses to drugs as well as nutrients in human<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. We showed for the first time that the motilin receptor agonist, erythromycin, exerts its orexigenic effects by modulating the function of homeostatic and hedonic brain regions involved in the control of appetite and food intake, mediated by the brain-gut axis. Further, the differential response in these regions covaries with the increase in hunger ratings and predicts the subsequent increase in food intake after erythromycin versus placebo.</p><p id="Par23">Regarding the stimulatory effect of a low dose of erythromycin on hunger and prospective food consumption ratings, we confirmed previous work by our group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In line with these effects on subjective ratings, there was a trend towards more hedonic food intake after erythromycin infusion compared to placebo, with a small effect size (Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic>: 0.44). This effect may not have reached full significance due to the rather long interval between the infusion and the task (because of the primary focus of this study on brain responses). Hence, this needs to be confirmed in studies testing hedonic food intake at 30&#x02013;40&#x02009;minutes after the start of the infusion (i.e. the moment where the difference in hunger ratings between both conditions was the largest in the present study). Nevertheless, these results are in agreement with our previous work showing that healthy volunteers requested a soup meal more often after i.v. erythromycin compared to saline infusion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Interestingly, the responses in reward and homeostatic brain regions discussed below predicted the increase of hedonic food intake after erythromycin versus placebo infusion. Further, these brain regions mostly overlapped with the brain regions that covaried with the increase of hunger ratings. These findings indicate that the effect of erythromycin on reward and homeostatic brain regions mediated its hunger-inducing effect and therefore predicted the increase in hedonic food intake.</p><p id="Par24">Among our predefined ROIs, the hypothalamus can be considered as the most important homeostatic region involved in the control of food intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. We found enhanced activity after erythromycin administration in the hypothalamus, and this increase in activity covaried with the increase of subjective hunger and predicted the increase of <italic>ad libitum</italic> food intake after the erythromycin administration. Taken together, these findings suggest that the hypothalamus plays a key role in erythromycin-induced increases in hunger and food intake.</p><p id="Par25">However, we also found that erythromycin activated important reward-related regions as the (ventral) midbrain (ventral tegmental area), ventral (nucleus accumbens) and dorsal striatum (caudate and putamen), amygdala, AIC, OFC, and ACC, all of which are key regions of the mesolimbic dopaminergic reward circuitry in the brain<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. In fMRI studies, differences in responses to visual high caloric food stimuli (anticipatory reward) and/or receipt of rewarding food (consummatory reward) between normal weight and obese subjects were found in most of these reward-related regions, highlighting their important role in (dys)regulation of appetite and food intake in health and disorders of food intake<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In our study, we found associations between the differential brain responses in most of these mesolimbic reward system regions and the increase of hunger and prospective food consumption ratings after erythromycin versus saline administration, and the differential responses in these regions predicted differences in hedonic food intake. This indicates that not only an effect on homeostatic circuitry, but also on mesolimbic reward circuitry may be an important candidate brain-based mediator of the orexigenic effect of erythromycin.</p><p id="Par26">It should be noted that the direction of the responses differed between these regions, with some of them showing an increase in activity in response to erythromycin, and others showing a decrease. Decrease of the BOLD signal probably indicates relatively smaller blood flow in these regions. In fact, a negative correlation between gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration and BOLD signals has been demonstrated previously<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Therefore inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA might be involved in the response to erythromycin infusion. Little <italic>et al</italic>. found a 5&#x02009;min increase followed by a decrease of the BOLD signal in medulla, pons, midbrain and hypothalamus in response to a bolus intragastric glucose infusion in a phMRI design<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. They suggested that the decrease was driven by the increase of circulating glucose and insulin. In our study, the regions that showed a decreased BOLD signal in response to erythromycin infusion indeed covaried with the increase of glucose or insulin levels (see below), even though the regions differed from the ones found by Little <italic>et al</italic>. after intragastric glucose infusion (bilateral pACC, bilateral AIC, left amygdala and midbrain).</p><p id="Par27">The exact gut-brain signaling mechanisms underlying the orexigenic effects of motilin and their neural basis had not been studied until now. However, Deloose <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup> found that, at the dose which was also used in the present study, this effect is controlled via a cholinergic pathway at the level of the GI tract, as pre-treatment with atropine abolished the effect of erythromycin on both hunger and gastric phase III induction. In addition, old data indicate that erythromycin does only penetrate the blood-brain barrier to a very limited extent in a healthy population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. Therefore, we may speculate that gastric phase III contractions may generate an afferent signal conveyed from gut to brain by vagal and/or spinal afferents, which in turn influences brain activity. Due to incompatibility of the MR scanner environment with gastrointestinal manometry equipment, we were not able to measure gastric motility simultaneously during the scanning period. We were therefore not able to address direct correlations between erythromycin-induced gastric contractions and brain activity. However, although speculative, given the well-known role of the insula in processing (visceral) afferent interoceptive information, our finding of left ventral and right dorsal AIC activation after erythromycin infusion may be in line with this interpretation. More specifically, the AIC re-represents the interoceptive signals from the body and integrates them with emotional input, thereby playing a fundamental role in generating &#x000ab;interoceptive feelings&#x000bb; and, together with the ACC, motivational states, including pain and hunger<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The covariation we found between differential responses in these regions and subjective feelings (hunger, prospective food consumption) and eating behaviour (hedonic food intake) is in line with this interpretation. On the other hand, the motilin receptor is expressed in the human TE671 cell line, which originates from the cerebellum<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Moreover, it is probably also expressed on the vagus nerve as motilin increased gastric vagal afferent fiber activity <italic>in vitro</italic> in the <italic>suncus murinus</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. This indicates that indirect (neural) or even direct (humoral) gut-brain signalling effects of motilin agonism cannot be excluded as a potential mechanism mediating the orexigenic effect of erythromycin on brain activity, in addition to motility-mediated effects described above. We observed differential timing of responses in different brain regions in this study, for example, the responses in the hypothalamus reached a peak at t&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02009;min, whereas the responses in the bilateral OFC peaked at t&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x02009;min. It is therefore likely that brain responses in different regions were mediated by different or multiple pathways with a differential lag.</p><p id="Par28">Given the observed erythromycin induced-effects on ghrelin, insulin, and glucose plasma levels and their covariation with the brain effects, these endocrine/metabolic effects may represent important alternative candidate neurohumoral gut-brain signals mediating the orexigenic effect of erythromycin. However, given the fact that hormone/glucose levels and brain responses are measured during the same timeframe, we cannot draw firm conclusion about the directionality of the associations, which renders the interpretation below inherently speculative.</p><p id="Par29">Ghrelin is recognized as a key orexigenic hormone, and has a structural resemblance to motilin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The fact that erythromycin administration not only prevented the increase in ghrelin levels over time seen after placebo infusion, but even induced a decrease in ghrelin levels (compared to the pre-infusion baseline) in this study argues against ghrelin as the key mediator of the orexigenic effect of motilin agonism. Therefore, the decrease in ghrelin could rather be the consequence of a negative feedback mechanism resulting from the erythromycin infusion (through peripheral or top-down brain-gut signaling mechanisms triggered by the brain response to motilin agonism). An inhibition of the adrenergic pathway controlling ghrelin release might be a possibility<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">We also found an increase of blood glucose and plasma insulin levels in response to erythromycin infusion. Suzuki <italic>et al</italic>. showed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> that in dogs exogenous motilin induced the release of insulin through vagal cholinergic pathways in the fasted state, without triggering any change in blood glucose levels. They also found that, in the interdigestive state, plasma insulin concentrations peaked during early gastric phase III. This is in line with our results showing an early peak (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02013;30&#x02009;min) in plasma insulin levels after erythromycin infusion. Indeed, Ueno <italic>et al</italic>. have already shown that administration of erythromycin increases the release of insulin in human subjects in fasting state<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. However, in our study we also found an increase of blood glucose together with an increase of plasma insulin after erythromycin infusion 2&#x02009;hours after a standard meal. This can potentially be explained by the difference between fasted state and interprandial state, as erythromycin is well-known for being a prokinetic agent and hence improves gastric emptying<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. In our study, erythromycin was infused 2&#x02009;hours after a small meal (275&#x02009;kcal). In healthy humans, gastric half emptying time of a similar solid meal (250&#x02009;kcal) varies between 20 and 118 min<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. It is therefore possible that the increase in blood glucose levels after erythromycin infusion is caused by emptying of food remnants from the stomach into the small intestine. In this case, the observed increase in insulin levels after erythromycin infusion could be secondary to the increase in glucose levels.</p><p id="Par31">In addition, the change of blood glucose and plasma insulin levels covaried with brain responses in homeostatic and hedonic regions. Interestingly, there were some remarkable differences between the regions that covaried with glucose and those with insulin. Changes of blood glucose covaried most strongly with the homeostatic hypothalamus, and a few smaller clusters in reward-related regions (bilateral AIC, pACC, caudate and left amygdala, supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). Changes of plasma insulin, on the contrary, covaried most strongly with reward related regions (bilateral AIC, pACC, caudate, putamen and left amygdala, supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), but not with the hypothalamus. Responses to glucose administration have been shown in the hypothalamus<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, midbrain, insula and putamen<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> in MRI studies. These regions overlap with the regions that covaried with the change of blood glucose levels in response to erythromycin administration in our study. Not much is known about brain responses to exogenous insulin, as this requires a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>. One possible explanation is that in our study, the increase of insulin was induced by erythromycin infusion, whereas erythromycin <italic>per se</italic> activated the hypothalamus. Therefore the covariation might be neutralized by the activation effect of erythromycin and the deactivation induced by glucose. More generally, it remains unclear whether the effects on glucose and/or insulin represent the true gut-brain signaling mediators of the observed orexigenic effect of erythromycin infusion, or are rather epiphenomena. As for ghrelin, the direction of the effects of erythromycin on glucose (increase) and hunger (increase) may argue againt a true mediating role, as, if anything, an increase in blood glucose would be expected to reduce hunger.</p><p id="Par32">Some limitations of our study require consideration. First, gastric motility and gastric emptying were not measured in this study, because of the uncompatibility of the high-resolution manometry probe with the magnetic field of the megnatic resonance imaing (MRI) scanner environment, as mentioned earlier. Second, due to the limitation of the spatial resolution of functional MRI (fMRI), we were not able to differentiate various nuclei in the brainstem. Third, the sample size was relatively small, due to the complexity of the study design and high costs of the fMRI scans. To achieve a homogeneous sample and avoid potentially confounding sex differences, we only included healthy women, which implies the limitation that the present results cannot be extrapolated to men.</p><p id="Par33">In summary, the motilin agonist, erythromycin, increased hunger and hedonic food intake and attenuated the secretion of ghrelin in healthy female volunteers. Homeostatic brain regions, more specifically the hypothalamus, were activated in response to erythromycin infusion, and the activation of hypothalamus covaried with the increase of hunger and predicted the increase of hedonic food intake. Further, brain responses to erythromycin were also found in several key reward regions. The responses in most of these regions (including bilateral AIC, left amygdala, bilateral caudate, bilateral OFC, and bilateral ACC) covaried with the increase of hunger, and, in most of the cases, also predicted the increase of hedonic food intake after erythromycin infusion. These results confirm recent behavioural findings identifying motilin as a novel key orexigenic hormone in humans, and identify the gut-brain signaling mechanisms underlying its effect. Therefore, although further research is needed, we believe these results may inspire future drug development to improve dysregulation of appetite and food intake in patients populations characterized by loss of appetite and weight loss, including functional dyspepsia, anorexia nervosa and/or cachexia due to organic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec23"><title>Eligibility criteria for participants</title><p id="Par34">Right-handed, normal weight, healthy women (18&#x02013;65 years) were included, to avoid sex as a potential confounder.

Standard preprocessing steps (realignement, coregistration, spatial normalization, and smoothing) were applied to the data.</p><p id="Par41">For the functional scan, a total of 1200 volumes of 46 slices (2.7&#x02009;mm thickness, interslice gap of 0.3&#x02009;mm) were acquired continuously per visit for a total examination duration of 50&#x02009;min (TE/TR&#x02009;=&#x02009;30/2500 ms, flip angle (FA)&#x02009;=&#x02009;90&#x000b0;, matrix size&#x02009;=&#x02009;88&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;85, field of view&#x02009;=&#x02009;21&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;21&#x02009;cm).

Two-pass realignment of the time series image volumes was followed by co-registration to the high-resolution structural image acquired in each session. The high-resolution image was used for each participant as reference for the spatial normalization to the EPI template image supplied with SPM.
