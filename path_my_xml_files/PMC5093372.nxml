According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Diabetes Statistics Report of 2014 there are currently 29.1 million people with diabetes, 21 million are diagnosed and 8.1 million undiagnosed. The prevalence of subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or pre-diabetes is in excess of 86 million.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and ACTNOW<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> studies showed that the rate of conversion for IGT to type 2 diabetes is 7&#x02013;10% per year with no significant difference in ethnicity. The primary risk factor for type 2 diabetes is obesity as 90% are either overweight or obese. As body mass index (BMI) increases from 23 to &#x0003e;35&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, there is a 93-fold increase in type 2 diabetes. Obesity also increases the risk of heart disease, hypertension and other metabolic diseases.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Lifestyle changes, including weight loss and exercise, reduces the risk of developing diabetes by 58%,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> whereas therapeutic intervention reduces the risk by 32% (metformin)<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and 72% (pioglitazone)<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> in pre-diabetes subjects. Few studies have been carried out to show some remission of pre-diabetes (IGT) to normal glucose tolerance with diets and weight loss.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Our previous feeding study (all food provided) comparing a high protein (HP) diet in normal glucose tolerant, obese, premenopausal women showed similar weight loss over the 6&#x02005;months. However, subjects on the HP diet had a significant improvement in insulin sensitivity, and decrease in cardiovascular risk (CVR) factors, inflammatory markers, oxidative stress<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and increase in GLP -1, GIP and gastrin<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> at 6&#x02005;months compared with the HC diet subjects. Other diet studies have recommended various methods for weight loss<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;19</xref> some of which suggested advantages of low carbohydrate (CHO),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> higher fat<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or HP diets.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Observations substantiate the validity of using a HP diet for weight loss. Suppression of hunger and inducement of satiety have been observed with the HP diet.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The thermic effect of feeding also increases with protein primarily by the increase in protein synthesis.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The low glycemic index (GI) of foods high in proteins has also been observed to be a factor in maintaining satiety. A high GI meal induces hyperglycemia which is followed a few hours later by the sensation of hypoglycemia and an earlier return of hunger.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The diet composition can alter a number of other variables even though the weight loss may be the same with an isocaloric HP versus a high carbohydrate (HC) diet. The plasma lipids which are a major CVR factor can be effected by the macronutrient diet composition.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> For instance, a decrease in triglycerides was observed on a low CHO diet.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Protein intake by itself induces insulin release; however, it is a much less potent secretagogue for insulin than is glucose in normal individuals.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This suggests that HP diets may help preserve the &#x003b2; cells by increasing sensitivity and decreasing insulin load per meal.</p><p>Higher protein content in the diet may also help maintain lean body mass.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Studies showed nitrogen balance remained positive after a hypocaloric HP diet but became significantly negative after a hypocaloric HC diet.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Another important aspect of a HP diet is the anti-inflammatory effect and decreased glucose area under the curve (AUC) compared with a HC diet as was shown in our previous study.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Other studies have demonstrated that hyperglycemia during glucose challenge or elevation of FFA<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> leads to activation of leukocytes and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have also shown that hyperglycemia in vivo and in vitro activates T cells, increases inflammatory cytokines, lipid peroxidation, and ROS.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Studies also have shown that hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes and obesity is associated with increased inflammatory markers.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>In this diet feeding study, we investigated the effects of a HP diet (30% kcals from protein, 40% kcals from CHO and 30% kcals from fat) versus a HC diet (15% kcals from protein, 55% kcals from CHO and 30% kcals from fat) for 6&#x02005;months on obese women and men with pre-diabetes with restriction of 500&#x02005;kcal intake/day (based on resting metabolic rate (RMR)) on remission of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, weight loss, changes in lean and fat body mass, inflammatory markers and CVR factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>We recruited women and men aged 20&#x02013;50&#x02005;years with a BMI&#x02265;30&#x000a0;to &#x02264;55&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> with pre-diabetes for a total of 24 participants.

Six subjects in the HP group and eight subjects in the HC group dropped out within a few weeks after screening due to their work schedule, driving distance or moved out of area. Since there were no data (OGTT, MTT, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), weight, metabolic markers) other than baseline (Bl) on those subjects that dropped out, they were not included in the data analysis of comparison of changes from Bl to 6&#x02005;months on the diet interventions.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Tennessee Health Science Center (UTHSC).</p><p>All participants were seen in the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at UTHSC for all their visits. After signing the consent form, a history and physical examination, height and weight, blood pressure (BP) and waist measurements were done. At the Bl and at 6&#x02005;months of the study participants underwent a standard OGTT and mixed meal tolerance test. The meal for the MTT for the HP group was a HP meal and the meal for the MTT for the HC group was a HC meal. Both HP and HC meals were 300 calories (the same as the 75&#x02005;g OGTT). Glucose and insulin were measured at Bl and at 30&#x02005;min intervals for 2&#x02005;hours. These tests were repeated after being on the diet for 6&#x02005;months. Each provocative test was performed after an overnight fast with 2 or more days between tests. At Bl and 6&#x02005;months, DXA scan, RMR, chemistry profile, complete blood count (CBC), vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and lipid profiles were performed. Urine collections for 24&#x02005;hours were performed for creatinine clearance (CrCl), microalbumin, calcium (Ca) and urinary urea nitrogen (UUN). These determinations were performed to determine the changes in body weight and body composition (lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM)), insulin sensitivity and glucose response, lipid profile, Ca metabolism and protein breakdown (by urinalysis). Subjects were assessed for level of activity and all were at minimum activity. Patients were requested to continue their current level of physical activity throughout the study. After meeting the screening criteria, subjects were randomized to either the HP or HC diet using a permuted block randomization method generated by the biostatistician.</p><p>Subjects were considered to have remission of their pre-diabetes if at 6&#x02005;months they had a fasting glucose of &#x0003c;100&#x02005;mg/dL, and a 2-hour glucose level of &#x0003c;140&#x02005;mg/dL during a single OGTT.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Diet-related parameters</title><sec id="s2b1a"><title>Diet composition</title><p>Study participants either followed a HP or HC diet for 6&#x02005;months, based on initial randomization using a randomization table.

After maintenance, caloric needs were established for each individual; 500&#x02005;kcals/day were subtracted from the determined caloric needs to promote a 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;lbs weekly weight loss. On average, an 1800&#x02005;kcal/day diet for a 100&#x02005;kg individual was used to achieve adequate weight loss. A one-time calorie reduction of 200&#x02005;kcal was made if a subject reached a plateau and did not lose weight for two consecutive weeks during the 6&#x02005;months. No subject was on &#x0003c;1200&#x02005;kcal/day.</p><p>A feeding study was necessary to ensure accurate macronutrient consumption.

Just as important, in the absence of interaction effects, focus was shifted on assessing marginal treatment arm differences. Assuming again the Bl to follow-up correlation is 0.25 and an effect size of 0.80 (ratio of mean weight change to within SD), the changes could be tested with at least 80% power.

Subjects on the HP and HC had significant weight loss at 6&#x02005;months from their Bl weights but not significantly different between the HP and HC groups at 6&#x02005;months. HbA1c and insulin sensitivity (HOMA IR and ISI) were all significantly improved at 6&#x02005;months from Bl in the HP and HC diets; however, the HP group had significantly greater improvement in these parameters compared with the HC group at 6&#x02005;months. The CVR factors (BP, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL) and inflammation markers (TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6) were significantly decreased in both diet groups; however, the HP diet resulted in significantly greater reduction in the triglycerides, LDL, oxidative stress (ROS-DCF), TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-6 compared with the HC diet at 6&#x02005;months. This reduction in TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6 demonstrates a better anti-inflammatory effect of the HP diet compared with the HC diet.</p><table-wrap id="BMJDRC2016000258TB1" orientation="portrait"

(1) The HP diet resulted in 100% remission of pre-diabetes to normal glucose tolerance while the HC diet resulted in only 33% remission. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first lifestyle intervention study where 100% remission of pre-diabetes was obtained. Our results show that high efficacy can be achieved with dietary modification if parameters are rigorously controlled and monitored. (2) The HP group had greater improvement in insulin sensitivity, greater reduction in CVR factors, oxidative stress (ROS) and inflammation than the HC diet group. (3) The HP diet group's percent lean body mass (LM) increased while percent body FM was decreased; whereas, the HC diet group lost both percent LM and FM. (4) There was no physical activity modification during the 6&#x02005;months on the diets, and since all subjects were minimally physically active, we were able to study the direct effect of the HP versus HC diets. (5) Diet meals were given to each patient weekly at our CRC along with survey of food consumption which resulted in a high level of compliance (&#x0003e;90%; <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJDRC2016000258TB1">table 1</xref>).</p><p>The HC group sustained higher glucose and insulin levels with both the OGTTs and MTTs compared with the HP diet group after 6&#x02005;months on the diet. The greater insulin response with the HC diet likely equates to greater &#x003b2; cells stress. The higher sustained glucose elevation with ingestion of glucose or higher glycemic foods as in the HC diet correlates with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the HC group compared with the HP group as our data show. A study showed antioxidant enzymes induced by repeated intake of excess energy in the form of high-fat, HC diets are not sufficient to block oxidative stress and inflammation in healthy human subjects.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Thus, the fact that our HP diet had a significantly greater reduction in ROS and inflammation markers than the HC diet in pre-diabetes subjects is of great health importance.</p><p>Although both HP and HC diet subjects did minimal exercise activity, the percent LM was preserved in the HP group while FM was lost. This preservation of percent LM in the HP diet group may be an important factor in improving insulin sensitivity since muscle is a major insulin sensitive tissue for glucose uptake. Since exercise builds muscle mass, it would be of interest to know if the subjects had been on an exercise programme if the LM would be conserved in the HC group or if there could be a greater increase in the LM in the HP group with exercise in conjunction with the LM preserving effect of a HP diet.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>Although some studies have reported a HP diet can cause negative Ca balance, increased Ca loss in the urine and adversely affect the bone,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> our HP and HC diets contained more than the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended amount of Ca/day<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and showed no bone loss or loss of Ca in the urine.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The protein composition in our HP diet was 30% which is at the upper limit of suggested protein consumption range (10&#x02013;30%). This may not be at a high enough percentage to cause a negative Ca balance as has been reported.</p><p>A possible limitation is assessment of insulin sensitivity by HOMA-IR with the African-American(AA) subjects;<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> however, the majority of the subjects in our study were AA and neither Bl HOMA-IR nor ISI (Matsuda index) was significantly different between the HP and HC groups. Also, both methods of assessment showed greater improvement of insulin sensitivity with the HP diet than the HC diet at 6&#x02005;months.</p><p>Diet compliance is an important factor in macronutrient composition diet studies. Most studies rely on a patient's recall food questionnaire of meals they ate days to weeks before which is generally inaccurate. Strengths of this feeding study are that it was a randomized control trial where all food and daily diet plans were provided to each subject in the HP and HC diet groups at their weekly visit to the CRC along with daily food consumption survey each week for 6&#x02005;months. This monitoring resulted in &#x0003e;90% compliance of diet adherence. Our study demonstrates for the first time that strict adherence of dietary intervention is possible and can produce meaningful and reliable results and remission of pre-diabetes. At an additional 6-month follow-up visit after 6&#x02005;months on the diet study, the subjects that chose to stay on the HP diet plans purchasing their own food and with consultations with the investigators when needed maintained their weight loss and normal glucose levels.</p><p>The daily cost of such a diet (HP or HC) was about $13 a day with minimal personnel involvement (except for weekly pick-up of diet supplies). The diet plans are adjustable to the subjects food likes and dislike with a wide variety of choices with different meal plans for each day of the week. Weekly meal plans and initial instructions could be provided to the subject and phone and email consultation provided when needed. By this method, the HP diet plan would allow for a diet care plan to be instituted by primary care physicians and offer an economical means of a nutritional weight loss diet and remission of pre-diabetes in men and women.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank J Crisler and A Ammons at UTHSC for assays of hormones and cytokines, all of the nursing and recruiting staff of the Clinical Research Center unit, all of whom are affiliated with the UTHSC, for their efforts and Nibedita Chowdhury, MD for assisting with some of the OGTT and MTTs and Dr John Christman for reviewing this manuscript.
