Most surgeons prefer ACDF, although there are indications that FOR is as effective as ACDF, has a lower complication rate and is less expensive. A head-to-head comparison of the 2 surgical techniques in a randomised controlled trial has not yet been performed. The study objectives of the Foraminotomy ACDF Cost-Effectiveness Trial (FACET) study are to compare clinical outcomes, complication rates and cost-effectiveness of FOR to ACDF.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The FACET study is a prospective randomised controlled trial conducted in 7 medical centres in the Netherlands. The follow-up period is 2&#x02005;years. The main inclusion criterion is a radiculopathy of the C4, C5, C6 or C7 nerve root, due to a single-level isolated cervical foraminal stenosis caused by a soft disc and/or osteophytic component, requiring operative decompression. A sample size of 308 patients is required to test the hypothesis of clinical non-inferiority of FOR versus ACDF. Primary outcomes are: &#x02018;operative success&#x02019;, the measured decrease in radiculopathy assessed by the visual analogue scale and &#x02018;patient success&#x02019;, assessed by the modified Odom's criteria. Secondary outcomes are: Work Ability Index (single-item WAI), quality of life (EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 level Survey, EQ-5D-5L), Neck Disability Index (NDI) and complications. An economic evaluation will assess cost-effectiveness. In addition, a budget impact analysis will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethics Committee of the University Medical Center Groningen.

Many patients with a cervical radiculopathy are in their productive phase of life and are part of their community's labour force. Therefore, temporary disability due to the radiculopathy may result in a major loss of productivity.</p><p>A cervical radicular syndrome (CRS) constitutes pain, paresis and/or paraesthesia in the distribution area of the corresponding nerve root. It can be caused by nerve root compression due to soft disc protrusion or by a spondylotic stenosis of the neuroforamen. The annual incidence of a CRS is estimated at 0.8 per 1000 inhabitants.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The initial treatment is primarily conservative. The revised Dutch CRS guideline (2010) states that a CRS existing for longer than 2&#x02005;months, and not responding to conservative treatment in that time course, can be considered an indication for surgical treatment.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>Various surgical approaches for the treatment of cervical radiculopathy have been described. Spurling and Scoville<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> reported the successful removal of the cervical disc with a hemilaminectomy in 1944. In the following years, the techniques further evolved into a keyhole foraminotomy (FOR) being popularised by Frykholm.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Cloward,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Smith and Robinson<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> developed the anterior approach for cervical discectomy in 1958. Since then, anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) has become very popular and became the favourite treatment option in the majority of neurosurgeons and orthopaedic surgeons for cervical degenerative disc diseases with stenosis of the central spinal canal.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>For lateral pathologies, such as the foraminal soft disc protrusion or spondylotic stenosis of the neuroforamen, there is still a controversy regarding the best surgical approach. Both the anterior and posterior techniques are well established, but the decision to choose one technique above the other is often based on the surgeon's preference and not on scientific evidence.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref></p><p>The majority of surgeons seem to favour the anterior approach. This preference is probably based on the fact that the anterior approach is also used for other cervical disorders, causing the surgeon to be more familiar with this operative route. Furthermore, the assumption that the posterior approach elicits more postoperative neck pain makes this technique less appealing for surgeons.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>However, there are also several advantages of the posterior approach in patients with a foraminal soft disc protrusion or spondylotic stenosis.</p><p>Four of these advantages are:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Clinical outcome after a posterior cervical FOR appears non-inferior to ACDF. There are conflicting results, derived from low-quality, mainly retrospective studies.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In a large study of Dohrmann and Hsieh,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> 6000 patients were analysed retrospectively from the existing literature. A good/excellent result (relief of symptoms) was scored in 80% of the patients after an anterior decompression versus 94% of the patients after a posterior decompression. This difference was statistically significant (p&#x0003c;0.05).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> On the other hand, Korinth <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> found, in a retrospective study of 292 patients, a statistically significant difference in success rate (Odom's criteria I and II) in favour of ACDF with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) stabilisation compared with FOR. Furthermore, Wirth and colleagues conducted a prospective trial comparing (1) anterior cervical discectomy without fusion (ACD), (2) ACDF and (3) FOR. The study did not show a significant difference in outcome between the three procedures (pain improvement in 100% of the patients after ACDF or FOR, 92% after ACD). However, the number of patients included in the study was very low (n=72).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Morbidity data are in favour of FOR. The lower complication rate for FOR can be explained by the difference in anatomical structures that are involved in the two approaches. Owing to the proximity of vulnerable and vital structures such as the carotid artery, vagal nerve, trachea, oesophagus and the recurrent laryngeal nerve, ACDF has a higher complication rate. The reported numbers of complications in the literature vary between 6.5% and 19.3% for the ACDF technique, and between 1.8% and 3.9% in the case of FOR.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Direct costs of FOR seem to be lower. The explanation for this is most likely the high costs of implants used in ACDF. Mansfield <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> reported an average difference of $3872 between ACDF and FOR, with $3143 of this difference contributable to costs in the operating room (including materials). Tumial&#x000e1;n <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> found a difference of $6508 between FOR and ACDF with plating. Approximately half of these extra costs were caused by the implants used.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Indirect costs of FOR seem lower, which may be related to a faster rehabilitation and an earlier resumption of work. However, this assumption is based on two retrospective studies comparing the cost-effectiveness of FOR to ACDF with plating. A comparison to ACDF without plating has not yet been made.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></list-item></list></p><p>In summary, a high-quality study comparing the effectiveness of FOR to ACDF has not yet been performed. Patients, the medical community and financial stakeholders would benefit from a study that puts both procedures to the test. The results of this study could be of use for the update/revision of the (inter)national guidelines for the treatment of a CRS.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The Foraminotomy ACDF Cost-Effectiveness Trial (FACET) study is designed as a high-quality study to analyse the cost-effectiveness of the FOR technique compared with ACDF in patients with a cervical monoradiculopathy caused by a discogenic and/or osteophytic foraminal stenosis.</p><p>The primary hypotheses are:

A total of 308 participants will be included in seven medical centres in the Netherlands during 2&#x02005;years. Both the FOR (experimental group) and the ACDF (active control) are established surgical techniques. A non-inferiority trial design was chosen to show whether FOR has at least as much efficacy as the ACDF technique or is worse by an amount &#x0003c;10% with regard to the primary outcome parameters.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study setting</title><p>The study will focus on patients with a monosegmental radicular syndrome due to a lateral or foraminal herniated disc or osteophyte, with compression of the C4, C5, C6 or C7 nerve root.

Participating neurosurgeons are from the University Medical Center Groningen, Martini Hospital Groningen, Radboud University Medical Center Nijmegen, Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital Nijmegen, Zuyderland Medical Center Heerlen, Medical Center Haaglanden and Medisch Spectrum Twente Enschede. Two centres are university teaching hospitals, and five are large regional medical centres. The participating hospitals were selected because of the high volume of spinal cases and their neurosurgeons&#x02019; familiarity with the two procedures under investigation.

After a second confirmation of the correct level, a partial hemilaminectomy and FOR of the involved level is performed with the use of an operating microscope or loupe magnification. The amount of reduction of the facet joint is determined by the extent of the foraminal stenosis. In cases of soft disc compressions, the proximal root is visualised adequately and mobilised to allow the removal of the compressing disc material. However, complete removal of the soft disc component is not strictly necessary and the decision to remove the soft component will be left to the surgeon's preference. In cases of an osteophytic foraminal stenosis, bony decompression of the proximal root is performed. The surgeon has the choice to carefully coagulate and divide the venous plexus that covers the nerve sheath.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Main study parameters</title><p>The primary study parameters are &#x02018;operative success&#x02019; and &#x02018;patient success&#x02019;.</p><p>&#x02018;Operative success&#x02019; will be the postoperative decrease in radiculopathy assessed by the VAS for self-reported arm pain, between the patients operated with the FOR technique and with the ACDF technique during 24&#x02005;months of follow-up.

With the aforementioned success rate in mind, an &#x003b1; of 0.05, power of 0.8 and a non-inferiority margin (&#x003b4;) of 10%, the authors conducted a sample size calculation.

More than 80% of the patients were willing to participate. Furthermore, it was calculated that with a low inclusion rate of 30% each year, the authors will be able to include 308 participants in 2&#x02005;years.

Both items will be analysed as appropriate depending on data distribution with a one-sided 0.05 level of significance (non-inferiority).

Furthermore, multivariate event analyses will be performed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. In addition, for the purpose of a supportive sensitivity analysis, multiple imputation procedures will be applied.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed alongside the clinical trial to assess the cost-effectiveness of FOR versus ACDF. There will be two separate outcome measures for the cost-effectiveness analysis, resulting in two incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for FOR as compared with ACDF. The first is incremental costs per extra percentage of patients with arm pain relief, while the second is incremental costs per QALY gained. EQ-5D-5L scores will be converted into health state utilities using the Dutch value set.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> These health state utilities range between &#x02212;0.446 and 1, with a higher utility indicating a better health-related QoL. The utilities will be multiplied by follow-up time spent in that particular health state (area under the curve) to eventually convert into QALYs.</p><p>The analysis will be performed taking a societal perspective. The time horizon will be equivalent to the full follow-up of the clinical study, which is 24&#x02005;months. According to pharmacoeconomic guidelines, discounting will be applied for costs (4%) and effects (1.5%) in the second year.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> A number of sensitivity analyses will be performed to identify the impact of variables, such as the costs of the FOR and ACDF procedures, resource use and effect size, on cost-effectiveness. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be constructed, based on bootstrap simulations, showing the probability of FOR being cost-effective compared with ACDF at varying levels of the willingness to pay, for either one additional percentage of patients with arm pain relief or one additional QALY.</p><p>Based on the results of the clinical study and the cost-effectiveness analysis, a BIA will be performed to inform decision makers on the financial consequences of implementing FOR as treatment of first choice for cervical foraminal soft disc/osteophytic disease in the Dutch healthcare system. The BIA will be performed according to the principles of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) task force and from the perspective of the government as well as a third party payer's/healthcare insurer's perspective.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The trial results will be extrapolated, by means of a simple model, from a time horizon of 24&#x02005;months to 5&#x02005;years, and for the entire Dutch population concerned. The extrapolation will assume a constant incidence of cervical foraminal soft disc/osteophytic disease. We expect that the proportion of cases eligible for surgical intervention will be stable over time as well. Therefore, the extrapolation will be linear. Sensitivity analyses will be performed on relevant parameters such as the eventual substitution rate of FOR versus ACDF (may not be 100%), the uptake of FOR with time, costs of the procedures and other cost items. We will assume that current usual care already consists of a mix of ACDF and FOR, that is, 90% and 10%, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Monitoring</title><p>The study will be monitored by the Trial Coordination Center of the University Medical Center Groningen.
