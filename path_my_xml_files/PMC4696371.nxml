Opioids (including pethidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, and droperidol are other sedative drugs used for the same purpose.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Ketamine could be used as a substitute of opioids and benzodiazepines for sedation during endoscopy with a wide spectrum effects on pain, amnesia, anesthesia, and sedation which can be administered intravenous, intramuscular, or even oral and rectal. Dose of 0.2-0.5 mg/body weight (Kg) is usually used for reduction of pain and after 10-15 min, the full consciousness is returned. Delusion, auditory and visual hallucinations, and other side effects which may occurred in a period of 24 h after ketamine administration make some limitations for drug usage. A potential contractive effect on laryngeal muscles in unwell patients also would lead to significantly unpredictable decrease in blood pressure and cardiac output. Previous studies had worked on the combination of ketamine and midazolam for the induction of sedation in pediatric gastro-enteric endoscopy but there is no similar study on adults.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In some areas of the world, ketamine is mostly used in sedation for endoscopy for all ages due to lack of other medications.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Ketamine is also used for the reduction of neuropathic pains such as postherpetic neuralgia, complex regional pain syndrome, malignancy, orofacial pain, and limb phantom pain.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Due to lack of enough data about the effect of ketamine on endoscopic sedation, we designed this study to evaluate the mentioned purpose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This double-blinded, randomized clinical trial study was done by the grant of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences during the years 2014-2015 with the group of patients who were candidates for gastro-enteric endoscopy. Inclusion criteria were the following: Age between 18 and 65 years, absence of hypersensitivity or any contraindication for ketamine, absence of mental or physical retardation, and no history of hypertension, seizure, hyperthyroidism, immune deficiency, or increased intraocular pressure. Any patient who required emergent intervention or who showed drug sensitivity during the study was excluded from the study.</p><p>All the patients who had the inclusion criteria were informed about the study protocols and procedures and fulfilled a written consent, after that they were divided into two groups of case and controls by computer randomizing system meaning that every participant had a number categorized into case or control group by the computer.</p><p>A questionnaire including demographic data was fulfilled; patients in case group administered 5 mg/body weight (Kg) of ketamine,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] 30 min before the endoscopy and the control group received placebo in the same order. For complete blindness of the study, drug or placebo was solved in 10 cc of apple juice because of the bitter taste of ketamine and after that, medication was given to the patient by a nurse who was blinded about the study protocols. After finishing the procedure, pain severity, degree of sedation, and physicians&#x02019; satisfaction of sedation were measured in both groups. Visual analog scale was used for pain assessment and physicians&#x02019; satisfaction of sedation was measured with the following scale: Very bad (scale 0), bad (scale 1), intermediate (scale 2), good (scale 3), and very good (scale 4). The sedation was also assessed with 1 = completely awake, 2 = awake but drowsy, 3 = asleep but responsive to verbal commands, 4 = asleep but responsive to tactile stimulus, and 5 = asleep and not responsive to any stimulus.</p><p>Finally, all the gathered data were analyzed using SPSS-20 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA); <italic>t</italic>-test, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann-Whitney test, and Chi-square test were used for data analysis and <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Eighty-six patients (43 in case group and 43 in control group) who were candidates for gastro-enteric endoscopy were included into this study; of which 43 (50%) individuals were males and 43 (50%) were females. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>, no differences were seen among groups regarding age, sex, and level of academic degree.

Our data revealed that low-dose administration of ketamine, 30 min before initiation of the endoscopy, can significantly decrease patient's pain and discomfort. We also found that physicians reported better satisfaction of sedation in patients who received ketamine comparing with those who received placebo.</p><p>Studies and experiences suggested that a successful gastro-enteric endoscopy can be done with a moderately potent sedative medication. A previous meta-analysis revealed that a moderate sedation can increase patient and physician's satisfaction. Although propofol is growing to be used as a moderate sedative medication, midazolam plus one opioid is considered as a standardized sedative method.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>There are several studies worked on the effect of ketamine on pain reduction[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and most of them are focused on the intravenous injection of ketamine and its effect on some special pains such as neuropathic pains.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Moharari <italic>et al</italic>. found that injection of 10 cc lidocaine plus 2 cc of ketamine into the urethra can significantly decrease pain during cystoscopy, especially in the first 5 min of the procedure.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another study designed to find a suitable sedative method for pediatric gastro-enteric endoscopy revealed that combination of oral ketamine with intravenous injection of midazolam is a perfect way to decrease pain and induction of sedation; however, further episodes of vomiting were reported due to oral administration of ketamine.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Khademi <italic>et al</italic>. in a 2011 study on 78 pediatric patients showed that peri-tonsillar infiltration of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) leads to reduced pain and postsurgery vomiting after adenotonsillectomy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Another study on 180 patients aged 18-60 and candidates for cholecystectomy revealed that subcutaneous injection of 2 mg/kg of ketamine or intravenous injection of 1 mg/kg of ketamine 15 min before initiation of the surgery can decrease postsurgery pain.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Combination of ketamine (0.25 mg/kg) and meperidine (5 mg) had been shown to have effects on pain reduction and decreased need to opioids after major abdominal surgeries in patients aged 15-60 years.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Results of a recent investigation by Shavakhi <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that sublingual administration of alprazolam resulted in better sedative status, decreased anxiety, and increased patient's satisfaction during endoscopic procedures compared with oral route of administration.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Lack of measurement of awaking time and ending time of procedure can be mentioned as our study limitation. As we searched, there was no study which compared the effect of ketamine compared with placebo, so we did not compared the effect of ketamine with other sedative agents.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our data showed that a low-dose oral administration of ketamine could make a suitable sedation for gastro-enteric endoscopy. Patients experienced less pain and less frequent retching and physicians had greater satisfaction of sedation compared with those placebo-treated group. We would like to suggest using ketamine as a suitable medication for the induction of sedation during gastro-endoscopic procedures if there is no contraindication.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was done by grant of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHOR'S CONTRIBUTION</title><p>SM contributed in the conception of the work, revising the draft, approval of the final version of the manuscript, and agreed for all aspects of the work.
