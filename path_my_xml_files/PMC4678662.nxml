Family meals-focused randomized controlled trials with weight outcomes have not been previously conducted. Therefore, this study purpose was to describe weight-related outcomes of the HOME Plus study, the first family meals-focused randomized controlled trial to prevent excess weight gain among youth.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Families (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;160 8-12-year-old children and their parents/guardians) were randomized to intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;81) or control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;79) groups. Data were collected at baseline (2011&#x02013;2012), post-intervention (12-months post-baseline) and follow-up (21-months post-baseline). The intervention included ten monthly group sessions (nutrition education; hands-on meal and snack planning, preparation, and skill development; screen time reductions) and five motivational, goal-setting phone calls. The main outcome was child body mass index (BMI) z-score.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>General linear models, adjusted for baseline values and demographics, showed no significant treatment group differences in BMI z-scores at post-intervention or follow-up; however, a promising reduction in excess weight gain was observed.

To address this issue, both childhood obesity prevention and treatment randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been initiated. Historically, childhood obesity <italic>prevention</italic> trials have consisted of initiatives with children of all sizes with implementation in school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] while <italic>treatment</italic> trials have typically focused on overweight youth within clinics and primary care facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prevention-focused RCTs have been mildly to moderately successful in reducing body mass index (BMI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], particularly among children compared to adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment studies with overweight youth typically have larger effects on BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] but are expensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Prevention of excess weight gain <italic>and</italic> the reduction of excess weight are critical for the future of our youth.</p><p>Perhaps interventions would be most effective if they used successful approaches from both types of programs. Successful prevention and treatment programs with significant effects on BMI are more likely high-quality studies with solid theoretical foundations, rigorous design, quality measurement and clear descriptions of intervention delivery integrity, fidelity and dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, successful programs often include family involvement, behavioral monitoring, environmental changes and longer-term interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. National experts have recommended that programs improve the family&#x02019;s ability to support children&#x02019;s weight-related behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; however, including parents in childhood obesity trials can be challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Family-based approaches for childhood obesity prevention interventions have increased over the past several decades and those rooted in behavior theory appear to have more successful outcomes for overweight youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Historically, treatment programs have been more likely than prevention programs to include parents and focus on the home environment and often teach about self-monitoring, goal setting, problem-solving and have explicit behavioral change expectations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. More recently, childhood obesity prevention RCTs have emphasized the importance of the home environment and family involvement in reducing childhood obesity and have included adiposity-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, few have been conducted with school-age or preadolescent children even though these children are at high risk of excess weight gain and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, few studies that measure potential effects over a longer post-intervention period have been conducted to evaluate sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>One growing area of research that may be promising for obesity prevention is family meals promotion. Noninterventional, cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have demonstrated robust findings between family meal frequency and child dietary intake quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], with some studies showing promising associations between family meal frequency and weight, particularly among young children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, few intervention programs have specifically examined promoting healthful and frequent family meals as a method of addressing childhood obesity. Our study team conducted a pilot RCT with a family meals-focused program in which nutrition and weight-related outcomes were directly measured; findings were promising but, as a pilot, it was not powered to assess change in weight-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A few other programs reported in the literature promoted family meals but not as the primary focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] or did not evaluate weight-related outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The present RCT builds upon the extant literature as it was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a family meals-focused intervention to prevent excess weight gain in 8-12-year-old children. It incorporated both childhood obesity prevention and treatment approaches. The a priori hypothesis was that children whose families participated in the intervention program would have significantly lower BMI z-scores at post-intervention (12&#x000a0;months post-baseline) compared to children in the control group; similar findings were hypothesized to be sustained at follow-up (21&#x000a0;months post-baseline). Given the strong associations between puberty and weight gain in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and robust findings that younger children eat meals more often with their families than older children and may thus be more influenced by changes in family meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], a subsequent aim was added to examine whether the intervention had a differential effect by pubertal onset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and procedures</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The Healthy Home Offerings via the Mealtime Environment (HOME) Plus study was designed as a two-group RCT (intervention and control) to promote healthier eating, reduce sedentary behaviors (i.e., meal-related screen time) and prevent excess weight gain among 8-12-year-olds by increasing the frequency and healthfulness of family meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. A staggered-cohort design was used in which two cohorts of families from a large metropolitan area in the upper US Midwest were recruited and randomized to treatment groups one year apart (2011 and 2012). Fully detailed power calculations are published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We partnered with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board because their mission promotes health, well-being and community and they have a significant presence in the local area. Six Minneapolis Park and Recreation community centers were selected as intervention sites based on the economic- and cultural-diversity of the populations they serve and site logistics (e.g., kitchen facilities).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Staff and volunteers recruited 160 children and one of their parents/guardians (the primary meal-preparing adult in the household) from community centers using flyers, targeted email lists, and in-person presentations/discussions; some participants learned of the study by word of mouth. Child inclusion criteria were as follows: being 8&#x02013;12 years old, having an age- and gender-adjusted BMI percentile above the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile (to potentially target a more at-risk group), having English literacy, and living with the participating parent/guardian most of the time. Exclusion criteria (children and parents) were plans to move from the area within 6&#x000a0;months, and medical conditions prohibiting participation (e.g., extreme food allergies). Regarding program reach, the HOME Plus sample appears to be similar in racial/ethnic diversity and slightly more educated compared to residents in the county where the community centers were located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedures</title><p>Participating parents and children signed consent and assent forms, respectively.

Baseline data collection occurred almost exclusively at participants&#x02019; homes (99&#x000a0;%). At post-intervention and follow-up, 35&#x000a0;%-45&#x000a0;% of families selected community sites for data collection. Families received a gift card at each data collection visit.

The intervention was delivered by trained staff (registered dietitians and a public health nurse) and targeted family change in the planning, frequency and healthfulness of family meals and snacks and limiting meal-related screen time. The intervention included ten monthly group sessions (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and five brief goal-setting telephone calls&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Families received a guidebook with session topics, strategies to promote behavior change and study goals, recipes and community resources. All family members were invited to attend sessions and transportation and childcare were provided, if needed. The most commonly used behavior change taxonomy clusters used in the sessions included <italic>Goals and Planning, Social Support, Repetition and Substitution, Natural Consequences, Shape Knowledge, and Antecedents</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] with many associated behavior change techniques as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The goal-setting calls (~20&#x000a0;minutes) were completed by dietitians trained in motivational interviewing who tailored each call to the family-selected behavioral goal(s). Calls included the same behavior change techniques as in-person sessions but followed an interview format, utilized motivational interviewing techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and provided opportunities to discuss behaviors/goals that complemented the group session topics.

Inclusion of covariates in the analytic models was determined by examining differences related to retention, correlations with BMI z-score and overlap between child and parent measures. Slight attrition occurred at post-intervention (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with significantly lower retention among nonwhite participants and those receiving economic assistance. Child age was related to BMI, and child and parent race were significantly correlated with each other. Thus, general linear models to assess intervention effects on BMI z-score at post-intervention and follow-up were adjusted for baseline child BMI z-score, age, gender and race and family receipt of economic assistance. To examine the longitudinal intervention effect, a general linear mixed model was fitted, with baseline BMI z-score, treatment group, time (post-intervention and follow-up) and treatment group-by-time interaction as fixed covariates, adjusting for demographic covariates and including participant-specific random intercepts. We also explicitly modeled the partially-clustered nature of this sample (since the intervention was delivered in group settings with multiple families while control participants stayed &#x0201c;unclustered&#x0201d;) using a random coefficient multilevel model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. The intervention effect was not affected after adjustment for partial clustering and no intervention sub-group facilitation was observed; thus, only the results of the analyses conducted without the adjustment are presented. We assessed &#x0201c;dose&#x02013;response&#x0201d; of the implemented intervention among intervention group participants who provided both baseline and post-intervention child BMI z-scores using multiple regression without and with adjustment for child age, gender, race and family economic assistance receipt at baseline. For post-hoc stratification to examine whether the intervention had a differential effect by pubertal onset, development scores were split at the median (development score: &#x0003c;1.6, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;57, prepubescent vs. &#x02265;1.6, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;90, pubescent).

The HOME Plus study was unique in that it was prevention- and family-focused with BMI as the primary outcome. Overall, the intervention effect on BMI z-scores did not reach statistical significance; however, modest and promising decreases in excess weight gain were observed at post-intervention and were sustained. Our post-hoc stratification analysis indicating significantly lower BMI z-scores for intervention children compared to their control group counterparts, among the prepubescent children only, is promising but should be viewed cautiously; further examination is warranted.</p><p>The present study exploratory findings suggest family-meal focused programming may potentially be efficacious to prevent excess weight gain among children prior to pubertal onset, as our cut-point for stratification was on the low end of development and consistent with prepubertal definitions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Our findings support the conclusions of several reviews showing that associations between family meal frequency and weight status/BMI are robust in younger children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Perhaps the persistence of BMI across development is strong enough that intervention timing is critical and should occur early during development. Moreover, we were unable to tease apart the potential biological and psychosocial changes associated with maturation; we suspect that engagement in a family-focused intervention and changes in BMI z-scores may be influenced by both. It is unlikely our main effect not reaching statistical significance was due to lack of intervention fidelity or family engagement given the high fidelity and attendance rates. Rigorous family meals research with younger populations is needed, particularly to examine the effects of psychosocial changes during this age, related family dynamics, and possible interactions with biological influences.</p><p>Our study programming attempted to target children comprising a wide range of ages and maturational stages. Although we believe the intervention program was age-appropriate for 8-12-year-olds, some participants were pubescent and perhaps, given the strength of biological influences at this time, additional content and/or strategies are needed to have a larger impact on BMI. Additionally, reviews have consistently indicated longer-term programs (12+ months) are more effective than shorter-term programs (&#x0003c;12&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. HOME Plus was a 10-month program that may be shy of the length of time necessary for substantial BMI change. However, based on HOME Plus intervention-participant feedback, 88&#x000a0;% indicated a longer community-based program would not be preferred. Increased costs would also prohibit programs of much longer length given the current funding climate. Alternatively, our inability to show a planned difference in our primary outcome may be due to an unmeasured influential variable that we failed to address or consider.</p><p>The present study had several strengths. The full scale study&#x02019;s design and intervention program had been pilot tested with similarly successful recruitment, retention and acceptability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The theoretical framework, study design, methodology and measurement were high quality and the intervention had high fidelity. Intervention efficacy was tested using a RCT with both post-intervention and long-term follow-up; many studies do not test for sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The main outcome measurement was strong as it was measured objectively by trained staff. The randomization procedure was effective, with no baseline treatment group imbalance. The combination of delivering the intervention using both group- and individualized-approaches provided multiple pathways for behavior change and the use of standardized manuals and continual monitoring of intervention delivery demonstrated intervention integrity. An additional strength of the intervention was the delivery in real-world community settings, demonstrating successful partnerships with community organizations. Providing convenient intervention and measurement locations and facilitating participation by offering transportation, childcare and flexible scheduling were key to successful engagement and high retention rates.</p><p>Several limitations should be noted. The generalizability of study findings is limited as participants, who self-selected into the study, may have done so because of interests in cooking and family meals, and thus may have been more receptive to behavioral change. However, <italic>all</italic> of our families identified important behavioral goals for improvement since we provided a menu of goals and allowed flexibility in goal selection. Also, families were recruited across a large spectrum of income levels and racial diversity given the area population and appeared to be representative. In addition, our inclusion criteria of BMI&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;50<sup>th</sup> percentile may have affected findings. Including a large proportion of normal weight children may have made it more difficult for us to see programmatic effects on BMI; as expected and shown in the description above, the intervention effect was more pronounced for heavier children. We were unable to model incidence of overweight/obesity by treatment group due to an insufficient number of children in our sample who were at normal weight at baseline but considered overweight/obese at post-intervention. Finally, at baseline, 61&#x000a0;% of families participating in HOME Plus were eating family dinner together 5 or more times per week, limiting the program&#x02019;s ability to increase family meal frequency which could have also diminished the effect on weight-related outcomes. Our high participation rates in the intervention sessions meant that we did not observe a dose&#x02013;response intervention effect on BMI z-score. Future researchers in this area may consider recruiting only families that report infrequent family meals to potentially have a larger preventative effect on excess weight gain.</p><p>Future research is needed in several areas of childhood obesity prevention study design and intervention development and delivery. Prevention of excess weight gain among normal weight youth may be more difficult than targeting weight reductions in overweight or obese youth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and may take longer to show [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In relation to the development and implementation of interventions, perhaps tailoring for within-group differences is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] by pubertal development. Given that the present study was conducted with urban families, many of whom were eating frequent family meals, future family meals-focused interventions should prioritize engaging families in rural communities and including families who do not already frequently eat together.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The HOME Plus study was a high quality study that tested a family meals-focused intervention with parents and children for the prevention of excess weight gain. Although we did not have a statistically significant overall intervention effect in our primary analysis, we observed modest but promising reductions in excess weight gain across age and weight status and significant effect modification by pubertal onset, suggesting potential weight-related effects for family meals-focused interventions among prepubescent children. Further research in this area is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CDC</term><def><p>Center for Disease Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HOME</term><def><p>Healthy Home Offerings via the Mealtime Environment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IRB</term><def><p>Institutional Review Board</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>US</term><def><p>United States</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JF, DN-S, MS, OG, AG and MK designed the research.
