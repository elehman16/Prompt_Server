It has analgesic and anaesthetic sparing property.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has potent sedative properties.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, because of its sedative property, it is unknown if the recovery from anaesthesia would be delayed when used as continuous infusion. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine on perioperative haemodynamics and also postoperative recovery in elective surgical procedures with continuous monitoring of depth of anaesthesia by entropy analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining the approval from institutional ethical committee and written informed consent from patients, 60 patients with ASA status I and II, aged 18&#x02013;55 years, and undergoing elective surgical procedures were randomly allocated into two groups: group A (control group): sevoflurane&#x02013;fentanyl and group B (test group): sevoflurane&#x02013;dexmedetomidine. Patients older than 55 years, those with a history of psychiatric/neurological illness, hypertensive patients, morbidly obese patients, pregnant and nursing women, patients with known allergic reaction to any of the study medications, patients on recent use of sedatives or analgesics, and patients with significant laboratory abnormalities were excluded.</p><p>On arrival in the operating room, patient's heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation were monitored by continuous electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) monitor and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) monitor, respectively. Depth of anaesthesia was evaluated by entropy (state entropy, response entropy) analysis (Datex-Ohmeda S/5 Avance workstation<sup>&#x02122;</sup>, GE Healthcare, Helsinki, Finland).</p><p>Inj. glycopyrrolate 4 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg and ondansetron 0.15 mg/ kg intravenous were given as premedication in both the groups. After a 5-min monitoring period, patients in the test group received inj. dexmedetomidine (2 ml diluted in 48 ml of saline) in a dose of 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg over 10 min through infusion pump. Two minutes prior to induction, patients in the control group received inj. fentanyl 2 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg intravenous slowly.</p><p>Ten minutes after the administration of the study drug, anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone sodium 5 mg/kg intravenous slowly. Succinylcholine 2 mg/ kg was used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with O<sub>2</sub>:N<sub>2</sub>O (50:50) and sevoflurane. Inj. vecuronium bromide was used as muscle relaxant.</p><p>Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane to a maximum of 2.5% end tidal to maintain the heart rate and blood pressure within 20% of the baseline value and entropy value between 40 and 60. Patients in the test group received dexmedetomidine continuous infusion between 0.2 and 0.8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/ kg/h. The anaesthesiologist was permitted to treat haemodynamic events, defined as heart rate and/or blood pressure more than 20% of baseline, in spite of increasing sevoflurane concentration to 2,5% and dexmedetomidine infusion to 0.8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg, with incremental doses of metoprolol 2&#x02013;5 mg, or fall in heart rate and blood pressure by more than 20% of baseline with ephedrine 5 mg intravenously.</p><p>In group B, dexmedetomidine was stopped approximately 15&#x02013;20 min before the completion of surgery. Inj. diclofenac sodium 1 mg/kg (max dose of 75 mg) was given intravenously in both groups at the time of skin closure. N<sub>2</sub> O and sevoflurane was discontinued after skin closure in both groups. Reversal of neuromuscular blockade was obtained with inj. neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 8 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg intravenous.</p><p>Immediately after extubation, sedation was assessed with sedation score as follows: 1, awake; 2, sleepy but arousable; and 3, sleepy difficulty to awake. In the postoperative period, if Visual Analogue Score (VAS) was &#x0003e;6, inj. tramadol 50&#x02013;100 mg was given as supplemental analgesia.</p><p>Heart rate, blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> and entropy were recorded continuously at predetermined time intervals as per the protocol. Recovery was assessed by modified Aldrete's and sedation score as follows: score 1, awake; score 2, sleepy but arousable; score 3, sleepy difficult to arouse.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Statistical analysis was conducted with Epi Info software (version 3.5.3, 2011) for windows statistical package using unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables with normal distribution. The nonparametric Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was used for variables not normally distributed. For categorical variables, chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used as applicable.

Dexmedetomidine also blunts the haemodynamic response to emergence from anaesthesia and extubation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Our study showed a significant attenuation of heart rate at the time of extubation in dexmedetomidine group.</p><p>Use of haemodynamic end points for assessing the depth of anaesthesia in a study on sympatholytic drugs such as dexmedetomidine would be unreliable as there may be compromise in the depth of anaesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Thus, use of electroencephalogram-dependent indices such as bispectral index and entropy to measure the depth of anaesthesia would be appropriate. In our study, adequate depth of anaesthesia was maintained throughout surgery with response and state entropy being maintained between 40 and 60.</p><p>One of the most commonly encountered problems in Postoperative Anaesthetic Care Unit (PACU) is delayed recovery and longer discharge time of patients receiving perioperative dexmedetomidine infusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Similar findings were observed in our study. However, there was no difference between two groups at the end of 2 h. The delayed recovery might be due to the sedative property of dexmedetomidine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] However, unlike opioids, sedation with dexmedetomidine is not associated with respiratory depression.</p><p>In our study, dexmedetomidine was discontinued 20 min prior to extubation, thus we could not establish the potential benefit of dexmedetomidine in attenuating haemodynamic response at the time of extubation and during postoperative period. Also, recording the time taken to extubate after the completion of surgery would have established objectively the effect of dexmedetomidine on immediate recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dexmedetomidine, when administered as a pre-anaesthetic medication and intraoperative infusion, attenuates stress response to various noxious stimuli and maintains haemodynamic stability. Dexmedetomidine's sedative property delays postoperative recovery, thus continuous monitoring is essential during the first few hours of postoperative period.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
