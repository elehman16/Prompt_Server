Various strategies are being used to deal with ileal perforations including primary closure of perforation with or without omental patch, repair of perforation with ileotransverse colostomy, ileostomy, exteriorization, trimming of ulcer edge and closure, wedge excision and anastomosis, and segmental resection and anastomosis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Severity scoring is a valuable tool for assessing and quantification of severity of acute illness. Currently Acute Physiological and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scoring system is the best available method for risk stratification in abdominal sepsis. In our study, we have compared different surgical procedures for ileal perforation using APACHE II score and what procedure was suitable in different groups of patients with different APACHE II scores.</p><p>The proposed study aims to compare and contrast three different surgical approaches to ileal perforation management, i.e. simple closure, resection, and anastomosis and ileostomy, to define the severity of peritonitis based on APACHE II score in cases of ileal perforation, identify the cause, define the criteria for choosing a particular modality of treatment and compare the short- and long-term outcome of the various treatment modalities.</p><p>The study will help to establish the criteria for instituting the management modality according to presentation and severity of the disease and the outcome of these procedures. Effective management of the disease will help in decreasing morbidity and mortality associated with the disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The following study was conducted in the Department of General Surgery, Government Medical College and Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, on patients who were admitted from casualty and surgical outpatient department from July 2012 to October 2013 with a proven diagnosis of ileal perforation peritonitis.

Abdominal pain was the most common clinical presentation (100%) followed by fever, abdominal distension, vomiting, and obstipation. The etiology of perforation was typhoid (38.59%), nonspecific (36.84%), tuberculosis (14.03%), and trauma (10.52%). Majority of the patients presented within 48 h of perforation (73.68%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Operative procedures in various etiological groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JSTCR-7-32-g001"/></table-wrap><p>APACHE II score was accessed and out of total 57 patients, 6 (10.52%) patients had APACHE II score 0&#x02013;9, 48 patients (84.21%) had APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19, and 3 patients (5.26%) had APACHE II score &#x02265;20. In APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19, 15 patients (31.25%) underwent primary closure, 16 patients (33.33%) underwent resection-anastomosis, and 17 patients (35.41%) underwent ileostomy [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Complications in all the procedures were noted and resulted that wound infection was the most common complication (71.92%).

Surgery is the ideal treatment as it eliminates soiling of peritoneal cavity in an effort to lessen the toxemia and enhance the recovery of the patient. However, there is no uniformity of standardized operative procedure that is most effective for the offending lesion.</p><p>There are also no criteria which define the type of surgical procedure based on the sepsis score. In the present study, all the patients were scores according to the APACHE II score. It was decided that patients with APACHE II score &#x0003c;9 would undergo primary closure of the perforation since the general condition of the patient and the associated peritonitis were conducive to good healing. In patients with APACHE II score &#x02265;20, the policy was to form a ileostomy proximal to the perforation(s), since primary repair in advanced stages of peritonitis in patients with poor general conditions would most likely lead to higher incidence of local complications. The present study in patients with APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19 aimed to establish whether primary closure of the perforation and formation of a proximal ileostomy would be the best treatment of choice.</p><p>Small bowel perforations most commonly affect the young in the prime of their life. In the present study, male preponderance was found with male to female ratio of 1.85:1 that is slightly on the lower side of the ratio 3:1 reported by Wani <italic>et al</italic>., 4:1 reported by Adesunkanmi <italic>et al</italic>. and Talwar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, different operative procedures - simple closure of perforation, resection-anastomosis, and ileostomy were performed according to cause and severity of illness. Simple closure was done in 20 patients, 15 of which had APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19. These patients had single perforation, small in size (&#x02264;1 cm), located within 60 cm of ileum with less peritoneal contamination. In 16 patients, resection anastomosis was performed, 15 of which had APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19. Resection-anastomosis was performed because of multiple perforations or large perforation (&#x0003e;2 cm) or when segment of bowel appeared unhealthy for simple closure. In the literature, simple closure is recommended for single perforations with less peritoneal contamination,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] while wedge excision, segmental resection and anastomosis, ileotransverse anastomosis have been recommended for multiple perforations, diseased segment of bowel.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Primary closure of perforation was done in 13 patients with single perforation of size &#x0003c;1 cm. The complication rate was 46.6%. Seven patients with large perforation also underwent primary closure. The complication rate in them was 85.71%. Resection-anastomosis was done in 16 patients, 5 out of which had large perforations (&#x0003e;1 cm). The complication rate was 75%. The morbidity associated with primary closure is 75% which is less than the morbidity of 80.9% and 52.3% associated with ileostomy formation and closure, respectively (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Simple repair of perforation in two layers is the treatment of choice for typhoid perforation. Two layer closure of the perforation with or without an omental patch has been most successful.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Surgical management with primary closure of the perforation (74.5%), closure with omental graft (14.5%), resection and anastomosis (3.6%), and only drainage (7.3%) was done by Talwar <italic>et al</italic>. The morbidity rate was 79.1% and mortality rate was 16.4%. The mortality was least with early primary closure of perforation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>If there are multiple perforations and any area of bowel seems unhealthy or liable to perforate, a length of small bowel should be resected, including all the diseased part and a two layer anastomosis is performed. Mortality rates were 43% for ileostomy, 36% for primary closure, 15% for those treated with wedge resection.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Shah <italic>et al</italic>. observed that it is better to opt for resection-anastomosis irrespective of the number of perforations and found lower complication rate (35.5%) and mortality rate (21.47%) in comparison to simple closure complication rate (71.25%) and mortality rate (42.96%) to ileostomy complication rate (100%) and mortality rate (77.77%). Pal reported 6.22% mortality with simple closure and ileotransverse anastomosis and found it to be better.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Ileostomy was performed in 21 patients, 10 of which had APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19. Ileostomy was recommended in cases of poor general condition, extensive contamination, perforation situated near the ileocecal junction, large perforations (&#x0003e;1 cm), intraoperative findings suggestive of strictures, caseating lymph nodes. In 17 patients with single, small perforation (&#x0003c;1 cm), ileostomy was made depending upon high APACHE II score, extensive fecal contamination, unhealthy bowel wall. The complication rate was 56.2%. About 5 patients with large perforations (&#x0003e;1 cm) and 4 patients with multiple perforations underwent ileostomy formation. The complication rate in them was observed to be 62.5%. Mortality was more in patients with multiple perforations as compared to single perforation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.025). Development of fecal fistula was unrelated to number of perforations.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Closure of the perforation combined with ileotransverse colostomy was found to have a definite improvement in recovery, mortality reduced from 75% to 20%.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Eggleston observed mortality was same but morbidity decreased (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) with closure of perforation and ileotransverse colostomy; this takes the diseased bowel out of the intestinal mainstream.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Extensive procedures such as resection-anastomosis and right hemicolectomy should be avoided in patients with poor general condition and toxemia. Ileostomy as a secondary procedure should be considered once fecal fistula develops in order to avoid peritoneal contamination. The mortality is unrelated to the duration of perforation and the type of operation performed (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Wound infection was the most common postoperative complication-about 75% each in Groups I and II, followed by intra-abdominal collections, wound dehiscence, and anastomotic leak, which is in accordance with previous studies (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The other complications in Group II were related to ileostomy which hampered quality of life and significantly added to morbidity in these patients.</p><p>The average APACHE II score in Group I was 14.95, Group II was 12.375 and was 12.285 Group III. Patients with APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19 had 73.0% morbidity and mortality 7.6% as compared to 38.7% in those having APACHE II score 0&#x02013;9. No mortality occurred in patients with APACHE II score 0&#x02013;9. Two deaths occurred in those with APACHE II score 10&#x02013;19, one was diagnosed typhoid perforation in an old male, and other was nonspecific perforation in adult female. Chest infection, renal failure, and sepsis accounted for their mortality. One patient with APACHE II score 21 managed to survive. Studies have reported unfavorable outcome in patients with APACHE II score of 20 or greater. High APACHE II score has predicted prognosis and mortality in various studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] APACHE II score predicted postoperative mortality in the study by Adesunkanmi <italic>et al</italic>.
