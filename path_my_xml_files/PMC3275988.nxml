The protocol was approved by the ethics committee of our institution. Randomization was done after we had taken written informed consent from the study participants and obtained baseline information. The random assignment scheme was created from a table of random numbers. Opaque prenumbered envelopes containing random assignments were maintained by the hospital pharmacist.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Patients</title><p>All the patients in the outpatient department of Orthopedics and Traumatology in our institution between October 2007 and September 2010 with sciatica were enrolled in the present study if they had the following inclusion criteria: (i) Sciatica was defined as the presence of pain in one or, both legs, radiating below the knee, with either nerve root compression sign (sensory, motor, or reflex deficits) and/or, nerve root irritation sign (reproduction of radicular pain by elevating the leg) along with computed tomographic (CT) evidence of a herniated nucleus pulposus at a level corresponding to the signs and symptoms; (ii) age 18 years or more; (iii) had a first or, recurrent episode of sciatica lasting for a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum of 1 year; and/or (iv) pain intensity must have a score higher than 30 mm on VAS.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they fulfilled the following exclusion criteria: (i) had signs and symptoms that warrant early surgical intervention (caudaequina syndrome, severe motor deficits, hyperalgesia); (ii) had CT scan evidence of signs and symptoms from causes other than a herniated nucleus pulposus; (iii) had received any previous epidural corticosteroid injections for the present episode; (iv) had undergone lower back spinal surgery; (v) pregnant patients; (vi) had a known allergy to corticosteroid or butorphanol; or (vii) had a known bleeding disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment</title><p>The patients received epidural injections of either 80 mg (2 mL) of methylprednisolone acetate and 1 mg (1 mL) of butorphanol diluted with 7 mL of isotonic saline, or 80 mg (2 mL) of methylprednisolone acetate diluted with 8 mL of isotonic saline by a lumbar interlaminar approach under fluoroscopic guidance. The injections were repeated on third and sixth weeks in the patients who continued to have scores higher than 30 mm on VAS. After the first injection, patients were supplied with paracetamol tablets (500 mg) for using as and when required basis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Blinding</title><p>The doctors making the follow-up assessment were unaware of the treatment received, and none of the doctors who administered the injections carried out the follow-up evaluations.

Although 14 controlled trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] have been done so far to evaluate the efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injections for sciatica due to herniated nucleus pulposus, it is very difficult to compare between them because: (i) only 7 studies consist of more than 20 patients in each group; and (ii) injection volume, number of injections, route of injection, and schedule of injection differ in various studies. Of these 14 studies, only 5 shows significant difference in favor of epidural corticosteroid injections[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and 9 found no significant difference in favor of corticosteroid injections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In a randomized double-blind controlled clinical trial of 100 patients treated with either epidural corticosteroid injections or with placebo, Dilke <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] found statistically significant differences in terms of relief of pain and return of normal daily activity in favor of the corticosteroid group. In a review of 39 patients, Ridley <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] reported significant pain relief in corticosteroid group within 2 weeks after the first injection. But, this benefit disappeared for 6 (35%) patients at 6 months follow-up visit, whereas 11 (65%) patients retained this benefit up to this time. They conclude that although epidural corticosteroid injections offer short-term pain relief, their long-term effect is doubtful. Similarly, in a study of 23 patients, Bush <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] found significant pain relief and significant increase in mobility in steroid group at 4 weeks, but, at 1 year this difference was only significant in terms of objective measurement (SLR). Snoek<italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Cuckler<italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] and Valat<italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] who addressed the same clinically relevant question failed to demonstrate significant difference in favor of corticosteroid group. In a study of 158 patients, Carette<italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] conclude that although epidural corticosteroid injections provide short-term pain relief, it does not provide significant functional improvement nor does it reduces the need for surgery.</p><p>Watts <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] performed a meta-analysis using pooled data of 907 patients from 11 previous randomized trials. They found that epidural corticosteroid injections were effective in the management of lumbosacral radicular pain. Although results of our study are not consistent with the results of this meta-analysis, this meta-analysis study has some limitations that need to be considered. The major limitation is that, the study was based on a collection of small trials. According to Bogduk<italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] overdependence on the results of meta-analysis that are based on the results of small trials should be avoided and should be considered with caution, even when the pooled data shows a statistically significant result. Whenever possible, a larger trial with sufficient power needs to be conducted to confirm the results of these meta-analyses that are based on a collection of small trials. In a recent large randomized double-blind controlled trial of 158 patients treated with either epidural corticosteroid injections or with placebo, Carette<italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] found that, although epidural corticosteroid injections provide short-term pain relief, it does not provide significant functional improvement nor does it reduce the need for surgery. The results of our study are consistent with the results of this larger trial with sufficient power.</p><p>So, convincing evidence of efficacy of epidural corticosteroid injection for sciatica due to herniated nucleus pulposus is lacking in various literature overviews. In the present study, we found statistically significant difference in favor of epidural butorphanol plus corticosteroid injections than corticosteroid alone.</p><p>The major strength of the present study is its prospective randomized, double-blind design. Both the patients and the assessing doctors were remained unaware of the treatment received throughout the trial. All the patients in each group were received epidural injections under fluoroscopic guidance. So, correct positions of the needle within the epidural space were confirmed intraoperatively under fluoroscopic guidance. A follow-up assessment of each patient was done by the same doctor throughout the trial. The follow-up assessment of each patient was done with the use of various outcome measures at regular standardized intervals.</p><p>However, the present study has some limitations. The major limitation is that, although we have successfully used combined epidural butorphanol plus corticosteroid injections, far larger numbers of patients are necessary to definitely conclude the safety and efficacy of this new therapeutic modality. Another weakness of our study is the number of patients who did not complete the 3 follow-up visits. However, as the rate of the patients lost to follow-up in our study is comparable with that in other studies, we do not believe that it hampers our results.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that epidural butorphanol plus corticosteroid injections, as compared with corticosteroid alone injections, offered marked improvement in pain, reflex, motor, and sensory deficits, and functional status and reduced the need for analgesics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> There was no source of external funding in support of this study</p></fn><fn
