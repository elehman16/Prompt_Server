About 75-50% of cardiac arrests during general anesthesia are because of difficult intubation that causes inadequate oxygenation and/or ventilation, which about 55-93% of them cause death or brain death.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Difficult laryngoscopy (characterized by poor glottic visualization) is equal to difficult intubation in the most patients. The reported data for difficult intubation varies from 1.5-13% in the patients who are undergoing surgery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Preoperative evaluation is very important but the fact that which of these anatomical landmarks and clinical factors are the best is unknown yet.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Several investigation explained prediction schemes by using a single risk factor or a multifactorial index.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A standard method for evaluation of difficult laryngoscopy is using the modified Mallampati (MMP) examination.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] For performing the MMT examination, the patient must be sit upright while his or her head is neutral position; tongue maximally protruded and has no phonation.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It was shown that the predictive value of the examination is dependent on the position of the cervical spine. Lewise and colleagues suggested that the MMP be performed with patient in sitting position while extended the craniocervical junction.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In a study which performed by Mashour and Sandberg,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] it was shown that the MMP with extension (Extended Mallampati Score, or EMS) was associated with improved specificity and positive predictive value. In another study, Mashour <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that the EMS predicted difficult laryngoscopy better than the MMT in the morbidly obese populations. Khan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that the upper lip bite test (ULBT) had more accuracy for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy compared with the MMT. Also, Krobbuaban and colleagues[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] showed that the ratio of height to thyromental distance (RHTMD) was a powerful bedsidescreening test for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy during preoperative period. To the best of our knowledge, there was no study to compare the EMS with the ULBT or RHTMD for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy. So, we designed this prospective blind study to compare predictive value of the three methods of airway assessment (EMS, ULBT and RHTMD) for difficult laryngoscopy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval from Ethic Committee of our university and taking written informed consent from the patients, this prospective observational study was performed on 467 consecutive ASA I-III adult patients. These patientswere scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation. They gave to participate in this randomized prospective double-blind study. The other inclusion criteria were patients who had no previous history of burn or trauma to the airway, had no tumors or mass in the laryngeal, facial and cervical region, had no restricted mobility of the neck and mandible (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or cervical diskdisorders), had ability to sit and open their mouth. Patient data which included sex, age, weight, height andbody mass index (BMI) were collected. The following four predictive test measurements were performed on all patients:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MMT: Samsoon and Young's modification of the Mallampati test[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] recorded oral cavity structures visible upon maximal mouth opening (as measured by interdental distance). While patient seated and the head was in natural position, each patient was asked to open his/her mouth as much as possible and to protrude the tongue without phonation. The view was classified as:</p><p>

</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>After generation of a randomization list, an anesthesiologist who was blinded to the study prepared identical patients and recorded all data. Another anesthesiologist blinded to the group allocation administered grade of laryngoscope patients. Then, after patient arrival to the operating room, routine monitoring including non-invasive arterial blood pressure, an electrocardiogram and oxygen saturation wasmeasured. Induction of anaesthesia was performed with 5 mg/kg of sodium thiopental intravenously (IV) and fentanyl 3 &#x003bc;g/kg IV. For facilitation of endotracheal intubation, atracurium 0.6 mg/kg IV was administered. The patients&#x02019; lungs were ventilated by mask with 100% oxygen. After that, laryngoscopy and evaluation of its difficulty was performed by a single anesthesiologist who was not informed from the preoperative class of airway. While the patient's head was placed in the sniffing position, the laryngoscopy was done by using a Macintosh #4 blade to visualize the larynx. The laryngoscopic view was classified by using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] without external laryngeal manipulation as following:</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Vocal cords visible;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only posterior commissure or arytenoids visible;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Only epiglottis visible;</p></list-item><list-item><p>None of the foregoing visible.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>During direct laryngoscopy, if the patient had CL III or IV view, it was considered difficult visualization of the larynx (DVL) and if it was CL I or II, it was considered Easy visualization of the larynx (EVL). By using MedCalc statistical software 9.3.6.0, power analysis showed that if the incidence of difficult laryngoscopy was considered 5%, 467 patients must be enrolled to the study for providing 80% power in detection of an improvement in discriminating power (measured by the area under curve of the appropriate receiver-operating characteristic curve) of an absolute value of 7% (e.g. from 60% to 67%) with a type I error of 5% and using a two-sided alternative hypothesis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (+LR) and negative likelihood ratio (- LR), positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of each test was calculated. Also, combinations of the predictors were formulated and the sensitivity, specificity, + LR, - LR, PPV and NPV were calculated and compared between the combinations. For determining clinical value of each score, the area under a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as the main end-point of the study. A ROC plot was achieved by calculating the sensitivity (true positive fraction) and specificity (true negative fraction) of every observed data value (cut-off value), and plotting sensitivity against 1 - specificity (false positive fraction). A value of 0.5 under the ROC curve indicates that the variable performs no better than chance and a value of 1.0 implies perfect discrimination. A larger area under the ROC curve denotes more reliability[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and good discrimination of the scoring system. Also, the ROC curves were used to recognize the optimal predictive cut-off points for each test. The most favorable predictive cut-off point is the point on the ROC curve that is nearest to the ideal point (sensitivity = 100%; false positive = 0%). Patient data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or numbers (%). BMI was calculated from weight (kg)/Height<sup>2</sup>(m). Patient data and value of the airway predictors were compared using t-tests for continuous variables and U-test for EMS, MMT or ULBT. Differences between the AUC values of four predictive tests were analyzed using MedCalc statistical software 9.3.6.0, and a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was defined as statistically significant. All other calculations were performed using the SPSS version 16.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Four hundred seventy six patients were included in the present study. Out of which four patients were excluded from the study on account morbid obesity (3 patients), trauma to the airway (1 patient).

DVL was observed in 33 (6.9%) patients. No patient excluded from the study due to failed intubation. As <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> show, the patients&#x02019; weight, BMI and RHTMD was significantly different between the DVL and EVL groups. The distributions for MMT, EMS, ULBT, the Cormack and Lehane grades are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. The measures used to explain the predictive properties of the four models are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. The AUC of the ROC for the EMS (AUC 0.703; 95% CI, 0.660-0.744) was significantly higher than MMT (AUC 0.569;95% CI, 0.523-0.614, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) but it was significantly lower when compared with the ULBT (AUC 0.820;95% CI, 0.783-0.854, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) and the RHTMD score (AUC 0.845; 95% CI, 0.810&#x02013;0.877, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The AUC of the ROC for the ULBT and the RHTMD score was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Predictive values for the foursingle or combined predictors are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>. The cut-off points for predicting difficult intubation was Grade 3 for ULBT, MMT and EMS. The most sensitive of the single tests was the ULBT with a sensitivity of 75.8% while for the MMT, it was the least sensitivity equal to 63.6%. The sensitivity for EMS (66.7) was higher than MMT and lower than ULBT [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The RHTMD had highest specificity equal to 90.52% and highest positive predictive value equal to 36.4% compared with the other three tests. The positive predictive value for EMS was higher than MMT and lower than RHTMD. The highest negative predictive value and the AUC of ROC curve amongst single predictors were with the RHTMD. The negative predictive value for EMS was higher than MMT and lower than RHTMD [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. His combination of the EMS with RHTMD, ULBT or MMT increased the AUC of ROC curve compared with the EMS as single predictors but that was not statistically significant. The combination with the best results wasthe EMS&#x02013;RHTMD with specificity, the positive likelihood ratio, the PPV, the AUC of ROC curve of 99.3%, 93.97, 87.5%, and 0.815 respectively. The optimal cut-off point for the RHTMD for predicting difficult laryngoscopy was 29.3 (sensitivity, 72.73%; specificity, 90.52%). The multivariate analysis oddsratios (95% CI) of the RHTMD, Mallampati class, EMS and ULBT were 0.062 (0.030-0.129), 0.069 (0.038-0.128), 0.015 (0.006-0.036) and 0.050 (0.029-0.086), respectively. The multivariate analysis relative risk (95% CI) of the RHTMD, Mallampati class, EMS and ULBT were 1.511 (1.267-1.802), 1.804 (1.356-2.398), 4.449 (2.414-8.198) and 3.307 (1.772-6.171), respectively.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-133-g001"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data, BMI and mean for RHTMD of all patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-133-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Distribution of MMT, EMS, ULBT and laryngoscopic view of all patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-133-g003"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Predictive values for MMT, EMS, ULBT and RHTMD to predict the occurrence of a grade 3 or 4 intubation according to the modified cormack-lehane classification</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-133-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A major factor that has been considered to be related to the morbidity and mortality following anesthesia is unexpected difficult intubation.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] For this reason, it is necessary to investigate for a simple and accurate predictive test. The previous studies reported that the incidence of difficult intubation was 1.3-13% which was depending to the criteria employed for its definition.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The incidence of DVL was 6.9% in our study and it was comparable with the some previous studies.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] The difference in incidence of DVL can be due to various factors such as different anthropometric features that exists among populations, unavailability of uniform grading in description of laryngeal views, application of cricoids pressure, position of head, the degree of muscle relaxation and the type or size of laryngoscope blade. Our data showed that the AUC of ROC for RHTMD and ULBT was 0.845 and 0.820 respectively, whereas the AUC for the corresponding EMSand MMT was 0.703 and 0.569 respectively. These data documented that the EMS was better than MMT for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy while the RHTMD and ULBT had more power than EMS in this regard. Also, we foundthat the AUC of ROC curve for RHTMD to predict difficult intubations was notsignificantly different from the ULBT. Another important finding in our study was that combination of EMS with RHTMD, ULBT, and MMT didn&#x02019;t increase its accuracy for predicting of difficult intubation. The combination of EMS with RHTMD or ULBT increased its accuracy compared with using EMS alone but not in comparison with using RHTMD or ULBT alone. In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, positiveand negative predictive values ofthe ULBT were 75.76%, 80.81%, 22.7%, and 97.8% respectively. These values were76.5%, 88.7%, 28.9%, and 98.4% respectively, in the original study by Khan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in 2003. Khan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] study showed that the ULBT wasbetter than MMT in prediction of difficult airway. Their conclusion is in agreement with the results of our study. Our study showed that the RHTMD was the useful predictor with a sensitivity and specificity 72.73% and 90.52% respectively. Also, it was shown that ULBT and RHTMD had less amount of detection failure for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy than the MMT test. In addition, one of useful index for evaluation of efficacy of a predictive test is the likelihood ratio (LR1) fora positive test. This index is equal to the number of timesmore likely that a patient with a positive test resultwill present with a difficult intubation. In our study, the LR1was 6.67 and 3.95 for the RHTMD and ULBT respectively, whereas it was 1.2 and 2.12 for the MMT and EMS. As Schmitt and colleagues[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] study showed, the RHTMD &#x0003e;25 can be used to predict difficult laryngoscopy but they emphasized that it might be dependable to the race and population that study was performed in them. In our study, a RHTMD more than 29.3 was a cutoff point for predicting difficult visualization of larynx. This difference between our study with Schmitt <italic>et al</italic>. merit more studies to determine the importance of ethnicity. In calculation of RHTMD, it is necessary to measure patient's TMD and height precisely. Therefore inter-observer variations are highly unlikely in contrast to significant inter-observer variations that found with the MMT. Also, many patients phonate involuntary during evaluation of the MMT score which may alter significantly the classification of Mallampati score.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Mashour <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed that the EMS was superior to MMT for prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in the morbidly obese population. Their findings were in agreement with our study. It was the only study performed on the specific of EMS, and there is no other texture to accept or deny this. It was shown that predictive value of the MMT is dependent on the position of patient. Lewis and colleagues[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] showed that best position for evaluation by MMT was the patient sitting, head extended and tongue maximally protruded. We designed our study in elective surgical patients while emergency cases were not included in the study. Also, our conclusion is not applicable to all subgroups of the general population such as elderly, obese or patient candidate for cesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Our study showed that the EMS was better predictor of difficult laryngoscopy than MMT in general population. The RHTMD and ULBT were superior to the EMS in this concern. Combination of EMS with the other scores didn&#x02019;t significantly increase accuracy of it in predicting difficult airway. This is the first study that compared the predictive value of EMS with RHTMD, MMT, and ULBT. It is necessary to do more studies with larger sample size in different populations before final conclusion can be elucidated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The authors wish to sincerely thank the support of all the colleagues in Kahani Hospital Medical Center affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Isfahan, Iran.
