Earlier studies have indicated a high frequency of neck and lower back pain among Estonian nurses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], necessitating a search for appropriate intervention methods to improve CROM and LROM in order to prevent and reduce neck and lower back pain among nurses.</p><p>Physical exercise has been evaluated as an effective intervention method for improving CROM and LROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and for reducing MSP in the neck and lower back [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Many authors have emphasized that such programmes should be conducted with sufficient frequency, intensity and duration, plus appropriate ergonomic counselling and supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Ergonomic interventions without physical exercise may be ineffective in preventing or reducing MSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], possibly because of insufficient or inconsistent implementation of ergonomic practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some studies have supported physical activity programmes in the workplace as being more effective intervention methods compared to home-exercise programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, Jakobsen and et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found the effects of physical exercise on musculoskeletal pain did not depend on whether exercises were conducted at the workplace or during leisure time at home. Moreover, Kuukkanen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found that supervised home exercises led to reduced lower back pain and these positive effects persisted for more than five years after the exercise programme was compleated.

We found a significant increase in cervical flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation, and in lumbar lateral flexion, after therapy. The largest increase in range of motion was found for cervical flexion; after 8-weeks, this value approached the age-specific normal CROM value of 58&#x02013;60&#x000b0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Our study results showed the exercise therapy programme had a greater effect on CROM compared to LROM. Therefore, the types of exercises needed to achieve better results in both CROM and LROM within a single therapy programme should be explored further. Our study results are difficult to compare with previous findings due to differences in study designs, exercise therapy programmes and outcome measurements. Only in some previous studies are CROM and or LROM compared before and after an exercise therapy programme. Tseng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] examined the effects of range-of-motion exercise on the upper and lower extremities and found positive effects in enhancing physical and psychological functions of older people after a stroke. More evidence is available concerning the positive effects of regular exercise on musculoskeletal symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Alexandre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] suggested that regular exercise can reduce musculoskeletal symptoms in nursing personnel. However, Dehlin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] found no effect of eight weeks of physical exercise on lower back pain. The negative results in their study could be explained by the low frequency of physical exercises, because in the study exercise was performed only twice a week and may thereby have been insufficient to decrease MSP. Cleland et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] found that thoracic spine manipulation together with cervical range of motion exercise was more beneficial for patients with neck pain than exercise only. Since neck and lower back pain are often associated with CROM and LROM limitations, the results of previous studies allowed us to make assumptions about how physical exercise led to CROM and LROM improvements. After the exercise therapy programme in our study, six participants were completely pain-free; and on mean pain intensity in the neck and lower back of the other seven participants was significantly lower than before (0.7 (SD 0.7).</p><p>Our method of investigation had the advantage of using well-known instruments for collecting MSP self-evaluations (NMQ and VAS); however Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) have been found to be more clinimetrically reliable than VAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We also used an objective and reliable method for collecting CROM and LROM measurements (AcumarTM Digital Inclinometer, Version 5.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Additionally, as all CROM and LROM measurements were made by the same physical therapist, a high reliability of measurements can be assumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The main limitations of this study were related to the number of subjects and quasi-experimental design of the study. Due to the small population of volunteer ICU nurses, it was difficult to find a sufficient sample size of subjects with suitable characteristics for randomization. In general, the major problem with quasi-experimental designs is that the experimental and control group might not be similar in terms of the demographic parameters selected for intervention and comparison. This lack of recruitment numbers required the control group to be from an asymptomatic population. However, the experimental and control group in our study were homogeneous for age, height, weight and BMI (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Our study was limited to investigating the effects of a home-exercise therapy programme on CROM and LROM. Other intervention strategies (e.g. participatory ergonomics) that could increase the effectiveness of any programme should also be taken into consideration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. As the aetiology of cervical and lumbar disorders is multifactorial, a combination of intervention programmes for intensive care nurses should be studied in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, as the cost-effectiveness of any intervention method is an important consideration, it would be ideal to find effective and low-cost interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>According to the training diaries nine of the experimental subjects participated in other aerobic training, such as cycling, running, walking, swimming, rollerblading and rowing, on average two times a week. Aerobic training outside of the exercise therapy programme was negatively associated with total CROM. This association might show possible over-training and or physical overload in the cervical spine, which may have influenced the effectiveness of the programme. In the future, randomized controlled trials are recommended to investigate the effects of exercise therapy programmes on CROM and LROM with and without other types of aerobic training. Consideration of the duration of the exercise program, initiating at 20&#x000a0;min and increasing to 60&#x000a0;min, may also need to be considered in terms of participant demand.</p><p>Our study results confirm that home-exercise programmes are useful for improving cervical and lumbar range of motion. To achieve better results in mobility of lumbar flexion and extension parameters, specific exercises individually adapted for each person need to be implemented in further studies. Although Alexandre et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] suggest that a standard programme of exercises conducted twice a week with an ergonomic approach could reduce musculoskeletal symptoms in nursing personnel, an individual approach could be more effective. Jakobsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] found that performing physical exercise at the workplace together with colleagues may be more motivating for some employees.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study indicated that CROM increased in all studied directions and that LROM increased in lateral flexion after the completion of an 8-week home-exercise therapy programme designed for intensive care nurses with MSP. We conclude that the used home-exercise therapy programme seemed to be effective for improving CROM and to a lesser extent LROM. Further studies are needed to develop this simple but effective home-exercise therapy programme to help motivate nurses to perform such exercises regularly. This study may contribute to the knowledge base within this area, however further research is required in larger samples, possibly with a symptomatic control group and more clinically rigorous outcome measures.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CROM</term><def><p>Cervical range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LROM</term><def><p>Lumbar range of motion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSP</term><def><p>Musculoskeletal pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMQ</term><def><p>Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual Analogue Scale</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they had no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>TF devised the study, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript.
