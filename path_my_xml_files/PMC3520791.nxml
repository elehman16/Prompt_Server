Humans have a strong tendency to judge the intention of others from their sequent behaviors. In general, people trust others who behave fairly, but not always. Here we show that judgments of both intentional aspects and memory of intentional behavior are automatically influenced by unintentional benefits from the behaviors of others. We conducted a reward-manipulated and repeated trust game by using real participants interacting with moving image partners on a computer screen. The participants assessed likability, trustworthiness, and perceived integrity of the partners in pre- and post-game questionnaires. The results of judgments of all three dimensions and the memory of frequency of each partner's fair behavior (sharing) were strongly influenced by profitability in the trust game, even though all partners shared 75% of the profit and participants were told that profitability was randomly assigned to each partner. Furthermore, these effects were moderated by the gender of the participants: males were more sensitive to monetary profits than were females. The results reveal that humans automatically trust, approve the integrity of, and recall well the fair behavior of others who provide affectively positive outcomes such as monetary profits. We call this phenomenon the &#x0201c;affect ripple effect&#x0201d;.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (No. 24680029) of the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture, Japan.

Previous studies using investment-game experiments demonstrated that participants form a likable impression and highly trustworthiness of other players, depending on the fair behavior of the participants <xref rid="pone.0051484-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Delgado1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, and they strongly remember whether the other players behaved fairly or unfairly <xref rid="pone.0051484-Singer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, one may infer and judge others' intentions based on their behavior <xref rid="pone.0051484-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The ability of inferring others' mental state, such as theory of mind, is a central function in interpersonal perception <xref rid="pone.0051484-Saxe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Tomasello1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which may enable us to see behaviors counter to the socially accepted norm <xref rid="pone.0051484-Cosmides1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>However, in having continuous interactions with others, someone who provides benefit for others may be trusted and recognized to have integrity even if he/she actually does not behave fairly or is not cooperative, such as a selfish but effective and beneficial leader. For example, a useful job ability, more than intentional fairness, is a better predictor of trustworthiness of workers in a workplace <xref rid="pone.0051484-Colquitt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Thus, we need additional explanation for the reason why a person even behaving not fairly is trusted or recognized his/her integrity by someone.</p><p>Here we focus on effect and attribution of affect occurred by other's beneficial behavior on social judgment and memory. Because an affective impression influences automatically and quickly <xref rid="pone.0051484-Zajonc1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, interpersonal preference such as good or bad may have a strong impact on interpersonal perception <xref rid="pone.0051484-Anderson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Fazio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Todorov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and may expand to a multidimensional judgment of personality, such as the halo effect <xref rid="pone.0051484-Nisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Affective and subliminal information sometimes unconsciously or automatically manipulates judgment in not only the judgment of visual materials <xref rid="pone.0051484-Winkielman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> but also of social targets <xref rid="pone.0051484-Bargh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Furthermore, humans have a strong tendency to attribute the cause of behavior to others performing the behavior rather than their situation. This tendency is known as correspondence bias <xref rid="pone.0051484-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Taking the affect effect into consideration, humans may attribute not only behaviors but also the affective outcome of the behaviors unconsciously. In addition, humans recall selective or even false memory to justify a decision made later <xref rid="pone.0051484-Johansson1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Mather1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Thus, it is possible that affective interpersonal judgments also influence interpersonal memory, in which a positive affect strengthens positive memory, including behavioral fairness.</p><p>There is now common agreement that the trust game, in which two people interact in an economic investment game, is one of the useful methods for researching not only economic behavior but also interpersonal judgments and memory in social relationships <xref rid="pone.0051484-Delgado1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Chang1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Stanley1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. We used a modified version of the trust game to characterize the relationship between interpersonal judgments, memory, and another's profitability as results of the behaviors of others. Regarding investment behaviors in trust game, people are generally supposed to take more risks when they believe that the expected monetary return from the partner is higher, and these beliefs being influenced by their previous monetary experience with this partner. Furthermore, we expected this monetary experience may automatically influence the judgments of intention and memory of the partner by affective effect. So, we hypothesized that the economic profitability of partners influences judgments of intention and memory of the intentional behavior of a partner, even when the perceiver obviously realizes that the profitability is logically not related to the target intention.</p><p>In the present study, we conducted a repeated trust game in which participants play 12 times with each 15 partner who were individually presented as a moving image on a computer screen. In the trust game, each partner had been assigned randomly an &#x0201c;Multiplier Rate (MR)&#x0201d; from a set of seven different rates (0 to 12) and a null condition. Investment is automatically multiplied by the MR as an experimental condition, profitability. Immediately before and after the section of the repeated trust game, participants assessed likability, trustworthiness, and perceived integrity of that partner. Therefore, the pre-game partner judgments were elicited before knowing the value of the MR. After the post-game partner judgments, participants answered a questionnaire that included memory tests asking the frequency of the shared behavior, the reward magnitude from each partner, and debriefing items.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-two Japanese students living in the Tokyo metropolitan area participated in the experiment (32 females, mean age &#x000b1; SD: 21.15&#x000b1;1.38 yrs).

All 15 persons were Japanese males (mean age &#x000b1; SD: 23.93&#x000b1;1.29) and were dressed in business shirts. We orally confirmed that no partner was the acquaintance of any participants in the end of each experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment was divided into five parts: instruction, pre-game partner judgments, trust game, post-game partner judgments, and debriefing questionnaire. First, in the instruction phase, participants were asked to answer a 6-item scale (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.81) for &#x0201c;general trust&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0051484-Yamagishi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> with the 7-point Likert-type scale of 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). A sample item includes &#x0201c;Most people are basically honest&#x0201d;. General trust, as a kind of belief about others, may influence social judgment, as individuals who are high in general trust initially trust others more strongly but judge the other's behavior more strictly than individuals who are low in general trust <xref rid="pone.0051484-Yamagishi1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Yamagishi2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. We aimed to test whether this belief effect or a moderate MR effect affected social judgments in continuous interactions, such as in a repeated trust game.</p><p>Then, they were given instructions (See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051484.s002">Appendix S1</xref>) on the experimental procedure and the rules of each task, and they were informed that during the trust game they would earn units of experimental currency that would be paid to them in cash at the conclusion of the experiment. Participants were given explanations of the possible range of participation.

Perceived integrity was assessed by using a different type of scale from likability and trustworthiness because we tried to test the consistency of our result among different measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0051484.s010">Table. S8</xref> presents all the items, Cronbach's alpha, and factor loadings of likability and trustworthiness). We measured likability and trustworthiness using four items, including one reverse item, on the 7-point Likert-type scale with anchors of 1 (disagree strongly) to 7 (agree strongly). Some studies suggested that likability and trustworthiness are similar dimensions <xref rid="pone.0051484-Todorov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Rosenber1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and actually had strong relationship in this studies, as expected (Pearson's <italic>r</italic>(728)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.767, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;.001; df (728) was result from the data quantity in which all partners' judgments except null condition (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;14) of all participants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;52)), while some studies treated trustworthiness as a different concept from simple likability or preference <xref rid="pone.0051484-Colquitt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. To assess the discriminant validity of these in this study, we first conducted a factor analysis with judgment data using likelihood method factoring and promax rotation. Consistent with above, the first factor accounted majority of the variance (factor 1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;58.31%; factor 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4.41%) while the factor loadings of items were clearly separated. The 2-factor solution accounted for 62.72% of the variance in the items and the overall fit statistics of this model were good: &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (13)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.743, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.018. We measured perceived integrity using four items, including one reverse item on a 7-point Likert-type scale with anchors of 1 (extremely low) to 7 (extremely high). The measurements were displayed on a screen and participants assessed partners by pushing a number button on the keyboard. Participants saw 12 item blocks of 15 faces and, therefore, had 180 judgments pre- and post-game. This task had no time limitation.

In each trial in the trust game, the participant plays with one of the partners and first chooses a high risk (30 UEC) or a low risk (15 UEC) investment with the partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0051484-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). This investment is automatically multiplied by the &#x0201c;Multiplier Rate (MR)&#x0201d; as an experimental condition. Then the partner can either keep the entire multiplied investment or share the investment with the participant half and half. A key manipulation was that each partner had been assigned randomly an MR from a set of seven different rates (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12) and a null condition, all of which were unknown to the participant at the start of the experiment. Each MR condition was assigned to two partners and the null condition was assigned to one partner. When the participant chose the 30 UEC investment and the partner chose to share, the average outcomes of each MR condition for the participant were as follows: MR0 partner&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;30 UEC (because the invested 30 UEC is lost), MR2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 UEC, MR4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;30 UEC, MR6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;60 UEC, MR8&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;90 UEC, MR10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;120 UEC, and MR12&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;150 UEC. The outcome, which fluctuated within a small range of less than 15% (e.g., MR8: 82&#x02013;98 UEC in each MR except MR1 (always 0 UEC) when the partner shared). When the partner chose keeping, the participant lost the investment in this trial (30 or 15 UEC) regardless of the partner's MR. In the trial with the null condition partner who did not respond and was just displayed in the movie, the UEC of the participant did not change. The frequency of reciprocity, which is an intentional behavior of all partners, was controlled to 75% sharing and 25% keeping, except for the null condition partner. Each participant played 4 blocks of 45 trials for a total of 180 trials. Each trial was divided into a participant's decision phase (2.5 s), a partner's decision phase (2.5 s), and an outcome phase (1 s). During the decision phase, participants viewed moving images of a partner and options (&#x0201c;30&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;15&#x0201d;). During the outcome phase, a behavioral outcome (&#x0201c;share&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;keep&#x0201d;) and a monetary outcome (amount of loss/gain) were presented. During the outcome phase of the null condition partner, &#x0201c;N/A&#x0201d;, which means no answer, was presented.</p><fig id="pone-0051484-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0051484.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Experimental design of trust game.</title><p>A trial in the game was divided into a decision phase and an outcome phase and was played with moving image partners.

Importantly, participants were told that the MR of each partner was assigned randomly by computers and their responses were the same as the actual behavior recorded in the trust game in the initial experiment in which partner movies were taken. After the explanation, participants had 8 practice trials of the trust game with photographs of different males from partners. We confirmed that all participants understood the rule of the game after the practices.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Questionnaire</title><p>In the last phase of experiments, participants answered the computerized questionnaire, which included two memory tests and debriefing items. In the first memory test, participants chose the share ratio (0% to 100%) of each partner during the trust game. In the second memory test, participants chose the reward magnitude (&#x02212;60 to +150 UEC) at the time participants had invested 30 UEC and the partner shared. In each test, the order of presentation of the partners was randomized. The debriefing items were four items, including &#x0201c;How do you feel when a high/low MR partner shared/kept during the trust game?&#x0201d; on the 7-point Likert scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a; very bad feeling, 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;very good feeling) for the manipulation check.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Manipulation check by debriefing items in the questionnaire</title><p>A two-way repeated analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a significant interaction (F(1, 51)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40.34, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) between the MR and the partner response. Simple tests of the main effect revealed that the ratings for high MR partners (6.25) were significantly higher than those for low MR partners (4.94) at the time that the partner shared (F(1, 51)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;112.36, <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001), while not when the partner kept (high MR: 2.44; low MR: 2.69; F(1, 51)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1.57, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.22).

The statistical threshold of P&#x0003c;0.05 (two-tailed) was applied for all statistical tests. Furthermore, a series of structure equation models (SEM) was performed to investigate the relationship between independent variables (pre-game judgments, MR, gender) and dependent variables (post-game judgments, memory, risk-taking behaviors).

The economic profit and loss strongly affected the judgments of likability, trustworthiness, integrity, and memory of fair behavior of the partners, even though the actual sharing ratio (75%) was the same among all partners. Importantly, the result of the memory of fair behavior suggests that perceivers could believe that partners providing more profits have a more cooperative intention in comparison to those providing fewer profits. In other words, humans may really trust the intention of beneficial others. The findings of this study are also supported by industrial research <xref rid="pone.0051484-Colquitt1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and perceptual study <xref rid="pone.0051484-Todorov1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>This effect on interpersonal judgment was moderated by gender: males were more sensitive to monetary profits than were females, which is consistent with other reports of investment games <xref rid="pone.0051484-Buchan1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. However, it was slightly modified by &#x0201c;general trust&#x0201d;, which is a kind of conscientious belief. Therefore, this effect from beneficial behavior is independent from some cognitive beliefs and is a biologically fundamental and automatic mechanism.</p><p>We found that participants tend to remember more the MR associated to a subject than his previous decisions. Although the MR of each partner was unknown to the participants at the beginning of the trust games, the result of the SEM indicated that the participants attributed their economic outcome to each partner's behavior during the interaction, which may be an affective and inner factor. Furthermore, this affective factor influenced all dependent variables, even though the variables, such as trustworthiness, perceived integrity, and fairness of memory, were logically unrelated to the economic profitability during the games. These effects were consistent with other studies of affective effect <xref rid="pone.0051484-Zajonc1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Nisbett1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Winkielman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Bargh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>As an extension of the well-known phenomenon of the economic ripple effect, we call this phenomenon the &#x0201c;affect ripple effect&#x0201d; because the affect related to a beneficial outcome has wide effects beyond the logical or meaningful boundaries of various dimensions of social cognition. This phenomenon is not simply explained as an attribution error, such as correspondence bias. In correspondence bias, humans unconsciously have a tendency to attribute behaviors to the actor rather than the situation surrounding the actor <xref rid="pone.0051484-Gilbert1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. This study demonstrated that humans unconsciously use the outcome of behaviors as reasons of judgments of the actor's trait and the memory of intentional behavior in some conditions. As we manipulated the reward magnitude, the affect underlies this effect. While subliminal priming effect studies <xref rid="pone.0051484-Winkielman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Bargh1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> strongly support our results, those studies also suggest the effect disappears or contrasts in the case that the priming was conscious to the perceiver and essentially unrelated to the evaluation of the stimuli <xref rid="pone.0051484-Higgins1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Lombardi1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Wegener1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Here, we found a strong effect, even though the difference of the reward magnitude was conscious and essentially unrelated to the partner's behavior. Because humans try instinctively to infer other's intentions <xref rid="pone.0051484-Winter1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Saxe1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051484-Tomasello1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, especially in interactive situations, the inference and memory might be strongly influenced by the affective outcome from other behaviors.</p><p>It is noted that we found a negative bias on social memory by the economic outcome, in accordance with prospect theory <xref rid="pone.0051484-Kahneman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Participants recalled keeping behaviors providing monetary loss more often than the actual frequency, even for the highest MR partners. This result suggested that participants had a stronger impression from a loss than from a gain so that they recalled negative behavior more. However, additional studies are needed because the present study could not explore the variations of magnitude, especially of loss.</p><p>In addition, we presented a paradigm for studying the relationship among social judgment, memory, decision, and affective outcome or beneficial trait in continuous and interactive relationships, providing that the MR-manipulated trust game and the memory test of the fair behavior ratio are useful methods. For example, although this study emphasizes the affective effect on inference and memory, cognitive control also can influence the affective effect <xref rid="pone.0051484-Frith1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In this study, such cognitive effort was not counted. Moreover, we used only males as partners of the trust game. Therefore, it is needed to conduct experiment with female partners in order to understand the gender effect more correctly. Finally, it is also possible that some cognitive knowledge or attitude other than General Trust could be used to explore interpersonal judgments and memory of other behaviors. Further explorations in this area would be meaningful.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provided crucial evidence of the central reason why the same sequent behaviors of the same person are judged differently by individual people. This implication can also be expanded to the practical effects and reasons of situations, such as salesmen sometimes get trusted by customer entertaining them at great expense even though this is not logically related to their service quality or product, and subordinates are often recognized by their bosses flattering them even though it is an obvious compliment. Moreover, findings in this study shed a new light on and provide additional evidence of the human mechanism, in which interpersonal judgment and memory must be evolutionally based on a fundamental learning mechanism. Interestingly, as with chimpanzees who prefer others who give foods <xref rid="pone.0051484-Melis1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, humans automatically not only prefer, but also trust, approve the integrity of, and strengthen the positive memory of others providing affectively positive outcomes to themselves.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0051484.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
