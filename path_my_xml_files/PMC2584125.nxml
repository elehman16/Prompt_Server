The observation that GHS-R is located in peripheral tissues suggests that ghrelin may exert direct effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>). The effects of ghrelin on substrate in humans are uncertain, but insulin resistance and stimulation of lipolysis have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). However, it remains difficult to segregate direct effects from effects related to GH and cortisol, and we have recently demonstrated that somatostatin infusion fails to sufficiently suppress ghrelin-induced GH and cortisol secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Hormonally replaced hypopituitary patients constitute a means for studying putative GH- and cortisol-independent effects of ghrelin in human subjects in vivo.</p><p>We aimed to study potential direct effects of ghrelin on substrate metabolism and insulin sensitivity in the postabsorptive state. In one experiment in healthy adults, we assessed whether ghrelin-induced GH release translated into GH signaling in skeletal muscle, in the event of which the importance of abrogating indirect effects of ghrelin is obvious. Second, we studied the effects of ghrelin exposure on whole-body and regional substrate metabolism in the basal and insulin-stimulated state in hypopituitary patients on stable replacement with GH and hydrocortisone.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>The studies were conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration and following the approval by the local ethics committee, the Danish Medicines Agency, and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) unit of Aarhus University Hospital. Both protocols were registered (Clinicaltrials.gov identification study 1: NCT00116025 and study 2: NCT00139945).</p><sec><title>Preparation of synthetic ghrelin.</title><p>Synthetic human acylated ghrelin (NeoMPS, Strasbourg, France) was dissolved in isotonic saline and sterilized by double passage through a 0.8/0.2-&#x003bc;m pore-size filter (Super Acrodisc; Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI).</p></sec><sec><title>Study 1: subjects and study protocol.</title><p>Six healthy men (aged 23 &#x000b1; 1 years, BMI 23.5 &#x000b1; 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were examined as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>). They received a constant infusion of saline or ghrelin (5 pmol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) starting at 0 min. At 90 min, a muscle biopsy was obtained from the lateral vastus muscle with a Bergstr&#x000f6;m biopsy needle (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Study 2: subjects and study protocol.</title><p>Eight hypopituitary men (aged 53 &#x000b1; 4 years, BMI 31.6 &#x000b1; 1.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) on stable replacement therapy with GH and hydrocortisone (for &#x0003e;3 months) participated. None of the patients had diabetes (A1C 5.7 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x00025; &#x0005b;range 4.9&#x02013;6.0&#x0005d;) or any concomitant chronic disease. Each patient was studied on two occasions with 5-h infusions of saline or ghrelin (5 pmol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Both study days commenced at 0800 h after an overnight fast (&#x0003e;9 h), with the subjects remaining fasting.</p><p>One intravenous cannula was inserted in the antecubital region for infusion, and one intravenous cannula was inserted in a heated dorsal hand vein for sampling of arterialized blood. At <italic>t</italic> &#x0003d; 0 min, saline or a primed-continuous ghrelin infusion (5 pmol &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) was commenced. The bolus dose was estimated from the elimination rate constant of ghrelin (<italic>k</italic><italic><sub>01</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>) and infused over a 20-min interval to avoid an overshoot of steady-state levels. Muscle biopsies were obtained at 120 min, as described above. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (insulin 0.6 mU &#x000b7; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; Actrapid, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) was performed from 120 to 300 min. Plasma glucose was clamped at 5.0 mmol/l by adjusting the rate of infusion of 20&#x00025; glucose according to plasma glucose measurements every 10 min. Insulin sensitivity was calculated from the glucose infusion rate (GIR) during the clamp. The period from 0 to 120 min is referred to as the basal period and the period from 120 to 300 min as the clamp period.

Serum GH, cortisol, and insulin were analyzed with a double monoclonal immunofluorometric assay (Delfia; Perkin Elmer, Wallac Oy, Turku, Finland). Serum free fatty acids (FFAs) were determined using a commercial kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany).

Aliquots of protein were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblotting was performed using primary antibodies as follows: p signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT5)a and -b, STAT5, pSTAT3, STAT3, p extracellular signal&#x02013;regulated kinase (ERK)1 and -2, ERK-1 and -2, p AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)&#x003b1;, AMPK&#x003b1;-pan, p acetyal-CoA carboxylase (ACC), pAkt, pAkt substrate, and Akt substrate 160 (AS160). Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase&#x02013;coupled secondary antibodies, visualized by BioWest enhanced chemiluminescence (UVP LabWorks, Upland, CA) and quantified by the UVP BioImaging System.

This investigation is also the first to document that ghrelin-induced endogenous GH release translates into Janus kinase/STAT signaling in skeletal muscle.</p><p>In some human studies, ghrelin administration increases plasma levels of glucose and FFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>) and reduces glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), indicating insulin resistance. These effects are, however, partly attributable to GH and/or cortisol secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). There are both clinical and in vitro data to suggest that ghrelin directly suppresses glucose-induced insulin secretion from the &#x003b2;-cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>), whereas administration of a ghrelin antagonist does the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>). Moreover, ghrelin knockout mice display enhanced glucose-induced insulin release from isolated islets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>) and exhibit increased peripheral insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>). Ghrelin/GHS-R double knockout mice show lower glucose levels after a glucose tolerance test and a more rapid drop in plasma glucose levels after an insulin tolerance test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>).</p><p>Our study in hypopituitary men demonstrates that ghrelin in humans directly suppresses insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and stimulates FFA release. The observations at the whole-body level were corroborated by the demonstration of increased concentrations of glucose in skeletal muscle interstitial tissue. Previously, it has been demonstrated that in humans glucose disposal rates during hyperinsulinemic clamp conditions are predominantly determined by the rate of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>). By contrast, we observed no significant effect of ghrelin on hepatic insulin sensitivity. AMPK appears to be a key messenger in ghrelin signaling in several tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>), and AMPK is also a recognized cellular energy sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>). In our study, we did not record any significant effect of ghrelin on the activation of either AMPK or ACC in skeletal muscle. The biopsies, however, were only obtained in the basal period, which limits assessment of aberrations in insulin signaling pathways. The molecular mechanisms by which ghrelin causes insulin resistance in humans thus remain to be further ascertained and should be studied in both basal and insulin-stimulated conditions.</p><p>Serum FFA levels increased in response to ghrelin, which did not translate into increased lipid oxidation. It should be noted that hypopituitary adults are moderately obese, which is likely to influence any effect of ghrelin on FFA turnover. More importantly, infusion of ghrelin does not imitate the secretory pattern of endogenous ghrelin. Furthermore, this study was powered to detect effects of ghrelin on insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>), and lack of significance with regard to lipid metabolism may be due to a &#x003b2; error.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time in humans that ghrelin directly induces lipolysis and resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. We also demonstrate that ghrelin-induced GH release translates into GH signaling in skeletal muscle, emphasizing the significance of accounting for GH when evaluating any effects of ghrelin. The physiological significance of the direct metabolic effects of endogenous ghrelin remains unclear, but we propose that ghrelin in concert with GH partition substrate metabolism during conditions of energy shortage in such a way as to restrict glucose utilization to insulin-independent tissues such as the brain.</p></sec>
