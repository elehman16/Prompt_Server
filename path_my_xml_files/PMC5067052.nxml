Ixekizumab, an anti-interleukin 17A monoclonal antibody approved for patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, is delivered subcutaneously via prefilled syringe or autoinjector. Here we report the results of an ixekizumab autoinjector usability study as well as the patient-reported experience with the autoinjector in a clinical trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The usability study enrolled 49 subjects (patients with a range of autoimmune conditions or their caregivers). Subjects were randomized to a trained or untrained group and were evaluated for their ability to perform an injection successfully when provided the device and the instructions for use. In the clinical trial, 102 subjects (patients with psoriasis or their caregivers) used the autoinjector to deliver injections of ixekizumab (80 mg every 2 weeks after a starting dose of 160 mg). At weeks 0, 4, and 8, subjects completed the subcutaneous administration assessment questionnaire, which assesses the ease of use and confidence with using an injection device.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the usability study, all subjects in the untrained arm performed successful injections, while two subjects in the trained arm had an injection failure.

Although biologics have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and tolerability, long-term outcomes are dependent on the patients&#x02019; long-term adherence.<xref rid="b1-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Most biologic therapies are self-administered via subcutaneous injection. In patients with Ps, self-injection may be impacted by reduced fine motor skills due to comorbid rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or disease involvement of the distal digits and/or nails, and these issues may promote nonadherence. In addition, forgetfulness, injection anxiety, and injection fatigue are among the most common reasons for nonadherence to therapeutic regimens.<xref rid="b2-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b6-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Autoinjector devices have been developed with a number of different features, which make self-injection easier for patients. There are currently a number of autoinjectors available to patients for administration of biologic therapies indicated for the treatment of Ps.<xref rid="b9-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Autoinjectors can increase tolerability and satisfaction with injections as well as adherence compared to manual injection methods.<xref rid="b9-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Ixekizumab, an anti-interleukin 17A monoclonal antibody, is a biologic therapy currently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque Ps that is delivered via subcutaneous injection with an autoinjector or a prefilled syringe. Phase III clinical trials have shown that ixekizumab is highly effective in treating Ps, providing rapid, long-lasting improvements in skin clearance and quality of life with an acceptable safety profile.<xref rid="b14-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, the pharmacokinetic profile of ixekizumab is equivalent when delivered by autoinjector or prefilled syringe.<xref rid="b16-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The single use autoinjector for the self-administration of ixekizumab was engineered to be simple to use and easy to operate while minimizing injection errors. The design principles applied to the ixekizumab autoinjector were informed by human factors research, as well as qualitative and quantitative surveys and interviews with patients, health care providers, and caregivers that sought to understand the ideal characteristics of a device while taking into account the varying degrees of patient capabilities and the ways in which patients interact with a device. Here we report the results of two separate studies: 1) a usability study with the autoinjector, which evaluated patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases for their ability to successfully perform an injection; and 2) a Phase III clinical study, UNCOVER-A, in which the overall experience of patients with Ps using the autoinjector to administer ixekizumab was evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>The autoinjector device</title><p>The autoinjector for ixekizumab is a single-use device containing 80 mg of ixekizumab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-mder-9-361">Figure 1</xref>). The design features of the autoinjector were informed by 13 separate qualitative and quantitative studies and three human factor studies (Eli Lilly and Company, data on file) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-mder-9-361">Figure 2</xref>), which included over 1,000 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Ps, PsA, RA, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), health care providers (rheumatologists and dermatologists), and caregivers from multiple countries (USA, Germany, Japan, France, and Italy).</p><p>Based on this qualitative and quantitative research, several design principles were identified: 1) the device should be easy to use by patients with a range of physical abilities or comorbid conditions impacting dexterity; 2) the device operation should be easy to understand; 3) patients should feel confident that they are delivering the dose successfully and using the device appropriately; and 4) the device can be safely used and disposed of. The autoinjector for ixekizumab has features consistent with these principles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-mder-9-361">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-mder-9-361">Video S1</xref>).</p><p>To perform the injection, patients or caregivers first remove the base cap, and place the clear base flat against the skin at the injection site (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-mder-9-361">Table 2</xref>). The flared base eliminates the need for pinching up the skin. Next, patients unlock the device and press the injection button. An audible click is heard indicating the start of the injection followed by a second click (&#x0003c;10 seconds from the first audible click) confirming that the injection is complete and that the needle has retracted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Usability study design</title><p>Prior to conducting the usability study, the protocol, informed consent, advertising, and other supporting documents were reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (Batelle Memorial Institute IRB, Columbus OH, USA). All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p><p>This usability study included patients with self-reported SLE, Ps, PsA, AS, or RA and caregivers with no professional health care-related training who had responsibility for administering care to other adults or juveniles (eg, relatives, friends, or neighbors). All study subjects were aged 18 years and older. Subjects were excluded if they were physically unable to perform the protocol procedures, had a known hypersensitivity or allergy to sterile placebo or were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planned to become pregnant during the course of the study (patients only). Study subjects with self-reported past medical history of bleeding disorders, human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or hepatitis B or C (per reported medical history) were also excluded from the study.</p><p>The primary objective of the usability study was to evaluate the proportions of patients who perform successful injections with or without supplemental training. Enrolled subjects were randomized into one of two study groups (trained or untrained). All subjects completed a simulated health care practitioner office visit, in which they were provided with basic prescription information about ixekizumab, including indication for use, dose, and dose frequency. Subjects assigned to the trained arm were further trained on the use of the device. The investigator guided subjects through the instructions for use and demonstrated the autoinjector by delivering an injection into an injection pad. The subject then performed a practice injection into an injection pad while the investigator observed, answered questions, and corrected for proper technique as needed.</p><p>After a decay period (&#x02265;1 day and &#x02264;1 week) each subject performed an injection (patients self-injected and caregivers injected into an injection pad). The investigator provided an autoinjector prefilled with 1.0 mL of sterile placebo and the instructions for use of the device. The investigator then instructed the subject to follow the steps in the provided instructional material to perform an injection. Each injection was recorded as a success by the investigator if the participant administered the complete dose. All failures were investigated during an interview to understand the root cause and the extent to which the design of the device, carton, or instructions for use may have contributed to the failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>UNCOVER-A study design: assessing the patient experience</title><p>The study design and primary results, including safety findings, for the UNCOVER-A trial were reported previously.<xref rid="b16-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Briefly, in this randomized, open-label, Phase III study, patients with moderate-to-severe Ps were assigned by a computer-generated random sequence to an injection device (prefilled syringe or autoinjector). Patients received 80 mg ixekizumab as one subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks, following a 160 mg initial dose at week 0 (baseline visit; administered as two 80 mg injections). At baseline, the first injection was demonstrated and performed by the investigator or staff. All remaining injections were performed by the patient or caregiver, and a study drug administration log was completed. The log documented the date, time, and location of administration; the administrator (patient or caregiver) of ixekizumab; whether ixekizumab was fully administered, and if not, what the reason(s) were from a list provided (study drug leaked from autoinjector, study drug leaked from injection site, hard to hold, autoinjector jammed during injection, study drug administration instructions were difficult to understand, or other). Site personnel completed a product complaint form for each operation failure reported on a study drug administration log.</p><p>The study received investigational review board approval for each site (Western Institutional Review Board, Puyallup, Washington, USA; University of Utah Institutional Review Board, Utah, USA), and all enrolled patients provided written informed consent.</p><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of ixekizumab delivered via autoinjector or prefilled syringe.<xref rid="b16-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> A secondary objective was to evaluate the patient/caregiver experience with the autoinjector using the subcutaneous administration assessment questionnaire (SQAAQ). The SQAAQ is a novel, 12-item, self-administered questionnaire that assesses ease of use of the device and patient confidence while using the device to administer a subcutaneous injection of drug (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-mder-9-361">Table 3</xref>). This instrument has not yet been psychometrically validated. At weeks 0, 4, and 8 of the study, patients and injection assistants assessed their experience with the autoinjector using the SQAAQ. Each item was answered on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from &#x0201c;strongly disagree&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d;. For each SQAAQ item, the number and percentage of patients who answered &#x0201c;strongly agree&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;agree&#x0201d; were summarized at weeks 0, 4, and 8 (observed case data). Here we report only results for those patients assigned to the autoinjector.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Baseline characteristics and disposition</title><p>Forty-nine patients or caregivers participated in the usability study.

One patient was a 73-year-old female with SLE who was injection-na&#x000ef;ve. This patient turned the locking ring back-and-forth several times while attempting to depress the injection button when it was in a locked position and ultimately abandoned the task. She had a number of comorbidities, including chronic pain, depression, and fibromyalgia and had 17 daily prescription medications, including some affecting cognitive function. The other injection failure occurred in a 56-year-old female with AS who was injection-experienced. This patient was unable to fully depress the injection button after unlocking the autoinjector. During the interview, she indicated that she had understood how to perform the injection, and no specific issues with the instructions for use were identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient-reported experience with the ixekizumab autoinjector: UNCOVER-A</title><p>In the UNCOVER-A study, patients or caregivers performed one injection at week 0 for the starting dose and one injection every other week for 12 weeks.

Of these 674 injections, there were two single occurrences of a failure to administer a complete dose. Both instances occurred at week 10 (sixth self-injection). In one instance, the patient, a 46-year-old man, reported drug leaking from the device, and this was due to a faulty device in which the needle did not deploy. In the other instance, the patient, a 54-year-old man, reported drug leaking from the injection site and this was likely due to the injection being too shallow into the epidermis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The use of biologic treatments over long time periods is common in the treatment of Ps, and is generally effective and safe.

There are many features that enable it to be used safely and easily with minimal errors or injection failures. The device has an ergonomic shape, grip, and dose button, which allow the device to be interacted with in different ways. There is a lock to prevent the device from misfiring. Its clear body allows the injection site and drug solution to be visualized so that there is confirmation that the full dose is delivered. In addition, audible clicks confirm the start and completion of the dose. Compared to other autoinjectors, it has a wider base, which eliminates the need to pinch up the skin.<xref rid="b17-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The results presented here demonstrate that the ixekizumab autoinjector can be used by patients or their caregivers with or without training, and the vast majority of patients and caregivers report that the autoinjector was &#x0201c;overall easy to use&#x0201d; and that they were &#x0201c;confident using the device&#x0201d;. Furthermore, failures to deliver a complete dose were uncommon.</p><p>The usability study demonstrated that the majority of patients with any of the represented autoimmune conditions or caregivers successfully performed injections with or without training. Notably, all patients and caregivers in the untrained arm performed successful injections when provided the autoinjector and the instructions for use. The two failed injections, which occurred in the trained arm, were not consistent with any pattern of issues with the device or the instructions for use. Overall, while these data indicate that patients can self-inject with or without training, for some patients, additional training or injection support may be required (eg, injection performed by caregiver).

There were two failed injections out of 674 total injections during the study (0.3%), which corresponds to one failed injection for one patient every 20 years according to ixekizumab&#x02019;s approved dosing regimen (17 injections per year). The two failed injections occurred at week 10 after each patient had already performed six successful injections. These data are consistent with usability testing in clinical trials of other autoinjectors that are currently available in Ps and RA.<xref rid="b10-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b19-mder-9-361" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The vast majority of patients with Ps or caregivers &#x0201c;agreed&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;strongly agreed&#x0201d; with each item of the SQAAQ at weeks 0, 4, and 8.
