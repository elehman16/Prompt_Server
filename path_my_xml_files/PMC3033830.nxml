These patients also have a higher risk of medication side effects, due to co-morbid medical conditions and age-associated changes in organ function. Moreover, a higher risk for drug-drug interactions may cause them to terminate treatment prematurely.</p><p>Second generation antidepressants [selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)] are recommended as first-line treatments in clinical practice guidelines and are most commonly prescribed for depressive disorders in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Nevertheless, until 2003, only one large placebo-controlled trial of a non-tricyclic antidepressant, marketed in the US, in outpatients 60 years of age or older with major depressive disorder had been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The first trials of second-generation antidepressants, including a large study of patients aged 75 years and above treated with citalopram, reported no advantage over placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] or small drug-placebo differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], hence the clinical value of these agents in treating older depressed adults was uncertain.</p><p>A later meta-analysis of 10 randomised placebo-controlled trials in depressed patients aged 60 years and older concluded that antidepressants are more effective than placebo, although effects were modest and variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A major limitation was that the average age of patients in these trials ranged from 60 to 72 years, with only a small number over 75. Late-life spans a broad age range and can be divided into <italic>young-old </italic>(60-74 years), and <italic>old-old </italic>(&#x02265;75 years). Among the <italic>old-old</italic>, antidepressant treatment may be especially complicated because of the high frequency and severity of co-morbid conditions, such as cognitive impairment or heart disease.</p><p>In addition to being well tolerated as an antidepressant in older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], escitalopram is effective in preventing relapse of MDD in patients &#x02265;65 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The latter study, as well as open-label data, suggests that escitalopram is safe and well tolerated in the long-term treatment of older patients with MDD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In order to compare the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in the <italic>old-old </italic>with the <italic>young-old</italic>, we undertook a secondary analysis of a published clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The primary aim was to compare the effect of escitalopram in preventing relapse of MDD among <italic>young-old </italic>and <italic>old-old </italic>patients. A secondary objective was to compare the initial response to open-label escitalopram in these two age groups. We hypothesized that <italic>old-old </italic>and <italic>young-old </italic>patients on escitalopram would have comparable benefits with regard to prevention of relapse and initial remission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The original study was conducted in 46 centers in 7 European countries from October 2003 to May 2005, in accordance with the principles of <italic>Good Clinical Practice </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the <italic>Declaration of Helsinki </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] applicable at the time of the study. The study was approved by the relevant local ethics committees and all patients gave written informed consent for participation. The methods and main results of the principal study have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><sec><title>Design Overview</title><p>This relapse prevention study started with a 12-week open-label treatment period that was followed by a 24-week, randomised, double blind treatment period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). During the initial open-label period, outpatients aged at least 65 years received escitalopram 10mg/day during the first week; the dose could be increased to 20mg/day at Week 2, based on the clinical judgement of the investigator. Subsequently the dose remained constant for the remaining open label period. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, patients who achieved remission, defined by a Montgomery &#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] (MADRS) score &#x02264;12, were eligible for randomisation to either continue escitalopram at their last fixed dose of 10 or 20mg/day, or to switch to placebo in a 1:1 ratio. Patients randomised to placebo who were on 20 mg/day escitalopram during the open period received 10 mg/day escitalopram for the first week (Week 13) before receiving placebo for the remainder of the study. Non-remitters left the study and were treated at the physician's discretion.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2318-11-2-1"/></fig><p>During the 24-week double-blind period (until taper at Week 36), study investigators regularly evaluated relapse symptoms. Relapse was defined either as a MADRS total score &#x02265;22 at a single visit, or an unsatisfactory treatment effect (lack of efficacy), as judged by the local investigator. In order to capture all patients who could be considered to have relapsed, this definition was extended in a sensitivity analysis to include patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for MDE or who attempted suicide. Patients who relapsed were withdrawn from the study and were contacted for a safety follow-up assessment 4 weeks later.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Psychiatrists recruited patients in private practice or hospital outpatient clinics. Those eligible for study were outpatients with a primary diagnosis of MDD (assessed by psychiatrists using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], moderate or severe, according to DSM-IV-TR criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and who gave informed consent. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in detail by Gorwood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Patients were required to have a MADRS score &#x02265;22 and an MMSE score &#x02265;24 at entry. Patients with severe or unstable medical co-morbid diseases were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Medication treatment</title><p>Study medications were tablets for oral administration of identical appearance, taste and smell. The oxalate salt of escitalopram, or a placebo, was used in the tablets. After the open-label period, eligible patients were assigned to escitalopram or placebo according to a computer-generated randomisation list drawn up by H. Lundbeck A/S. Details of the randomisation were unknown to any of the investigators and were contained in a set of sealed opaque envelopes. At each study center, sequentially enrolled patients were assigned the lowest randomisation number available in blocks of four. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>After baseline assessment of efficacy measures, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 weeks of open-label treatment. For patients randomised to double-blind treatment, efficacy and tolerability parameters were assessed 1, 2, and 4 weeks after randomisation, and then every 4 weeks until the last dose of double-blind treatment (Week 24 of double blind, also Week 36 of the full study).</p><p>Efficacy assessments at baseline and each follow-up visit included the MADRS, Clinical Global Impression - Severity of illness (CGI-S) and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement of illness (CGI-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The primary analysis of efficacy was the time to relapse from the start date of double-blind treatment. Prior to the study, all investigators attended a joined MADRS and CGI rating session chaired by an experienced research psychiatrist.</p><p>The tolerability and safety evaluations were based on spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, body weight, and physical examination.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>To provide more clinically useful information in the age contrast during the open label period, patient response was pre-defined as at least 50% improvement from baseline in the MADRS total score, as was remission (MADRS &#x02264;12). Complete remission (MADRS &#x02264;5) was defined <italic>post hoc</italic>. All efficacy analyses in the double-blind period were conducted on the modified intent-to-treat (ITT) dataset, consisting of all randomised patients who took at least one dose of trial medication in the double-blind treatment period, using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach to impute missing data. Comparisons between age groups during the open-label period were performed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with age group and country as factors, and with the score at randomisation as a covariate.</p><p>The pre-defined primary efficacy analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] used a two-tailed log-rank test to compare the time to relapse for patients treated with escitalopram <italic>versus </italic>placebo, using SAS version 9.1 as statistical software. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival curves were produced and Cox proportional hazards models were estimated to assess the effect of several variables on time to relapse. A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test was used to compare the crude proportions of relapsed patients. In the current study, the focus was on the effect of age - comparing the <italic>old-old </italic>(patients aged &#x02265;75 years) <italic>versus </italic>the <italic>young-old </italic>(65 to 74 years), using a Cox model and logistic regression, with treatment and age group as covariates. The appropriateness and robustness was studied by investigating the possible effect of country and of country-by-treatment interaction. The results from analyses with center as a covariate were in line with that of the primary analysis and revealed no "outliers" among countries or centers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>Of the 405 patients who received open-label escitalopram, 254 were aged 65-74 years <italic>(young-old) </italic>and 151 were &#x02265;75 years of age <italic>(old-old</italic>).

However, most depressed patients aged at least 75 years live in the community. They tend to have less cognitive impairment than nursing home residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Open-label treatment with escitalopram was comparably effective in reducing depression in <italic>young-old </italic>as in <italic>old-old </italic>patients, consistent with the results of the meta-analysis of Gildengers et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Notably, a significantly higher percentage of <italic>young-old </italic>patients achieved complete remission, likely related to the slightly higher level of symptoms at entry in the <italic>old-old </italic>patients, particularly for MADRS items 3 to 8. The response rates (77% and 83%) in both age groups were greater than those reported in 2 placebo-controlled trials of escitalopram in elderly patients (46% response) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], in which escitalopram failed to separate from placebo. Sneed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] also found higher response rates in patients in comparator trials (60% response) compared with placebo-controlled trials (46% response). Hence, in the absence of a placebo control, these rates of remission should not be construed as being entirely related to escitalopram treatment. In addition to the clinician-rated MADRS, the geriatric depression scale was also used in the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This patient self-rating scale was only assessed at baseline, at randomisation and at last assessment. It is a validated scale for the assessment of the health status of older people, but does not directly assess symptoms of depression.</p><p>The pattern of AEs was similar in both age groups, and to that previously seen with escitalopram in younger adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Based on the incidence of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events, <italic>old-old </italic>patients tolerated treatment with escitalopram equally well as <italic>young-old </italic>patients. During the 24-week relapse prevention period, escitalopram was significantly more efficacious than placebo.</p><p>This study's main strength is that, as a result of the high remission rates during the open-label escitalopram phase, there were relatively large numbers of patients in both the <italic>young-old </italic>and <italic>old-old </italic>groups at the point of randomisation, giving the study satisfactory statistical power to detect differences in relapse rate and pattern between them. The analysis by age group was, however, retrospective, and its inclusion and exclusion criteria to some extent limit the generalizability of its findings to the depressed <italic>old-old </italic>population. A further limitation of the study is that we did not investigate in detail the effect of medical co-morbidities on outcomes. As Reynolds et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] note, the number and severity of co-morbid medical illnesses moderate depression recurrence in older old depressed patient. Since medical co-morbidities were comparable across the randomization groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), it is unlikely that medical co-morbidity influenced any treatment benefit from escitalopram.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Co-morbid medical conditions at baseline with a prevalence &#x02265;5% in either age group</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Diagnosis*</th><th align="center">Patients aged 65-74 years<break/>(n = 254)</th><th align="center">Patients aged &#x02265;75 years<break/>(n = 151)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Hypertension</td><td align="center">129 (50.8%)</td><td align="center">86 (57.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Myocardial ischemia</td><td align="center">31 (12.2%)</td><td align="center">34 (22.5%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Localised osteoarthritis</td><td align="center">19 ( 7.5%)</td><td align="center">16 (10.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Osteoarthritis</td><td align="center">10 ( 3.9%)</td><td align="center">16 (10.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hypercholesterolaemia</td><td align="center">26 (10.2%)</td><td align="center">15 ( 9.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Insomnia</td><td align="center">23 ( 9.1%)</td><td align="center">15 ( 9.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Osteoporosis</td><td align="center">23 ( 9.1%)</td><td align="center">15 ( 9.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diabetes mellitus</td><td align="center">12 ( 4.7%)</td><td align="center">12 ( 7.9%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diabetes mellitus non-insulin-dependent</td><td align="center">20 ( 7.9%)</td><td align="center">11 ( 7.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Varicose vein</td><td align="center">13 ( 5.1%)</td><td align="center">10 ( 6.6%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Coronary artery disease</td><td align="center">10 ( 3.9%)</td><td align="center">9 ( 6.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gastritis</td><td align="center">7 ( 2.8%)</td><td align="center">9 ( 6.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cardiac failure</td><td align="center">2 ( 0.8%)</td><td align="center">9 ( 6.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cataract</td><td align="center">3 ( 1.2%)</td><td align="center">8 ( 5.3%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Back pain</td><td align="center">17 ( 6.7%)</td><td align="center">6 ( 4.0%)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Hypothyroidism</td><td align="center">16 ( 6.3%)</td><td align="center">5 ( 3.3%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* These conditions were judged as stable by study physicians, as required by the study inclusion criteria</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The study has clear and relevant implications for clinical practice. The slightly higher percentage <italic>of young-old </italic>patients achieving complete remission during the open-label phase probably reflects the somewhat higher burden of symptoms that <italic>old-old </italic>patients have at the start of acute treatment. The comparable (and very low) incidence of adverse events and of adverse event-related withdrawals in <italic>old-old </italic>and <italic>young-old </italic>patients in both phases of the study suggests that escitalopram is well-tolerated by <italic>old-old </italic>depressed patients. Although slightly fewer <italic>young-old </italic>patients on escitalopram relapsed (6.9% vs 12% in the <italic>old-old </italic>group), the hazard ratio was only slightly larger (1.2). It is therefore clear that escitalopram is highly effective (compared with placebo) in preventing depressive relapse in <italic>old-old </italic>patients who remit during acute escitalopram treatment, as shown by the hazard ratio in this sub-group.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>CK has received honoraria from, and have conducted clinical research supported by H.
