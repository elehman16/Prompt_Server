Because glaucoma is a chronic disease, the long-term safety of prostaglandin analogs is of paramount importance. However, many prostaglandin analogs contain preservatives that may be toxic to the eye.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-opth-4-1355">1</xref> The most common preservative in IOP-lowering medications is benzalkonium chloride (BAK), a quaternary ammonium compound that causes bacterial cell death by lysing cytoplasmic membranes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-4-1355">2</xref> BAK has demonstrated toxicity against both corneal and conjunctival cells when administered in the range of concentrations present in ophthalmic medications (0.004&#x02013;0.02%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-opth-4-1355">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-opth-4-1355">5</xref> Moreover, in vitro, animal, and clinical studies have demonstrated that BAK-containing medications are associated with greater toxicity, increased ocular surface damage, and decreased tolerability compared with BAK-free preparations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-opth-4-1355">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-4-1355">10</xref> Latanoprost 0.005% (Xalatan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) contains 0.02% BAK, one of the highest BAK concentrations found in ophthalmic preparations.

We were interested to determine whether these favorable outcomes noted with travoprost BAK-free would be duplicated in Japanese patients, a population that is generally underrepresented in clinical studies but is prevalent on the island of Hawaii. Therefore, the goal of the current study was to examine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of travoprost 0.004% BAK-free compared with previous use of latanoprost 0.005% in Japanese patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension living in the US.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a prospective, open-label, multicenter, intraindividual, and active-controlled study. The objective of the study was to examine the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of travoprost BAK-free in Japanese patients on prior latanoprost monotherapy. The protocol was approved by all relevant institutional review boards and the study was performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice. All participating patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients were at least 21 years old with a clinical diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension in at least one eye (and a documented history of untreated IOP &#x0003e; 21 mmHg) and were of Japanese origin. Japanese origin was defined as descended from both maternal and paternal Japanese grandparents and Japanese parents (one parent could be half-Japanese), and part of the third generation or younger to live in the US. They also needed to have been treated with latanoprost monotherapy for at least one week prior to enrollment and had to have an IOP &#x02265;16 mmHg in at least one eye and &#x02264;30 mmHg in both eyes at the baseline visit. They were required to have a best corrected Snellen visual acuity (BCVA) of at least 20/200 in both eyes, and the investigator had to consider the patient a good candidate for travoprost BAK-free due to a need for improved tolerability or reduced IOP over that observed with latanoprost therapy.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: presence or untreated history of narrow angles with or without complete or partial closure in either eye; any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry in a study eye; any known opacity or patient uncooperativeness that restricted adequate examination of the ocular fundus or anterior chamber of either eye; concurrent infectious/noninfectious conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, blepharitis, or uveitis in either eye; conventional intraocular surgery within three months prior to screening or laser surgery within two months prior to screening in either eye; history of ocular trauma within six months prior to screening; risk of visual field or visual acuity worsening as a consequence of trial participation, in the investigator&#x02019;s opinion; progressive retinal or optic nerve disease from any cause other than glaucoma; women who were pregnant, lactating, or of childbearing potential and not using a reliable means of birth control; any clinically significant, serious, or severe medical or psychiatric condition or severe dementia; any condition which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, would interfere with optimal participation in the study or present a special risk to the patient; participation in any other investigational study within 30 days prior to visit 1; known history of allergy, sensitivity or poor tolerance to any components of the study medications; use of systemic medications known to affect IOP, which have not been on a stable course for seven days prior to visit 2 or an anticipated change in the dosage during the course of the study; unwillingness to risk the possibility of darkened irides, eyelash changes, or periocular pigmentation; history or risk of uveitis or cystoid macular edema; history of ocular herpes simplex; anticipated use of ocular, dermal, or oral corticosteroids for more than two weeks in total during the trial or current chronic use of ocular, dermal, or oral corticosteroids; and use of contact lenses in the study eye(s).

The patients were then changed from BAK-preserved latanoprost monotherapy to travoprost ophthalmic solution 0.004% BAK-free administered once daily at 8 pm for 12 weeks. Patients returned to the clinic at week 4 for a safety assessment (BCVA, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and IOP at 4 pm) and at week 12 to undergo final study visit evaluations (same as for baseline visit) and to answer a study medication preference question. Adverse events were collected, monitored, and evaluated throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The primary efficacy variable was the change in IOP from latanoprost monotherapy at the baseline visit to travoprost BAK-free monotherapy at the week 12 visit and was analyzed by a two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test.

As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-4-1355">Table 1</xref>, patients had a mean age of 73.1 &#x000b1; 9.8 years and nearly all (95%) had a diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma. Nineteen patients received latanoprost for one month or less before transitioning to travoprost BAK-free and the one remaining patient received latanoprost for approximately six weeks. No significant difference in mean IOP was observed between latanoprost monotherapy at baseline and travoprost BAKfree monotherapy after 12 weeks (17.0 &#x000b1; 1.5 mmHg versus 17.1 &#x000b1; 1.6 mmHg, <italic>P</italic> = 0.76, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-4-1355">Table 2</xref>) nor were significant differences noted in mean ocular hyperemia (0.7 &#x000b1; 0.8 versus 0.3 &#x000b1; 0.4, <italic>P</italic> = 0.064).

A potential explanation for this significant improvement may be provided by the fact that BAK-containing latanoprost has been reported to produce a loss in conjunctival goblet cells, which has not been observed with travoprost BAK-free.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-opth-4-1355">9</xref> Because goblet cells facilitate ocular surface wettability and tear film stability through the secretion of mucin,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-4-1355">17</xref> a loss of these cells would be expected to destabilize the tear film, leading to decreased tear breakup time. The Horsley study, which compared latanoprost with travoprost BAK-free and had a study design similar to the current study, also reported a significant increase in tear breakup time after transition to travoprost BAK-free (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-4-1355">10</xref> supporting the results of our study.</p><p>Patients in the current study were found to have no significant changes in IOP 12 weeks after transitioning from latanoprost monotherapy to travoprost BAK-free monotherapy, suggesting that the removal of BAK does not affect IOP control. With respect to safety, patients had no significant changes in visual acuity, corneal staining, or slit-lamp biomicroscopy. An examination of ocular hyperemia demonstrated a trend toward less hyperemia with travoprost BAK-free, but missed statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.064) due to the small number of patients. This is noteworthy, because studies of latanoprost and BAK-containing travoprost have demonstrated a modest increase in the incidence and severity of hyperemia with travoprost relative to latanoprost.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-4-1355">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-opth-4-1355">20</xref> Results from this study suggest that travoprost BAK-free may not have an ocular hyperemia disadvantage, although the relatively small sample size of this study (n = 40 eyes) may make a modest difference difficult to detect. However, the Horsley study comparing latanoprost and travoprost BAK-free did demonstrate a significant improvement in corneal staining after transition to travoprost BAK-free (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-opth-4-1355">10</xref> While no definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the discrepancy between our results and those of Horsley and Kahook, the fact that patients in the Horsley study had been on latanoprost therapy for at least a year may have contributed to the different results. In the current study, most patients received latanoprost for less than a month, and because corneal damage from BAK is cumulative, corneal staining would most likely not be affected after only a few weeks of BAK exposure. Additionally, our study design did not select for patients with ocular surface disease. The patients entered the study with normal OSDI scores and ocular staining and, as expected, no changes were observed after 12 weeks of dosing with the travoprost BAK-free formulation.</p><p>The brief duration of latanoprost therapy (&#x02264;six weeks) prior to transitioning to travoprost BAK-free is a limitation of this study because it may not have allowed enough time to observe differences in IOP and/or adverse effects between treatments. A similar study with a longer requirement for latanoprost use prior to transition might produce differences in other parameters that were not evident in the current study. However, the fact that the Japanese patients in this study had a strong preference for travoprost BAK-free after such a short time taking latanoprost suggests strongly that patients perceived travoprost BAK-free to be more tolerable than latanoprost.</p><p>In conclusion, this study, albeit in a limited number of patients, demonstrates that patients of Japanese origin with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension can be changed from latanoprost 0.005% monotherapy to travoprost 0.004% BAK-free monotherapy, with similar IOP control and similar or improved safety and tolerability. Based on these results, it is appropriate to expect that patients would view such a transition favorably.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Jennifer Klem, PhD provided
