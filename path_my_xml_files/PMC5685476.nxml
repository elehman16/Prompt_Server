It has been shown to be safe and well tolerated after short-term administration in humans; however, its clinical and functional activity after longer-term administration has not been previously assessed.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods and findings</title><p>HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 104 was designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses of VRC01 administered either subcutaneously or by intravenous (IV) infusion and to assess the pharmacokinetics and in vitro immunologic activity of the different dosing regimens. Additionally, this study aimed to assess the effect that the human body has on the functional activities of VRC01 as measured by several in vitro assays. Eighty-eight healthy, HIV-uninfected, low-risk participants were enrolled in 6 United States clinical research sites affiliated with the HVTN between September 9, 2014, and July 15, 2015. The median age of enrollees was 27 years (range, 18&#x02013;50); 52% were White (non-Hispanic), 25% identified as Black (non-Hispanic), 11% were Hispanic, and 11% were non-Hispanic people of diverse origins. Participants were randomized to receive the following: a 40 mg/kg IV VRC01 loading dose followed by five 20 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 4 weeks (treatment group 1 [T1], <italic>n</italic> = 20); eleven 5 mg/kg subcutaneous (SC) VRC01 (treatment group 3 [T3], <italic>n</italic> = 20); placebo (placebo group 3 [P3], <italic>n</italic> = 4) doses every 2 weeks; or three 40 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 8 weeks (treatment group 2 [T2], <italic>n</italic> = 20). Treatment groups T4 and T5 (<italic>n</italic> = 12 each) received three 10 or 30 mg/kg IV VRC01 doses every 8 weeks, respectively. Participants were followed for 32 weeks after their first VRC01 administration and received a total of 249 IV infusions and 208 SC injections, with no serious adverse events, dose-limiting toxicities, nor evidence for anti-VRC01 antibodies observed. Serum VRC01 levels were detected through 12 weeks after final administration in all participants who received all scheduled doses. Mean peak serum VRC01 levels of 1,177 &#x003bc;g/ml (95% CI: 1,033, 1,340) and 420 &#x003bc;g/ml (95% CI: 356, 494) were achieved 1 hour after the IV infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively. Mean trough levels at week 24 in the IV infusion series of 30 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses, respectively, were 16 &#x003bc;g/ml (95% CI: 10, 27) and 6 &#x003bc;g/ml (95% CI: 5, 9) levels, which neutralize a majority of circulating strains in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] &#x0003e; 5 &#x003bc;g/ml). Post-infusion/injection serum VRC01 retained expected functional activity (virus neutralization, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and virion capture). The limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size of each VRC01 administration regimen and missing data from participants who were unable to complete all study visits.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VRC01 administered as either an IV infusion (10&#x02013;40 mg/kg) given monthly or bimonthly, or as an SC injection (5 mg/kg) every 2 weeks, was found to be safe and well tolerated.

The study was approved by the local institutional review boards at all participating sites: Brigham, Partners Human Research Committee; Fenway, Fenway Health IRB; Cleveland, University Hospitals, Cleveland Medical Center IRB; New York Blood Center, New York Blood Center IRB; College of Physicians &#x00026; Surgeons, Columbia University IRB; Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania IRB (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02165267).</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Interventions</title><p>VRC01 (VRC-HIVMAB060-00-AB) was formulated at a concentration of 100 (&#x000b1;10) mg/ml suspended in formulation buffer (25 mM sodium citrate, 50 mM sodium chloride, and 150 mM L-arginine hydrochloride at pH 5.8). The placebo for SC administration was VRC-PLAMAB068-00-AB, a sterile buffered aqueous solution of 25 mM sodium citrate, 50 mM sodium chloride, 150 mM L-arginine hydrochloride, 10% dextran 40 (w/w), and 0.005% polysorbate 80 (w/w) at pH 5.8. The purified product vials and the placebo vials were filled and labeled at the VRC Vaccine Pilot Plant operated by Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. (Frederick, MD). The placebo was matched for color and viscosity to mimic the interventional product to avoid unintentional unblinding. The placebo for IV infusions was sodium chloride for injection 0.9%, USP, obtained locally by the sites. IV infusions were administered via an IV pump over 60 minutes for the first administration, then over at least 30 minutes for subsequent infusions. For each SC administration, up to 4 injections of 2 mL of the study product could be administered, with abdominal sites being used most frequently.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The prespecified primary clinical objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VRC01 administered intravenously and subcutaneously at multiple time points. Primary endpoints were local and systemic reactogenicity signs and symptoms, laboratory measures of safety, adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs), early discontinuation of infusions and reason(s) for discontinuation, and early study termination. The primary laboratory objective was to evaluate the serum levels of VRC01 at week 24, following IV and SC administration in 3 different regimens, with the primary end points being serum concentrations of VRC01 in each group at week 24. Secondary objectives included the determination of serum levels of VRC01 over time and whether anti-idiotypic antibodies could be detected. Exploratory objectives included the evaluation of in vitro functional humoral activities of VRC01 in serum and mucosal compartments. Specimens from participants were also tested for neutralizing activity against a panel of circulating and laboratory strains of HIV. Assessment of the binding of VRC01 to multiple Env proteins as well as the determination of VRC01 concentrations and functional activity in genital, rectal, and oral secretions are still underway and will be reported in a future manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size of the study was determined to provide reasonable precision in the estimation of safety event rates and the mean trough drug concentration after the administration series for each active treatment arm. Specifically, for an active arm of <italic>n</italic> = 12, there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 safety event if the true rate of such an event is 17.5% or more, and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.88% or less. For each active arm of <italic>n</italic> = 20, there is a 90% chance of observing at least 1 event if the true rate of such an event is 10.9% or more, and there is a 90% chance of observing no events if the true rate is 0.52% or less. In addition, the chosen sample sizes provide reasonable precision for the estimation of serum concentrations, assuming a normal distribution for the log-transformed trough levels. Further discussion of the statistical considerations involved in the selection of sample sizes is provided in the full protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002435.s002">S1 Protocol</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization sequence was obtained by computer-generated random numbers and provided to each HVTN clinical research site through the Statistical Data Monitoring Center (SDMC) of the HVTN via a web-based randomization system. The randomization was conducted in blocks to ensure balance between T1 and T2, between T4 and T5, and within T3/P3 treatment groups. At each institution, the pharmacist with primary responsibility for dispensing study products was charged with maintaining security of the treatment assignments.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Blinding</title><p>Participants and site staff were unblinded as to participant treatment assignments among treatment groups T1, T2, T4, and T5, but blinded, except for site pharmacists, as to treatment assignment (active versus placebo) for treatment/placebo group T3/P3. Study product assignments were accessible to study pharmacists, contract monitors, and SDMC staff, who are required to know this information in order to ensure proper trial conduct.</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>Participants were monitored for type 1 hypersensitivity reactions, cytokine release syndrome (CRS), and serum sickness during and post infusion. Reactogenicity assessments were performed at baseline (prior to each study product administration) and following each IV infusion/SC injection at the early assessment time point (within 25&#x02013;120 minutes) and daily for the subsequent 3 days. Participants were instructed to record symptoms using a postproduct symptom log and to contact the site daily during the assessment period. Local injection site reactions of pain, tenderness, erythema, and induration and systemic symptoms of malaise and/or fatigue, myalgia, headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, arthralgia, and body temperature were assessed. Following the first study infusion, safety monitoring included the performance of abbreviated physical exams and the assessment of AEs and concomitant medications at each study visit. Clinical laboratory testing included the collection of complete blood count and chemistry panel at 2 weeks (in all groups), then monthly until month 6 (in treatment and placebo groups T1 and T3/P3) and at month 2, 3, 4, and 6 (treatment groups T2, T4, and T5) and urine dipstick/urinalyses at 2 weeks and 3 and 6 months in all groups. Pregnancy testing was performed in female participants and results confirmed as negative prior to each study product administration. AEs were reported for the duration of the study. Safety reports were monitored daily by the HVTN Core for events meeting safety pause criteria and prompt Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) AE review rules. Weekly safety data reviews by the PSRT led to teleconferences when indicated, and the independent HVTN Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) reviewed unblinded safety data thrice yearly. Research sites reported clinical safety data to the Statistical Center for HIV/AIDS Research &#x00026; Prevention (SCHARP) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The number and percentage of participants experiencing each type of reactogenicity sign or symptom was tabulated by maximum severity and treatment arm and the percentages were displayed graphically by arm. Severity of reactogenicity and AEs was graded using the DAIDS US NIH Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events, Version 1.0, December, 2004; clarification August, 2009 [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Pharmacokinetic analysis</title><p>VRC01 concentration in participants&#x02019; sera was quantified using the murine anti-VRC01 mAb 5C9 as previously described [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, 5C9 was coated onto Immulon-4HXB microtiter plates overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Plates were washed and then blocked with 10% fetal bovine serum in phosphate-buffered saline. Duplicate serial 3-fold dilutions covering the range of 1:100&#x02013;1:24,300 of the test sample were added and incubated for 2 hours at 37&#x000b0;C, followed by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman antibody and TMB substrate. Color development was stopped by the addition of sulfuric acid, and plates were read within 30 minutes at 450 nm via the Molecular Devices Paradigm plate reader. Four-parameter logistic curve regression of a standard curve of VRC01 covering the range from 0.98 to 1,000 ng/ml was utilized to quantitate sample concentrations based upon the average of sample dilutions within the range of the assay. Concentration values below the limit of quantification (1.10 &#x003bc;g/ml) were replaced by 0.55 &#x003bc;g/ml in all calculations.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Neutralization assay</title><p>Neutralizing activity was measured against HIV Env-pseudotyped viruses as a function of reductions in Tat-regulated luciferase (Luc) reporter gene expression in TZM-bl cells as described [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Assays for measurements of serum VRC01 concentration were performed with 3 Env-pseudotyped viruses that exhibit either a highly sensitive tier 1A phenotype (clade B: MN.3, clade C: MW965.26) or a moderately sensitive tier 2 phenotype that is typical of most circulating strains (clade B: PVO.4). As these 3 strains are highly sensitive to neutralization by VRC01, they were selected for optimal sensitivity for the assays quantifying levels of the antibody. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) and 80% inhibitory concentration (IC80) of the clinical lot of VRC01 were determined against each virus. The stock concentration of VRC01 used in this analysis (0.34 mg/ml) was determined by the same ELISA used for pharmacokinetic (PK) measurements. The concentration of VRC01 in serum samples was calculated by multiplying the 50% infectious dose (ID50) (or 80% infectious dose [ID80]) neutralization titer (as a dilution factor) of the serum sample against each isolate by the IC50 (or IC80) of the clinical lot VRC01 (in &#x003bc;g/ml) against the corresponding isolate, in which the IC50 and IC80 of the clinical lot of VRC01 was the geometric mean value obtained in repeated assays. Additional assays were performed with a global panel of 11 tier 2 Env-pseudotyped reference strains [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] to assess the magnitude and breadth of serum neutralizing activity in greater detail. These latter results were expressed as the serum dilution that resulted in either a 50% or 80% reduction in infectivity (ID50 and ID80 neutralization titers). Assays with this global panel of tier 2 viruses were performed for 6 participants from treatment group T5 (selected based upon sample availability for all time points) at 4 weeks following each infusion and at 1 hour and 8 weeks following the last infusion.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>ADCC assay</title><p>ADCC activity against CEM.NKRCCR5 cells infected with the subtype C HIV-1-infected CH505 transmitted/founder infectious molecular clone (IMC) (provided by Dr. Ochsenbauer, University of Alabama&#x02013;Birmingham) was measured in 96-well plates as a function of reductions in Renilla Luc reporter gene expression as previously described [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. One positive control in duplicate and 1 standardized negative control in duplicate were used per plate. The readout was reduction in Relative Luminescence Units (RLU), referred to as percentage specific killing. For each sample, percent specific killing was measured in 2 wells at a dilution of 1:25. The CD4bs bnAbs 3BNC117 and CH31 (both generated by Duke Human Vaccine Institute, Protein Production Facility, Dr. Haynes) and the clinical product VRC01-13-123 were also tested starting at the concentration of 50 &#x003bc;g/ml. The anti-RSV Synagis mAb (MedImmune, LLC, Gaithersburg, MD) was utilized as a negative control. The analyses of plasma ADCC responses examined peak percent specific killing (%SK), defined as the maximum %SK across the 6 dilution levels (&#x0201c;peak %SK&#x0201d;) and averaged over the 2 replicates.

After incubation, 50,000 (THP-1) or 500,000 (monocyte) cells were added to each well and spinoculated. Cells were fixed and phagocytosis was analyzed by flow cytometry from at least 2,000 cell events per sample. A phagocytic score was determined by the ratio of samples (percent bead positive multiplied by the MFI bead positive values for samples) to the no-bead antibody controls. Samples were considered positive if the average phagocytic score was(1) greater than the 95th percentile of the score for all baseline visits tested (visit 2) and (2) the follow-up visit response value was &#x02265;3 times the baseline visit response value.

Specifically, serial dilutions of serum samples were incubated with optimized concentrations of biotinylated VRC01 and SULFO-TAG labeled VRC01 at 37&#x000b0;C for 2 hours. Samples were transferred to a previously blocked Streptavidin-coated MSD plate and incubated for 3 hours at room temperature on a plate shaker. Plates were washed on an automated plate washer, read-buffer was added, and samples were read with the MSD-2400 plate reader. Mean signals from replicate wells were evaluated and the endpoint dilution was defined as the greatest sample dilution with a response above the positivity threshold for the assay. The positivity threshold is the lower limit of the linear range for VRC01 in the assay. Serial dilutions of the VRC01-specific monoclonal antibody 5C9 were utilized to establish the linear range of 5C9 (0.01221 to 3.5 &#x003bc;g/mL).

The per-protocol (PP) cohort included participants who received all assigned treatments within the expected visit windows. Safety evaluation was done in the MITT cohort. The number and percentage of participants experiencing each AE or reactogenicity symptom and sign were analyzed by severity and treatment group. VRC01 levels were evaluated in both the MITT and PP cohorts. Geometric means and associated 95% confidence intervals of VRC01 levels were based on a t distribution. Functional activities and their correlations with VRC01 levels were evaluated in the PP cohort.</p><p>Individual-level non-compartmental pharmacokinetics analysis was performed based on the ELISA-based serum concentration-time data in the PP cohort. Specifically, VRC01 accumulation was computed based on the ratio of trough drug level measurements and the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) within the infusion interval for each participant, after the third and second infusions, as compared to the first in groups T4 and T5. The estimates were crude due to the relatively sparse time points. The trough levels were either observed or predicted as the estimated mean concentration at 8 weeks post infusion based on the fitted individual-level log-linear line through the observed concentrations at day 28 and day 56 after the first infusion, at day 84 and day 112 after the second infusion, and at day 140 and day 168 after the third and last infusion. AUC was calculated using the linear trapezoidal method. The expected visit dates were used in these calculations. Lastly, the terminal elimination rate and half-life were calculated based on the log-linear portion (28 to 84 days after the last infusion) of the time-concentration curve for each participant in groups T4 and T5. The terminal rate (slope) was determined by fitting a linear regression line to the log-transformed concentrations over time. The half-life was estimated as ln2 (= 0.693) divided by the terminal slope.

Fifty-five percent (95% CI: 44%, 65%) of VRC01 and 50% (95% CI: 15%, 85%) of placebo recipients experienced mild pain and/or tenderness at the infusion or injection site sometime during the trial, 1 person (in T3) experienced moderate tenderness following one of the SC injections, and no participants reported severe pain and/or tenderness. Very few of the erythema/induration reactions that occurred met the NIH&#x02019;s DAIDS criteria for mild reactions (&#x0003e;25&#x02013;81 cm<sup>2</sup>); these included 2 participants following receipt of IV VRC01 (1 in T3 and 1 in T5) and 1 participant following IV placebo administration (P3).

The symptoms were all graded as mild in the placebo recipients, while, of those VRC01 recipients who experienced any systemic symptoms, the maximum severity was mild in 70%, moderate in 23%, and severe in 6% (3 participants). In the 3 participants with severe reactogenicity symptoms, 2 had concurrent viral infections, while 1 reported severe malaise lasting 1 day, with no sequelae.

There were 9 AEs (3.8% of all AEs, 95% CI: 2%, 7%) occurring in 8 participants that were deemed product related by the investigators; all were mild and transient, and those occurring following VRC01 administration included elevations of hepatic transaminases (aspartate transaminase [AST] and alanine transaminase [ALT] elevation in 1 participant), elevated creatinine, neutropenia, localized injection site pruritus, diarrhea, generalized rash, and varicella zoster virus reactivation. An AE of chest tightness deemed related to study product occurred in a placebo recipient. No VRC01-related hypersensitivity reactions or CRS symptoms were observed during the study.</p><p>Study product was discontinued in 8 participants, including 2 participants who relocated from study sites, 1 participant who became pregnant, 1 who did not adhere to study visits, and 1 who was unable to be contacted. One participant developed a mild, generalized, pruritic, maculopapular rash 3 days after receiving the first SC injection of VRC01, which resolved less than 4 hours after applying inert lotion and was deemed related to the study product. Another participant had a brief syncopal episode several hours after receiving a VRC01 infusion, deemed not related to the study product. A third participant had mild, brief chest tightness following the first SC injection that resolved spontaneously; this was deemed related to the study product; however, this participant was determined after unblinding to be a placebo recipient.</p><p>Regarding adherence, 35 out of 44 (80%) participants in groups T2, T4, and T5 received all expected 8-weekly infusions, with 90% complete adherence in T2, 75% in T4, and 83% in T5.

Twenty-nine participants (33%) missed at least 1 infusion or injection during the study. The most commonly cited reasons for missed visits were travel, relocation, or loss to follow-up. The study product was not administered for 11 study visits, affecting 9 participants in the first 3 groups, due to the observation of frozen study product at the end of a thawing period of less than 1 hour, leading to revision of pharmacy instructions to request a thawing period of greater than 1 hour, without further abnormalities observed. The 59 participants (57 VRC01 recipients and 2 placebo recipients) who received all study product administrations comprise the PP cohort and, unless otherwise stated, were the focus of PK and immunological assessments.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002435.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002435.t002">Table 2</xref> depict the group-level geometric mean serum VRC01 concentrations measured by ELISA and neutralization assays for participants in the PP cohort.

These results are consistent with previously reported half-life and drug accumulation estimates for VRC01 [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and are independent of dose levels [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>In T3, the average serum VRC01 level 3 days after IV infusion of 40 mg/kg was 416 &#x003bc;g/ml.

Similarly, average trough levels measured 14 days after each subsequent 2-weekly SC injection decreased steadily from 85 &#x003bc;g/ml after the first injection to 34 &#x003bc;g/ml after the final injection. VRC01 remained detectable (&#x02265;1.1 mg/ml) in 60% of participants 10 weeks after the last injection. No VRC01 was detected in the placebo group (P3). The relatively stable pharmacokinetics after multiple IV and SC dosing suggests the absence of anti-VRC01 antibodies, which was confirmed via ADA assay in a highly sensitive MSD platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002435.s008">S4 Table</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Immunologic activity of VRC01 post infusion</title><p>To test whether VRC01 retained expected neutralizing activity post infusion, serum samples from the same time points used for the ELISA-based PK analysis were assayed against 3 Env-pseudotyped viruses (tier 1A: MN.3, MW965.26; tier 2: PVO.4) in the TZM-bl neutralization assay.

The relevance of the current findings are that, although the use of anti-HIV antibodies for immunoprophylaxis has been studied in NHP models for more than 20 years [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], recent interest in their use for HIV prevention in humans has increased after studies identified multiple bnAbs that exhibit potent activity against a majority of HIV-1 strains [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Such bnAbs, alone or in combination, could provide a novel approach to anti-HIV-1 immunoprophylaxis, and insights from clinical trials of bnAbs could inform the development of immunogens and effective HIV-1 vaccines. VRC01 is among a class of potent bnAbs targeting the functionally conserved CD4bs region of HIV. VRC01 was previously shown to be safe, well tolerated, and non-immunogenic in a small dose-escalation trial in 28 HIV-uninfected participants who received 1 (20 mg/kg) or 2 IV infusions 4 weeks apart of either 5, 20, or 40 mg/kg or 2 SC injections of 5 mg/kg [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. A similar trial was conducted in 23 HIV-infected participants [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>HVTN 104 found that VRC01 administered subcutaneously and in different IV doses was safe and well tolerated, with no dose-associated toxicities. There were a limited number of local site reactions, but patterns of AEs did not differ significantly by route or frequency of product administration or the dose used. Peak serum VRC01 concentrations 1 hour after the final IV administration demonstrated dose proportionality, with the highest levels achieved following the largest dose (40 mg/kg every 8 weeks) and lowest levels after the lowest IV dosing regimen (10 mg/kg every 8 weeks) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002435.t002">Table 2</xref>). The trough following the final VRC01 administration for each dosing regimen ranged from 6 to 46 &#x003bc;g/ml (trough based on the interval between previous administrations). By quantitative assays to measure auto-antibodies and assessment of VRC01 concentrations and neutralization functionality over time, there was no evidence of the development of anti-idiotypic or other autoantibodies, nor was there significant drug accumulation after repeated dosing.</p><p>This trial also examined 2 doses of VRC01 (10mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) administered over a longer interval between IV infusions (8 weeks) that informed the design of 2 proof-of-concept efficacy trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ampstudy.org">www.ampstudy.org</ext-link>, ampstudy.org.za)[<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Of note, the range of VRC01 serum levels of participants receiving either the 10 mg/kg or the 30 mg/kg IV regimens every 8 weeks overlapped for more than 60% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002435.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The evaluation of 11 SC injections received every 2 weeks is also relevant for the design of studies of post-exposure prophylaxis for infants born to HIV-infected mothers who were not virologically suppressed on ARV therapy [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Serum VRC01 concentrations remained at or above 30 &#x003bc;g/ml when 5 mg/kg was administered subcutaneously every 2 weeks through the final trough time point, tailing to 1.8 &#x003bc;g/ml by the final assessment point at week 32.</p><p>The viral neutralization activity based on the IC50 potency of trough levels 24 weeks after IV infusion with either 10 or 30 mg/kg of VRC01 suggests that, of HIV Env-pseudotyped virus strains evaluated, 93%&#x02013;94% of tier 2 clade B strains and 75%&#x02013;84% of tier 2 clade C strains would be neutralized; while coverage based on a more stringent IC80 potency suggests that 82%&#x02013;93% of clade B strains and 58%&#x02013;75% of clade C strains would be neutralized at trough time points (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed.1002435.t003">Table 3</xref>). Actual midpoint and trough levels measured were similar to what would be predicted based on in vitro neutralization assays.</p><p>The VRC01 levels present in the serum samples tested in this study demonstrated an ability to avidly capture virions in vitro and to mediate ADCP, suggesting functionalities in addition to neutralization, although limited ADCC activity was seen. In addition, the serum VRC01 levels measured by ELISA were found to be correlated with ADCP and virion capture activities but less with ADCC activity. This lack of correlation with ADCC activity and the overall low ADCC activity exhibited by VRC01 compared to other CD4bs bnAbs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002435.s004">S2 Fig</xref>) suggests differences in the ability of VRC01 to bind gp140 microspheres or cell surface Env versus infectious virus and differences in affinity of VRC01 binding to Fc receptor (FcR) expressed on the cell surface.</p><p>The current study has reported an estimated terminal half-life of about 15 days for different dose levels of VRC01, whether administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Prior studies of the pharmacokinetics of VRC01 in HIV-uninfected adults have compared multiple doses (5, 20, and 40 mg/kg) given intravenously at 0 and 28 days and a low dose (5 mg/kg) given subcutaneously at 0 and 28 days [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In those studies, IV infusion of VRC01 resulted in high peak serum levels (up to 1,000 &#x003bc;g/ml) that fell rapidly over a few days, with further slow decline over several weeks from catabolism. However, use of smaller SC doses that allowed for a slow diffusion of IgG into the vasculature and lymphatics resulted in stable higher trough IgG serum levels, which remained constant between consecutive SC IgG infusions [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both routes of administration displayed similar half-lives. It is possible that trough levels rather than peak levels are of greatest importance for sufficient prevention of HIV acquisition when administering passive immunotherapy. In HVTN 104, the trough level found after 5 mg/kg SC dosing every 2 weeks was 34 &#x003bc;g/ml and ranged from 6 to 27 &#x003bc;g/ml when VRC01 was administered intravenously every 8 weeks at 10 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg, respectively. It is conceivable that smaller doses given more frequently via the SC route could have the potential to provide sufficient and consistent trough levels as compared to higher IV doses given less frequently. However, in HVTN 104, almost half of the missed visits occurred among those assigned to receive injections every 2 weeks; hence, the development of bnAbs with longer half-lives is clearly warranted. Recent studies have suggested that through modification of the Fc portion of the mAb to better bind the neonatal Fc receptor, bnAbs may be able to have extended half-lives [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], potentially allowing for product administration as infrequently as every 6 months.</p><p>The less than optimal adherence to the study schedule amongst those assigned to receive injections every 2 weeks or infusions every 4 weeks helped inform the selection of the every-8-week dosing frequency for the 2 Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) efficacy trials (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ampstudy.org">www.ampstudy.org</ext-link>, ampstudy.org.za). Other bnAbs that have greater potency and breadth are under investigation [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and could be more effective than VRC01 for protection against HIV. Combining bnAbs for prophylaxis could also expand breadth and help prevent viral escape by inhibiting HIV-1 at multiple sites of vulnerability via complementary mechanisms of action [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In addition, the development of synergistic bispecific antibodies [<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002435.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] that could target more than 1 epitope is another intriguing approach. Finally, if the AMP studies demonstrate that VRC01 can protect against HIV-1 acquisition when administered either at 10 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg every 8 weeks, then antibody concentrations achieved in HVTN 104 may be able to be used to inform the assessment of the immune responses to new vaccine candidates to prevent HIV transmission.</p><p>The limitations of this study include the relative small sample size describing 5 different VRC01 administration regimens, missing data from participants who were not completely adherent to the study visit schedule, and limitations in the interpretation of the clinical significance of the in vitro findings. The pharmacokinetic data from this study must be interpreted cautiously, because the study windows were narrow and the PP cohort only included values from participants who received all of their study infusions, providing PK estimates that may not be generalizable to ongoing efficacy studies of VRC01 that have wider windows and will evaluate a larger number of infusions and longer periods of product exposure. Because of concerns early in this trial about potential particulate matter that turned out to be frozen product (resulting in longer thawing periods), some VRC01 infusions and injections were not administered, resulting in collecting less data than had initially been planned. The study had relatively sparse PK sampling immediately after infusion or injection, limiting inferences that can be drawn regarding early distribution of VRC01 in the blood. Studies of VRC01 concentrations in mucosal secretions and tissues are currently underway and should help further understanding of the penetration of systemically administered VRC01 in different body compartments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VRC01 administered intravenously or subcutaneously was safe and well tolerated. Product-related AEs were uncommon and generally transient and mild. After a 40 mg/kg IV loading dose, VRC01 levels were maintained at &#x0003e;30 &#x003bc;g/ml for several weeks through either IV or SC administration every 2 weeks. Trough levels of 4, 16, or 27 &#x003bc;g/ml were maintained with IV infusions of 10, 30, and 40 mg/kg every 8 weeks, respectively. The trough data support the rationale that VRC01 administered every 8 weeks intravenously should be evaluated in studies of HIV-1 immunoprophylaxis. The first efficacy trials of VRC01 are underway in the AMP studies (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT02716675 and NCT02568215, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ampstudy.org">www.ampstudy.org</ext-link>, ampstudy.org.za), evaluating anti-HIV-1 activity among 4,200 at-risk men and transgender people who have sex with men in North and South America and at-risk young women in sub-Saharan Africa. The findings should help inform the development of both passive and active immunization strategies to prevent HIV-1 infection. The trough levels seen after SC administered VRC01 every 2 weeks suggest that this approach may be particularly appropriate for immunoprophylaxis for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Studies are being developed to test this hypothesis. In summary, HVTN 104 found that VRC01 delivered via IV or SC routes was safe and well tolerated, and results from in vitro assays suggest that the levels achieved in clinical specimens displayed a wide range of functional anti-HIV activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002435.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>HVTN 104 CONSORT checklist.</title><p>CONSORT, Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials; HVTN, HIV Vaccine Trials Network.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002435.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002435.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>HVTN 104 protocol, version 2.</title><p>HVTN, HIV Vaccine Trials Network.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pmed.1002435.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed.1002435.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Individual-specific VRC01 serum concentration level.</title><p>Data are presented for <bold>(A)</bold> the MITT cohort and <bold>(B)</bold> the PP cohort.
