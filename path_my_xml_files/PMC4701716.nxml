Plasma samples were assayed by PharmaNet Canada, Inc. (Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada), using a validated HPLC method with a lower limit of quantification of 100 pg/mL. The analyte and its internal standard alendronic acid-d<sub>6</sub> were extracted from a 0.2 mL aliquot of human plasma prepared with K2 EDTA, using a protein precipitation procedure, followed by a solid phase extraction and a derivatization step. The extracted samples were injected into a liquid chromatograph equipped with a Zorbax 300-SCX (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), 50 &#x000d7; 3 mm, 5 &#x000b5;m column.

The detection method used was tandem mass spectrometry.</p><p>Within-run accuracy and precision evaluations of the assay were performed by analyzing replicate concentrations of alendronic acid in human EDTA K2 plasma. The run consisted of a calibration curve plus a total of 30 spiked samples; 6 replicates of each of the lower and higher limits of quantitation; and low, medium, and high quality control samples. The within-run coefficients of variation ranged between 1.27% and 4.47%. The within-run percentages of bias ranged between &#x02013;4.19% and 6.34%.

All AEs were transient and considered mild in intensity by the investigator. There were no serious AEs reported and no subjects discontinued because of an AE. Two laboratory AEs were reported at prestudy: alanine aminotransferase increased for 1 subject and aspartate aminotransferase increased for a second subject. There were no consistent treatment-related changes in routine clinical safety parameters, including vital signs and physical examination.</p><p>The most common drug-related AEs were arthralgia (reported by 25 and 27 subjects after receiving ALN/D5600 and ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, respectively), pyrexia (12 vs 10 subjects), and headache (9 vs 10 subjects). Gastrointestinal disorders were reported in 4 and 6 patients, respectively, and included abdominal distension, diarrhea, vomiting (all 1 subject each) and toothache (2 subjects) in the ALN/D5600 group, and diarrhea (5 subjects), toothache (2 subjects), and nausea (1 subject) in the ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group. There were no clinically meaningful differences in tolerability between the ALN/D5600 combination tablet and the coadministered dose of ALN and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0080"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although the 90% CIs of the observed GMRs for the plasma AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of ALN for subjects with measurable PK in both treatment periods were not all contained within the prespecified bounds for bioequivalence (ie, 0.80&#x02013;1.25), the 90% CI of the observed GMR for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> of ALN was within the bounds. In addition, the 90% CI of the ratio of medians for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> obtained from the nonparametric analysis was within the prespecified bounds. The ALN/D5600 combination tablet and coadministration of ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub> resulted in similar plasma concentration-time profiles (<xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). This is supported by the fact that for both GMRs the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were within the lower bound of the 90% CI of ALN AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> (there was only a minor excursion of the upper bound of the 90% CI of ALN AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>), and the entire 90% CI for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> was within the bioequivalence bounds (ie, 0.80&#x02013;1.25).</p><p>The observed differences between ALN AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> are not believed to be clinically significant, in that the slightly higher AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of the ALN/D5600 combination tablet would not be expected to result in an additional safety risk or to have an influence on efficacy compared with concomitant ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. This is because the differences were small and thus would likely fall within the range experienced among the broad population of patients using ALN, and because of the mechanism of action of ALN, which relies on its deposition in bone. Incorporation of ALN in bone over time is correlated clinically with increased bone mass and reduced fracture risk,<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> such that small differences in AUC or C<sub>max</sub> are unlikely to have a major effect. In addition, based on the highly variable drug characteristics of ALN and using the proposed bioequivalence approach of the European Medicines Agency for high variability values (intrasubject variability &#x0003e;30%),<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> the C<sub>max</sub> of ALN falls within the expanded CI of 0.698 to 1.432. The highly variable drug status of ALN was not prespecified in the hypothesis because this was the first study conducted by the sponsor to employ a newly developed assay for plasma ALN. For this reason, internal data on which to base variability estimates were lacking, and data from the literature on ALN were limited in this regard.</p><p>The GMR and 90% CIs for unadjusted serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;80h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were within the prespecified bioequivalence bounds. After baseline correction of serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub>, both point estimates and the entire 90% CI for C<sub>max</sub> were within the prespecified bounds; however, the upper limit of the 90% CI for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;80h</sub> fell outside these bounds. This was because some subjects had lower serum vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentrations at 80 hours postdose than at predose. The likely explanation for this is the restrictions that were placed on subjects to prevent exposure to vitamin D<sub>3</sub> except for study treatment, including the avoidance of sun exposure and a diet containing minimal, if any, vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. The baseline adjusted approach attempts to separate the contribution of the administered vitamin D<sub>3</sub> from endogenous vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels on an individual basis, and in doing so, also adjusts for potential differences in baseline vitamin D<sub>3</sub> levels across periods. However, this approach assumes that the endogenous level will remain constant, which appeared to be incorrect for some subjects. The PK parameters AUC<sub>0&#x02013;80h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> obtained from the data unadjusted for baseline vitamin D<sub>3</sub> concentrations are therefore favored because this approach requires no assumptions; these data also agree with those presented previously.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>Historically, the primary PK parameter of ALN was urinary excretion of ALN. This was because plasma concentrations were too low for analysis and elimination of bioavailable ALN is essentially entirely via urinary excretion.<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref> However, urinary analysis of ALN requires complex processes, is labor intensive, and typically requires more than 200 subjects to demonstrate bioequivalence.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Recently, HPLC-MS/MS detection has been used to measure plasma ALN levels. Use of a plasma-based assessment required fewer subjects to demonstrate bioequivalence compared with urine-based assessments.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> Once the extreme values in the ALN data were accommodated, the data generated from this study are in good agreement with those published previously using a urine-based approach to demonstrate bioequivalence,<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> which supports the applicability of the plasma ALN assay. Because the plasma t<sub>1/2</sub> of ALN is long (up to 10 years), calculation of the apparent terminal t<sub>1/2</sub> and therefore the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> may be underestimated. Hence, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> was proposed as the primary PK end point upon which to assess bioequivalence for ALN.</p><p>There were no clinically meaningful differences in tolerability between the ALN/D5600 tablet and the coadministration of ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. Although the combination tablet showed slightly higher C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> for ALN, the safety profile remained consistent with that of the marketed drug.</p><sec id="s0085"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study of healthy male and female volunteers in Taiwan, the ALN/D5600 combination tablet was considered bioequivalent to coadministration based on ALN AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> and nonparametric AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and unadjusted vitamin D<sub>3</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;80h</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>. The magnitude of the difference between ALN/D5600 and ALN + vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for ALN AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> was not considered to be clinically significant, and both parameters fall within the expanded CIs of the European Medicines Agency&#x02019;s proposed bioequivalence approach for high variability values. The combination tablet was well tolerated, with no serious AEs reported, and is comparable to the coadministration of corresponding doses of ALN and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>This study was sponsored by Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc.
