There is now considerable evidence demonstrating an association between enhanced oxidative stress and the incidence of CVD. In healthy vasculature, oxidative stress is kept in check by nitric oxide (NO) derived from endothelial NO synthase (NOS). Endothelial- and platelet-derived NO plays a pivotal role in maintaining normal vascular homeostasis and has atheroprotective effects, inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation, leukocyte adhesion, and aggregation of platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Diabetic vascular disease, in contrast, is characterized by altered NO bioavailability resulting from an increase in the amount of the NO scavenger superoxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>), derived predominantly from NAD(P)H oxidase or from uncoupled endothelial NOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Together, these alterations lead to endothelial dysfunction, enhanced platelet activity, and an increased risk of thrombosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Despite a large body of evidence linking dysregulated NO production and enhanced oxidative stress to vascular disease, however, clinical studies with well-characterized antioxidant vitamins, such as vitamins C and E, have proved disappointing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The inability of antioxidants to be delivered and retained in the vascular bed may explain these results. Moreover, with increasing evidence of the importance of free radicals in normal physiological function, a new paradigm is emerging that favors controlled free radical production. In this model, a therapeutically beneficial rebalancing of NO relative to O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production is sought, rather than the complete suppression of free radical production, such as occurs after antioxidant administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this regard, we have recently shown that n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), the major constituents of oily fish, can modulate the nitroso-redox balance by increasing vasculoprotective NO and decreasing O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). This finding may be extremely valuable for diabetic patients whose disease manifests as a high oxidative status. Furthermore, fish oil&#x02013;derived n-3 PUFAs may also offer several other advantages. Importantly, they are easily absorbed and retained within cellular membranes, where they can act as a readily available supply of free radical&#x02013;modifying agents. This bioavailability, coupled with their ability to specifically modulate the function of enzymes producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species, such as NAD(P)H and NOS, suggests that, far from simply being free radical scavengers like other antioxidants, n-3 PUFAs may be therapeutically superior.</p><p>The health benefits of high oily fish consumption were first recognized in the Greenland Inuit, in whom n-3 PUFA consumption was correlated with a lower CVD mortality rate. Since that discovery, a substantial amount of evidence has accumulated to show that the high content of n-3 PUFAs, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), are responsible for these health benefits. The n-3 PUFAs are believed to exert their therapeutic benefits through a variety of mechanisms, including a reduction in antithrombotic and antiarrhythmic actions and improved endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Few studies, however, have investigated the potential benefits of n-3 PUFA treatment for diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Platelets contain all the components of a functioning NO-producing pathway, including the enzyme necessary for the production of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and are therefore capable of producing NO in response to platelet-specific agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In addition, they also contain all the subunits required for the assembly of the NAD(P)H oxidase system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Platelets thus represent an accessible cellular model for functional studies to explore free radical activity in relation to changes in NAD(P)H oxidase and NOS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Accordingly, in the current study we examined platelets to investigate the effects of n-3 PUFAs on NO and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> bioactivities and on oxidative stress in a diabetic population.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Materials and antibodies</title><p>We obtained all reagents from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study design</title><p>We recruited T2DM patients with hypertension (T2DM HT group; <italic>n</italic> = 22; duration of diabetes 6 &#x000b1; 1 years) and age- and sex-matched control study participants with hypertension (HT alone group; <italic>n</italic> = 23). A cohort of healthy individuals without treatment (control), collected as an adjunct to this study, was also used to provide baseline reference values and is included for illustrative purposes. We identified diabetic study participants eligible for the trial from clinical registers. Previous T2DM diagnosis was defined as a fasting plasma glucose level of &#x0003e;7.0 mmol/L or plasma venous sample level of &#x0003e;11.1 mmol/L 2 h after consuming a 75-g oral glucose load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Patients were eligible for the study if their records provided evidence of stable control of diabetes, defined as HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels of 6.5&#x02013;10%. For the purposes of the study, we used fasting glucose levels throughout as a surrogate marker for diabetes status. We excluded participants if they had any history of overt CVD or established microcomplications and macrocomplications of T2DM or hypertension, such as retinopathy or nephropathy, as well as excluding those receiving insulin therapy. All study participants adhered to their regular diets and medications throughout and gave written, informed consent for all procedures. This study was approved by the local ethical committee of Queen's University Belfast. Data from previous intervention studies revealed an SD of 0.39 pmol/10<sup>8</sup> platelets (after log transformation) for measurements of NO production. Thus to detect a 40% differential change in NO at a 5% significance level with a two-tailed hypothesis test, our study required 20 volunteers per group to achieve 90% power.</p><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 8 weeks of n-3 PUFA or placebo, with an intervening 8-week washout period. In brief, after randomization, study participants received daily for 8 weeks either four fish oil capsules (Omacor) containing 0.46 g EPA and 0.38 g DHA (Solvay Pharma) or four identical olive oil&#x02013;containing capsules. We chose olive oil as the placebo to provide a calorie intake similar to that of the fish oil capsule, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). After an 8-week washout period in which study participants did not receive any treatment, participants were then allocated the oil supplement they had not previously received. We performed studies before treatment (baseline 1), after 8 weeks of treatment, after the 8-week washout (baseline 2), and after a further 8 weeks of treatment. This was in line with previous studies confirming that an 8-week treatment phase permits sufficient time for the incorporation of the fatty acids into cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Platelet isolation</title><p>Study participants attended all trial appointments after having fasted overnight, and they refrained from taking their prescribed medications until after the assessment. After a 30-min rest period, we withdrew 120 mL of venous blood from the left antecubital fossa with a 19-gauge butterfly needle. Three aliquots were processed for routine biochemical assays. The remainder of the blood in 9.0-mL aliquots was run into each of 10 polypropylene tubes containing 1.0 mL 3.18% sodium citrate and gently mixed. Care was taken with this collection process to avoid activation of the platelets. The platelet-rich plasma was separated from erythrocytes by centrifugation (200<italic>g</italic> for 30 min at room temperature), and platelets were concentrated by centrifugation at 850<italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The resulting pellets were washed twice with Tyrode buffer. Two pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for subsequent platelet 8-isoprostane and membrane fatty acid analysis. A third pellet was separated into cytosol and membrane fractions for subsequent p47 content assessment and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. Finally, we resuspended the remaining two pellets in fresh Tyrode buffer in preparation for O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> or nitrite measurement. Estimation of platelet purity verified that the number of contaminating polymorphic nuclear cells was consistently below 0.05/10<sup>8</sup> platelets.

Because we have previously shown that DHA and EPA have such properties in normal endothelial cells, the aim of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of fish oil supplementation in a disease characterized by a high oxidative status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Because of the high susceptibility of PUFAs to oxidative damage, it is important to ensure that supplementation is not damaging to vascular health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Isoprostanes are the nonenzymatic products of AA oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). They are chemically similar to prostaglandins but with opposing biological function; they contribute toward the increased platelet activation observed in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and are therefore useful indicators of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress. After fish oil supplementation, isoprostane levels were unaltered in HT alone study participants, perhaps as a result of the efficacy of conventional antihypertensive therapies in use by this group. In contrast, fish oil treatment significantly decreased isoprostane levels in the T2DM HT group, suggesting that n-3 PUFAs offer an additional therapeutic benefit. These results are in agreement with those of Mori et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), who also demonstrated an n-3 PUFA&#x02013;mediated decrease in isoprostane levels in T2DM patients.</p><p>Assessment of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production provided further evidence for a fish oil&#x02013;mediated decrease in oxidative stress. Our current study demonstrated a significant elevation in O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production in platelets isolated from diabetic study participants at baseline, suggesting that, despite treatment for blood glucose reduction, these participants still showed evidence of dysfunctional ROS signaling. This dysfunction was normalized by n-3 PUFA supplementation, suggesting that these agents provide additional benefit beyond their conventional drug regimen.</p><p>We have previously shown that NOS and NAD(P)H are the two most significant enzymatic sources of O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production in platelets. With subcellular compartmentalization of p47-phox as a surrogate indicator of NAD(P)H oxidase activity, the results of this study indicate that, compared with healthy individuals, membrane-associated levels of p47 were elevated in both HT alone and T2DM HT study participants, which is in agreement with observations in experimental models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Fish oil supplementation markedly reduced this membrane association, suggesting lowered NAD(P)H oxidase activity.</p><p>Measurement of NO levels in vascular disease settings is often complicated by a paradoxical increase in NOS expression. The additional protein, however, is dysfunctional and acts as a source of oxidative free radicals along with NO, resulting in elevated nitrite and concomitant O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Thus an accurate assessment of altered NO bioavailability requires an assessment of the functional status of NOS. Although the current study did not demonstrate a measurable effect on nitrite production, evidence for a change in the functional status of NOS, in terms of its ability to produce NO or O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, was found. In the T2DM HT study participants classified as the uncoupled NOS group, fish oil and olive oil supplements both decreased NOS<bold>-</bold>derived O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> production significantly. These results indicate that both oils reduce the proportion of uncoupled NOS present. Together, these findings suggest that the ability to restore normal NOS function is common to both n-3 PUFA and olive oil, whereas the effects of n-3 PUFA treatment on decreased ROS production from NAD(P)H oxidase are unique to the fish oils. In summary, these findings indicate an overall n-3 PUFA&#x02013;mediated improvement in global platelet redox status. Indeed, this is in agreement with previous research in our group showing that supplementation with n-3 PUFAs improved forearm blood flow in diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, there are several ways in which fish oils may mediate the effects observed in this study. First, the presence of the unsaturated double bonds increases lipid bilayer fluidity, thereby preventing the sequestering of signaling molecules to cholesterol-rich plasma membrane microdomains, such as caveolae and lipid rafts where endothelial NOS and NAD(P)H reside. For endothelial NOS, such a shift leads to a physical separation from its inhibitory partner caveolin-1, leading to an increase in basal NO production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This effect on membrane fluidity is a feature shared, albeit to a lower extent, by monounsaturated fatty acids like oleic acid, the major n-9 PUFA constituent in olive oil. This may explain the olive oil&#x02013;mediated improvement in NOS function that we saw.</p><p>Second, the incorporation of PUFA displaces AA from the plasma membrane to accommodate the influx of EPA and DHA, effectively reducing AA concentrations. Any reduction in AA, an activator of NAD(P)H oxidase, inhibits NAD(P)H activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).</p><p>Third, n-3 PUFAs also have a high affinity for eicosanoid-synthesizing enzymes such as cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase and can be metabolized to specific EPA- or DHA-derived eicosanoids that are less inflammatory and thrombogenic than their n-6 PUFA&#x02013;derived counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The production of eicosanoids is dependent on an n-6 unsaturated bond, which is absent from oleic acid. Thus it is possible that the fish oil&#x02013;specific effects we observed are due in part to a decrease in n-6 PUFA&#x02013;derived metabolites in conjunction with a concomitant increase in their n-3 PUFA&#x02013;derived counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Raised triglyceride levels are a major risk factor for CVD in diabetic patients. Thus the finding that Omacor, currently prescribed for hyperlipidemia, had the ability to decrease triglyceride levels in our study population is clearly advantageous. Interestingly, the decrease in triglyceride levels was more marked in the T2DM HT participants and correlated with decreased ROS production. Mechanistically, this may be the result of a decrease in levels of oxidized LDL, which is known to inhibit NOS function by increasing its association with caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Furthermore, diabetes is a chronic inflammatory disease in which enhanced levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines act to exacerbate endothelial dysfunction. In this regard, n-3 PUFAs are known to modulate proinflammatory cytokine expression and also reduce cytokine signaling events by displacement of cytokine receptors from their downstream signaling partners, suggesting a further means by which fish oil may indirectly alter redox mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>Much of the advice for diabetic patients regarding fish consumption is based on the higher incidence of CVD in T2DM and is extrapolated from studies on the non-T2DM population or derived from prospective studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). T2DM patients have an enhanced oxidative burden compared with non-T2DM patients; therefore, studies confirming efficacy of fish oil supplementation for the former are extremely important. One of the few large scale studies to focus on individuals with T2DM recently reported no significant benefit of fish oils with respect to reducing cardiovascular mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In common with our study, all study participants received a similar ratio of EPA to DHA. In contrast, however, they received a lower dose (1 g/day) than we used here (3 g/day). Perhaps more importantly, the underlying disease pattern was markedly different, with patients only enrolled if they had already had a cardiovascular event. In contrast, our study focused on study participants without advanced disease and accordingly investigated markers known to be elevated in the early stages of endothelial dysfunction. Future large scale studies, such as ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes) should clarify whether fish oil supplementation in T2DM patients with no previous CVD would be beneficial in preventing disease progression.</p><p>In summary, by using well-characterized markers of platelet and vascular dysfunction, our findings support a model whereby supplementation with n-3 PUFAs decreases ROS production and oxidative stress and improves NOS function in T2DM study participants. These favorable effects on redox state in platelets support a cardioprotective role for n-3 PUFAs in patients with T2DM.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the R &#x00026; D Office Northern Ireland.</p><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>D.M.M. codirected research, analyzed data, and wrote the manuscript.
