However, only a few small studies have investigated the composition of vaginal microbiota during labor. In this work, we analyzed vaginal swabs collected at 36 weeks gestation and at the onset of labor from 256 women participating in a randomized placebo-controlled study of probiotic supplementation for the prevention of atopic dermatitis in offspring. Although individuals&#x02019; vaginal microbiota was stable over time, several bacterial families, which are characteristic of mixed community state type (CST) IV, were overrepresented in vaginal swabs sampled at labor. Alpha-diversity also tended to increase by between 36 weeks gestation and the onset of birth. In the majority of women, CST remained the same throughout the study. Among the women who switched their vaginal microbiota from one CST to another, approximately half shifted towards CST IV. Although CST IV is often associated with bacterial vaginosis, which in turn may lead to preterm birth, in our cohort this shift was not associated with self-reported vaginosis, preterm delivery or birthweight. Probiotic consumption did not alter vaginal microbiota.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Vaginal microbiota of women can generally be separated into five vaginal bacterial community state types (CSTs) that seem to be dependent on ethnic and biogeographical background<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Four of the CSTs are characterized by high levels of either <italic>Lactobacillus crispatus</italic> (CST I), <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> (CST II), <italic>Lactobacillus iners</italic> (CST III) or <italic>Lactobacillus jensenii</italic> (CST V). On the other hand, CST IV lacks lactobacilli and is enriched in various anaerobic bacteria. Whilst CST IV can be found in healthy women, it is often linked to high Nugent scores and bacterial vaginosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which in turn is associated with increased risk of preterm birth and contraction of sexually transmitted infections<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The vaginal microbiota plays a major role in initial colonization of the infant gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>.

However, it seems that postnatal vaginal seeding of C-section born babies may result in a pattern of colonization that resembles what is observed in vaginally born babies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. It is therefore crucial to understand how vaginal microbial communities of laboring women are structured. Several large cohort studies have described vaginal microbiota during pregnancy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.

Among women who had a vaginal microbiota that changed from one CST to another, we also show that it was more common to switch to CST IV than to other CSTs.

We did not find any correlation between CST type frequencies in the study cohort and detection of OTU26 at either time point (binomial FDR&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). Only six women were persistently colonized by this OTU throughout the study, and three of them have shifted the CST by the time of labor onset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Control for reagents contamination</title><p id="Par22">Five negative controls included from the DNA extraction step, were also subjected to sequencing. Only one of them had sequencing reads that were not removed after quality filtering. This sample had 92 reads, most of which belonged to <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> (49 reads) and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (18 reads) genera, possibly indicating cross-contamination of the negative control due to potential well-to-well spillage. The majority of other OTUs found in the negative control were detected as single reads (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). We marked these OTUs as &#x02018;suspicious&#x02019; as they might have stemmed from the reagents contamination<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. However, since only one out of five negative controls was amplified, and the number of sequencing reads in this sample was low, we did not exclude these OTUs from the dataset.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par23">To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe the vaginal microbiota at the point of admission to hospital for labor in a large cohort of women (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;105), as well as at the 36<sup>th</sup> gestation week (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;230). In concordance with previous observations, <italic>L. crispatus</italic> (CST I), <italic>L. iners</italic> (CST III) and <italic>L. jensenii</italic> (CST V) were the most commonly identified residents of the vaginal microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. We found that the number of observed species increased significantly by the time of delivery. In particular, OTUs and bacterial families that are characteristic of CST IV were significantly overrepresented at labor compared to 36 weeks gestation. For women with samples at both time points (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;79), the vaginal microbiota at labor generally had a greater resemblance to the pregnancy sample from the same woman than to other women. However, in 17.7% of our study cohort the CST shifted within the last weeks of pregnancy. In half of the women who changed the CST by the time of labor onset, the microbiota changed to CST IV. Although the tendency to switch from one CST to another during pregnancy has been previously reported, the shift to CST IV has rarely occured<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. CST IV is often linked to high Nugent scores<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>, which are commonly used in assessment of bacterial vaginosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Although we do not have the Nugent scores for these samples, the frequency of self-reported vaginosis during pregnancy was low in our cohort and did not seem to be connected to any particular CST type. CST IV has been linked to increased risk of preterm birth<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, but other studies do not find this association<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. In our cohort, CST IV did not correlate to either preterm birth or birthweight of the child. Moreover, all women who shifted to CST IV by the time of labor onset, delivered at term. Increased rate of CST IV was also reported characteristic of 6-weeks-postpartum vaginal samples of women with uncomplicated term deliveries<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Since prenatal hormonal changes might contribute to the differences in the microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, we believe that this can indicate that vaginal microbiota changes shortly before labor onset and then takes long time to be recovered back to its non-pregnant state. Women who had visible blood traces in their vaginal swab, tended to shift CST more often than other women, although a tendency towards CST IV shift in these samples was comparable to that of the whole study cohort.</p><p id="Par24">We have previously demonstrated that mothers from the probiotic arm of the study had acquired the administered probiotic strains in their gut and their newborns were colonized by LGG<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Since it was mothers, and not their children, who received the probiotic supplement, it is fair to assume that LGG was transmitted from mother to child either at birth or during breast-feeding. However, we did not find any indication of LGG transfer via breast milk microbiota<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup> and the results of this study do not support the hypothesis of LGG translocation to the vaginal tract either. Another possible route of LGG transfer might be through oral microbiota via kissing or pacifiers, which are often cleaned by putting them in mothers&#x02019; mouths. Alternatively, since infants of LGG-colonized mothers were more likely to harbor this strain in their gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>, the colonization may occur through maternal gut microbiota.</p><p id="Par25">Early-onset GBS (<italic>S. agalactiae</italic>) infection can be fatal for newborns and can cause neurologic impairment in the survivors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. Although we do not have access to medical records on maternal GBS status during labor, our sequencing data suggest rather low prevalence of <italic>S. agalactiae</italic> in vaginal swabs of women from our cohort (13%) compared to the average maternal colonization rate in Europe (19%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par26">The relative abundance of OTU56 (<italic>Ralstonia</italic>), which belongs to the <italic>Burkholderiaceae</italic> family, was found to be significantly different between pregnancy and labor onset. However, one read from this OTU was also detected in the negative control sample that had detectable sequencing reads. Taking into account that <italic>Ralstonia</italic> was previously reported as one of potential next-generation sequencing contaminants<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, these results have to be taken with caution. We also report significant differences in <italic>Chitinophagaceae</italic>, which are commonly isolated from soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. However, none of the reads in the negative control belonged to this bacterial family. Moreover, recent study on urinary microbiota has also detected <italic>Chitinophagaceae</italic> both in mid-stream urine and vaginal fluid samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par27">In conclusion, we report that although vaginal microbiota at labor resembled microbiota during pregnancy, bacteria associated with CST IV were significantly overrepresented. We also show that those women who shifted their dominant microbiota by the time of labor onset, tended to shift towards CST IV. CST IV microbiota type was not significantly associated with either self-reported bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy, preterm birth or birthweight of the child. Probiotic consumption did not affect the microbial community profile and administered probiotic strains were not translocated to the vaginal tract.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>
