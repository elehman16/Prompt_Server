Patients with cancer experience different courses of disease, needs and unmet needs. They have different resources and motivations for receiving help, and adjusting to and coping with critical situations. This complexity of the consequences of cancer adds to the challenges of organising a comprehensive and individual rehabilitation course that embraces the complex of physical, psychosocial, sexual and financial problems and unmet needs experienced by patients with cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1 R2 R3 R4 R5 R6 R7 R8">1&#x02013;8</xref></p><p>The general practitioner (GP) is regarded as a central person in coordinating each patient's rehabilitation course, since they often have prior knowledge about the patient's resources and comorbidity,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9 R10 R11 R12 R13 R14">9&#x02013;14</xref> which are factors that might influence the quality and benefits of the patient's rehabilitation. Also, studies have shown that patients would like their GP to be involved and proactive during the course of disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> However, the GP is often sidelined during the cancer treatment, which complicates early rehabilitation as well as the critical transition phase from the hospital to the general practice after the end of the treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16 R17 R18">16&#x02013;18</xref> This may contribute to the low patient satisfaction with respect to the GPs&#x02019; interest in and contribution to the course of the cancer disease observed in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref> The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects of an intervention encouraging the early involvement of GPs on satisfaction of patients with cancer with their GP in general, and specifically in relation to the cancer course. Furthermore, the GPs&#x02019; self-reported satisfaction with their own contribution to their patients&#x02019; physical and psychosocial rehabilitation will be explored.</p><p>The present paper is part of a series of papers evaluating the effects of the intervention. We have previously reported that the intervention had no statistically significant effect on the patients&#x02019; quality of life as the primary outcome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> or on the level of psychological distress,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> on GPs&#x02019; proactivity or on the patients&#x02019; participation in rehabilitation activities<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> as secondary outcomes. In this light, one might question whether we could reasonably expect any effect on patient satisfaction. However, the intervention was expected to improve the communication between the hospital and GPs as well as between GPs and patients, which in itself may improve patient satisfaction with GPs, even if there were no detectable effects on, for example, the quality of life or psychological distress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We conducted a cluster randomised controlled trial, testing whether a complex intervention facilitating early cancer rehabilitation by involvement of GPs early after diagnosis improves patients&#x02019; satisfaction with their GPs.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>All adult patients (&#x02265;18&#x02005;years) newly diagnosed with cancer and admitted to Vejle Hospital between 12 May 2008 and 28 February 2009 were assessed for eligibility.

Further, the GP received an email summarising the information, supplemented by general information about the needs and problems of patients with cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013002726F2">figure 2</xref>). The information about the individual patient was personally conveyed by phone, if possible, and always sent electronically along with the general information.

The distribution of cancer types at Vejle Hospital naturally implies an overrepresentation of female patients with cancer (an almost even number of men and women were diagnosed with cancer in 2008 at a national level).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> Responding GPs in the two groups showed similar demographic characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013002726TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013002726TB1" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Baseline demographic and medical characteristics of all included patients (n=955)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=469)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention group (n=486)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Age, years</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Mean (95% CI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.6 (62.5 to 64.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.2 (62.2 to 64.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Median</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Range</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 to 98</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28 to 92</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Sex, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Male</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">134 (28.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">133 (27.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Female</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">335 (71.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">353 (72.6)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Cancer type, n (%)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the breast</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">206 (43.9)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">201 (41.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the lung</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">69 (14.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75 (15.4)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Malignant melanoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 (9.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">35 (7.2)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the rectum/anus</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33 (7.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45 (9.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the colon</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (6.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">39 (8.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the ovaries</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (2.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (1.9)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the bilary system</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (1.5)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (1.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the brain</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (1.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (1.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the prostate</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (1.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (0.6)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Cancer of the corpus uteri</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (1.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (1.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Myelomatosis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6 (1.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (1.0)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Lymphoma</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (0.6)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (0.8)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Unspecified location</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (3.4)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (3.3)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Other diagnoses</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">24 (5.1)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">33 (6.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2013002726TB2" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Demographic characteristics of responding general practitioners after 14&#x02005;months of follow-up.

Since this questionnaire was administered to patients after 6&#x02005;months of follow-up, the level of satisfaction also reflects the diagnostic phase before the intervention was initiated. This may have diluted a possible effect of the intervention on patient satisfaction with the GP.</p><p>As there were no validated instruments measuring patient satisfaction with their GP's contribution to their cancer course specifically, we constructed ad hoc questions. Additionally, no validated instruments measuring the GPs&#x02019; satisfaction with their own contribution to the patient's cancer rehabilitation course were available, and ad hoc questions were constructed. All ad hoc questions were pilot tested and showed acceptable variability and response rates.</p><p>Cluster randomisation was performed to ensure that GPs working together only handled patients from either the intervention or the control group. Information about the study might have disseminated from GPs in the intervention group to GPs in the control group, but we have no reason to believe that this has caused any significant spillover effect.</p><p>The heterogeneity of the study population due to inclusion of patients with various types of cancer, different prognoses, comorbidities and the need for rehabilitation and supportive care may have diluted the effects of the intervention in subgroups of patients with specific diagnoses or problems. Subgroup analyses of satisfaction with the GP among patients with breast cancer using the DanPEP questionnaire showed higher levels of satisfaction with the GP among intervention group patients. Patients with breast cancer are usually younger and socioeconomically advantaged compared to the majority of patients with cancer. This may imply a higher level of psychosocial resources leading to a higher degree of action towards handling of their unmet needs and a greater acceptability towards interventions similar to the one in this study, which may contribute to a higher degree of satisfaction with their GP. We are aware that the choice of a heterogenic sample may have caused some dilution of possible effects of the intervention among subgroups of patients. However, the overall purpose was to test the intervention, which was intended to be relevant to all types of patients with cancer, on patients with cancer in general and thereby to simulate real life in general practice.</p><p>After the study was conducted, problems with ceiling effects of the DanPEP questionnaire have been discussed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> However, there is no indication of ceiling effect in our data as the proportion of top evaluations of patients with cancer in our study was considerably lower with regard to all separate items and all five dimensions of care compared to levels in previous DanPEP and EuroPEP surveys.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Evaluations differ between countries, but the overall proportion of top evaluations for all 23 items ranges between 63.9% and 98.0%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> A nationwide Danish DanPEP survey conducted in 2002&#x02013;2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref> showed proportions of top evaluations similar to the European average. In the Danish study, satisfaction of patients with chronic cancer with their GP was generally higher compared to patients in general and to patients with other chronic diseases. In addition, higher patient satisfaction was found to be strongly associated with increasing age. In our study, patients were considerably less satisfied with their GP with regard to proportions of top evaluations of the 23 items of the DanPEP (ranging between 34.4% and 70.7%) compared to the European and the Danish studies. This may partly be explained by the potential life crisis induced by a diagnosis of cancer, which many patients might have found themselves in at the time of follow-up. Additionally, some patients with cancer are dissatisfied with their GP's handling of their course of diagnosis, which may be reflected as dissatisfaction with the GP in general in the DanPEP data. The increasing adjustment to and coping with the different consequences of the cancer disease over time may explain the higher satisfaction with the GP among patients with chronic cancer. In addition, the threat of a cancer disorder is often said to promote a certain strength and gratefulness for life among the patients surviving it or living with it, which is reflected in higher levels of satisfaction and quality of life than observed among patients in an early phase of their disease, and among people in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Meaning</title><p>The complexity of consequences of a cancer disease affecting almost all aspects of the life of patients with cancer demanded a complex intervention embracing as many aspects possible in order to provide an optimal rehabilitation course for each patient. Although no overall effect on patients&#x02019; or GPs&#x02019; satisfaction with the GPs&#x02019; contribution to the cancer course was observed, subgroup analyses of the satisfaction with the GP among patients with breast cancer indicate that this type of intervention may be effective for some groups of patients with cancer. Future research should focus on how to reach other subgroups of patients with cancer with different characteristics and challenges.</p><p>Only 67% of patients with cancer were satisfied or very satisfied with their GP's contribution to the rehabilitation course. In contrast, close to 90% of GPs were satisfied or very satisfied with their own contribution to the patients&#x02019; rehabilitation course. Our results reveal a pronounced lack of agreement between patient and GP satisfaction with the GPs&#x02019; contribution to the patients&#x02019; rehabilitation course. The subjective assessment of satisfaction with the support provided may vary between patients and GPs and be influenced not only by many external factors within each group but also by the specific characteristics or experiences of each individual. Future research should focus on the mismatch between GP-experienced and patient-experienced satisfaction with the GPs&#x02019; contributions, and in particular on how to improve patient satisfaction regarding the GPs&#x02019; contribution to their rehabilitation course.</p><p>The low level of patient satisfaction with regard to all five dimensions of the DanPEP questionnaire of patients in both groups suggests that patients with cancer within the first year after diagnosis may have relatively high expectations to their GP, and require special attention and support from their GP. It would be useful to focus future research on how to best prepare GPs for the complex task of supporting cancer rehabilitation, including how to identify those in need of specific support and proactive care. However, political and financial incentives supporting and defining the GPs&#x02019; role and activities in cancer rehabilitation are needed in order to provide optimal conditions for GPs to facilitate a successful rehabilitation course for each patient.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomised controlled trial showed that a complex intervention aiming at facilitating GPs&#x02019; role in cancer rehabilitation had no impact on patient satisfaction with their GP or on the GPs&#x02019; satisfaction with their own contribution to the course of cancer in patients. Low patient satisfaction with the GP, and low agreement between patients&#x02019; and GPs&#x02019; satisfaction with the GPs&#x02019; contribution to the course of cancer in patients were observed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e178" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002726.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e179" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-002726.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all patients and healthcare professionals who took part in the study.
