We will recruit 68 patients with chronic low back pain following discharge from an outpatient hospital program, who will be randomly allocated to the physical activity intervention (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) or the standard care group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) and monitored for 6&#x000a0;months. The physical activity intervention will involve a physical activity advice booklet, a face-to-face health coaching session and 12 fortnightly follow-up telephone-based health coaching sessions. This intervention will be supported by provision of a specifically designed web app and a physical activity monitoring device (<italic>FitBit</italic>).

If proven to be effective, this approach will constitute a major advance in the management of low back pain. Chronic patients who experience recurrent pain and disability after treatment are prone to seek additional care in the form of physiotherapy, medication, emergency department attendance, specialist consultation or spinal surgery. This model aims to maintain functional levels and reduce care-seeking empowering patients to self-manage their low back pain by offering them a contemporary patient-centred physical activity program with the support of mobile health technology. The outcomes of this trial will have immediate implications for clinical practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=367876">ACTRN12615000189527</ext-link> (26-02-2015).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Mobile health</kwd><kwd>Health coaching</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>It is well recognised that low back pain (LBP) is a significant public health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Relapses in pain (60&#x000a0;%) and work absences (33&#x000a0;%) are common, making LBP one of the most costly conditions in industrialised societies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The total cost associated with the management of chronic LBP in Australia is estimated at AU$9.17 billion, with the cost of indirect care and productivity losses contributing Ai1U$8.15 billion of this total figure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cost is expected to grow with the increasing obesity crisis and ageing population worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The clinical course of LBP is intricate. Over a 1-year after discharge from treatment, most patients will still have pain for a sustained period, and a small proportion will still have persistent severe pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although randomised controlled trials (RCT) investigating the efficacy of conservative interventions for chronic LBP have found improvements in pain and disability, patients usually exhibit a rapid decline in clinical outcomes, 3&#x000a0;months after treatment discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These patients are likely to have a new episode of LBP or continual pain and therefore seek additional health care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Previous research has shown that patients with chronic LBP who engage in moderate to high levels of physical activity have better prognosis in terms of pain, disability, and quality of life than those who fail to maintain adequate levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, ongoing adherence to such lifestyle behavior is difficult to achieve. Use of communication technologies to increase physical activity has become increasingly popular in recent years, likely because they facilitate access and adherence to health interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The use of physical activity monitors is particularly effective in increasing engagement in physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. New generations of activity monitors are affordable and provide feedback on daily steps taken and distance travelled using internet, tablet or Smartphone interfaces and social media. A recent systematic review provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of activity monitors such as pedometers to increase physical activity levels for patients with musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Additionally, physical activity monitors have been shown to not only improve physical activity levels, but also to increase function and reduce pain in patients with chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Another intervention that may be effective in improving adherence to exercise is health coaching. There is evidence that telephone-based health coaching interventions lead to positive changes in health behaviours. These include increased physical activity participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], improved nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and better management of chronic musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Coaching interventions have a strong, evidence-based foundation in behaviour-change theories such as Social Influence Theory, Social Cognitive Theory, and the Transtheoretical Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and can be effectively delivered by telephone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is evidence that health coaching via telephone has the potential to increase activity levels in patients with LBP when compared to usual physiotherapy care alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies of a post-treatment physical activity intervention consisting of mobile health and health coaching on long-term outcomes in patients with chronic LBP. Therefore, the primary aim of this RCT is to investigate the effec of a patient-centred physical activity intervention supported by health coaching and mHealth technology, including a mobile web app, tailored physical activity plan, goal setting, and feedback from affordable physical activity monitoring device (<italic>FitBit</italic>) in care-seeking, pain and disability in people with chronic LBP. Secondary outcomes will be physical activity participation and goal attainment. We hypothesise that the use of a patient-centred physical activity intervention will prevent clinical decline in patients who have received the benefits of conservative treatment for chronic LBP, empowering them to self-manage their LBP as well as to prevent worsening of LBP and reduce care seeking.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>We will conduct a single-blinded pilot RCT to evaluate a patient-centered physical activity intervention involving health coaching, compared to standard care (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

A senior physiotherapist from Liverpool Hospital will be responsible for booking potential participants on their second to last appointment to meet the investigator after discharge. At discharge, patients that agree to participate will be asked to sign the consent form. The assessor will collect demographic and anthropometric data (age, height, weight, waist circumference) as well as baseline data related to the study outcomes. A device able to accurately estimate how physically active a person is throughout the day (<italic>Actigraph</italic>) by measuring 3-dimensional body accelerations will be given to all participants at baseline with clear instructions for use and telephone support available.

Participants will also be advised to continue their usual activities. The physical activity intervention group will also receive an individualised patient-centred physical activity plan developed with the advice of a health coach. The focus of the patient-centred physical activity will be on a gradual increase in physical activity where participants will be encouraged to devise fortnightly goals to suit and advance their physical activity levels. This intervention will be supported by the use of mHealth, which will include a specifically designed mobile web application (web app) and a physical activity monitoring device (FitBit).</p><p>The intervention will address the following factors:</p><p><italic>Health coaching</italic>: This will involve an initial individual face-to-face coaching session. The session can take up to 2&#x000a0;hours and it will be held at the participants&#x02019; home. The health coach will be an experienced physiotherapist with a health coaching certification. Their aim will be to motivate and support the participants to increase their physical activity levels. The health coaching session will encompass:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Increasing physical activity: Participants will be assisted to develop a physical activity plan that suits their lifestyle preferences. The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines addressing healthy adults recommend at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate-intensity or 75&#x000a0;min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity. These recommendations relate not only to sports, but also to other leisure activities, work and transport activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Suitable local exercise opportunities will be identified using the NSW Ministry of Health&#x02019;s <italic>Active and Healthy</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] online database.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Decreasing sedentary behaviour: Participants will be encouraged to increase incidental physical activity throughout the day.

The health coach will jointly work with each participant to set short-term physical activity goals to be achieved fortnightly. The participants&#x02019; individual goals will be set taking into consideration the nature of LBP and its normal clinical course. Although the focus of the interaction between the coach and participants is not on symptom monitoring, if significant clinical decline (e.g. participants&#x02019; reports of nerve root compromise) is observed, coaches will advise participants to seek appropriate treatment. The health coach will aim to monitor their goals, giving them support and motivation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This health coaching service will be modelled after the successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] NSW Ministry of Health initiative <italic>Get Healthy</italic> service. After the first individual face-to-face coaching session, the health coach will contact each participant fortnightly (12 phone calls over a 6&#x000a0;month period each participant) to assess progress, update the participants&#x02019; short-term goals and assist in overcoming barriers &#x02013; e.g. how to get back to exercise after illness, and provide problem-solving strategies for maintaining physical activity.</p><p><italic>The Fitbit activity monitor and feedback device:</italic> The activity monitoring device will be provided to the participant by the health coach during the initial visit who will also demonstrate its use. Each participant will receive a brief orientation covering this instrument&#x02019;s proper functions. Telephone support will be offered to participants who have difficulty with the device setup. The <italic>Fitbit</italic> is a personal accelerometer device designed to track physical activity and sleep. This device logs individual data on physical activity and provides feedback on the number of steps taken in each 24-hour period; the distance walked daily; calories burned; and sleep duration and quality. The number of steps taken per day, week, and month are also summarised graphically on the device&#x02019;s website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fitbit.com/au">http://www.fitbit.com/au</ext-link>) or a Smartphone application, which will also be demonstrated to the participant.</p><p><italic>The IMPACT web app:</italic> The IMPACT web app: A mobile web app will be built and hosted by the University of Sydney. The app will be customised specifically for the purposes of this project to allow participants to monitor their goals and their physical activities. Participants will be able to access the app at any time and write reports about their physical activity related goals to their health coach as well as receive coach-tailored feedback. In addition, each participant will receive a quick questionnaire every week to monitor their pain levels, based on the Numerical Rating Scale; disability, based on the Rolland-Morris disability questionnaire and care-seeking associated with LBP. This questionnaire was created specifically to this project. The health coach will have the ability to view the participant&#x02019;s report and communicate with them by phone fortnightly to discuss their goals and update them according to their reports and feedback. Personalised messages constructed by the health coach will be sent every week to encourage participants to achieve their goals. In summary, the IMPACT web app will be designed to facilitate monitoring achievement and providing updates on participants&#x02019; goals, encouraging them to engage in physical activity and track potential adverse events.</p><p><italic>The standard care control group</italic> will receive the &#x02018;<italic>Make your move &#x02013; Sit less, be active for life!&#x02019;</italic> booklet and will be advised to work towards increasing their physical activity levels and achieving their two long-term goals as defined at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Primary outcomes will be collected at baseline and weekly over a period of 6&#x000a0;months of intervention through an online, self-reported electronic questionnaire, created by the research team.

Objectively measured physical activity will be assessed over a 7-day period using a matchbox-sized accelerometer (<italic>Actigraph</italic> GT3X+). Participants will be instructed to wear the accelerometer on the right hip, attached via an adjustable elastic belt, for seven consecutive days during waking hours (except during water activities or bathing). Activity counts per second will be collected at a sampling frequency of 30 Hz and reintegrated to 60-second epochs for data analysis. The mean counts/minute/day ActiGraph measure will be computed as the total counts accumulated in a valid day divided by the wear time of that day. To be considered as a valid day for analysis, ActiGraph wear time must include 10&#x000a0;h or more. Periods of 60-minutes or more of consecutive zeros (indicating non-use) will be considered as &#x0201c;off-time&#x0201d;.

Two long-term goals will be defined by the participant at trial entry GAS is a method used to evaluate interventions according to the attainment of a number of participant-specific goals. In effect, each participant has his/her own outcome measure but this is scored in a standardised way to allow proper statistical analysis. Traditional standardised measures include a standard set of tasks (items) each rated on a standard level. In GAS, tasks are individually identified to suit the participant, and the levels are individually set around their current and expected levels of performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. According to a recent systematic review, GAS delivers reliable and valid scores when employed as an outcome measure in working age and older people within a physical and neurological rehabilitation environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size for this trial was determined in order to detect a 2-point difference between groups on the pain intensity outcome measured by the Pain Numerical Rating Scale, assuming a standard deviation of 1.9 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. According to a study conducted by J. T. Farrar et al.

The coefficient of the group x time interactions will provide estimates of the effects of interventions over time. Between-group differences in mobility-related goal attainment, at 6&#x000a0;months after randomisation, will be analysed with ordinal regression. To aid interpretation of goal attainment, the scores will also be dichotomised (goal met versus goal not met), and odds ratios calculated. Accelerometer data will be processed using ActiLife 6 software. Acceptable wear time will be set a priori and defined as 4&#x000a0;days or more of 10&#x000a0;h or more per day. All analyses will be performed by intention-to-treat and blinded to treatment group. Potential covariates that will be investigated are baseline pain and disability levels, number of previous treatments, symptom duration, co-morbidities, age and socioeconomic status.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Process evaluation: qualitative study</title><p>Several face to face semi-structured interviews will be conducted with a minimum of 20 participants from the physical activity intervention group, at 1 and 6&#x000a0;months after study enrolment, in order to understand the experiences and attitudes of participants with regard to undertaking the intervention. Participants will be judgmental sampled to obtain a range of demographic data including gender, age and physical activity level. Participants will be interviewed about perceived advantages and disadvantages of the intervention, motivation, self-efficacy and confidence, beliefs about physical activity. The main facilitators and barriers of the intervention will be identified using thematic analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Ethics</title><p>The trial includes key methodological features to minimise bias in controlled trials: randomisation, concealed allocation, specification of eligibility criteria, blinded outcome assessment, blinded analysis, and intention-to-treat analysis. Data will be stored in spreadsheets and transferred to appropriate statistical software for analysis by an investigator blinded to group allocation. Spreadsheets will be regularly scrutinised for omissions and errors. Data will be stored and accessed as per the University of Sydney ethics requirements.</p><p>This protocol was registered at the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12615000189527) and was prospectively approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee from the South Western Sydney Local Health District (Local HREC reference 15/015).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Discussion</title><p>This RCT will represent a major advance in the field because it will investigate a new model of care to prevent clinical decline in patients who have received the benefits of conservative treatment for chronic LBP. Patients who experience recurrence of LBP after treatment are prone to seek additional care in the form of physiotherapy, medication, and attending emergency departments. This intervention aims to empower patients to self-manage their LBP as well as to prevent back pain recurrence, disability and reduce care seeking by offering patients a contemporary patient-centred physical activity program with the support of mHealth technology. This new model of care is based on a model used in a funded NHMRC trial combining physical activity promotion and fall prevention in older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] which is managed by co-investigator Tiedemann. This is an innovative approach of translating knowledge from health fields and a successful model will be translated to a population recovering from LBP that seeks care through public and health private systems. The impact on reducing the current yearly $1 billion treatment costs for LBP could be substantial. The outcomes of this program of research will have immediate clinical practice implications. If effective, this new model of care has the potential to be implemented in the management of other chronic conditions that would benefit from increased physical activity participation, such as osteoarthritis, heart disease and diabetes. The results of this trial will be published once the study is concluded.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>ABA, EP, MS, MLF, AT, MJ and PF were responsible for the design of the study.
