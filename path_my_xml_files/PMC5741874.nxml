The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is 70&#x02013;80% and a significant proportion of people affected develop chronic low back pain (CLBP). Besides a severe negative impact on people&#x02019;s health and health-related quality of life, CLBP is associated with substantial costs for society. Medical costs for the management of CLBP and costs for production losses due to absenteeism from work are sizeable. Pharmaceuticals, physical activity, manipulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions are examples of widely used treatments for CLBP.

In the World Health Organisation (WHO) study on the global burden of disease, low back pain accounted for close to 11% of the total number of years lived in disability (YLD), making low back pain the leading cause of YLD in the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The total cost of low back pain to society was estimated at &#x020ac;1 860 million in Sweden in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The indirect costs due to lost productivity were sizeable and accounted for 84% of the total cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Sweden, low back pain is the most common reason for granting sick leave for patients with musculoskeletal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The lifetime prevalence of low back pain is 70&#x02013;80% and a significant proportion of patients (10&#x02013;20%) develop chronic low back pain (CLBP) lasting for at least 3 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CLBP is associated with long-term pain, impaired function, and a severe negative impact on people&#x02019;s health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, CLBP is associated with substantial costs arising from within, but also outside, the health care sector. It is estimated that the total yearly cost for a patient with CLBP is SEK 227,000 within primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The indirect costs for production losses due to lost work days stood for about 85% of the total costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Health care systems should prioritise identifying effective and cost-effective treatment strategies to decrease the disease burden of CLBP.</p><p id="Par14">A wide range of treatment options exist in the treatment and management of CLBP. Different pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments, like physical activity, manipulation, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation interventions, are widely used alone or in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. According to a survey published in a report by the Swedish Agency for Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services (SBU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], treatments for acute back pain in Sweden are often given by physiotherapists, chiropractors or naprapaths. While all of these occupational groups provide information and advice to stay active, they usually combine different interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Physiotherapists typically also use different types of training and exercise in the treatment of acute back pain, than those used by chiropractors. For example, in the survey by SBU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], 69% of the physiotherapists stated that they frequently used &#x02018;circulation training&#x02019; as compared to 36% of chiropractors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Chiropractors and naprapaths also use forms of manual therapies that physiotherapists do not, in general, use. The results in the survey showed that 13% of the physiotherapists regularly used spinal manipulation whereas the corresponding figure for chiropractors was 96% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The report by SBU (2016) probably also reflects what occupational groups and treatments are involved in the treatment of patients with CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our study will further increase the knowledge on what treatments physiotherapists and chiropractors currently use for the treatment of CLBP in Sweden.</p><p id="Par15">The scientific basis to recommend the use of one treatment alternative over another is inadequate or limited and, therefore, more research is needed to study the effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] of treatments for CLBP. According to findings in systematic literature reviews, there is high-quality evidence that spinal manipulation is as effective as other therapies (exercise therapy, standard medical care or physiotherapy) in reducing pain and improving function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there is low-to-moderate evidence for (motor control) exercise to be clinically important, when compared to minimal intervention, and there is moderate-to-good evidence that motor control exercises have similar outcomes as other exercises and manual therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is moderate evidence that multidisciplinary treatments are more likely to have less pain and disability for patients compared to patients receiving usual care or physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, SBU (2015) stated in a comment that the results in Kamper et al. (2015) were uncertain and maybe due to publication bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">In a previous pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT) in Sweden, Skargren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] compared the outcomes and costs of chiropractic care and physiotherapy as a primary treatment for patients with back and neck pain over a 1-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. No difference in costs and outcomes were demonstrated for the total population. However, subgroup analyses showed that patients with acute, uncomplicated back pain gained more from chiropractic care at a similar cost, whereas patients with chronic back pain gained more from physiotherapy with a slightly reduced cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Niemisto et al. (2003) found that a combined intervention (advice, physiotherapy, and spinal manipulation) was more effective in reducing pain and disability than a physician consultation alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There were no significant differences in costs between the treatment groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a follow-up study 2 years later, it was indicated that a physician consultation was cost-effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A cost-effectiveness study conducted alongside a RCT, concluded that spinal manipulation was a cost-effective addition to &#x02018;best care&#x02019; for back pain in general practice, but also found that manipulation alone probably was cost-effective compared with manipulation followed by exercise in a UK setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">With limited health care resources and stretched health care budgets, it is important to strive for efficient use of scarce resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Economic evaluation is a method for assessing costs and effectiveness of alternative ways of allocating resources to assist decisions aimed at improving efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It also constitutes an important input for guiding clinical decisions. To be useful for decision-makers as an input to improve decision-making on the societal efficiency of the allocation of health care resources, it is important that the economic evaluation is based on a societal perspective, including costs both within (e.g. costs for pharmaceuticals, and costs for hospital and ambulatory care) and outside (e.g. indirect costs for decreased labour production) the health care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In economic evaluations it is common to carry out cost-effectiveness analyses, where costs are measured in monetary terms and effectiveness in non-monetary terms. In this type of analysis, where the aim is to maximise the health gains for a specific cost constraint, it is crucial to use an outcome measure that combines effects on quality and quantity of life into one measure. The most commonly used measure of this sort is the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This type of outcome measure is also recommended by, e.g. the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in England and Wales, and by the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Economic evaluation can be used to guide resource allocation decisions on which (if any) treatments for CLBP should be recommended. To achieve valid and reliable cost-effectiveness results in the area of CLBP the economic evaluation should be conducted alongside a RCT designed to reflect the clinical situation to which the decision is being applied and with a sufficient follow-up period carried out in well-defined study populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. This opens up the possibility to perform the economic evaluation based on data characterised by both high internal and external validity. A limitation of conducting an economic evaluation alongside a RCT is that the sample size is usually determined based on primary clinical endpoints in the trial. This implies that the power to detect different hypothesised cost-effectiveness results may be low. However, by using the net benefit approach, it is possible to investigate the power in a cost-effectiveness study that is implied by the given sample size in the RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. An advantage of using a so-called pragmatic RCT as a basis for the economic evaluation is that patient-level trial data provide an unbiased estimate of the effectiveness of interventions as reflected in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In addition, the RCT provides an opportunity for collecting data on the resources used to estimate costs and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Currently, there are no clinical guidelines in Sweden on which treatment option should be used for CLBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This reflects a lack of knowledge on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different treatment strategies for CLBP in a Swedish context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, it is important to increase this knowledge. This is central for government agencies and county councils to be able to produce evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to use for CLBP.</p><p id="Par20">In Sweden, patients with low back pain are often treated by either chiropractors or physiotherapists. Sometimes patients are treated by chiropractors and physiotherapists in collaboration. Besides providing general information and advice, these occupational groups usually recommend exercise (mostly recommended by physiotherapists) and manual therapies (mostly recommended by chiropractors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. These treatment alternatives are also recommended in guidelines in different parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. As noted above, although a wide range of treatments exist for CLBP, the scientific basis to recommend the use of one treatment alternative over another is limited. There is, therefore, a need for well-designed clinical trials investigating both the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments for CLBP. Cost-effectiveness studies may provide valuable information on whether it is good value for money to use treatments and examinations provided by chiropractors and/or physiotherapists, in addition to only providing information and advice. Information both about the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness of treatments for CLBP is crucial for decisions aiming at improving the efficiency in the allocation of limited resources for the treatment of CLBP. The results from our study will improve the basis for health care decision-making and policy recommendations and should be considered when producing and updating evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to use for CLBP.</p><p id="Par21">The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness (back pain-related functional limitation, back pain intensity, general health, HRQoL, and working status), costs (medical costs and costs for production losses) and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and physiotherapy when added to information and advice in the treatment of patients with non-specific CLBP in Sweden.</p><p id="Par22">Research questions:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par23">How do chiropractic care and physiotherapy, chiropractic care, or physiotherapy, when added to information and advice, impact outcomes (back pain-related functional limitation, back pain intensity, general health, HRQoL, and working status) as compared with only information and advice?</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Which (if any) of chiropractic care and physiotherapy, chiropractic care, or physiotherapy, when added to information and advice, is a cost-effective treatment strategy when compared to each other, and when compared with only information and advice?</p></list-item></list>

The reasons for a pragmatic design are to reflect clinical practice and to limit per-protocol effects on the outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Each participant&#x02019;s treatment is at the discretion of the individual chiropractor and/or physiotherapist. In Sweden, there are no official guidelines that define what those treatments typically include or how many sessions are standard. This study protocol has followed the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Guidelines (Additional&#x000a0;file&#x02009;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).

If needed, additional units will be included. The operations manager for each PCRU has signed a written certificate to assure that they will provide sufficient resources to both carry out the study and guarantee the safety of the participants. The PCRUs are reimbursed through the Stockholm County Council. Twelve PCRUs in the Stockholm County Council were initially informed about the study by email and invited to participate. For each of the six PCRUs interested in participating, an information meeting was scheduled. Before the start of the study each PCRU was informed about the study methods in more detail and given the opportunity to give feedback on how to improve the efficiency in the recruitment of participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Characteristics of participants</title><p id="Par27">The study includes individuals aged between 18 to 60 years, who are willing to participate in any of the included treatment groups (&#x02018;information and advice&#x02019;; &#x02018;physiotherapy, and information and advice&#x02019;; &#x02018;chiropractic care, and information and advice&#x02019;; or &#x02018;chiropractic care, physiotherapy, and information and advice&#x02019;). All patients give written informed consent. The inclusion and exclusion of study participants is done to mimic the clinical praxis of Swedish primary health care, where the first patient contact usually takes place by phone. Inclusion criteria are: pain located below the costal margin and above the inferior gluteal folds, reoccurring low back pain for at least 3 months, age between 18 to 60 years, can stand or walk independently, and being Swedish speaking and literate. Exclusion criteria are: pain attributable to a known specific pathology (e.g. pain related to tumours, fractures, or fibromyalgia), lack of written informed consent, pregnancy or less than 6 months postpartum or post weaning, been treated for low back pain by a chiropractor and/or physiotherapist in the previous 1 month.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment procedures</title><p id="Par28">All participants are recruited through the PCRUs. Individuals with low back pain who contact the PCRU by phone are informed about the study and invited to participate. For individuals who are willing to participate (orally informed consent is given), and who meet the eligibility criteria (assessed by a primary health care staff member), a first (baseline) visit is scheduled at the PCRU. Information about the study will also be sent by email to the participants, after the phone contact and before the first PCRU visit. During the first visit to the PCRU, the participants sign a letter of informed consent before the treatment starts. At each PCRU two study coordinators (chiropractor and physiotherapist) are responsible for the enrolment of participants. Being a pragmatic RCT, there are no criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions, or improving adherence for a given trial participant. There is also no relevant concomitant care or intervention permitted or prohibited during the trial. The patients have the option to withdraw from the study at any point in time.</p><p id="Par29">The recruitment of participants needs to be carefully monitored for each PCRU without any interaction between researchers and potential study participants. Throughout the study, the study coordinators at each PCRU will be contacted by the first author (FG) on a weekly basis about the enrolment of participants and the recruitment rate. During the start of the study (first 4 weeks) FG also assesses whether the information made available to each PCRU is clear regarding study methods and recruitment procedures. If needed, the information about study methods and recruitment procedures will be updated and clarified. After potential amendments, all PCRUs will continue the recruitment of participants according to the updated procedures. Additionally, FG will meet all the study coordinators on a monthly basis to review and gain feedback on the enrolment procedures and the recruitment rate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par30">Each PCRU will continue to include subjects until the required total number of subjects (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;600) is achieved (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). All patients who give informed consent and who fulfil the eligibility criteria will be randomised. Participants are randomised to one of four treatments: &#x02018;information and advice&#x02019;; &#x02018;physiotherapy, and information and advice&#x02019;; &#x02018;chiropractic care, and information and advice&#x02019;; or &#x02018;chiropractic care, physiotherapy, and information and advice&#x02019;. A computer-generated, block randomisation list is produced to allocate participants to the treatment wings. The randomisation list and the allocation sequence are generated by a statistician who is not involved in the study. The sequence is concealed from the researchers involved in enrolling and assessing participants by using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. All researchers involved in the study will be blinded to block size(s) and randomisation list. Thus, the researchers do not know the block size(s) or if there is only one block size or different block sizes. This information (about block size(s) and randomisation list) is only known by the independent statistician who is not involved in the trial. The randomisation list will be in the possession of the statistician for the duration of the study. Envelopes will only be opened when it is time to allocate the intervention.

Both direct and indirect costs will be estimated. Direct costs include costs for pharmaceuticals, health care visits, clinical examinations, and hospital days. Information about each participant&#x02019;s resource consumption is collected by using a computer-based questionnaire. At each follow-up occasion (at baseline, and at 3, 6, and 12 months after baseline) the participant is asked to recall their resource consumption during the last 3 months (quantities of resource consumption is, e.g. number of prescriptions, number of visits to health care providers, number of clinical examinations, and number of hospital days).

The average number of QALYs during 12 months is calculated as the area under the curve during 12 months. A treatment is defined as cost-effective if the treatment is less costly while providing the same or better health outcomes, or if the added cost of the treatment is reasonable in comparison to the health outcomes obtained, in which case the incremental cost per gained QALY is estimated. An intervention is in the latter case defined as cost-effective if the cost per QALY gained is below or equal to a threshold value corresponding to how much society is willing to pay in order to gain a QALY. Different threshold values for a QALY have been used in cost-effectiveness studies and the value has usually been set to around US$50,000 (corresponding to approximately SEK 400,000 using the average exchange rate during 2016 of 1 US$&#x02009;=&#x02009;SEK 8.6). However, Neumann et al. (2014) argue for using a threshold value of either US$100,000 or 150,000 for a QALY and that a threshold value of US$50,000 should be interpreted as a lower boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. If the threshold value of a QALY is derived from the literature on the value of a statistical life, even higher threshold values are derived (US$100,000&#x02013;400,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In Sweden, the Swedish Transport Administration (STA) uses a value of a statistical life of SEK 24 million in cost-benefit analysis of road investments. Using this figure, a value per QALY gained of about SEK 950,000 can be derived (US$110,000). In our study, we define an intervention to be cost-effective if the cost per gained QALY is equal to or below SEK 900,000 (US$100,000).</p><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis will be reported in accordance with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] and good research practices on how to conduct cost-effectiveness analysis alongside clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

An expectation bias may work in both directions depending on whether patient expectations and beliefs are positive (placebo effect) or negative (nocebo effect). We have not included any questions to measure patient expectations and beliefs before the treatment starts, which implies that we cannot estimate the potential expectation bias. On the other hand, which is a strength of the study, the results from our pragmatic RCT will reflect real effects for patients with CLBP in a primary care setting. Some patients do not always feel that they will get the treatment they would prefer, which may also affect the outcome of the treatment in clinical practice. Another limitation is the follow-up period in the trial, which is 1 year. Ideally, we would like to have a 2-year follow-up to be able to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of chiropractic care and physiotherapy in the long run.</p><p id="Par63">CLBP is a severe public health problem associated with substantial costs for society. Although a wide range of treatment options exist for CLBP, the scientific basis to recommend the use of one treatment alternative over another is limited. The results from our study will improve the basis for health care decision-making and policy recommendations on how to use limited health care resources to improve health for people suffering from CLBP in Sweden. Our findings should be considered when producing and updating evidence-based guidelines and recommendations on which treatment strategies to use for CLBP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par64">Protocol version 1: 9 July 2017.
