The aim of this study was to assess if prior XRT is associated with worse outcomes following AWR for hernia or oncologic resection.</p><p><bold>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</bold> This was a retrospective study that included all consecutive patients who underwent complex AWR using acellular dermal matrix (ADM) at a single centre. We performed propensity score analysis for risk adjustment in multivariable analysis and for one-to.one matching.</p><p><bold>RESULTS:</bold> There were 511 patients who underwent AWR with ADM for repair of a complex hernia and/or oncologic resection. One hundred thirty (25%) patients underwent XRT prior to AWR and 381 (75%) patients did not undergo XRT. With a mean follow-up of 30.0 months, a greater percentage of XRT AWR patients underwent flap reconstruction (14.6% vs 5.0%, p&#x0003c;0.001), whereas fewer underwent component separation (61.5% vs 71.4%, p=0.036) compared with non-XRT AWR patients. Both groups had similar rates of hernia recurrence (8.5% vs 9.4%) and surgical site occurrence (25.4% vs 23.4%). When the treatment method was adjusted for the propensity score, these results persisted. There were no differences in hernia recurrence, surgical site occurrence, and wound healing complication rates.</p><p><bold>CONCLUSIONS:</bold> Contrary to our hypothesis, previous XRT does not adversely affect outcomes in abdominal wall reconstruction. Surgeons should be aware of the higher likelihood of needing a flap for skin replacement when performing AWR in the setting of XRT.</p></body></article>
