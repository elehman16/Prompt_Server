patterns of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) on chronic stroke patients&#x02019;
dynamic balance ability. [Subjects and Methods] In total, 30 stroke patients participated
in this study, and they were assigned randomly and equally to an experimental group and a
control group. The experimental group received exercise treatment for 30&#x02005;min and ramp gait
training with PNF for 30&#x02005;min. The control group received exercise treatment for 30&#x02005;min and
ground gait training for 30&#x02005;min. The interventions were conducted in 30&#x02005;min sessions,
three times per week for four week. The subjects were assessed with the Berg balance scale
test, timed up and go test, and functional reach test before and after the experiment and
the results were compared. [Results] After the intervention, the BBS and FRT values had
significantly increased and the TUG value had significantly decreased in the experimental
group; however, the BBS, FRT, and TUG values showed no significant differences in the
control group. In addition, differences between the two groups before the intervention and
after the intervention were not significant. [Conclusion] In conclusion, ramp gait
training with PNF improved stroke patients&#x02019; dynamic balance ability, and a good outcome of
ramp gait training with PNF is also expected for other neurological system disease
patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Proprioception</kwd><kwd>Ramp gait</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients have difficulty with balance and postural adjustments and increased
postural sway. They also shift the center of gravity to the non-paretic lower limb causing
asymmetric posture, decreased body balance, and reduced weight movement ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The balance ability of hemiplegic patients
suffering from stroke is the most important factor for them and their family members, and
its improvement is the most important goal of rehabilitation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>An active functional recovery treatment program for stroke patients is ramp gait training.
A ramp is provided as a measure to prevent the risk of a fall, and as a rehabilitation
program after injury, it is used as a substitute for stairs<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. A ramp is an essential facility for those who have difficulty with
movement, such as the disabled who cannot use stairs, and elderly people and pregnant women
who cannot move about freely<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study
of ramp use characteristics of healthy adults, Yun et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that increases in angle height led to increased muscle
activity in the lower limb muscles. Yi and Kim<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that increased ramp height in treadmill training resulted in
increased gait speed, and in a study of stroke patients Hesse et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that slope training using a treadmill improved
their stride and gait speed.</p><p>A method of enhancing stroke patients&#x02019; balance ability is proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation (PNF)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. PNF improves the
functions of proprioceptors by stimulating them in the muscles and tendons. It also
increases muscle strength, flexibility, and balance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and enhances coordination<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is effective at eliciting the maximal responses of motor units.
Based on theoretical grounds, this study examined the effects of ramp gait training with the
PNF technique, which is an effective therapy for the muscle strengthening and retraining
necessary for the independent gait of hemiplegic patients, as well as for stroke patients&#x02019;
balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted from August 20 to September 30, 2014 in K hospital located in
Daegu Metropolitan City. The criteria for inclusion were: chronic stroke patients who were
diagnosed as having stroke resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage using magnetic resonance
imaging or computed tomography, whose onset of stroke was at least six months or longer
ability to maintain an independent standing posture for 30&#x02005;s or longer; the ability to walk
30&#x02005;m or longer alone indoors; the ability to communicate enough and to understand oral
instructions given by the therapist; and patients who were not using assistive devices or
receiving drug therapy of internal medicine for the alleviation of spasticity. The subjects
voluntarily agreed to participate in this study, and a written agreement was obtained from
them. This study was approved by the University institutional review board and was conducted
in accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The total number
of subjects was 30 and they were assigned randomly and equally to a control group and an

participated in this study.</p><p>A physical therapist with clinical experience of more than one year conducted the muscle
strengthening exercise, range of motion exercise, and stretching exercise, for all subjects.
The control group received PNF gait pattern training by the therapist, wherein they walked
back and forth over 10&#x02005;m. This exercise was conducted for 30&#x02005;min three times per week for
four weeks. The experimental group conducted flexion of the knee joint of the paretic side
and flexion, adduction, and external rotation of the hip joint of the paretic side. The
therapist held the ankle and anterior medial part of the knee of the experimental group and
directed, &#x0201c;Raise your ankle and flex the lower limb up the diagonal line&#x0201d;. The experimental
group moved their paretic lower limb joint to the end of the range of motion at the same
time, and to provide the appropriate resistance, the therapist with the right hand placed on
the knee joint applied force to the lateral part of the knee and applied resistance to the
adduction and external rotation of the hip joint with the other hand<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the
subjects exhibited rapid fatigue, respiratory problems, or dizziness during training, the
training was stopped immediately and for safety, careful observation and assistance
followed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The experimental group received training on a specially devised ramp whose angle of
inclination, length, and width were 10&#x000b0;, 10 m, and 0.8 m, respectively, for 30&#x02005;min per day.
Gait training involving traveling back and forth over 10&#x02005;m was conducted three times per
week for four weeks. The subjects received PNF lower extremity gait pattern training with
the help of a physical therapist in front of the ramp gait-training device. The training
method was the same as that for the control group. When the subjects exhibited rapid
fatigue, respiratory problems, or dizziness during training, the training was stopped
immediately and for safety, careful observation and assistance were followed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The BBS test is used to evaluate the balance of elderly people and neurological disease
patients. It is a functional test that simply evaluates three aspects within a short time,
such as postural maintenance, postural adjustment by voluntary movement, and reaction to
external perturbation<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has high
intra-rater reliability, inter-rater reliability, and internal validity<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS test consists of 14 items and each item is scored
from zero to four points, giving a maximum possible total score of 56 points. When a subject
performs the evaluation items independently or within a fixed time, four points are
given<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The TUG test is a method of evaluating functional motions, including dynamic balance and
gait ability. A subject stands, walks 3&#x02005;m back and forth, and sits down in the original
spot. It can test functional movement in a simple and swift manner. The TUG test measures
the time taken to stand from a sitting posture, walk 3&#x02005;m and return, and sit down in the
chair. In this study, it was performed three times and the average value was calculated and
recorded. When the time taken is 30&#x02005;s or longer, the subject has an unstable movement
ability, is dependent, and cannot walk outdoors independently. Because the measurement
method is simple, it can be easily performed by hemiplegic patients with lower limb
disability, and it has a high reliability<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. FRT is used to evaluate the stability limit and is also a
measurement of dynamic balance ability. The measurement method involves subjects standing at
a 10&#x02005;cm distance from a wall on a flat floor, spreading their feet shoulder-width apart in a
comfortable standing posture, extending the elbows, flexing the shoulders to 90 degrees,
moving the body forward to a maximal extent using the ankle joints only, stretching the body
in parallel to a maximal extent, and the distance the end of the middle finger tip has moved
is measured<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows. To test of the significance
of differences in the results before and after the experiment, the paired t-test was
conducted. The independent t-test was performed to test the significance of differences
between the groups, before and after the experiment. A statistical significance level of &#x003b1; =
0.05 was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>After the intervension, the experimental group BBS and FRT values had significantly

on hemiplegic patients&#x02019; balance ability. Stroke patients have difficulty with gait due to
unstable standing balance, the weakening of muscle tone, and abnormal muscular contraction
timing<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the shift of
much weight onto the non-paretic side lower limb restricts their physical activity because
of asymmetric support, stroke patients and decreases weight movement ability<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, decreases in dynamic balance
ability reduce ability to respond appropriately to environmental changes and diverse tasks,
and dynamic balance ability is closely related to gait ability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results show that after the intervention, the
experimental group&#x02019;s BBS and FRT values had significantly increased, and its TUG value had
significantly decreased; however, the control group&#x02019;s BBS, FRT, and TUG value significant
differences. In addition, there was no significant difference between the two groups after
the intervention. This is because the proprioceptive senses of the ankle joints are
stimulated more during gait on a ramp than during gait on the ground, or because when
flexion of the ankle joints takes place on a ramp, the body&#x02019;s forward and vertical movements
occur and balance ability is required to counterbalance the force generated by the lower
limbs and align the body.</p><p>In one experiment, chronic hemiplegic patients were divided into a proprioceptive sense
training group and a visual feedback training group, and the proprioceptive sense group&#x02019;s
BBS score increased<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Bohannon and
Lusardi<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported BBS scores increased
with age in a proprioceptive training group. In a study by Hwang<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, BBS and TUG values of hemiplegic patients, for whom
proprioceptive stimulation was performed, were significantly greater than those of a visual
feedback group. Geiger et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> divided
the subjects into a proprioceptive training group and a control group, and reported the TUG
time of the proprioceptive training group decreased from 23.08&#x02005;s to 14.62 s. Lee et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted PNF lower limb pattern training
for four weeks using elderly people divided into an elastic band group and a control group,
and reported the PNF group&#x02019;s FRT values were statistically significantly different; a result
which is consistent with the present study results.</p><p>In the present study, the balance ability of hemiplegic patients who received ramp gait
training with the PNF technique significantly improved. This study provides important
material for clinicians. It confirms balance recovery through the PNF technique in
rehabilitation training owing to the manual treatment effect based on Dietz&#x02019;s
principles<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. If composite gait
training including diverse double tasks is conducted rather than mere lower extremity
pattern training with PNF, it should lead to better functional improvement in the gait
ability of stroke patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This Research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2015.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Eng</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Reliability and comparison of weight-bearing ability
