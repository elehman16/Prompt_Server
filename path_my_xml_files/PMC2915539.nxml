This decision was based, in part, on the results of several large, international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trials of either six or 12 months&#x02019; duration that had been undertaken in COPD patients. Roflumilast 500 &#x003bc;g daily improved lung function and reduced exacerbations in patients with more severe COPD, especially those with chronic bronchitis, frequent exacerbations, or who required frequent rescue inhaler therapy in the placebo-controlled trials. It also improved lung function and reduced exacerbations in patients with moderately severe COPD treated with salmeterol or tiotropium. Advantages of roflumilast over inhaler therapy are that it is an oral tablet and only needs to be taken once daily. While taking roflumilast, the most common adverse effects patients experienced were gastrointestinal upset and headache. Weight loss, averaging 2.2 kg, occurred in patients treated with roflumilast. Patients taking roflumilast were more likely to drop out of the trials than patients in the control groups. Patients who discontinued therapy usually did so during the first few weeks and were more likely to have experienced gastrointestinal side effects. Roflumilast is the first selective phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor and will offer physicians another treatment option for patients with more severe COPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>roflumilast</kwd><kwd>phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>exacerbation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most common cause of death in the US and is also a major cause of morbidity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-4-147">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-4-147">2</xref> Lung parenchymal destruction, ie, emphysema, and obstructive bronchiolitis are the typical pathologic changes in COPD and are characterized functionally by progressive airway obstruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-4-147">1</xref> Inflammatory changes and mucus gland hyperplasia in the larger airways may also occur, and are accompanied by chronic cough and mucus hypersecretion.

A concern with these data is that the statistical significance for most inflammatory endpoint measures was driven by placebo and this may have overestimated the magnitude of the anti-inflammatory effect produced.

In particular, the incidence of insomnia, anxiety, and depression was two to three times higher in the 500 &#x003bc;g roflumilast-treated group when compared with placebo. A potentially significant cause for concern was that of the 12054 patients in the roflumilast COPD database, three completed suicides (all in males) were reported in those patients given roflumilast compared with none in patients taking placebo. It is noteworthy that none of these individuals had a prior history of depression. There were also two suicide attempts (both in females). However, in these cases both individuals had prior psychiatric histories (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Pulmonary-AllergyDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM207377.pdf">www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Pulmonary-AllergyDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM207377.pdf</ext-link>).</p><p>Another potential serious adverse event was cancer.

The significance of this observation is unclear. If roflumilast is carcinogenic, one might expect a greater than one-year latency period before tumors develop.

Important advantages are that it avoids many drug interactions, narrow therapeutic index of theophylline, and the need for regular blood level monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-dddt-4-147">38</xref> Potential disadvantages are that it is not a bronchodilator, lacks the clinical track record of a drug used for over 70 years, and the cost of a new drug versus an older generic medication.</p><p>Compared with ICSs, a potential advantage of combining roflumilast with long-acting bronchodilators is the ease of taking a pill once daily rather than having to be able to use an inhaler properly, and which needs to be taken twice daily. Roflumilast is not related to an increased risk of pneumonia or other adverse affects associated with ICSs use, such as osteoporosis, glaucoma, cataracts, and skin thinning. However, roflumilast is associated with other adverse effects, including weight loss and a greater risk of discontinuation of therapy whether given alone, or with short- and/or long-acting bronchodilators.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-dddt-4-147">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-dddt-4-147">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-dddt-4-147">68</xref> Moreover, serious adverse events include an apparently higher incidence of neuropsychiatric abnormalities and of certain cancers. In this respect, it is salient that in January 2010 Forest Laboratories submitted to the FDA a new indication for roflumilast together with associated labeling changes and a warning regarding neuropsychiatric events. The revised indication for roflumilast is for the &#x0201c;maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) associated with chronic bronchitis in patients at risk of exacerbations&#x0201d; and is more restrictive than broad maintenance treatment of COPD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Pulmonary-AllergyDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM207377.pdf">www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/Pulmonary-AllergyDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM207377.pdf</ext-link>). In April 2010, the Pulmonary-Allergy Drugs Advisory Committee (PADAC) convened by the FDA voted by 10 votes to five against approving roflumilast for the treatment of COPD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.medscape.com/viewarticle/720010">www.medscape.com/viewarticle/720010</ext-link>). Although the PADAC believe roflumilast to be safe and modestly effective, it seems likely that this negative outcome reflects a concern that the potential adverse events outweigh the modest improvements in lung function. However, on 22 April 2010, the European Medicines Agency Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use adopted an opposite stance to PADAC and recommended the granting of a marketing authorization for roflumilast. The approved indication is for the &#x0201c;&#x02026; maintenance treatment of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, FEV<sub>1</sub> post-bronchodilator less than 50% predicted) associated with chronic bronchitis in adult patients with a history of frequent exacerbations as add-on to bronchodilator treatment&#x0201d; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/opinion/Daxas_15986110en.pdf">www.ema.europa.eu/pdfs/human/opinion/Daxas_15986110en.pdf</ext-link>). A final decision by the FDA is expected in May 2010 after negotiations with Forest. Regardless of the outcome of those talks, in the European Union at least, after more than 20 years of development, roflumilast will become the first class PDE4 inhibitor for the treatment of COPD and will provide physicians with another treatment option for patients with more severe disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors were solely responsible for the content and writing of the review.

the trial. Post-FEV<sub>1</sub> refers to the mean change in postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> at the end of the trial. SGRQ refers to change in mean St George Respiratory Question Score at the end of the treatment period. A reduction in score represents an improvement. Dropouts represent the percentage of patients that did not complete the treatment period. For each study, the first percentage represents the percentage of subjects in the roflumilast treatment arm that did not complete the study and the second percentage represents dropouts in the placebo arm. In each study, a greater percentage dropped out of the roflumilast treatment arms. The exacerbation rate refers to the number of moderate and severe exacerbations, exacerbation rate per patient, or the percentage of patients experiencing exacerbations during the study. In each case, the first number represents the roflumilast arm and the second the placebo arm of the studies. The next row contains the average difference in weight loss between the placebo arm and the treatment arms. In the three studies reporting weight loss, patients receiving roflumilast lost an average of slightly more than 2 kg more than the placebo-treated patients (N/A, data are not available). The last three rows represent the percentages of patients reporting diarrhea, nausea, and headache. In each case, the first percentage represents the percentage of patients reporting the side effect in the roflumilast arm and the second represents the percentage reporting the side effect in the placebo arm.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></floats-group></article>
