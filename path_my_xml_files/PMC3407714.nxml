The prognostic algorithm was used to interrogate genomic data from a series of patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. Those genes associated with outcome in the adjuvant treatment setting, independent to prognosis were used to train an algorithm able to classify a patient as either a responder or non-responder to ACT. The performance of this signature was independently validated on a separate series of genomic profiles from patients enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of cisplatin/vinorelbine <italic>vs.</italic> observation alone (JBR.10).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>NSCLC patients exhibiting the high-risk, poor-prognosis form of the 160-gene prognosis signature experienced a 2.80-times higher rate of 5-year disease specific death (log rank P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) compared to those with the low-risk, good prognosis profile, adjusted for covariates.

While disease stage is associated with outcome and commonly used to determine adjuvant treatment eligibility, it is known that a subset of patients with early stage disease experience shorter survival times than others with the same clinicopathological characteristics. Improved methods for identifying these individuals, at or near the time of their initial diagnosis, may support a decision to pursue an increased frequency of screening or use of adjuvant therapy options. The ultimate goal of this work is to provide a tool for generating personalized assessments of prognosis and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) response, particularly for patients with early stage disease, in order to reduce the rate of over and under treatment in NSCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Subramanian and Simon recently compared 16 studies describing the development of prognostic gene expression signatures for NSCLC, published between 2002 and 2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. A standard set of assessment criteria was applied to each, including an evaluation of study design and statistical analysis methods, and whether the signature demonstrated an improvement over existing methods of prognosis. The study concluded that none of the expression signatures could demonstrate a significant improvement over a clinical formula based on the age and tumor size, and thus were not useful for clinical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Heterogeneity of response to ACT significantly confounds treatment for patients with NSCLC. As such, methods are needed to avoid unnecessary treatment in patients unlikely to respond, despite satisfying the current treatment guidelines for a given agent or combination of agents. Clinical trials conducted by multiple groups have shown a potential benefit of cisplatin-based ACT for individuals with completely resected tumors, ranging from a 4-15&#x02009;% survival benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Unfortunately no significant benefit for patients with stage I NSCLC has been observed to date, and as such the standard of care for these patients is surgery and observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In a uniquely designed, randomized controlled clinical trial, Zhu et al. identified 15 genes which stratify patients into groups distinguished by a significant difference in both outcome and adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While the prognostic ability of the 15-gene algorithm was independently validated using a previously published series of NSCLC patients, only internal cross-validation results were presented to verify the signatures ability to predict response to ACT. While a correctly conducted cross-validation approach may give an initial unbiased estimate of classifier accuracy, predictive algorithm validation using at least one external, independent patient series is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Analysis of data from patients not used in the gene selection and/or algorithm training allows assessment of the impact of &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; technical and biological variation on the performance of a novel multi-gene assay.</p><p>Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop and validate complimentary algorithms for (i) stratifying stage I-II NSCLC patients into categories with significant differences in disease-specific survival (DSS) and (ii) stratifying stage I-III patients on the basis of cisplatin-based ACT-benefit, defined as treatment-related change in DSS. The analytical guidelines proposed by Subramanian and Simon were followed closely throughout, in order to maximize the clinical relevance of the novel algorithms developed. Finally, it was hypothesized that prognosis and sensitivity to ACT agents may represent independent characteristics of NSCLC. If this were to be the case, patients with good or bad prognosis may be equally likely to possess the molecular characteristics required for ACT-induced tumor cell death, requiring separate but complimentary algorithms for the optimal prediction of prognosis and treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Compilation of a genomic database for gene selection &#x00026; algorithm training</title><p>Genomic and clinical data from 420 patients who were originally part of The Director&#x02019;s Challenge Consortium for Molecular Classification of Lung Adenocarcinoma (DCC) series (total N&#x02009;=&#x02009;442) were used to identify two sets of genes associated with (a) disease-specific survival (DSS) and (b) response to ACT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].

These patients were compiled from five previously published studies, as described in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> (Validation Series A). After annotating the gene expression data from each series of patients with UniGene annotations, it was determined that two of the microarray platforms present in the combined series did not contain features that corresponded to all 160 genes that were identified from Training Series A. The Affymetrix U95A microarray used by Bhattacharjee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] contained 132/160 (83&#x02009;%) of the genes while the custom Agilent format used by Takeuchi et al.

Rather than impute missing values using a k-NN method for example, it was decided to compute the prognostic score using the signature genes that were available. In this way the validation performed reflects conditions that may occur in real world use of such a multi-gene assay, in which variations in specimen preparation and microarray fabrication may lead to one or more missing data points per signature.</p><p>Of the 264 Stage I-II NSCLC patients in Validation Series A, 174 (66&#x02009;%) patients were assigned to the low risk (good prognosis) category and 90 (34&#x02009;%) to the high-risk (poor prognosis) category.

Two multi-gene algorithms have been developed to predict DSS and ACT benefit, using a previously published multi-center series of lung adenocarcinoma gene expression profiles. The 160 gene prognostic and 37 gene predictive gene sets identified by this study overlap by a single gene, SPSB3<italic>,</italic> but no functional ontologies or molecular pathways were found to be in common. SPSB3 is a largely uncharacterized gene not previously linked to NSCLC but in this study found to be associated with good prognosis and benefit from ACT. Several gene ontologies significantly represented by the 160 and 37 gene signatures have been linked to prognosis or ACT efficacy, including MAPK-pathway regulation, apoptosis, membrane transport and metabolic activity.</p><p>The prognostic and predictive signatures developed in this study differ from previously published methods in a number of key areas. Both were developed from NSCLC datasets comprised of a single histological subtype (NSCLC), using multivariate methods of gene selection on a large, well annotated training series originally designed to meet statistical sample-size requirements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The methods developed in this study satisfy the Subramanian and Simon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] criteria for evaluating NSCLC prognosis signatures (reproduced and annotated in Additional file 1). These include description of relevant patient characteristics (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), no presentation of cross-validation statistics as the only performance metrics and the ability to apply the signature to other data for future comparisons and other non-clinical uses (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ChipDX.com">http://www.ChipDX.com</ext-link>). Finally, the 160-gene prognosis signature has been shown to stratify stage IA, IB and II patients into groups with significant differences in RFS independent of clinical covariates.</p><p>The 160-gene prognostic signature was the single strongest predictor of outcome in patients with stage I disease when evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis (HR: 2.80, P&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;0.0001). Furthermore, as shown by the comparison of ROC data and also in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C-E, the genomic method appears to be superior to other methods at identifying high-risk stage I patients, <italic>i.e.</italic> those at risk of death within 24&#x02009;months. This may allow clinicians to recommend increased screening or the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients not otherwise considered eligible.</p><p>By evaluating the performance of the 160-gene prognosis signature on a multi-platform multi-center validation series, it has effectively been &#x02018;stress-tested&#x02019; under conditions resembling real-world use. Despite the fact that 26&#x02009;% of samples in Validation Series A were analyzed using microarrays without the complete 160-gene set, the classifier was shown to be the strongest predictor of outcome. Future validation studies using microarrays containing all 160 genes will help determine if the signature contains redundant information, or if the performance statistics generated herein are an underestimate the true prognostic significance of the algorithm.</p><p>The 37-gene ACT-response signature was developed using a novel approach to algorithm design - selecting genes associated with outcome in ACT treated patients, independent to a previously calculated prognosis score. By applying the response signature to an independent validation series of lung cancer patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of cisplatin-based chemotherapy or observation only, the ability of the algorithm to identify those who would go on to receive a clinical benefit from ACT was demonstrated (HR: 0.23; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0032, adjusted for clinical covariates). To the contrary, those Validation Series B patients who were predicted to be non-responders, showed no difference in DSS between ACT and OBS arms of the trial (HR: 0.55; P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.38). None of the 37 genes overlapped with the 15-gene signature of Zhu et al. which was reported to have an ACT-benefit hazard ratio of 0.33 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0005) for predicted responders and 3.67 (P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.013) for non-responders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The use of ACT in stage I patients is currently controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], however it is proposed that that the method described herein may allow clinicians to identify and treat only those individuals whose tumors have the molecular requirements of ACT efficacy. Prospectively planned trials and more extensive comparisons of data from frozen and FFPE tissues, additional NSCLC histologies and chemotherapeutic agents are necessary to further evaluate the clinical utility of the algorithms developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study describes novel genomic signatures able to significantly predict DSS and cisplatin-based ACT benefit for patients diagnosed stage I-II NSCLC. The signatures are comprised of biologically relevant genes and have been evaluated on genomic profile data obtained by multiple institutions using multiple microarray types, reflecting real-world usage. The distinct composition and lack of functional overlap of each signature supports the hypothesis that prognosis and response to ACT in NSCLC are factors influenced by unique molecular characteristics. In conclusion, robust multi-gene algorithms have been developed and validated on independent patient series, demonstrating the potential assist clinicians improve the management and treatment of patients diagnosed with NSCLC. Further work is required to confirm the findings reported herein and determine the applicability of these signatures for other lung cancer histologies and treatment modalities.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HR, Hazard ratio; NSCLC, Non-small cell lung cancer; DSS, Disease specific survival; ACT, Adjuvant chemotherapy treatment; OBS, Observation
