Participants will be randomised into one of the two groups: the intervention group will receive standard ward-based care delivered by the NHS service with additional treatment by a specifically trained generic rehabilitation assistant during ward stay and via telephone contact after hospital discharge and the control group will receive standard ward-based care delivered by the current NHS service. The intervention group will also receive additional information about their critical illness and access to a critical care physician. The total duration of the intervention will be from randomisation to 3&#x02005;months postrandomisation. The total duration of follow-up will be 12&#x02005;months from randomisation for both groups. The primary outcome will be the Rivermead Mobility Index at 3&#x02005;months. Secondary outcomes will include measures of physical and psychological morbidity and function, quality of life and survival over a 12-month period.

These typically persist for many months, may not resolve completely<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1 b2 b3">1&#x02013;3</xref> and are associated with reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL), which often fails to achieve preillness levels.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1 b2 b3 b4">1&#x02013;4</xref> The direct (healthcare) and indirect (carers/family) costs during this period are probably high but are not well studied. In the UK, a recent report (&#x02018;Quality Critical Care&#x02019;)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> and a NICE guideline<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> have highlighted the need to improve rehabilitation for this patient group. A systematic review undertaken during NICE guideline development indicated a lack of high-quality research concerning what interventions improve patient outcomes and their clinical and cost-effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> Recommended future research questions included: &#x0201c;For patients at high risk of critical illness-associated morbidity, what is the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of organised critical care rehabilitation versus usual care on physical and psychological functioning, participation and quality of life?&#x0201d;</p><p>Our pretrial work identified the following key issues in this area:</p><p><italic>Patients have wide ranging health problems</italic>: the health problems that follow critical illness have been called the &#x02018;post-ICU syndrome&#x02019;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>
<italic>Physical impairment</italic> is typified by malnutrition, which is worsened by poor appetite and nausea. Patients can lose 10%&#x02013;30% of their body mass during critical illness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Recovery is further delayed by joint stiffness, pain and neuropathies; levels of fatigue and breathlessness are high. Muscle weakness is particularly common and strongly associated with poor outcome. Problems with <italic>psychological health and social functioning</italic> are also common.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> Anxiety, depression and post-traumatic psychopathology (such as post-traumatic stress disorder) are reported in 10%&#x02013;40% of patients. These problems are rarely screened for or addressed in most acute hospitals.</p><p><italic>Patient rehabilitation is currently not coordinated</italic>: survivors are currently managed in acute hospitals with inconsistent fragmented strategies post-intensive care unit (ICU) discharge. Typically, specialty-based teams lead care and patients are widely dispersed within the hospital. Importantly, patients effectively &#x02018;compete&#x02019; with less sick patient groups (eg, elective surgery patients) for limited rehabilitation resource. In a local audit, we found that 70% of patients were discharged directly home from the acute hospital without clearly planned rehabilitation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Coordination with primary care services was poor and inconsistent, and knowledge of the specific problems faced by the post-ICU patient was very limited among staff on the general wards and after discharge to the community.</p><p><italic>Patients are major users of acute hospital resource</italic>: intensive care costs are high, mainly because of the high staffing levels required to provide multiple organ support on an individual patient basis. The duration of ICU stay is skewed towards a median stay of 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days in most healthcare systems, but the minority of patients requiring longer ICU stay utilise the majority of ICU bed days and continue to utilise enormous hospital resource post-ICU discharge as a result of their residual disability. As the population ages and numbers of ICU admissions are expected to increase, this cohort of ICU survivors will place increasing pressure on acute hospital services. Clinically effective rehabilitation strategies therefore have potential to be both efficient and cost-effective.</p><p><italic>Patient outcomes are poor</italic>: many patients report poor pre-ICU HRQoL and have chronic health problems prior to ICU admission,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> but HRQoL is significantly reduced in most patients following ICU discharge. Impaired physical function is particularly common during the first 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months after discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> Typically, recovery of HRQoL takes at least 12&#x02005;months. Over 50% of patients are below retirement age and only half of those previously working have returned to work by 12&#x02005;months. Patients have an excess risk of death compared with age- and sex-matched population for up to 5&#x02005;years after discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref></p><p>Little research has evaluated interventions to improve outcomes following ICU discharge. A small randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed that self-help manuals, supported by a researcher, improved physical function at 6&#x02005;months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> A recent randomised trial found improvements in physical function at hospital discharge associated with early mobilisation in the ICU but did not address longer term patient benefits or report cost-effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Many critical care services provide nurse-led follow-up clinics at 3&#x02013;12&#x02005;months after hospital discharge, but this approach has little, if any, emphasis on the early recovery phase and a recent randomised trial was unable to demonstrate any clinical benefits or cost-effectiveness.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref></p><p>Our pretrial work included a qualitative interview-based study evaluating the experience of 20 survivors of long-term ventilation during the 6&#x02005;months following ICU discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> We found that patients experienced profound debilitation during the ward phase of recovery and were frustrated by fragmented or specialty-led care, which seemed neither to take account of their individual needs nor issues specific to critical illness. Many were distressed by a perceived indifference among busy ward staff towards their significant dependence and needs. Concerns focused on the brevity and perceived inadequacy of rehabilitative provision (especially physiotherapy), while others felt &#x02018;outside&#x02019; the rehabilitation process, in terms of their individual contribution and longer term goals and strategies. Many patients were discharged home with limited understanding of the nature or severity of their critical illness, which contributed to unrealistic expectations of recovery. In general, patients were ill equipped to manage their own recovery following hospital discharge and had limited access to clinicians in order to address their concerns. We developed a service model based around a generic rehabilitation assistant (GRA) to coordinate and deliver rehabilitation for these patients throughout their hospital stay and maintain contact after hospital discharge.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> In our model, rehabilitation is planned and supervised by &#x02018;hard-stretched&#x02019; specialist staff (physiotherapists, dietitians, occupational therapists) but delivered by a single specifically trained GRA who develops a close relationship with the patient. We tested our model in a feasibility RCT and showed that markedly enhanced levels of treatments could be successfully delivered with this model, and the GRAs could function autonomously across specialist boundaries in the acute hospital.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> We further refined our service model to include a GRA training programme, predefined competencies and input from critical care staff to provide information to patients and families.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial objectives</title><p>Our primary objective is to evaluate the impact on physical, psychological and social functioning of a novel complex intervention strategy to enhance delivery of physical and nutritional rehabilitation to patients during the 3 months following ICU discharge. Our secondary objectives are to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of our approach and compare patient and carer experiences and satisfaction between usual care and the new strategy.</p></sec><sec><title>General design</title><p>RECOVER is a prospective, randomised, parallel group, controlled trial with concealment of outcome assessment. We are comparing our novel intervention with usual care. A schematic diagram describing the trial structure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">figure 1</xref>. The primary study outcome is the Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) at 3&#x02005;months postrandomisation, which is a measure of physical function in relation to mobility. As this is a trial of a complex intervention with potential effects on many outcomes important to patients and health services, we are measuring a range of secondary outcomes during 12&#x02005;months of follow-up (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">table 1</xref>).

The hospitals are run as a single organisation with each major specialty grouping managed by a clinical director and management team. The critical care service is run as a discrete directorate with a single general critical care unit on each site. The Edinburgh Royal Infirmary ICU cares for approximately 700 mechanically ventilated patients each year and the Western General hospital ICU approximately 450 patients. Cardiac surgery and paediatric critical care are provided in separate ICUs. Further information about the critical care setting is available in the Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit report (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sicsag.scot.nhs.uk/">http://www.sicsag.scot.nhs.uk/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Subject screening and selection</title><p>All ICU admissions will be accounted for, and those receiving 48&#x02005;h of continuous ventilation will be screened for eligibility. <italic>Inclusion criteria</italic> are the patient required &#x02265;48&#x02005;h of continuous invasive (via an endotracheal and/or tracheostomy tube) mechanical ventilation in the ICU and the consultant in charge of the patient considers them fit for discharge from the ICU. <italic>Exclusion criteria</italic> are a primary neurological admission diagnosis (brain trauma, intracerebral bleed, stroke, Guillain&#x02013;Barre syndrome); the clinician in charge of care has agreed with the patient and/or family that only palliative care will be provided; patients currently receiving home ventilation or planning to commence a programme of home ventilation; patients expected to be discharged from ICU to a non-study hospital where the intervention cannot be received; gaining informed consent following the intervention or follow-up is not feasible due to communication difficulties; the patient currently enrolled in another RCT with similar endpoints and aged &#x0003c;18&#x02005;years at the time of screening. The recruitment window will be up to 7 days from the time the patient fulfils entry criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>The study involves participants who may lack capacity as a result of acute illness. For these patients, the Adults with Incapacity Act (Scotland; 2000) applies. Patients with mental capacity will be approached for consent to participate in the trial. For those lacking mental capacity, the welfare attorney or next of kin will be approached for consent. For patients enrolled with this approach, patients will be approached for consent to remain in the trial once they regain capacity. The study information sheets are available on the ECTU website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk">http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Based on our pilot study, we estimated that the mean (SD) RMI at 3&#x02005;months postrandomisation will be 10 (4.3), with normal mobility being 15 on a 0&#x02013;15 scale. Our pilot data suggested a change from baseline to 3&#x02005;months in RMI of 2 (SD 5) is currently typical.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> We have powered the study to detect an improvement in the change from baseline RMI of 2 points at 3&#x02005;months in the intervention group compared with usual care. This would be a clinically relevant difference in physical disability for patients in relation to activities of daily living and independence. To detect this difference, we require 100 evaluable patients per group at 3&#x02005;months (80% power; 5% significance level). Assuming a 12% death rate before 3&#x02005;months (based on pilot work) and 95% follow-up of remaining patients at 3&#x02005;months (facilitated by home visits by research nurses), we require to randomise 240 patients in total. Using local audit data, we estimated that 498 eligible patients will be cared for each year of whom 309 will be discharged alive from ICU. Assuming 70% enrolment, we expect to enrol 216/year or 18/month. The planned recruitment period is therefore 14&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Method of assignment to treatment groups</title><p>Patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive either existing usual care or the novel intervention. Randomisation will be by a remote computer-based telephone system to ensure allocation concealment.

Following the 3-month assessment, all patients will receive usual care irrespective of their location, but relevant healthcare professionals will be made aware of any key issues by the research team to ensure patient safety. Based on audit data, we expect only a small proportion of patients to remain in hospital at 3&#x02005;months when the primary outcome is measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Description of treatments received</title><p>RECOVER is a complex intervention trial and, as recommended by the MRC complex intervention framework, we are describing the process of care received in each group in detail.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> To achieve this, we have identified four key stages of the patient pathway during which we believe key and important components of rehabilitation occur. These comprise the immediate post-ICU discharge period (stage 1); ward-based rehabilitation in the acute hospital (stage 2); acute hospital discharge planning (stage 3) and the posthospital discharge period (stage 4). These stages will have differing durations and timings in relation to randomisation according to individual patient requirements. The processes and treatments that we want to measure during each stage have been defined a priori and will be recorded prospectively according to a proforma (see data collection and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The process measures and treatments recorded prospectively to describe the rehabilitation received during the intervention period</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Process</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Data recorded by</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">One: post-ICU discharge</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Visits by ICU clinical staff</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provision of rehabilitation manual by research team</p></list-item></list></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research nurse from medical notes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Two: ward-based rehabilitationDocumented for each week (or part week) in the acute hospital</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Number of visits (and content) by physiotherapy staff, occupational therapy, SLT, dietetic and other non-parent specialty staff</p></list-item><list-item><p>Number of visits by GRA (intervention group only)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Total numbers of therapy sessions in physiotherapy, dietetic, occupational health, SLT and other relevant categories</p></list-item><list-item><p>Patient-centred goals documented</p></list-item></list></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research nurse from medical notes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Three: hospital discharge</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Number patient discharged to rehabilitation facility</p></list-item><list-item><p>For patients discharged to home/community:</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proportion of patients receiving home visit occurred</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proportion of patients with letter to general practitioner specifically documenting rehabilitation issues</p></list-item></list></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research nurse from medical notes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Four: post-hospital discharge to 3-month outcome measure</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Total contacts with GRA during post-hospital discharge period</p></list-item><list-item><p>Contact with healthcare services</p></list-item></list></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Research nurse at 3&#x02005;months assessment</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>GRA, generic rehabilitation assistant; ICU, intensive care unit.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention group procedures</title><sec><title>Generic rehabilitation assistants</title><p>GRAs will be employed to work exclusively with patients randomised to the intervention group. We previously described the concept of the specialist critical care rehabilitation assistant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> For RECOVER, we calculated that the workload would require 2.5 whole time equivalent posts working flexibly across the two hospitals under the supervision of a multidisciplinary rehabilitation team comprising physiotherapists and dietitians and some input from speech and language therapy and occupational therapy. The GRAs will be trained to use systematic screening tools for common problems and deliver therapy according to predefined competencies. All GRAs will receive a 4-week training programme prior to starting the trial.

These will be used to trigger specialist input using predefined thresholds or criteria.

As the trial is testing a complex intervention involving health service redesign, we do not propose a separate analysis of patients who did not receive any or certain elements of the intervention. The primary outcome measure, RMI at 3&#x02005;months postrandomisation, will be compared between the groups using analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline RMI and for the factors included in the minimisation algorithm. A sensitivity analysis will be performed where the lowest possible value of RMI (0) is imputed for those patients who die within 3&#x02005;months of randomisation. A similar approach will be used to analyse the secondary outcome measures. A detailed analysis plan has been written for the baseline variables, process measures and primary and secondary outcome variables. The analysis plan is available on the ECTU website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk">http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Qualitative study</title><p>We plan to maximise the information obtained about the intervention using a mixed methods approach, incorporating qualitative research.

Participants will be invited to discuss their experiences of recovery and rehabilitation up to 3&#x02005;months post-ICU discharge. We will explore key issues and concerns and the ways in which multi-disciplinary input impacted upon recovery both during the acute hospital phase and following discharge home. A comparative analysis between the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; and intervention focus groups will explore the impact of the intervention on participants' key issues and concerns.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthcare professionals</title><p>Using purposive sampling, we will invite 8&#x02013;10 representatives from key healthcare disciplines at each site to participate in focus group interviews towards the end of the recruitment period. Drawing upon our analysis of the research logs, participants will be invited to discuss barriers to the delivery and coordination of patient-led care among both groups and perceptions (including acceptability) of the GRAs as a novel strategy for the rehabilitation of patients after ICU discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of research logs kept by GRAs</title><p>The GRAs will keep a log throughout the trial to record their experience of the novel role. Using thematic analysis, we will analyse these to categorise the principle barriers to the intervention and successful strategies in the implementation of the intervention both in individual patients and across ward and hospital settings. These data will supplement the quantitative measurement of process outcomes and facilitate the translation of findings into routine care.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Blood sampling for biomarker inflammation study</title><p>A substudy will investigate the prevalence of persisting inflammation following ICU discharge and its relationship with recovery. For patients who consent to additional blood sampling, a 10&#x02005;ml blood sample will be collected at randomisation, weekly until hospital discharge and at the 3-month visit, and stored frozen as plasma and serum. Biological substances involved in the inflammatory response will subsequently be measured and related to measures of physical recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Health economic evaluation</title><p>Cost-effectiveness will be estimated using a prospective within trial analysis of treatment effects analysed on an intention-to-treat basis and a decision model of long-term costs and health outcomes. The primary endpoint for the economic analysis will be incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing the intervention group with the usual standard of care impact, focusing on health service use and HRQoL. Health service costs will be assigned to the type and intensity of resource use measured by rehabilitation interventions/contacts, medications, hospital clinic attendances and hospitalisation episodes from randomisation to 12&#x02005;months of follow-up. The health economic questionnaire used in the study is available of the ECTU website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk">http://www.clinicaltrials.ed.ac.uk</ext-link>). Unit costs will reflect a mixture of approaches including activity-based analyses of resource consumption for specific rehabilitation interventions alongside average per diem inpatient costs calculated on a specialty-specific basis using the Scottish Health Service Costs system. Endpoints for health effects will include survival times and quality-adjusted survival times. Quality-adjusted survival times per life years will be calculated for all randomised patients using the HRQoL measures. These within trial analyses will be integrated into a decision model of long-term costs and health effects. We propose to use a Monte-Carlo microsimulation model. Base case analysis, using the intention-to-treat results, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted by varying key model parameters and critical assumptions over plausible ranges/distributions. The decision model will also permit the analysis of cost-effectiveness conditional on prespecified patient subgroups to allow for heterogeneity in the case mix of patients receiving intensive care and their baseline condition at ICU discharge.
