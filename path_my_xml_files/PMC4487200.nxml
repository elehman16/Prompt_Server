Adverse events were similar in the two groups. Five out of seven patients (71 %) randomized to abatacept and one out of three patients (33 %) randomized to placebo experienced &#x02265;30 % improvement in skin score. Subjects receiving abatacept showed a trend toward improvement in mRSS at week 24 (&#x02212;8.6 &#x000b1; 7.5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0625) while those in the placebo group did not (&#x02212;2.3 &#x000b1; 15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.75). After adjusting for disease duration, mRSS significantly improved in the abatacept compared with the placebo group (abatacept vs. placebo mRSS decrease estimate &#x02212;9.8, 95 % confidence interval &#x02212;16.7 to &#x02212;3.0, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0114).

Patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) have extensive fibrosis of the skin, and suffer significant morbidity related to skin tightening including pain, pruritus, and the development of contractures and tendon friction rubs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Although the etiology of SSc remains unknown, several observations support the role of activated T cells in disease pathogenesis. Skin biopsies obtained from SSc patients early in their disease demonstrate a perivascular, mononuclear cell infiltrate comprised of T cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. T cell activation is a prominent feature in SSc, as demonstrated by the presence of increased numbers of T cells bearing activation markers, such as interleukin (IL)-2 receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], as well as elevated levels of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17 in the peripheral blood of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Abatacept (Orencia, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY, USA) is a soluble fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of human cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 linked to the modified Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1. Abatacept inhibits T cell activation by binding to CD80 and CD86, thereby blocking interaction with CD28. We conducted a pilot study to assess the safety, tolerability, potential efficacy, and molecular effects of intravenous (IV) abatacept in patients with dcSSc based on the analysis of clinical and gene expression data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study protocol</title><p>The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00442611. The Institutional Review Board of Stanford University approved the study prior to its initiation. The study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki Principles. All participants provided written informed consent. Study enrollment occurred from May 2008 through November 2010. Eligible subjects were &#x02265;18 years old with a diagnosis of dcSSc. Subjects must have had no symptoms suggestive of renal crisis within 6 months of screening; forced vital capacity (FVC) &#x0003e;49 % and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &#x0003e;39 % predicted, absence of pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure, or symptomatic coronary artery disease. Immunomodulatory therapy had to be discontinued at least 90 days prior to randomization, but prednisone &#x02264;10 mg daily was permitted if the dose was stable for at least 28 days prior to randomization. Exclusion criteria included a diagnosis of limited cutaneous SSc, eosinophilic fasciitis, eosinophilia myalgia syndrome, other overlap autoimmune syndromes, or concurrent diagnosis with another definable connective tissue disease, or a known history of any chronic infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Intervention and study assessments</title><p>Subjects were randomized 2:1 to receive abatacept dosed according to weight (500 mg/dose for subjects weighing &#x0003c;60 kg; 750 mg/dose for those weighing 60&#x02013;100 kg, and 1,000 mg/dose for those weighing &#x0003e;100 kg) or matching placebo by intravenous infusion. All other concomitant medications, including treatment for Raynaud&#x02019;s phenomenon, gastroesophageal reflux disease, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and prednisone at &#x02264;10 mg daily were continued at stable doses throughout the study period. Subjects were dosed on days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days for a total of seven doses through day 141. Final study visit for safety and efficacy assessments was day 169 (week 24). At each study visit, subjects underwent physical examination including vital signs and modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and laboratory assessment including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, urinalysis, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Patient global assessment of disease activity and pain by 10-point visual analogue scale (VAS), and physical function assessed by the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were collected at each visit as was physician global assessment by VAS. Pulmonary function tests were performed at baseline and week 24. Skin biopsies were obtained from the forearm 10 cm distal to the olecranon at baseline and repeated within 1 cm from the initial biopsy site at week 24 in a subset of patients. Skin biopsy samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently thawed at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C in RNAlater-ICE (Ambion, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) and RNA prepared for analysis of genome-wide gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Masking</title><p>Both patients and investigators were blinded to the treatment allocation. The same efficacy assessor (LC) performed all skin scores and physician global assessments at baseline and week 24, and remained blinded to safety assessments throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Safety was the primary outcome, comparing adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs in the abatacept and placebo groups. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in mRSS at week 24 compared to baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoints included changes in Scleroderma HAQ-DI, patient and physician global assessments, and pulmonary function at 24 weeks compared to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>DNA microarray hybridization and data processing</title><p>Tissue samples were processed and microarray data were normalized and filtered as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. cRNA was hybridized to Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8x60K Microarrays (G4851A). Agilent Feature Extraction Image Analysis Software (Version 10.7.3) was used to extract data from raw microarray image files. Probes with &#x0003e;20 % missing data were excluded resulting in 41,589 probes that passed the filtering criteria. The probes were median-centered across all arrays. The gene expression data are available from NCBI GEO at accession number GSE66321.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Differential gene expression analysis</title><p>Missing values in microarray data were imputed using GenePattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] module ImputeMissingValuesKNN; 41,589 probes were collapsed to 21,982 gene symbols via GenePattern module CollapseDataset using annotation file for Agilent SurePrint G3 Human GE v2 8x60K Microarray. Genes differentially expressed between two phenotypic classes of interest (e.g., between baseline and post-treatment improver samples) were identified using GenePattern module ComparativeMarkerSelection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Expression data for significant genes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) were clustered in Cluster 3.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and visualized in TreeView [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Differentially expressed gene signatures were analyzed for functional enrichment via g:Profiler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and were annotated with significantly enriched functional terms (false discovery rate (FDR) &#x0003c;5 %).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intrinsic subset assignment</title><p>Gene expression data were analyzed for all samples in this study (including abatacept- and placebo-treated patients) as well as four healthy control samples previously analyzed on the same DNA microarray platform. The inclusion of healthy controls was necessary to provide the proper distribution of gene expression data for intrinsic subset assignment. The 26,251 probes from the Agilent 8x60K platform were collapsed to 16,214 unique gene symbols. The 995 intrinsic probes from Milano et al. ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; Agilent 4x44K platform) were collapsed to 793 unique gene symbols. Of these 793 unique intrinsic genes from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], 645 (~81.3 %) were also present in the abatacept dataset and were used in the cluster analysis.</p><p>In order to formally assign each sample to the intrinsic gene expression subset, we performed a correlation of centroids for the 645 intrinsic genes between the 20 samples in this study and the reference dataset of [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Centroids were calculated for the fibroproliferative, inflammatory and normal-like groups; the limited subgroup was excluded since no patients with limited SSc were included in the abatacept study. The gene expression centroid was created by averaging the gene expression data for all 645 genes across all samples assigned to that intrinsic subset in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. We then calculated Spearman correlation statistics (correlation coefficients and <italic>p</italic>-values) between each abatacept sample and three intrinsic subset centroids.

To identify pathways differentially expressed on a single sample level, microarray data were analyzed via ssGSEA (single-sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] using ssGSEAProjection module from GenePattern. Significant pathways (FDR &#x0003c;10 %) were clustered and visualized as described above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The sample size of 10 patients was pre-determined based on the amount of support, drug, and placebo that was provided to conduct this investigator-initiated study. Last observation carried forward analyses were employed. Comparisons between groups were analyzed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests, <italic>t</italic>-tests, and chi-squared analysis where appropriate. mRSS scores were compared using Wilcoxon signed rank test and mixed models to account for repeated measures over eight visit times for each patient and adjusted for disease duration.

During the follow-up, one patient randomized to placebo withdrew because of an infected digital ulcer. One patient randomized to abatacept declined to provide skin biopsies. Therefore, biopsies for gene expression analyses were available for eight of ten study subjects, including two of the three patients in the placebo group and six of the seven patients in the abatacept group.

Genes that were significantly differentially expressed in abatacept improvers between baseline and post-treatment either showed stable expression or displayed opposite trends in non-improver and placebo samples suggesting the association with a clinical response to abatacept treatment. The intrinsic subset assignment of abatacept patients shows that the improvers tend to be in the inflammatory intrinsic subset at baseline. The majority of the improvers demonstrate the loss of the inflammatory signature post-treatment consistent with the robust response to the therapy. These changes in the gene expression profiles of improvers are reflected by the functional changes as seen in the differentially regulated pathways. Generally, we observe decreased expression of genes involved in immune response, including those associated with CD28 T cell co-stimulation. We observe that improvers from the abatacept group show a decrease in the inflammatory gene signature from Milano et al. post-treatment with a concomitant decrease in inflammatory pathways, including significant repression of CD28-dependent signaling. We do not observe a decrease of the inflammatory gene signature or inflammatory pathways in the non-improver and placebo-treated patients.</p><p>Our results suggest that abatacept therapy may be most beneficial for patients from the inflammatory intrinsic SSc subset, a hypothesis that must be rigorously tested in a larger clinical trial. This finding is consistent with the idea that patients in the inflammatory intrinsic subset are likely to benefit from drugs specifically targeting inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Our results parallel those from a recent report showing that SSc patients who experienced a clinically significant improvement in mRSS while treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (CellCept, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) were classified as inflammatory at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>While our study provides some support for the idea that blockade of T cell costimulation may be useful in the treatment of cutaneous fibrosis in SSc, the small number of patients precludes any conclusions regarding its clinical efficacy. After adjusting for disease duration, abatacept significantly improved mRSS by &#x02212;9.8 points compared with placebo at 6 months, exceeding the minimal clinical important difference of 5.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. An observational study using The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) database also showed that abatacept was safe and well tolerated in 12 patients with SSc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This study found that a mean of 11 months of abatacept treatment resulted in improvement in several measures of joint disease, including swollen and tender joint count as well as the 28-count Disease Activity Score. There was no significant change in mRSS after abatacept treatment, but only half of the patients had dcSSc and the mean baseline mRSS was only 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Our study was limited by the small sample size and the relatively short treatment duration. Given that the natural history of dcSSc is stabilization of skin tightening over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and T cell infiltrates in the skin are detected early in disease, most clinical trials of immunomodulatory therapies target patients with early (&#x02264;18 months to &#x02264;5 years) disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Defining early disease as &#x02264;18 months, three out of seven of the abatacept patients, but none of the placebo patients, were classified as early. Therefore, it is possible that the abatacept group was more likely to improve spontaneously than the placebo group. However, accounting for disease duration, abatacept-treated patients demonstrated significantly greater improvement in mRSS than placebo-treated patients (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0114). In addition, disease duration has only a mild negative correlation with change in mRSS (r = &#x02212;0.27), and the best time for intervention is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The abatacept group also had lower baseline mRSS and HAQ-DI scores suggesting that these patients may have been more likely to improve despite treatment. The discrepancy between patient and physician global score changes indicates that these VAS scales may not be reliable outcome measures. Finally, we did not assess for effects on joint disease in our study.</p><p>In terms of the gene expression analyses, the small sample size required the use of uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-values for the identification of gene signatures. We accounted for this limitation by performing corrections for multiple hypothesis testing in our functional enrichment and GSEA procedures.</p><p>Our study provides supportive data for a multi-center placebo-controlled clinical trial of subcutaneous abatacept in early dcSSc that is currently ongoing. This study includes pre- and post-treatment skin biopsies for gene expression analyses, and will provide more definitive data as to whether there is a role for abatacept in the treatment of cutaneous fibrosis in SSc patients, particularly those in the inflammatory intrinsic subset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We performed a placebo-controlled randomized trial of abatacept in patients with dcSSc. Most patients treated with abatacept experienced an improvement in mRSS post-treatment, and the majority of improvers mapped to the inflammatory intrinsic subset at baseline. Multiple immune response pathways including specific molecular targets of abatacept were significantly downregulated in improvers post-treatment but were unchanged in non-improver and placebo groups. Our results suggest that abatacept may be particularly beneficial for dcSSc patients from the inflammatory intrinsic gene expression subset and warrant further investigation in a larger clinical trial.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec25"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2015_669_MOESM1_ESM.xlsx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
