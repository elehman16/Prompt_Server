The primary endpoint was change from baseline in pre-dose evening trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>). Secondary endpoints were change from baseline in percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods (powered), evening and morning peak expiratory flow, symptom-free 24-h periods and withdrawals due to lack of efficacy.

As part of the overall FF clinical development program, a dose-ranging study (25&#x02013;200 mcg doses of FF) showed that FF 50 mcg administered over 8&#x000a0;weeks was the minimum dose required to achieve significant improvements in evening trough forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This 12-week study sought to evaluate the efficacy and safety of once-daily FF 50 mcg dosed in the evening in asthma patients aged &#x02265;12&#x000a0;years who were uncontrolled on short-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (SABA) and/or leukotriene modifying agent. One other study with FF 50 mcg has been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which was an 8-week dose ranging study. Two phase III studies of longer duration (of which this is one) comparing FF 50 mcg with placebo have been conducted in SABA only patients, to determine whether FF 50 mcg is a suitable starting dose for asthma patients not already using a controller medication.

The study was approved by local ethics committees and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p><p>Patients were randomized (1:1) to receive FF 50 mcg or placebo for a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks; both treatments were administered by the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler once daily in the evening. Patients were randomized in accordance with a central randomization schedule generated by the sponsor using a validated computerized system (RandAll [GlaxoSmithKline, UK]), after a telephone call to the Registration and Medication Ordering System (RAMOS [GlaxoSmithKline, UK]). Both patients and investigators were blinded to treatment allocations. Treatment compliance was assessed by reviewing the dose counter on the ELLIPTA device. All patients received albuterol/salbutamol, to be used as needed throughout the run-in and treatment periods; no other asthma medications were permitted. The following non-asthma medications were permitted during the study: decongestants; intranasal and topical corticosteroids; immunotherapy; short- and long-acting antihistamines; and antihistamine eye drops.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in pre-dose evening (trough) FEV<sub>1</sub> at Week 12. FEV<sub>1</sub> measurements were performed in the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 and were made within 1&#x000a0;h of the time FEV<sub>1</sub> was measured at baseline and approximately 24-h after the last evening dose of medication.</p><p>The powered secondary endpoint was change from baseline in the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods during the 12-week treatment period. Other secondary endpoints were: change from baseline in daily evening and morning peak expiratory force (PEF) averaged over the 12-week treatment period; change from baseline in the percentage of symptom-free 24-h periods during the 12-week treatment period; and number of withdrawals from study due to lack of efficacy. PEF measurements, symptoms and use of rescue medication were recorded daily using an eDiary.</p><p>Other selected endpoints included: change from baseline in Asthma Control Test<sup>TM</sup> (ACT) score at Week 12; percentage of patients controlled (defined as having an ACT score &#x02265;20) at Week 12; change from baseline in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ)&#x02009;+&#x02009;12 Total score at Week 12; and ease of use questions on the ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler at the end of 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Safety evaluations</title><p>Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events (AEs; coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities dictionary) and severe asthma exacerbations throughout the 12-week treatment period. A severe exacerbation was defined as deterioration of asthma requiring the use of systemic/oral corticosteroids for at least 3&#x000a0;days or an inpatient hospitalization or emergency department visit due to asthma that required systemic corticosteroids. Oropharyngeal examination was performed throughout the duration of the treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A total of 220 randomized patients were expected to provide 104 evaluable patients per arm, giving 94% power to detect a difference of 200&#x000a0;mL between FF 50 mcg and placebo groups in evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, with significance declared at the two-sided 5% level. This also provided 95% power to detect a difference of 15% between FF 50 mcg and placebo groups in the change from baseline in percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods, with significance declared at the two-sided 5% level. The overall power of the study to detect treatment differences between FF 50 mcg and placebo for the primary and powered secondary endpoints was 90%.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in pre-dose evening (trough) FEV<sub>1</sub> at the end of treatment (Week 12). This was analysed using an Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) model, which allowed for effects due to baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, region, sex, age and treatment group. Last Observation Carried Forward was used to impute missing data. A supporting analysis was performed using a repeated measures model. Powered secondary, secondary and other endpoint comparisons were also analyzed using ANCOVA, with the exception of withdrawals due to lack of efficacy (analyzed using Fisher&#x02019;s Exact test) and the percentage of patients controlled (ACT score &#x02265;20; analyzed using logistic regression).</p><p>The safety population comprised all patients randomized to treatment and who received at least one dose of study medication. The intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprised all patients in the safety population except for 20 (10 from each treatment arm) patients excluded due to data quality issues identified through a site audit during a previous study. The per protocol population comprised all ITT patients who did not have any full protocol deviations.</p><p>In order to account for multiplicity across the key endpoints, a step-down closed testing procedure was applied for the primary and secondary endpoints whereby failure to achieve significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) for the primary treatment comparison (FF 50 mcg vs. placebo), at any point in the hierarchy, meant that all tests lower down in the hierarchy were interpreted as descriptive only. The hierarchy was as follows: (1) evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub>; (2) rescue-free 24-h periods; (3) evening PEF; (4) morning PEF; (5) symptom-free 24-h periods; and (6) withdrawals due to lack of efficacy. If significance was achieved at each stage of the hierarchy, then all other efficacy endpoints were tested without further multiplicity adjustment.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population</title><p>Of 449 patients screened, 248 were randomized, of whom 242 comprised the safety population and 222 comprised the ITT population.

There were no reports of pneumonia or oral/oropharyngeal candidiasis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In patients with persistent asthma uncontrolled by non-ICS medications, FF 50 mcg administered once daily in the evening for 12&#x000a0;weeks significantly improved evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub> compared with placebo. Patients who received FF 50 mcg also showed a significant increase in the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods compared with placebo. The safety profile for FF 50 mcg was acceptable and similar to that of placebo. The patient population was chosen as the most appropriate for once-daily treatment with a low dose of FF.</p><p>The statistically significant improvement in evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub> observed with FF 50 mcg compared with placebo (120&#x000a0;mL) is similar to findings from a recent dose-ranging study that investigated the potential of low doses of once-daily FF (25&#x02013;200 mcg) for the treatment of persistent asthma over 8&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The current study was performed in a similar population of asthma patients (i.e., those who required a step-up to Step 2 of asthma treatment guidelines) and, although lung function at baseline was different, those authors found that FF 50&#x02013;200 mcg statistically significantly improved lung function compared with placebo; the treatment difference between FF 50 mcg and placebo in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> was 129&#x000a0;mL (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.033). The present data for FF, generated from a larger cohort of patients and over a longer period of time, support these findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The study was powered based on a change in evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub> of 200&#x000a0;mL. However, in another study comparing morning and evening dosing of FF/VI whose findings were reported after our study design was finalized, smaller treatment differences vs. placebo were seen for evening FEV<sub>1</sub> when compared with morning FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x02013; this was probably due to the known diurnal variation in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Despite this, the effect of FF 50 mcg on evening FEV<sub>1</sub> in our study was significant. However, in another phase III study the improvement for FF 50 mcg over placebo was not statistically significant, although improvement with the active comparator fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 mcg was significant (102&#x000a0;mL; <italic>p&#x02009;=</italic>&#x02009;0.030) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The reason for the findings of Busse et al. not being consistent with those of the current and previous studies of FF 50 mcg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] is unclear, as the patient population enrolled was very similar to that of the current study. Finally, for the powered secondary endpoint in this study, the statistically significant increase in the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods with FF 50 mcg compared with placebo is consistent with results from the 8-week dose-ranging study that involved FF 50 mcg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Collectively, the findings suggest that FF 50 mcg results in meaningful improvements in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods.</p><p>Statistical significance was not achieved for the secondary endpoint of change from baseline in evening PEF for FF 50 mcg vs. placebo, meaning that significance could not be inferred for the remaining secondary and other endpoints. However, other studies investigating treatment with FF 50 mcg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or FF 100 mcg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] have reported numerically greater improvements in evening PEF compared with placebo (treatment differences of 20.7&#x000a0;L/min, 17.2&#x000a0;L/min and 15.9&#x000a0;L/min, respectively). Lung function is generally improved in the evening due to diurnal variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], reducing the likelihood of detecting treatment benefit at that time point. However, trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, which was also assessed in the evening, did improve significantly following FF 50 mcg compared with placebo treatment. For the remaining endpoints of morning PEF, symptom-free 24-h periods, ACT score, percentage of patients controlled (defined by ACT score &#x02265;20 at Week 12) and Total AQLQ score, numerically greater increases were observed over 12&#x000a0;weeks in patients who received FF 50 mcg compared with placebo. More patients in the placebo group were withdrawn due to lack of efficacy compared with the FF 50 mcg group.</p><p>The overall safety profile was favorable in both the FF 50 mcg and placebo groups, consistent with previous findings for this dose of FF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cortisol levels were not measured in this study, as the treatment was with a low dose of FF and no effect of cortisol had been seen with higher doses. The effect of FF on cortisol levels has been assessed in a separate meta-analysis, which is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Common AEs experienced by asthma patients receiving ICS treatment included headache, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis and influenza. Incidence of these AEs was similarly low between treatment groups in this study, although headache was more frequent in the placebo group.</p><p>A strength of our study is the inclusion of a statistical hierarchy of endpoints, which added robustness in validating the overall efficacy of FF 50 mcg compared with placebo. However, this might also be considered a weakness, as failure to achieve statistical significance for evening PEF meant that treatment differences between FF 50 mcg and placebo for the remaining endpoints could only be interpreted in descriptive terms. Another strength was the use of electronic diary cards, which meant that all entries were date and time stamped and which did not allow retrospective entries; this is likely to have increased the quality of daily recordings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, FF 50 mcg administered once daily in the evening significantly improved evening trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and the percentage of rescue-free 24-h periods compared with placebo. Improvements with FF 50 mcg were numerically greater than with placebo for all efficacy endpoints. Fewer patients receiving FF 50 mcg treatment withdrew due to lack of efficacy compared with patients receiving placebo treatment and there were no safety concerns. Overall, the efficacy/tolerability profile of FF 50 mcg was acceptable, suggesting that treatment with FF 50 mcg is potentially suitable for patients &#x02265;12&#x000a0;years of age with persistent asthma that is uncontrolled by non-ICS therapy.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>a</sup>ELLIPTA&#x02122; is a trademark of the GlaxoSmithKline group of companies.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>ACT</term><def><p>Asthma control test&#x02122;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of covariance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AQLQ</term><def><p>Asthma quality of life questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV<sub>1</sub></term><def><p>forced expiratory volume in one second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FF</term><def><p>Fluticasone furoate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p>Inhaled corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABA</term><def><p>Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEF</term><def><p>Peak expiratory force</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SABA</term><def><p>Short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonists</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VI</term><def><p>Vilanterol</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>P.M.O&#x02019;B. has served as a consultant to Almirall, AstraZeneca, Chiesi and Novartis; has served on advisory boards for AIM, Altair, Boehringer, GlaxoSmithKline, Medimmune and Merck; has received lecture fees from Chiesi; and has received research funding from AstraZeneca, Asmacure, Altair, Amgen, Genentech, Topigen and Wyeth.
