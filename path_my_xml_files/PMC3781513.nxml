In patients with diabetes, the benefits of exercise are offset, in part, by the inadequacy of current methods of insulin replacement to respond to changing metabolic demands both during and after exercise, leading to an increased risk of hypoglycemia. Most severe hypoglycemic events occur during sleep, and the frequency of biochemical hypoglycemia is increased on nights after afternoon exercise. Indeed, in a study of 50 well-controlled children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, the Diabetes Research in Children Network (DirecNet) showed that the percentage of nights during which blood glucose levels fell to &#x02264;60 mg/dL nearly doubled (from 28 to 48%) for nights with compared with nights without antecedent afternoon exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>A number of pathophysiologic factors contribute to the increased vulnerability of youth with type 1 diabetes to nocturnal hypoglycemia (NH) after sedentary or physically active days. Using the hypoglycemic clamp technique, Jones and colleagues demonstrated that plasma epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia are markedly blunted in children and adolescents with and without diabetes during deep sleep at night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These findings were extended by Banarer and Cryer, who also demonstrated decreased epinephrine responses to hypoglycemia during sleep in adults with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Using the euglycemic clamp technique to maintain stable plasma glucose and insulin levels during the night, McMahon and colleagues have more recently shown that the rate of exogenous glucose infusion had to be sharply increased 7&#x02013;11 h after afternoon exercise, even in the face of unchanged plasma insulin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In patients who receive fixed basal insulin doses given by insulin pump or injections of long-acting insulin analogs, the increased metabolic demands that occur on nights after afternoon exercise combined with the impaired ability of falling glucose levels to stimulate an adequate epinephrine response during sleep put patients with type 1 diabetes at increased jeopardy for NH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems provide a means to optimize overnight glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes by more fully exploiting the variable basal infusion rate capability of insulin pumps based on retrospective analysis of overnight glucose profiles. However, even optimized overnight basal rates in generally sedentary children can lead to NH on nights after unexpected antecedent afternoon exercise. While the JDRF CGM randomized clinical trial demonstrated that CGM is effective in lowering A1C levels in patients with type 1 diabetes who use the devices frequently, the risk of severe hypoglycemic events was not reduced and prolonged episodes of NH were common in children and in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Recently, use of sensor augmented pump (SAP) therapy has been demonstrated to decrease time spent in hypoglycemia compared with pump therapy alone; yet, episodes of hypoglycemia could not be eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Additionally, while SAP therapy may be the best possible treatment modality currently commercially available, its use by patients has been limited, with data from the Type 1 Diabetes Exchange estimating usage of CGM to 6% of study participants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These data support the contention that no treatment of type 1 diabetes will be optimal until there is feedback control of insulin-delivery rates based on real-time changes in sensor glucose levels.</p><p>Steil and colleagues carried out the &#x0201c;first in man&#x0201d; studies of a closed-loop (CL) system using an external insulin pump, external glucose sensor, and a proportional-integrative-derivative (PID) algorithm in 10 adult patients with type 1 diabetes in a clinical research center setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). While delays in insulin absorption resulting from the use of the subcutaneous route of insulin administration contributed to early postprandial hyperglycemia and late postmeal hypoglycemia, overnight glucose control was outstanding. Subsequent studies have demonstrated the ability of CL systems to regulate glucose levels during the overnight period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), but physical activity of study subjects was restricted in most of these inpatient investigations. In this study, we used the same exercise paradigm that doubled the rate of NH in the DirecNet study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) to examine and compare the frequency of NH during open-loop (OL) and CL insulin delivery on nights with and without antecedent exercise in the afternoon in a group of adolescents and young adults with well-controlled type 1 diabetes.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study subjects and enrollment</title><p>Subjects were recruited from the Yale Type 1 Diabetes Program and local advertising.

During both CL and OL admissions, subjects underwent a treadmill exercise protocol in the afternoon on one of the 24-h periods (exercise day) and rested throughout the other 24-h period (sedentary day)&#x02014;also in random order. Meals (self-selected by study subjects from a hospital menu) were identical during both admissions and on both study days were provided at 8:00 <sc>a.m.</sc>, noon, and 5:00 <sc>p.m.</sc>.

Intravenous catheters were placed for measurement of reference plasma glucose levels, which were measured at the bedside every 30 min by the YSI 2300 Glucose Analyzer (YSI Life Sciences, Yellow Springs, OH). In 10 of the 12 subjects, blood samples were obtained for determination of plasma insulin levels every 30 min between 10:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> and 6:00 <sc>a.m</sc>. Patients were treated with 15&#x02013;30 g oral carbohydrates if reference blood glucose fell below 60 mg/dL.

During this admission, subjects were advised to continue their &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d;; therefore, subjects tested blood glucose levels on a glucose meter as desired, determined how much insulin to bolus for meals, and made their usual adjustments (if any) to basal insulin infusion rates during exercise.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Subject preparation: procedures for CL studies.</title><p>On the afternoon of admission to the HRU, two continuous glucose sensors (the study sensor and a back-up sensor) were inserted in the subcutaneous space of the anterior abdominal wall and calibrated; a new insulin infusion set was placed in the hip/buttocks, and the home insulin pump was replaced by the study pump (Medtronic Paradigm 715). Insulin usage over the prior 3&#x02013;7 days was used to determine algorithm parameters that were programmed into the study computer. Subjects were continued on OL control for dinner. After dinner, a run-in period of CL control was initiated at ~9:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> to achieve stable, target glucose levels at the start of the CL experiments the next morning (7:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> of study day 1).</p><p>The hybrid CL system used in this study consisted of four components: a Medtronic Paradigm 715 insulin pump, a Medtronic MiniLink REAL-Time transmitter (MMT-7703) adapted for 1-min transmission, a Medtronic Sof-Sensor (MMT-7002/7003) continuous glucose sensor, and the Medtronic external PID algorithm, which uses a PID algorithm modified to include insulin feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). With this system, glucose sensor signals were transmitted every minute from a radiofrequency transmitter and delivered insulin commands to the pump by radiofrequency signaling. The algorithm&#x02019;s target glucose level was set to 120 mg/day during the day and night. Details regarding the algorithm parameters and calibration procedures have previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), during CL control subjects also received a small manual priming bolus of 0.05 units/kg (average premeal bolus 3.1 &#x000b1; 1.2 units) at the start of the meals.</p><p>Although the system operates off of one sensor, the second sensor was available in the event of a sensor malfunction. Sensors were calibrated at the start of CL control and whenever reference/sensor errors exceeded 20%. Sensor accuracy, defined as mean absolute relative deviation between sensor and reference blood glucose levels, was 10.1 &#x000b1; 2.0% during the CL studies.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Exercise protocol.</title><p>On the afternoon of the first admission, subjects underwent an abbreviated exercise tolerance test to determine the treadmill settings needed to obtain target heart rates. The target heart rate was calculated to approximate 50&#x02013;55% maximal effort (equivalent to 65&#x02013;70% maximum heart rate), where maximum heart rate was calculated as 220 &#x02212; subject age (in years). As in the DirecNet study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), exercise sessions were scheduled to begin at 3:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> to simulate typical after-school activity. The exercise session consisted of four 15-min exercise periods interspersed with three 5-min rest periods. Treadmill settings were adjusted to maintain the subject&#x02019;s target heart rate. Reference blood glucose levels were measured just prior to the start of exercise and at the end of each 15-min exercise period. On the day of exercise, supplemental carbohydrate was administered if starting blood glucose was &#x0003c;120 mg/dL. Pre-exercise per-protocol supplemental carbohydrate was needed in &#x0223c;30% of subjects while on CL therapy (range of carbohydrates 15&#x02013;75 g), with double the number of subjects requiring supplemental carbohydrates during the OL exercise condition (range of carbohydrates 15&#x02013;120 g). During rest periods, subjects received 15&#x02013;30 g carbohydrate snack if reference blood glucose was &#x0003c;80 mg/dL, and blood glucose levels had to be &#x02265;80 mg/dL in order to resume exercise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>Reference plasma glucose concentrations were used to compare differences in glucose control between the two treatment conditions CL and OL. The overnight period was defined as 10:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> to 6:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> Hypoglycemia was defined as reference blood glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dL. A treatable hypoglycemic event was defined as a reference blood glucose level &#x0003c;60 mg/dL. Episodes of treatable hypoglycemia needed to be separated by more than 30 min to be counted as two discrete events. The proportions of overnight blood glucose values &#x0003c;70, 70&#x02013;180, and &#x0003e;180 mg/dL were also compared under OL and CL control.

Indeed, 90% of reference blood glucose values were between 70 and 140 mg/dL, 98% were in the 70&#x02013;180 mg/dL, and only 1.5% were &#x0003c;70 mg/dL&#x02014;a precision that could not be achieved during the overnight period on sedentary days during OL therapy. Even more important, the CL system outperformed OL pump therapy in this group of very well-controlled adolescents and young adults on nights after afternoon exercise: the proportion of hypo- and hyperglycemic values was significantly lower during CL control, and the number of episodes of hypoglycemia that required treatment because of blood glucose levels &#x0003c;60 mg/dL fell from eight during OL therapy to only one during CL control.</p><p>Episodes of biochemical and treatable episodes of NH were reduced on exercise nights because feedback control of insulin delivery rates allowed the system to automatically reduce basal insulin delivery during the vulnerable 10:00 <sc>p.m.</sc> to 2:00 <sc>a.m.</sc> period. It is also noteworthy that mean reference blood glucose levels during the overnight period with CL control during both sedentary and exercise days were nearly identical to the PID algorithm&#x02019;s 120 mg/dL target setting (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, regardless of prior daytime activity level, the CL system achieved a similar proportion of time spent within a targeted range of 70&#x02013;180 mg/dL (CL exercise vs. CL exercise: <italic>P</italic> = 0.23). Thus, CL therapy was both safe and effective in allowing optimization of glycemic control under both sedentary and exercise conditions.</p><p>As per the DirecNet protocol, during OL control in this study patients remained on the same overnight basal rates on both sedentary and exercise days. While many clinicians may recommend temporary reductions in overnight basal rates in pump-treated patients to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia on nights after afternoon exercise, there are no clear guidelines for the duration and extent of reduction in basal rates, which is likely to vary from patient to patient and depends on the type of exercise. It is not surprising that previous reports have shown that use of this strategy often results in nocturnal hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).</p><p>The current study was conducted as a proof-of-concept assessment of the effects of exercise on CL performance, and our data provide compelling evidence regarding the effectiveness of CL insulin delivery in reducing the risk of NH regardless of prior daytime activity. Recently, the first outpatient testing of an artificial pancreas in a transitional setting of a camp demonstrated that use of such insulin delivery modalities can decrease NH while providing tighter glycemic control than could be achieved with SAP therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Nevertheless, a number of obstacles remain before this technology can be safely used in the outpatient home setting. The major obstacle that needs to be overcome is to minimize the risk of patient injury due to overdelivery of insulin because of a system malfunction. As CL insulin delivery is determined by sensor glucose values, it is critical to have uninterrupted sensor data; thus, in the current study, two sensors were placed so that should a sensor fail, the alternate sensor signal could be used and thus prevent placement of a new sensor. Development of orthogonal sensors or systems that have more than one electrochemical sensor may provide redundancy to the system without necessitating the placement of two sensors. Better sensor accuracy, greater integrity of radiofrequency transmissions, and enhanced ease of patient use are among the improvements that are needed to translate this technology into outpatient treatment. In the meantime, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia by automatically reducing or temporarily suspending pump basal insulin infusion rates based on projected low glucose levels is an area of intense research interest.</p><p>Our findings extend the findings of previous studies that sought to assess the effectiveness of CL systems on overnight glucose control in patients with type 1 diabetes. In those investigations, studies were carried out on sedentary days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) or days with shorter periods of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). While the system could not decrease the rate of hypoglycemia that occurred during exercise, our data indicate that compared with OL therapy, CL insulin delivery is an effective means to ensure adequate glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia in the overnight period, even on nights after vigorous and prolonged afternoon exercise. It should also be noted that CL control markedly reduced but did not fully eliminate the incidence of NH during exercise and sedentary days. Thus, other approaches including improved algorithms or a bihormonal system that includes small rescue doses of glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) may still be needed to completely eliminate the problem of NH.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
