Colchicine is an ancient drug-at least 2,000 years old, which is attracting renewed interest because of its actions at a subcellular level. Many studies during the past years have elucidated a variety of previously unsuspected drug actions and have demonstrated the varying effectiveness of colchicine therapy for a surprisingly broad array of diseases including recurrent aphthous stomatitis, Behcet's disease, familial Mediterranean fever, polymyositis, and scleroderma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The pharmacodynamics of colchicine as an anti-fibrotic agent is well-established by various <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] warranting its use in the treatment of various diseases associated with fibrosis. The long held view that colchicine's anti-inflammatory actions are specific for gout is no longer tenable. Perhaps the most important anti-inflammatory properties of colchicine are related to the drug's effect on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocyte chemotaxis, leukocyte adhesiveness, the drug's action in potentiating factors that increase leukocyte cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, thereby, inhibiting lysosomal degranulation that accompanies phagocytosis and its effect on the release of prostaglandin E, which suppresses the leukocyte function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effects of colchicine on fibroblasts and collagen fibers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="DRJ-10-527-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Hence, the exciting combination of an anti-fibrotic agent along with anti-inflammatory properties of a drug that is surprisingly well tolerated, easily available, and cost effective, prompted us to embark on this study.

The patients for the study were selected from those who visited our department. A formal ethical clearance to conduct this study was given by the Ethical Committee of the institute. An informed consent was obtained from the patients before including them in the study. A detailed case history of the patient with emphasis on their habits (chewing betel nut, pan parag, etc.) and a thorough clinical examination was recorded on a standard proforma. A clinical diagnosis of OSF was made based on the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria and the patients were graded clinically according to Gupta Dinesh Chandra S. <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The diagnosis was confirmed histopathologically by a punch biopsy of the lesion. Hematoxylin and Eosin and van Gieson's stains were used to analyze the staining intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate and the density of collagen fibrils, respectively, in the pre and post treatment biopsy specimens. Fifty patients (41 males and nine females) in the age group of 15 years to 55 years, thus diagnosed as having OSF, were included in the study and were divided randomly into two groups for the purpose of treatment. Group 1-Patients were administered orally tablet colchicine (Tablet Zycolchine, Zydus Cadila Healthcare Ltd., Ahmedabad, Gujrat, India) 0.5 mg twice daily. Hyaluronidase 1,500 IU was mixed in 1 ml of lignocaine. 0.5 ml of this solution was injected intralesionally in each buccal mucosa once a week. Baseline liver function tests, serum urea, and creatinine were done for these patients to rule out any existing hepatic pathology and the tests were repeated once every month during the study period and one month following cessation of treatment. Group 2-Patients were administered intralesional injection of Hyaluronidase 1,500 IU as in group 1 and 0.5 ml of injection Hydrocortisone acetate 25 mg/ml in each buccal mucosa once a week alternatively. Patients in both the groups were asked to discontinue all betel nut chewing habits during the entire study period.</p><p>Both groups were treated for 12 weeks. Post-treatment punch biopsy was taken one week after the cessation of treatment for histopathological evaluation. Patients were asked to observe for any local allergic symptoms as itching, redness or ulcerations at the site of injection or if any constitutional symptoms developed and to report the same immediately. Treatment was discontinued in such patients. During the subsequent visits the patient's response to the treatment procedures was recorded with emphasis on ascertaining the amelioration of specific symptoms like burning sensation, trismus, and intolerance to hot and spicy foods. Clinical examination of the oral mucosa, site of lesion, margins, extension, color and surface texture and presence of fibrotic bands was recorded. The interincisal opening of the mouth was recorded during each visit [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>]. Pre and post treatment histopathological specimens were compared for the inflammatory cells and fibrous tissue [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>].

Sixty-four percent of the patients complained of both trismus and burning sensation. All the patients had an areca nut chewing habit, either in the form of betel nut or other commercially available products like Pan Parag, Pan masala, Gutka etc. Additional habit of smoking was observed in only one male patient. The buccal mucosae were affected in all the patients, however, only five showed tongue involvement.

The results are not predictable with some therapies and none has been consistently successful.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In 2001, Haque <italic>et al</italic>., successfully treated 29 OSF patients with recombinant interferon gamma (rhIFN-&#x003b3;) and concluded that IFN-&#x003b3; may reverse OSF. They tried IFN-&#x003b3; in OSF based on the studies which showed that systemic recombinant IFN-&#x003b3; improved the mouth opening, musculoskeletal, and pulmonary efficiency in patients with scleroderma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] In view of the female predilection, its presentation in middle life and histological similarities, the analogy that OSF is an &#x0201c;idiopathic scleroderma of mouth&#x0201d; seems reasonable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Collagen fibrils in OSF are more embryonic in nature with a defective maturation similar to scleroderma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Canniff <italic>et al</italic>., showed that OSF and scleroderma were similar with an increased frequency of HLA &#x02014; DR3 and haplotypic pairs B 8/DR3 in the latter and HLA &#x02014; DR3 A10 and B 7 in the former.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] However, there is difficulty in the availability of IFN-&#x003b3; and the cost of this agent is high in developing countries. Considering the shortcomings of all previous treatment modalities for OSF and the positive observations of the study by Haque <italic>et al</italic>., we have studied the effects of colchicine in the management of OSF.</p><p>The patients in group 1 showed an early reduction in the burning sensation. There was also a significant improvement in the mouth opening and in the movement of the tongue (clinical grade 5). The histopathological findings also showed a marked reduction in the inflammatory cell infiltrate and density of collagen fibrils. The mechanism by which colchicine improved the clinical status of OSF patients in our study was difficult to ascertain since the drug was used in combination with Hyaluronidase. Also since this was the first study where cochicine had been used in the treatment of OSF, we could not compare our results. However, we attributed them to the effect of colchicine which is both an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent. Like IFN-&#x003b3;, colchicine also reduces collagen synthesis, down regulates fibroblast proliferation and upregulates anti-fibrotic cytokine and collagenase synthesis in the basal layer of the epithelium and lamina propria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] One of our patients, however, showed relapse of the restricted mouth opening during the follow-up of 6 months after the cessation of treatment. The cause of the relapse could be due to a number of factors like the dosage being less for that particular individual or the non-compliance of treatment by the patient.</p><p>Colchicine has been reported to be beneficial in the treatment of diseases associated with fibrosis in animals and human beings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The short and long term administration of colchicine therapy in moderate dosages is surprisingly well tolerated. None of our patients reported any local or systemic adverse reactions during treatment and also after the cessation of drug intake. The most common toxic side effect reported reflect the drug's action on rapidly proliferating gastrointestinal tract epithelial cells and include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. These symptoms are especially frequent at dosage levels 2-3 mg/day although they are rapidly and completely reversible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] It is possible that the dosage we used in our study, i.e. 0.5 mg colchicine administered orally twice a day, is an acceptable dosage, because at this dosage the patients achieved significant therapeutic results with no adverse reaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Large amounts of the drug and its metabolites enter the liver and then the bile and, hence, should not be administered to patients with hepatic disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] Follow-up blood cell count should also be performed periodically and medication stopped if the toxic effects develop. Tests to determine baseline serum urea nitrogen, creatinine levels, a complete blood cell count, and liver function test, performed prior to initiating the treatment and during follow-up of our patients also recorded values within the normal range.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The encouraging results should prompt a clinical trial on more number of OSF patients to broaden the therapeutic usefulness and applications of one of our most ancient treatment agents. This baseline study gives scope for further studies with the systemic use of colchicine alone in the treatment of OSF, and, also for research in the use of the drug as a formulation that can be administered locally into the fibrous bands to confirm the above results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
