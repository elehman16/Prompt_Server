In addition to localizer/scout images and calibration images, the following scans were acquired: dual echo proton density (PD) and T2-weighted image (WI), 3D-inversion recovery fast-spoiled-gradient recalled (IR-FSPGR), T1-WI, spin-echo (SE) T1-WI with (patients only) and without Gd contrast, fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), PD-weighted (used as the magnetization transfer unsaturated M<sub>0</sub> image) and PD-weighted with magnetization transfer (M<sub>S</sub>). Conventional 2D scans (PD/T2, FLAIR and T1 SE pre- and post-contrast) were acquired with consistent voxel size (48 slices of 3 mm slice thickness, with FOV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.6, matrix&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;256&#x000d7;256 and phase FOV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.75), and slice selection (oblique axial images parallel to the subcallosal plane).The PD M<sub>0</sub> was acquired with 3 mm slice thickness, FOV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.6, phase FOV&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.75, matrix 256&#x000d7;256, TR&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2400, TE&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22 and FA&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;90. The PD M<sub>S</sub> was acquired identically to the M<sub>0</sub> except for the addition of a magnetization transfer pulse with an offset of 1200 Hz. Patients received a single dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of Gd contrast. HCs did not receive contrast injection. All participants were positioned in the scanner to maximize comfort and minimize head movement.

Secondary endpoints were the volumes of tissue significantly increasing and significantly decreasing in VW-MTR value from baseline to 12 weeks and from 12 to 24 weeks in NABT, and increasing and decreasing VW-MTR values at 24 weeks versus baseline in T2, T1 and Gd-enhancing lesions.</p><p>The VW-MTR analysis was previously described in detail <xref rid="pone.0091098-Dwyer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.

Misclassification of T1 hypointensities were avoided using an in-house-developed inpainting technique; 4) VW-MTR maps were generated by a voxel-wise application of the standard MTR formula ([(M<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;M<sub>S</sub>)/M<sub>0</sub>]&#x000d7;100); 5) VW-MTR difference maps were created by subtracting VW-MTR map pairs based on longitudinal time points; 6) Threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) was applied to the difference maps to increase classification sensitivity; 7) A Monte Carlo process was used to derive statistically rigorous probability values associated with the TFCE-generated voxel clusters; 8) Voxels were classified as increasing or decreasing in NABT, T2, T1 and T1+Gd lesion volumes and 9) Image quality control was performed at every stage, beginning with the quality control of the raw input images.</p><p>Frequency and number of adverse events (AEs) in HCs and patients over the duration of the study were recorded.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>A total of 40 subjects, comprising 25 patients and 15 HCs, were planned to be enrolled.</p><p>All statistical tests were two-tailed and considered significant at the &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 level of significance.

Secondary objectives were the measurement of changes in VW-MTR LV over 24 weeks and in NABT from baseline to 12 weeks and from 12 to 24 weeks following treatment with IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC, as well as safety.</p><p>The increases and decreases in VW-MTR observed in the study serve as indications of possible remyelinating and demyelinating processes occurring in NABT, T2, T1 and Gd-enhancing lesions of patients <xref rid="pone.0091098-Dwyer1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. For NABT, increases in VW-MTR in patients were much greater than those observed in HCs, but the variation was such that the difference fell short of significance at 24 weeks. It is possible that loss of statistical power by 24 weeks contributed to this result, as MRI data for 2 patients and 2 HCs were not available for the Week 24 comparison, thus reducing the already small sample size available for statistical analysis. From baseline to 12 weeks, NABT tissue volume with increasing VW-MTR was significantly greater in patients compared with HCs (unadjusted p-value), which could suggest that IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC treatment may be associated with an early surge in remyelinating activity. This is consistent with the effect of type I IFNs suggested in a virus-infected SJL/J mouse model of MS (Theiler&#x02019;s murine encephalomyelitis), in which short-term treatment (5 weeks) led to a significant increase in remyelinated spinal cord white matter <xref rid="pone.0091098-Njenga1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>When the data from individual patients were analyzed, the large variations observed are attributed to very high increasing VW-MTR volumes in 3 patients (ID #s 29, 03, 25). Similarly, for T2 lesions, increases in VW-MTR appeared to be driven by a small number of patients. The sensitivity of the VW-MTR imaging technique enabled the distinction of this subpopulation of patients, and suggested that remyelination in these patients was very prominent. However, the results need to be verified by a larger study.</p><p>The between-patient variability in tissue volume with changing VW-MTR is consistent with previous VW-MTR studies <xref rid="pone.0091098-Zivadinov2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. A profound diversity in the amount of remyelination between cases has also been observed by immunohistochemistry, with evidence of extensive remyelination occurring in RRMS and progressive disease <xref rid="pone.0091098-Patrikios1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. As histopathological analysis of a Gd-enhancing lesion has been shown to correlate with VW-MTR <xref rid="pone.0091098-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, further validation of VW-MTR extrapolation to remyelination and demyelination by histopathology may help better define this relationship <xref rid="pone.0091098-Chen3" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Baseline disease activity may affect treatment response; having a high number of Gd-enhancing lesions was expected to result in little increasing VW-MTR activity in NABT <xref rid="pone.0091098-Chen2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the 2 patients (ID #s 29, 03) with the greatest number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline (22 and 9 lesions, respectively) had markedly increased VW-MTR changes in NABT, suggesting that higher inflammatory activity may correlate with much higher remyelination. From this study, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn as to whether IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC treatment caused the observed higher remyelination, as untreated patients were not studied. However, the results are intriguing and it is interesting to speculate that IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC may be exerting an anti-inflammatory effect, which is then influencing the remyelination process. Investigations of correlations between the effect of IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC on Gd-enhancing lesions and VW-MTR changes would be interesting. An explanation for those patients where increasing VW-MTR activity was sparse might be that prior repeated demyelinating and remyelinating processes within lesions could have destroyed oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, leading to inhibition of progenitor cell maturation <xref rid="pone.0091098-John1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091098-Prineas1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> or axonal inhibition of remyelination <xref rid="pone.0091098-Charles1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Of the 5 patients who had a relapse during the study, VW-MTR changes in NABT and LV were moderate to small, or negligible in magnitude, relative to patients without relapse. Generally, decreasing VW-MTR appeared to be more prominent than increasing VW-MTR in the 4 patients who each had one relapse. For the patient with four relapses (ID # 07), VW-MTR changes were small; notably, decreasing VW-MTR was dominant over increasing VW-MTR in NABT, while increasing VW-MTR was greater than decreasing VW-MTR in T2-LV, T1-LV and Gd-enhancing LV.</p><p>As expected, decreasing VW-MTR in NABT measured versus baseline at 12 and 24 weeks and in T2-LV at 24 weeks was significantly greater in patients than in HCs, supporting the validity and sensitivity of the VW-MTR imaging technique for measuring ongoing demyelinating processes in the RRMS disease state.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Factors Affecting Measurement of Myelin Content by VW-MTR</title><p>The significant changes from baseline to 24 weeks in VW-MTR activity in NABT volume within both the patient and HC groups and in T2-LV and T1-LV within the patient group are suggestive of dynamic shifts occurring in myelin content. It then follows that a numerically greater degree of change in VW-MTR signal occurred in patients than in HCs in all areas measured is suggestive of greater dynamic shifts in myelin content. The reasons for this are unknown but are assumed to be due to the RRMS disease state, although, without an untreated control RRMS group, an effect due to treatment with IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC cannot be ruled out. It has to be noted that subtle movement artifacts may be an important confounding source in the VW-MTR analysis. However, we believe we have adequately controlled for this in two ways. First, motion artifacts tend to create high-frequency, disconnected &#x0201c;ridges&#x0201d;, which are not generally picked up by the TFCE approach that we used to preprocess the data. Second, and more directly, we specifically included motion artifacts in our quality control checks, and manually removed them if detected.</p><p>The VW-MTR imaging technique has advantages over conventional MRI because its voxel-wise approach to image processing avoids the definition of <italic>a priori</italic> ROIs inherent to other MRI approaches, thereby reducing background noise and increasing sensitivity to a level capable of reporting on more subtle or heterogeneous tissue changes (e.g., myelination processes in NABT) not normally detectable by ROI-based approaches. On the other hand, potential confounding influences on the sensitivity of VW-MTR to myelination processes in lesions may result from rapid, transient changes in re- and demyelination events and to the associated edema that accompanies inflammation during the acute period of lesion formation. In the brains of 7 patients with MS, significant correlation was found between water content and MTR, indicating that inflammation and edema influence MTR in those patients, and so decreasing MTR may not be exclusively due to demyelination <xref rid="pone.0091098-Vavasour1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, post-lesion MTR values appear to stabilize after 6 months <xref rid="pone.0091098-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, giving confidence that mean MTR changes are unlikely to be affected by transient inflammation and edema and better reflect pure myelination processes after this time point. The changes in the NABT VW-MTR due to edema resolution are even less likely after 6 months. Edema itself may correlate poorly with myelin content; the conclusion from an <italic>ex vivo</italic> study in rat spinal cord was that intercompartmental exchange of water between myelin and non-myelin compartments may cause the myelin water fraction to underestimate the true myelin content of tissue. However, MTR metrics appear to be insensitive to intercompartmental water exchange in comparisons with multi-exponential T2 relaxation MRI measures <xref rid="pone.0091098-Dula1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model <xref rid="pone.0091098-Gareau1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, MTR and myelin water percentage appeared to measure different aspects of pathology, and modulation of inflammatory activity did not correlate with myelin water percentage.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Safety</title><p>There were no unexpected AEs reported following treatment with IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC, which was well-tolerated by patients in this study.

The use of VW-MTR as a possible indication of remyelination is still an emerging technique; further validation is required to discount confounding effects as described above that could cause increasing tissue volumes that are detected by VW-MTR.</p><p>The potential benefit of IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC on remyelination as measured by VW-MTR in a head-to-head comparison with untreated or comparator-treated patients was not measured. However, the inclusion of a HC group allowed evaluation of this technique for normal variation between individuals, against which changes in VW-MTR could be compared. Use of HCs for comparison with a patient population in prospective longitudinal pilot studies of non-conventional MRI, including VW-MTR, may become an attractive approach in the future for several reasons. First, the ultimate goal of therapy is to normalize patient VW-MTR changes over time or to reduce variability over time, to those observed in HCs over the same time period. HCs also experience brain changes over time and so the notion of arresting disease progression as measured by VW-MTR requires validation by reference to a comparator without disease progression to account for age-related changes. Second, ethical considerations preclude placebo-controlled studies using an established MS treatment versus placebo-treatment in patients with RRMS. An alternative would be to measure VW-MTR prior to starting treatment; however, this is more difficult from a practical and ethical point of view, as the window of switching from old to new treatments is very narrow in patients with MS at present time and the feasibility of enrolling sufficient numbers of patients with MS who were na&#x000ef;ve to treatment was deemed to be low.</p><p>Another limitation that should be considered in any future study is that transient, intermittent, and/or longer term effects of treatment with IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC may have been missed by the short duration and limited number of VW-MTR measurement timepoints of this pilot study. As already mentioned, early stage remyelination events occurring in lesions that are still active may be unstable <xref rid="pone.0091098-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, so that formation of persistent, remyelinated shadow plaques earlier in the disease time course will be sparse in contrast to what is observed in inactive lesions of later-stage disease <xref rid="pone.0091098-Patrikios1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Previously, a 1-year study was extended to a 2-year follow-up due to evidence of the sensitivity of VW-MTR as a means to monitor disease activity in patients with MS <xref rid="pone.0091098-Zivadinov2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Significant increases and decreases in MTR have been shown to be ongoing for 7 and 33 months, respectively, in a 3-year study on various regions of acute Gd-enhancing lesions <xref rid="pone.0091098-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. As potential remyelination follows onset of demyelination <xref rid="pone.0091098-Patrikios1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, a future study design with more frequent VW-MTR measurement timepoints to measure the relative time courses of VW-MTR decreases and increases may capture the temporal signature of RRMS. A benefit of a longer-term study measuring sustained remyelinating effects, in addition to gaining insights on whether and how IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC influences re- and demyelination, would be to minimize any bias in interpretation of VW-MTR measurement by transient fluid shifts. As the magnitude of change from baseline to Week 24 is larger than from baseline to Week 12, enrollment of larger patient and HC populations in future studies would allow for adequate power to detect interesting signals, and would also allow for better characterization of the localizations of VW-MTR changes. Given the small sample and relatively short follow-up, the study was not sufficiently powered to perform spatial mapping of changes in a meaningful way. However, in the previous study, we noted possible regional specificity of the localizations of VW-MTR changes with increases in VW-MTR being more confined to the frontal lobes and the decreases in VW-MTR being more confined to the parietal and occipital lobes <xref rid="pone.0091098-Zivadinov2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A significant change in NABT volume with increasing VW-MTR was observed in patients with RRMS following treatment with IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC tiw at 12 weeks. Further studies are required to investigate this as a possible treatment effect. This study further validates VW-MTR as a potentially valuable and sensitive tool for understanding the complicated pathological processes underlying RRMS. The considerable patient-dependent variability in VW-MTR changes in NABT and lesion volumes suggests that there may be heterogeneity in the population examined, which would merit further research in a larger and longer-term study to understand potential correlations between advanced MRI activity, disease activity and duration and relapses. In particular, it would be valuable to identify patients who would benefit most from MS therapies like IFN &#x003b2;-1a SC in terms of remyelination and whether the significant increase in VW-MTR signal suggestive of remyelinating activity in patients seen at 12 weeks can be sustained long-term.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0091098.s001"><label>Checklists S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0091098.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0091098.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0091098.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Sara Hussein for technical assistance in performing some of the work described in this article, and Esther Law and Chris Grantham of Caudex Medical for assistance in preparing the initial draft of the manuscript, collating the comments of authors and other named contributors including assembling tables and figures.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0091098-Barkhof1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
