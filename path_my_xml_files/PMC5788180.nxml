Earlier research suggested that brief exercise leads to sudden water loss and temperature reduction in the airways triggering bronchoconstriction, but these specific physicochemical exercise responses occur similarly in people both with and without a history of asthma (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Why these airway perturbations lead to bronchoconstriction in susceptible individuals is not clear. In a previous study, we induced ovalbumin (OVA) sensitivity in rats by parenteral OVA and then exposed the animals to aerosolized OVA or exercise. Bronchoconstriction resulted not only from specific exposure to aerosolized OVA, an expected finding in the previously sensitized rats, but, intriguingly, also from nonspecific exposure to brief exercise (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). These results add to the evidence that there is an exercise-associated inflammatory mechanism in EIB.</p><p id="P6">A brief bout of exercise leads to marked increases in circulating leukocytes in children and adults, and alters leukocyte gene expression (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The pattern of circulatory mediators that changes after acute exercise (e.g., the increase in both cortisol and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) suggests a highly regulated inflammatory response in which both pro- and anti-inflammatory processes are activated (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Stressful and inflammatory states and diseases cause a downregulation of leukocyte glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), and Bonifazi et al. (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) showed that highly trained athletes had reduced GR expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.</p><p id="P7">The goal of this research was to test the immediate impact of a brief exercise challenge and the longer-term effect of an 8-week exercise training intervention on GR expression in circulating leukocytes in adolescents with and without asthma. We undertook this exploratory study to better understand 1) why brief exercise is a major trigger of bronchoconstriction in children with asthma and 2) somewhat paradoxically, why physical fitness is associated with better asthma control across the lifespan (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Circulating leukocytes play a mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of bronchoconstriction (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and acute exercise challenges alter gene expression and function of many asthma-related pathways in circulating leukocytes(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that acute exercise challenges and exercise training would affect leukocyte GR expression, a gateway and control point for the many stress and inflammatory functions associated with asthma (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p id="P8">In the present study, we examined for the first time the impact of both acute exercise and an exercise training intervention on leukocyte GR protein expression (by flow cytometry) and gene expression (RT-PCR) in adolescents with and without asthma. Moreover, since the gene expression response to exercise varies among the leukocyte subtypes (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), we isolated and separately identified the exercise effect on monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes.</p><p id="P9">Brief exercise is often used as an aid in the diagnosis or characterization of asthma. While such challenges are highly specific, their sensitivity (using most current protocols) is poor. Why many asthmatic adults and children with a convincing history of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction do not manifest airway obstruction during in-laboratory testing remains enigmatic. Nonetheless, we did measure standardized pulmonary function before and after the brief exercise challenges and evaluated other gas exchange markers of airway function [e.g., the relationship between ventilation (&#x00056;&#x00307;E) and CO<sub>2</sub> production (&#x00056;&#x00307;CO<sub>2</sub>) during exercise (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7" sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p id="P10">Fourteen healthy and 12 asthmatic adolescents (ages 14-17 years) participated in the study.

Dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to determine body composition, including lean body mass, and percent body fat, using a Hologic QDR 4500 densitiometer (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA). DXA scans were performed and analyzed using pediatric software.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Pulmonary Function Testing</title><p id="P12">Spirometry was performed at baseline and 10-15 mins after exercise challenge.

After sitting comfortably without pedaling (&#x0201c;resting) on the cycle ergometer for 3 min and 1 min of unloaded pedaling, the work rate (WR) was incremented at 10&#x02013;20 W/min to the limit of the subject's tolerance. Subjects were vigorously encouraged during the high-intensity phases of the exercise protocol. Gas exchange was measured breath-by-breath and peak &#x00056;&#x00307;O<sub>2</sub> was calculated as the highest 20-second rolling average in the last minute of exercise.

The work rate was individualized for each subject and was calculated to be equivalent to the work rate corresponding roughly to 50% of the work rate between the respiratory anaerobic threshold and the peak oxygen uptake. On average, this work rate was equivalent to 75% of the participants' peak &#x00056;&#x00307;<sc>o</sc><sub>2</sub>.

Two ml whole blood was aliquoted to be used immediately for leukocyte immune-phenotyping and intracellular staining of the GR using flow cytometry. The remaining blood was used to separate plasma for cortisol and cytokine analysis. A second 10 ml EDTA-treated peripheral blood was collected to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) on a subset of healthy and asthmatic adolescents.

This model included training, gender, group (health vs. asthma) main effects, and interactions. Next, a set of models accounting for subject inter-correlations among repeated measures was run within each leukocyte subtype, evaluating differences related to acute exercise challenge and exercise training, gender, and group (healthy vs. asthma). Secondary analyses included a set of models evaluating acute and training effects on absolute leukocyte subtype counts.

GR levels on leukocytes may also change over a short period of time through, for example, phosphorylation of GR (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>).</p><p id="P41">We speculate that acute downregulation of the GR on leukocytes may represent a period of increased vulnerability to triggers leading to bronchoconstriction, similar to the increase in susceptibility to upper respiratory tract infections following acute bout of exercise thought to be related to short-term suppression of the immune system (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S33"><title>Effect of Exercise Training Intervention on GR Protein Expression</title><p id="P42">We found a significant decrease in GR expression on T lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and CD16dim cells with training (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>). Improved fitness has been shown to improve asthma symptoms and airway inflammation in asthmatics. Furthermore, aerobic training has been associated with a decreased need for glucocorticoids in asthmatics (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests a role for the GR in mediating the anti-inflammatory effects of exercise training. Animal models of asthma suggest that aerobic training is associated with an anti-inflammatory effect through various mechanisms including reduction in NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; levels (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), GR expression (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), or anti-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In an animal asthma model, Silva et al. found that aerobic training increased the expression of GR in the airway smooth muscle, as well as expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines leading to decreased airway inflammation and inflammatory mediators (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). This finding in airway smooth muscle differs from our findings in leukocyte subtypes; however, GR expression and regulation vary considerably between tissues (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p id="P43">In one study of subjects undergoing different training regimes, highly trained athletes were found to have lower levels of GR-&#x003b1; mRNA compared to low-trained and untrained subjects in PBMCs (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In another study of healthy males, exercise training was associated with a significant reduction in GR mRNA, as well as NFK&#x003b2;1 in mononuclear cells with concomitant reduction in cytokine concentrations and basal cortisol levels (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p id="P44">Given the high prevalence of steroid treatment in many diseases, there is a surprising lack of clinical studies focused on mechanisms of GR regulation. GR expression is decreased following treatment with steroids, but is also decreased following an acute stress (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Our results showing decreased GR expression in both acute exercise and an exercise intervention illustrate a possible paradox (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> and 7). We found that acute exercise is associated with decreased expression of GR and may represent a brief period of increased vulnerability to triggers, leading to bronchoconstriction. Decreased GR is associated with increased severity of illness in critically ill children in the pediatric intensive care unit (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p><p id="P45">We speculate that exercise training (involving repeated bouts of exercise) downregulates the stress response in general, and will render individuals less susceptible to triggers and bronchoconstriction (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). This healthy adaptation phenomenon may be an example of hormesis, where repeated exposures of a stress, such as acute exercise, can elicit adaptive changes allowing individuals to withstand greater stress (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Environmental stressors, such as exercise or the microbial environment, may activate the immune system, particularly the innate immune system, and protect against development or worsening of asthma (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). For adolescents prone to asthma, increased tolerance of stress and inflammation may help explain why improving fitness improves asthma control and symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="S34"><title>GR Expression in Asthma</title><p id="P46">We found no differences in GR protein expression between healthy controls and adolescents with asthma using flow cytometry. We also did not find any differences in GR mRNA expression between controls and asthmatics, although our sample size of asthmatics was small. This is consistent with previous studies where levels of GR mRNA or protein levels did not differ between healthy and asthmatic participants with varying degrees of severity (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Perisic et al. found that GR binding affinity in mononuclear cells was decreased, while the number of GR was increased, in moderate asthmatic adolescents compared to mild asthmatics and healthy subjects. The investigators did not examine responsiveness to steroids (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S35"><title>Gene Expression</title><p id="P47">We selected a small group of genes known to be involved in the GR pathway. We found that HSP70 gene expression in PBMCs was significantly increased following acute exercise challenge. Additionally, we found that baseline levels of HSP70 were decreased after exercise training. HSP70 in skeletal muscle and circulating leukocytes is affected by acute bouts of exercise (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) and also interacts with GR through partial unfolding that results in GR ligand release and inactivation (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). From our flow cytometry data, it is clear that GR expression varies among different leukocyte subtypes; this might explain why it would be difficult to identify effects of individual leukocyte subtypes in the heterogeneous population of PBMCs. We found no differences in gene expression of NR3C1, GR &#x003b2;, and TGF&#x003b2;1 and 2 in response to acute or exercise training. We only selected a small group of genes related to glucocorticoid function and therefore could have missed others that were not examined.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S36"><title>Study Limitations</title><p id="P48">While GR expression is only one factor that explains glucocorticoid responsiveness, we did not measure GR function, for example, with dexamethasone stimulation, which could provide further insight into the role of GR in acute and exercise training. Gene expression was performed in PBMCs on a small number of targeted genes and there may be differences in expression of genes that influence GR that were untested. Further, the gene expression pattern of specific leukocyte subtypes may not be reflected in the larger PBMC sample. Indeed, we have found that the pattern of gene expression in response to acute exercise among circulating leukocytes is cell-type specific (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). There are data from animal models that even within a specific leukocyte subtype patterns of gene expression differ from cells residing in specific tissues compared with circulating cells (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). In our studies in children, we could only safely access circulating leukocytes, and it is quite possible that gene expression (and, perhaps, GR quantity) differs between the circulating pool and the pulmonary pool of cells. It is noteworthy that the concentration of almost all leukocyte subtypes is much higher in the pulmonary circulation than in the peripheral blood, suggesting a possible unique activation of these cells that are in close contact with potentially harmful mediators (e.g., pathogens, pollutants) in the environment. Additional factors in determining glucocorticoid responsiveness include evaluation of different GR isoforms at the protein level. GR isoforms can only be identified using Western blot of proteins and a more accurate assessment of the impact of exercise on GR can be done by examining protein expression of GR isoforms and whether the localization of those isoforms change between cytoplasm and nucleus with exercise. Another limitation of our study was the ability to detect race or ethnic differences in GR expression in our study population. There are several studies that have reported differential race/ethnic responses to corticosteroids, specifically that African-American asthmatics may respond less to corticosteroids compared to other groups (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Finally, we studied a group of self-selected adolescents with asthma that were relatively fit and the majority of asthmatics were under good control. We suspect that children with asthma who volunteer for studies involving exercise may represent patients who are more physically active than those who choose not to volunteer. We speculate that differences in GR expression may be evident in asthmatics who are unfit, are more symptomatic, or do not respond to steroids effectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S37"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="P49">In summary, we found that exercise training decreased GR expression in circulating leukocytes in healthy and asthmatic adolescents and may be one mechanism through which improved fitness leads to improved asthma control and symptoms. Future studies should include looking at the effect of exercise on GR function, different GR isoforms as well as localization of GR between the cytoplasm and nucleus. Finally, this is an exciting time for translational researchers focused on the role of the GR in health and disease. Hapgood et al. recently outlined a remarkable set of glucocorticoid-independent mechanisms through which stress, cytokines, and other factor alter the GR and influence physiological function (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Given the multifactorial nature of the effect of exercise on cellular homeostasis (ranging from changes in temperature and pH to production of stress and growth factors), it is highly likely that some of these newer mechanisms may play a role in the exercise effect on GR in circulating leukocytes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S38"><title>Supplementary

Exercise is a multifactorial perturbation to cellular homeostasis, including: changes in pH and temperature; release of stress cytokines and growth factors; and changes in neuroadrenergic regulation. In the response to an acute bout of exercise, circulating leukocyte GCR is immediately reduced in key leukocyte subtypes. This perhaps creates a period of vulnerability in patients with asthma, rendering them more susceptible to additional triggers of bronchoconstriction. Paradoxically, the effect of the longer-term exercise training was a sustained reduction in GCR on circulating leukocyte subtypes. This may represent a longer-term downregulation of the GCR in response to the repeated elevation in glucocorticoid and other stress hormones [an increasing number of which are now known to alter GR (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)]. Ultimately, how this sustained downregulation of leukocyte GR is related to the clinical observation of improved asthma control in fitter children remains unknown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms858660f6"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Common Genes in Monocytes Altered in Response to Acute Exercise and Associated with the GR Pathway</title></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene Symbol</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gene Name</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Relevant Function</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NR3C1</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02191;</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glucocorticoid receptor.
