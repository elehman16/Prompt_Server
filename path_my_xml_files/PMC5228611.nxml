Eligible participants were HIV-infected adults (aged &#x02265;18 years) who were virologically suppressed (plasma HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies per milliliter) on a current antiretroviral regimen containing DRV boosted by ritonavir (600/100 mg twice daily or 800/100 mg once daily) continuously for at least 4 months before screening. Treatment history included failing at least 2 prior antiretroviral regimens and confirmed resistance by historical genotype to at least 2 different classes of antiretrovirals. Participants must have had no history of integrase inhibitor resistance or be INSTI naive, or be currently suppressed on the following INSTIs [raltegravir, elvitegravir, or dolutegravir (50 mg once daily, but not twice daily)]. We allowed a history of up to 3 thymidine analogue mutations and/or K65R, but no history of Q151M or T69 insertion mutations. Eligible participants could not have any DRV-associated resistance mutations, including V11I, V32I, L33F, I47V, I50V, I54L/M T74P, L76V, I84V, and L89V. The Stanford HIVdb algorithm v8.01 was used to calculate genotypic susceptibility scores (GSS). For each drug, a 5-point scale was used: susceptible, potential low-level resistance, low-level resistance, intermediate-level resistance, and high-level resistance were scored as 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, and 0, respectively. The total genotypic susceptibility scores for a given regimen were calculated as the sum of the scores for each individual drug. Participants had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Cockcroft-Gault formula of at least 50 mL/min.</p><p>We randomized participants in a 2:1 ratio using an interactive voice/web response system to switch to coformulated E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg (Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA) plus DRV 800 mg (Janssen) once daily or to stay on their baseline regimen. E/C/F/TAF plus DRV was supplied by Gilead; participants who continued their baseline regimen obtained treatment by prescription.</p><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

We assessed noninferiority of E/C/F/TAF plus DRV vs. baseline regimens using a 2-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) approach (alpha level of 0.025), with a prespecified margin of 12%. Because an alpha of 0.00001 was spent on interim analyses at week 12, the significance level for the 2-sided test was adjusted to 0.04999 (corresponding to 95.001% CI).

Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of participants with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c;50 copies per milliliter at week 48 using the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm and the change from baseline in CD4 cell count at weeks 24 and 48.

Overall, steady-state plasma exposure for the components of E/C/F/TAF and DRV was within the safe and efficacious ranges of these analytes. Importantly, PK results of this study demonstrated that the pharmacodynamic (&#x0201c;boosting&#x0201d;) effect of cobicistat on elvitegravir and DRV was maintained upon coadministration of E/C/F/TAF plus DRV, yielding trough concentration levels 10-fold to 22-fold greater than inhibitory and effective concentration thresholds for adequate elvitegravir and DRV antiviral activity.</p><p>Treatment with E/C/F/TAF plus DRV resulted in high rates of virologic suppression. E/C/F/TAF plus DRV was noninferior to continuing on baseline regimens at week 24 and met prespecified criteria for noninferiority and superiority at week 48. No participant discontinued because of lack of efficacy. Virologic failure and treatment discontinuation (because of withdrawal of consent or loss to follow-up) contributed to the lower percentage of virologic success in the baseline regimen group. At week 48, E/C/F/TAF plus DRV was superior for the subgroups of participants either aged &#x0003c;50 years or male; more men were randomized to the E/C/F/TAF plus DRV group than to the baseline regimen group. No new virologic resistance was detected among participants who switched to E/C/F/TAF plus DRV.</p><p>Treatment with E/C/F/TAF plus DRV was well tolerated. Participants in the E/C/F/TAF plus DRV group reported a higher rate of adverse events, which was not unexpected for individuals initiating a novel therapy in comparison with those continuing their well-tolerated baseline regimen in an open-label study. Indeed, as assessed by a validated survey tool, although treatment satisfaction was evenly matched between randomized groups at baseline, satisfaction improved among participants who switched to E/C/F/TAF plus DRV. This observation underscores that, for a population with extensive ART experience including prior complicated regimens, there is an unmet need for more convenient treatment options. Simplified regimens improve adherence, as demonstrated in the current study in which participants who switched to E/C/F/TAF plus DRV consistently reporting fewer days with missed doses and greater virologic success at 48 weeks than those remaining on their baseline regimens.</p><p>Long-term safety considerations are an important element in antiretroviral simplification strategies. Proteinuria and specifically proximal tubular proteinuria have been shown to increase risk of mortality or cardiovascular events in both the general population and in HIV-infected individuals.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Upon entry into the current study, most participants were receiving regimens containing TDF. Switching to a regimen containing TAF improved glomerular and tubular function, including decreases in overall and tubular proteinuria, consistent with results of other TDF to TAF switch studies.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Tenofovir (but not TAF) is actively transported from the blood into renal proximal tubule cells by the organic anion transporters (OAT) 1 and OAT3, resulting in tenofovir accumulation in the proximal tubule.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The marked (&#x0003e;90%) reduction in circulating tenofovir after switching to TAF is likely the reason for the improvements in clinical renal toxicity compared with continuing on TDF.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Participants in our study were representative of the treatment-experienced population who started treatment before the HAART era, with a median age of 49 years, approximately 15 years older than in treatment-naive trials,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and high rates of comorbid conditions, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease. This improved renal safety profile is important in a population of treatment-experienced individuals, who are likely to be older and have more cardiovascular and renal risk factors than a naive population.</p><p>Limitations to this study include the open-label study design; as such, between-group differences in adverse events and subjective safety reports should be interpreted with caution. More robust reporting of adverse events for the experimental arm (E/C/F/TAF plus DRV) may have occurred in this open-label trial. In addition, approximately one-fourth of participants who switched to E/C/F/TAF plus DRV were newly exposed to a new drug class (INSTI), which may have also contributed to additional reporting of adverse events in this group. Another limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size and hence the inability to control for potential imbalance of important factors, such as comorbidities, impacting safety outcomes between the 2 arms. Participants who switched to E/C/F/TAF plus DRV received drugs provided by Gilead; those who continued their baseline regimen obtained treatment by prescription. This difference in study drug supply might have contributed to the difference in the rates of early discontinuation of study drugs. Because this study excluded participants with DRV mutations or more than 3 thymidine analogue mutations, results should not be extrapolated to such individuals.</p><p>Our study provides important guidance for the management of treatment-experienced individuals with multiclass resistance who have traditionally required multitablet &#x0201c;salvage&#x0201d; regimens to maintain virologic suppression. Single-tablet regimens have generally been options only for treatment-naive individuals or those switching therapy without a history of prior resistance. Strategic regimen simplification to the 2-tablet, once daily combination E/C/F/TAF plus DRV was noninferior at 24 weeks and virologically superior at 48 weeks, to remaining on baseline regimens, and was associated with greater patient satisfaction and adherence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="qai-74-193-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e593" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors acknowledge the individuals who participated in this study and the site and study management staff whose efforts made this work possible.
