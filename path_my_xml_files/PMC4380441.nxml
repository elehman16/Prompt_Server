In the present study, we investigated the neural activity caused by re-experiencing the fatigue sensation that had been experienced during a fatigue-inducing session. Thirteen healthy volunteers participated in fatigue and non-fatigue experiments in a crossover fashion. In the fatigue experiment, they performed a 2-back test session for 40 min to induce fatigue sensation, a rest session for 15 min to recover from fatigue, and a magnetoencephalography (MEG) session in which they were asked to re-experience the state of their body with fatigue that they had experienced in the 2-back test session. In the non-fatigue experiment, the participants performed a free session for 15 min, a rest session for 15 min, and an MEG session in which they were asked to re-experience the state of their body without fatigue that they had experienced in the free session. Spatial filtering analyses of oscillatory brain activity showed that the delta band power in the left Brodmann&#x02019;s area (BA) 39, alpha band power in the right pulvinar nucleus and the left BA 40, and beta band power in the left BA 40 were lower when they re-experienced the fatigue sensation than when they re-experienced the fatigue-free sensation, indicating that these brain regions are related to re-experiencing the fatigue sensation.

The Japanese Society of Fatigue Science defined fatigue as a decline in the ability and efficiency of mental and/or physical activities that is caused by excessive mental or physical activities or disease [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 20&#x02013;30% of the general population in European countries and the United States experience substantial fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and in Japan, more than half of the adult population reports experiencing fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Fatigue is often accompanied by a peculiar sense of discomfort, a desire to rest, and a decline in motivation, referred to as fatigue sensation [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Fatigue sensation may impair our functioning. Therefore, it is important to clarify the neural mechanisms underlying fatigue sensation to cope with fatigue related problems prevailing in our society. Fatigue can be classified as acute or chronic, and physical or mental. In this study, we focused on the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation related to acute mental fatigue.</p><p>Several studies have tried to clarify the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation, which has multiple aspects. The level of fatigue sensation induced by performing a prolonged cognitive test was positively correlated with the increase in regional blood flow in the medial orbitofrontal cortex measured using H<sub>2</sub>
<sup>15</sup>O positron emission tomography [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The self-evaluated level of physical and mental fatigue sensation was related to the change in oscillatory power in the posterior cingulate cortex in magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and the self-evaluated level of effort required to perform a mental task was related to the neural activation of the insular cortex in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>One fMRI study asked healthy participants and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients to imagine themselves in fatiguing situations. The neural activity in the posterior cingulate cortex was higher in CFS patients than in healthy participants, and the neural activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was lower in CFS patients than in healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, in this study, the way in which the participants imagined that they were in a fatiguing situation may have been variable, i.e., they might have recalled autobiographical episodes similar to the situation presented in the experiment or they might have mentally simulated the situation without a specific episode in mind. Although this study showed the effectiveness of a fatigue provocation procedure for investigating the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation, restricting the way the participants self-induce the fatigue sensation would enable specific aspects of the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation to be examined and would further increase our understanding of the neural mechanisms related to fatigue sensation.</p><p>Emotion-induction paradigms have been successfully utilized to explore the neural substrates of emotions such as anxiety, anger, sadness, disgust, and happiness [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In an H<sub>2</sub>
<sup>15</sup>O positron emission tomography study, the pattern of neural activity caused by self-induced transient sadness during recalling affect-appropriate life events and looking at sad human faces was different from that caused by self-induced transient happiness, indicating that transient sadness and happiness affect different brain regions in divergent directions [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. An fMRI study of the neural activity caused by symptom provocation in obsessive-compulsive disorder found that a distinct pattern of activation was associated with each symptom of the disorder [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Taking these findings into consideration, investigating the neural substrates related to self-induced fatigue sensation could be an effective approach to further the understanding of the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation in healthy people and patients with fatigue-related diseases such as CFS.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the neural activity induced by re-experiencing a mental fatigue sensation that had actually been experienced by participants during a mental fatigue-inducing session. We hypothesized that past experience related to fatigue sensation is an important factor which contributes to future formation of fatigue sensation through the transfer to memories that are located within specific brain structures and that investigating the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation related to memory would provide valuable clue to understand the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the neural mechanisms of fatigue sensation related to memory in healthy participants. The neural activity during re-experiencing the mental fatigue sensation and the sensation without mental fatigue was recorded with high temporal and spatial resolution using MEG to identify the neural activity related to re-experiencing the mental fatigue sensation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirteen healthy male volunteers (21.7 &#x000b1; 3.3 years of age [mean &#x000b1; SD]) participated in this study.

The level of fatigue sensation that the participants thought to be caused by performing the 2-back task and the level of the fatigue sensation at the beginning of the experiment and before and after the rest session was assessed using a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (minimum fatigue) to 100 (maximum fatigue). At the beginning of the first experiment for each participant, the daily level of fatigue was assessed using Japanese version of the Chalder&#x02019;s fatigue scale [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The Japanese version of the Chalder&#x02019;s fatigue scale consists of 11 questions and the response to each question can be 0 (less than usual), 1 (no more than usual), 3 (more than usual), or 4 (more than usual) during the past several weeks [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>MEG recordings</title><p>MEG recordings were performed in the MEG sessions using a 160-channel whole-head type MEG system (MEG vision; Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) with a magnetic field resolution of 4 fT/Hz<sup>1/2</sup> in the white-noise region.

Epochs of the raw MEG data that included artifacts were visually identified and were excluded from the analyses before averaging. Spatial filtering analysis of the MEG data was performed to identify the changes in oscillatory brain activity that reflected time-locked cortical activities [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] caused by re-experiencing the state of the body with and without fatigue. The MEG data were bandpass filtered at 1&#x02013;4 Hz, 4&#x02013;8 Hz, 8&#x02013;13 Hz, 13&#x02013;25 Hz, and 25&#x02013;58 Hz by a finite impulse response filtering method using Brain Rhythmic Analysis for MEG software (BRAM; Yokogawa Electric Corporation) to obtain delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma signals, respectively. After the bandpass filtering, the location and intensity of the cortical activities were estimated using BRAM, which uses a narrow-band adaptive spatial filtering algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Voxel size was set at 5.0 &#x000d7; 5.0 &#x000d7; 5.0 mm. For each frequency band, the oscillatory power of the MEG data during re-experiencing in the fatigue experiment was calculated relative to the oscillatory power of the MEG data during re-experiencing in the non-fatigue experiment (oscillatory power ratio). To minimize the effects caused by the interruption of the auditory cue, oscillatory power ratio was calculated using MEG data from 2,000 to 4,500 ms after the onset of the off phase of the auditory cue.</p><p>These data were then analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM8, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK), implemented in Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA). The MEG parameters were transformed into the Montreal Neurological Institute T1-weighed image template [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and applied to the MEG data. The anatomically normalized MEG data were filtered with a Gaussian kernel of 20 mm (full-width at half-maximum) in the x-, y-, and z-axes. To enable inferences to be made at a population level, individual data were summarized and incorporated into a random-effect model [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The weighted sum of the parameters estimated in the individual analysis was used to create &#x0201c;contrast&#x0201d; images, which were used for group analyses [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The resulting set of voxel values for each comparison constituted a statistical parametric map (SPM) of the t statistic (SPM{<italic>t</italic>}). The SPM{<italic>t</italic>} was transformed to the units of normal distribution (SPM{Z}). Significant differences in the signal between re-experiencing the state without fatigue and that with fatigue were assessed using <italic>t</italic> statistics on a voxel-by-voxel basis [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

The decrease in the beta band power in the left BA 40 was positively associated with the level of fatigue sensation the participants thought to be caused by performing the 2-back test. The decrease in the alpha band power in the right pulvinar nucleus was positively associated with the daily level of fatigue assessed using the subjective rating scale, i.e., the Chalder&#x02019;s fatigue scale [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Our findings are in line with previous reports related to the neural mechanisms of autographical recollection and self-induced emotions. In an fMRI study that used a semantic memory decision task as a control condition, activation of the left BA 39 and the left BA 40 was related to re-experiencing past events [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In another fMRI study, activation of the left BA 39, left BA 40, and right thalamus was higher during the recollection of emotional autobiographical episodes than during a semantic memory control task [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In a H<sub>2</sub>
<sup>15</sup>O positron emission tomography study, activation of the right thalamus was observed when anxiety and anger were self-induced [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Taking these findings into consideration, the left BA 39, left BA 40, and right thalamus may be related to the re-experiencing and/or recollection of fatigue sensation and the right thalamus may be related to the self-inducing of fatigue sensation required in the process of re-experiencing the fatigue sensation. In the present study, band power was different between the fatigue experiment and the non-fatigue experiment, even though the process of re-experiencing was involved in both experiments. The difference of the band power therefore seems to be related to the contents that were re-experienced, i.e., the fatigue sensation, rather than to the re-experiencing process itself. To support this assumption, the decrease in the beta band power in the left BA 40 was positively associated with the level of fatigue sensation caused by performing the 2-back test.</p><p>In the present study, we observed that the alpha band power in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus was lower in the fatigue experiment than in the non-fatigue experiment. The thalamus is located deep in the brain and the signal-to-noise ratio of the magnetic signal originating from the thalamus may not be sufficient for reliable source estimation. However, there is accumulating evidence that the source of magnetic signals originating from subcortical regions such as the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala can be detected using MEG [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In fact, electromagnetic activity in the thalamus has been detected in MEG studies using adaptive beamformers to estimate source localization [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Together with our finding that the decrease in the alpha band power in the pulvinar nucleus was positively related to the daily level of fatigue, the observed change in the alpha band power in the pulvinar nucleus indicates a role of the pulvinar nucleus in re-experiencing fatigue sensation.</p><p>Changes in the oscillatory band powers in the brain regions such as the PCC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were not observed in our present study. These two brain regions have been reported to be activated in a fatigue-provocation condition in the CFS patients compared with that in the healthy participants [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, it has just been reported that the PCC is involved in the self-evaluation of the level of fatigue [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0122455.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Taking these into consideration, it seems that the contribution of these brain regions to the neural mechanisms related to re-experiencing fatigue sensation is limited, especially in heathy participants.</p><p>There are limitations to our study. First, the number of the participants included in our study was small. To generalize our results, studies with a larger number of participants are needed. Second, neural activity from a deep brain region, i.e., the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, was detected. Further studies with other neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI would be beneficial in confirming the neural activity in this brain region. Third, in some brain regions, the observed decrease in band power may have been related to performing the 2-back test. In fact, the BA 40 is involved in the performance of n-back test trials [<xref rid="pone.0122455.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the change in band power observed in the present study, particularly the decrease in the alpha and beta band power in the BA 40, was caused because the brain regions involved in performing the 2-back task were activated spontaneously when the participants re-experienced the fatigue sensation experienced in the 2-back task session, even though they were instructed not to perform 2-back test in their mind during the MEG session. To clarify this point, studies with fatigue-inducing tasks which do not require the intensive activation of BA 40, such as physical fatigue-inducing tasks or other types of mental fatigue-inducing tasks are needed. Fourth, since the neural activities caused by re-experiencing the fatigue sensation were assessed only in a single session in each experiment, we cannot estimate the recency effect of memory from our present study. In addition, while the time interval between 2-back test session (or free session) and MEG session was relatively short in our present study, it is of great interest whether the neural activities caused by re-experiencing the fatigue sensation after longer time interval from the 2-back test session (e.g., after one week or later) would be different from those observed in our present study.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that neural activity in the left BA 39, left BA 40, and right pulvinar nucleus were likely related to re-experiencing a mental fatigue sensation. Our findings may help clarify the neural mechanisms underlying fatigue sensation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Forte Science Communications for editorial help with the manuscript and Manryoukai Imaging Clinic for MRI scans.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0122455.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
