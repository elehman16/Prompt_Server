Usually, accelerated targets are timed too late and decelerating ones too early. The present experiment sought to investigate whether these differences in performance when intercepting targets moving under constant and accelerated motions change after a short period of practice. The task involved striking targets that moved along a straight track by moving forward a manipulandum that moved along a slide perpendicular to the target&#x02019;s motion. Participants were allocated to one of the three experimental groups, defined according to the type of motion of the moving targets: constant speed, constant acceleration, and constant deceleration. Results showed that after some practice participants were able to intercept (positive and negative) accelerating moving targets as accurately as constant speed targets. These results suggest that people might be able to learn how to intercept accelerating targets, corroborating the results of some recent studies.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Interception</kwd><kwd>Acceleration</kwd><kwd>Practice</kwd><kwd>Movement</kwd><kwd>Timing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>People&#x02019;s responses to moving objects are of two basic types: responses in which the object is contacted&#x02014;called interceptive responses or interceptive actions (Zago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>, for a recent review)&#x02014;and those in which contact is avoided. These responses involve changing the position of the body or a body part, so that it moves into or out of the moving object&#x02019;s path (positioning) and doing so at the right time (timing; Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1980</xref>). Control of response timing has been studied in greater detail than the control of positioning. One reason for this is that response timing can be studied independently of positioning using the coincidence anticipation task in which a person attempts to make a discrete response, such as a button press, at the same moment that a moving object arrives at a specified location (Payne <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1986</xref>; Schmidt and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). Another reason is that a controversial hypothesis concerning the perceptual basis for timing control&#x02014;the tau-hypothesis (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1980</xref>)&#x02014;has been the subject of many empirical studies (see Tresilian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1999</xref>; Wann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>).</p><p>One of the claims of the tau-hypothesis is that the acceleration (specifically, the rate of change of speed) of a moving object is not taken into account in the timing of interceptive actions (Lee and Reddish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1981</xref>). The finding that the human visual system is very poor at detecting and estimating the rate of change of speed (Watamaniuk and Heinen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>; Werkhoven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1992</xref>) lends some support to this idea; a number of empirical studies of human timing performance are also consistent with it when accelerations of both gravitational magnitude (=&#x02009;9.81&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>) (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1983</xref>; Michaels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>) and non-gravitational magnitude (Benguigui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Port et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>; Senot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>) were involved.</p><p>Although it was clear early on that there were a few interceptions that would be impossible to achieve if acceleration were not being taken into account, specifically those involving short falls (&#x0003c;2&#x000a0;m) from rest under gravity (Lacquaniti and Maioli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1989</xref>; Tresilian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>), it is possible that these are special cases that people learn to deal with in a different way (e.g., using the drop height to determine the timing, Tresilian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>; Wann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). However, subsequent studies of interceptions under gravitational magnitude acceleration over greater distances demonstrated that people were able to use internalised information about the gravitational acceleration (a kind of internal model) to time their responses (McIntyre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2001</xref>; Zago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2005</xref>). It is possible that knowledge of the gravitational acceleration is acquired over years of experience with falling objects and so other accelerations might be treated differently. This is plausible given that the magnitude of gravitational acceleration is large compared with other, naturally occurring, continuous accelerations: ignoring the latter would lead to much smaller errors than ignoring gravitational acceleration and Lee&#x02019;s argument that accelerations can be ignored without incurring large errors could plausibly apply (Lee and Reddish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1981</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1983</xref>). However, recent evidence indicates that is not always the case: relevant knowledge of accelerations having gravitational and smaller, non-gravitational magnitudes can be acquired relatively quickly and used in the control of timing (de Rugy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>; La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>; Tresilian and Lonergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>; Zago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>).</p><p>De Rugy et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>) employed a coincidence anticipation task (participants pressed on a force sensor) in which the moving object underwent an accelerative perturbation. The object was a simulated ball rolling down a tube at constant speed; shortly before arriving at the specified target location the tube curved into one of several different concave (downwards) or convex (upwards) humps so that the ball accelerated and decelerated. This affected the time it took to reach the target line. Results showed that participants were able to compensate for most (about 85%) of the effect of these perturbations on the ball&#x02019;s time to arrival within about 300 trials (de Rugy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Performance in constant speed catch trials demonstrated that compensation was (at least in large part) anticipatory rather than an acquired feedback-based reaction to specific stimulus conditions. Although this finding does not demonstrate the acquisition of an internal model of the magnitude of the acceleration, it does demonstrate a role for acquired knowledge in controlling the timing of interceptions involved accelerations of a non-gravitational magnitude.</p><p>Less clear is how people deal with continuous, constant accelerations of non-gravitational magnitudes such as those produced when a moving object rolls or slides up or down an inclined plane or over a flat, frictional surface (La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). It is known that human observers exhibit a number of cognitive misunderstandings about accelerated motions up and down slopes (e.g., Bertamini <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1993</xref>; Hecht <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1993</xref>; Rohrer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2002</xref>), including neglect of acceleration (Ebersbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; studies by Bozzi described in; La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). This suggests that people might show systematic timing errors when intercepting objects undergoing these motions (La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>), which is consistent with the previous studies using accelerations of non-gravitational magnitude (Benguigui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Port et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>). However, as La Scaleia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>) note, there has been surprisingly little empirical study of actually intercepting objects rolling up or down slopes. In one relatively early study, people were found to be able to consistently achieve a high degree of temporal accuracy (to within &#x000b1;17&#x000a0;ms) within relatively few practice trials (typically&#x02009;&#x0003c;50) when hitting targets accelerating under gravity down an inclined track at 1.2 or 2&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup> (Tresilian and Lonergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>, though these authors did not report on how performance changed with practice). Similar findings were reported by La Scaleia et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>) over a much wider range of conditions and using both interceptive and non-interceptive responses. In both these studies, the targets accelerated down an incline (so speed increased) and the incline itself was visible throughout, as was the target&#x02019;s starting location. Thus, neither study examined interception of decelerating targets. Participants in both studies could also view the incline before and during the interception and could see the starting location of the target, which provided advance cues about the target&#x02019;s motion that participants could have learned to use to predict a target&#x02019;s time to arrival.</p><p>In the study reported here, we examined whether people could learn to accurately time interceptions of a moving target that accelerated or decelerated at a constant rate (1.2&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>) and we report how their performance changed with practice. The target&#x02019;s motion was constrained to a horizontally oriented track, so there were no cues provided by an incline. In addition, the participants were provided with no information about the initial conditions of motion (starting position or speed) that could be used to predict time to arrival. The results add to our understanding of the range of conditions in which people can learn to take accelerations into account when timing interceptive actions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Method</title><p>The experimental procedures described in this manuscript were approved by the Ethics Committee of The University of Warwick and were in accordance with the ethical standards of the national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declarations and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-one psychology students (21 men, age range: 19&#x02013;25 years) from The University of Warwick participated voluntarily in the experiments and gave their informed consent prior to commencement of the testing sessions.

The target was fixed on a 2.5&#x000a0;cm wide belt, which was driven by a computer controlled torque motor (Baldor Motors &#x00026; Drivers) around two pulleys 5&#x000a0;m apart. Participants moved a hand-held manipulandum along a linear slide (Starr Industries, Germany) 9.5&#x000a0;cm above and perpendicular to the target drive belt. The manipulandum consisted of a plastic handle mounted on a rectangular plastic block housing a bearing that runs with minimal friction along the linear slide. The target was struck by an aluminium rod (bat), 0.5&#x000a0;cm diameter, which was attached to the front end of the plastic block. To strike the target, the manipulandum had to be moved through a distance (<italic>D</italic>) of 18.4&#x000a0;cm.</p><p>

</p><p>The target was flat and rectangular, 5&#x000a0;cm tall and 7.5&#x000a0;cm in length, made of aluminium material covered with bright green adhesive foam. The target always moved under constant acceleration, either accelerating (<italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x000b1;120&#x000a0;cm/s<sup>2</sup>) or moving with constant speed (constant motion, <italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0). The average speed of the target when in the striking zone on all trials was: 173.59&#x000a0;cm/s (173.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25, 173.65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.15, and 173.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.23&#x000a0;cm/s for constant, accelerated and decelerated motion, respectively); 193.91&#x000a0;cm/s (194.12&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.28, 194.15&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.23, and 193.45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.26&#x000a0;cm/s); and 214.42&#x000a0;cm/s (214.48&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.33, 214.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.25, and 214.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.21&#x000a0;cm/s). These values were estimated when the target&#x02019;s centre reached the central position of the striking zone and the variability around the mean of these values is related to motor jitter.</p><p>The time for which the target was visible up to the moment of interception (viewing time) was varied randomly over trials within a range of 1.0&#x02013;1.2&#x000a0;s (mean&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.1&#x000a0;s). Viewing time was controlled through an electronically controlled liquid crystal display (LCD) goggles which could be switched between an opaque and a transparent state. The goggles were custom made using a normal pair of safety goggles (Monarch, model 061-clear), to which two layers (one internal and another external) of an LCD film were attached. The LCD film (Smart-Tint&#x02122;, Reflex&#x000ae; Glass) changes its state from opaque (OFF mode) to transparent (ON mode) when activated with an electric current of 65&#x000a0;V (&#x000b1;5&#x000a0;V) AC and 1 AMP (OFF&#x02013;ON response time of 100&#x000a0;ms). In opaque mode, the LCD film has an internal haze of 90% and a visible light transmission of 50%, and, respectively, 8 and 70% when in transparent mode. All participants wore these goggles during the whole experiment.</p><p>Infrared emitting diodes (IREDs) were fixed to the carriage in which the target was housed and to the base of the plastic block in which the handle was mounted. The positions of these IREDs were sampled at 200&#x000a0;Hz during experimental trials using an Optotrak Certus&#x000ae; (Northern Digital Inc.) optoelectronic movement recording system and stored on computer disc.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design and procedures</title><p>Before the experiment, participants received general instructions about the task and the equipment used in the experiment. They were instructed to grasp the handle of the sliding manipulandum and to strike the target using one single and continuous movement of their arm, avoiding moving a short distance, slowing down and speeding up, or stopping and then moving the remaining distance to the target. Whether or not the participants followed these instructions was noted by the experimenter in each trial during the data collection and data reduction (i.e. presence of minima in the speed profile), and later excluded from the data analysis (less than 2% of the total amount of trials were excluded). Participants were informed that the trial would start as soon as the LCD goggles became opaque and that after some time, the goggle would became clear allowing them to visualize the target approaching. The time between switching the goggles from opaque to clear at the beginning of the trial ranged from 3 to 3.5&#x000a0;s.</p><p>Participants were randomly allocated to one of the three experimental conditions according to the type of acceleration of the approaching targets: acceleration, deceleration, or constant speed. Participants in the acceleration condition intercepted targets moving with a constant acceleration (<italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;+120&#x000a0;cm/s<sup>2</sup>), whereas the targets moved with constant deceleration (<italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;120&#x000a0;cm/s<sup>2</sup>) in the deceleration condition. Targets in the constant speed condition did not accelerated and moved with constant speed (<italic>a</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0).</p><p>Participants performed a total of 147 trials equally distributed for each target speed (slowest, medium and fastest) and pseudorandomly presented, always avoiding identical speed conditions in consecutive trials. Speeds conditions were defined as a function of the speed of the target at the interception zone. We adopted this procedure to keep the temporal precision for each speed condition the same across the two experimental groups; regardless of the type of acceleration, the targets were moving at. Participants performed all the trials in two blocks of trials with a 3&#x000a0;min resting period just after the 72th trial. In each group, participants were exposed to different sequences of trials which were generated by the computer at the beginning of each session.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data reduction</title><p>All data reductions were performed using the custom LabVIEW&#x02122; software (version 8.1, National Instruments Inc.) using the standard data processing algorithms. Any missing data of the IREDs were interpolated by cubic spline, as long as the number of missing samples did not exceed 10% of the sampling frequency (200&#x000a0;Hz). The position data time series were digitally filtered by dual pass through a second-order Butterworth filter with a cut-off frequency of 20&#x000a0;Hz and then interpolated (using cubic spline) to 1000&#x000a0;Hz. This software re-sampling post-filtering is essentially equivalent to hardware sampling at 1000 HZ, since the original sampling (200&#x000a0;Hz) was well above the Nyquist limit for human limb movements&#x02014;such movements do not contain signal frequencies much above 10&#x000a0;Hz (e.g., Winter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>). After this procedure, the position data time series were numerically differentiated once and twice to derive the speed and acceleration data of the target and intercepting effector, respectively. Movement onsets were calculated from the tangential speed time series using the two-stage algorithm B suggested by Teasdale et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1993</xref>). The algorithm first determines the sample (S1) at which the time series first exceeds 10% of its maximum value. Then, working back from S1 it finds the first sample (S2) at which speed reaches 10% of the speed value at S1. Working forward from S2, the final step of the algorithm locates the onset being the sample at which speed equals the average value plus the standard deviation between S1 and S2. The time at which the target was hit as well as the temporal error were estimated from the position time series of the manipulandum IRED and the target IRED less a small offset to take into account the amount the bat IRED was displaced from the surface of the bat and the distance the target IRED was displaced relative to the target surface. The sample at which the Y-position of the manipulandum reached the Y-position occupied by the target determined the time of target strike when the target was actually hit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dependent measures and statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Temporal errors</title><p>The main measure in this experiment was the temporal error (TE), which is defined as the difference between the time when the tip of the bat reaches the Y-position of the target&#x02019;s plane of motion and the time when the target&#x02019;s centre reached the Z-position, where the tip of the bat crossed the Y-position of the target&#x02019;s plane of motion. The mean and the standard deviation of the temporal error over a series of trials are the constant temporal error (CTE) and the variable temporal error (VTE), respectively. In this experiment, we also analysed the hit rate (HR), defined as the percentage of targets contacted with the tip of the bat. For each participant, the 147 trials were divided into 7 blocks of 21 trials and averaged to give estimates of HR and CTE for each condition. For the calculation of VTE, we computed the standard deviation of the same 21 trials. Because HR is based on the percent of hits and follows a binomial distribution, the arcsine squared root transformation was used to analyse this variable as recommended by Hogg et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Movement trajectories</title><p>For the analysis of movement trajectories, we analysed movement time (MT), defined as the time when the subject start moving the manipulandum, relative to the moment that the centre of the moving target reaches the Z-position, where the tip of the bat crosses the target&#x02019;s plane of motion and target strike, and the percentage of mono-phasic and bi-phasic movements. In a previous study, movements with inflection points in the speed profile were observed when performing this interception task (Tresilian and Lonergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). These inflection points appear as minima in the acceleration profiles. Movements of this type have been interpreted as compound movements made up of two or more component submovements (Milner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1992</xref>; Rohrer and Hogan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>) with later submovements possibly being corrections to errors in the initial movement (e.g., Meyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1988</xref>). We examined whether such movements were present in the data recorded using the same procedure used by Tresilian and Plooy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>).</p><p>Minima in the acceleration profile were used to provide an estimate of the number of components in a particular movement. A one-component movement (mono-phasic movement) is one with no minima in the acceleration profile, a two-component (bi-phasic) movement has one minimum, and so on. The criteria for defining an acceleration minimum were chosen, such that the selected minima were associated with visually identifiable inflection points in the speed profile. It was found that this was achieved if the depth of a minimum was greater than 2% of the maximum overall acceleration (Tresilian and Plooy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). Depth was defined as follows: any minimum has acceleration peaks to the left and right, and the difference between the value of the acceleration at the lowest of the two peaks and at the minimum point is the depth of the minimum.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of studies have investigated how people time the manual interception of accelerating targets and reported results consistent with the idea that acceleration (rate of change of speed) information is not used (e.g., Benguigui et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>; Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1983</xref>; Michaels et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>; Port et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1997</xref>). A series of studies over the last two decades have demonstrated that people can, with practice, learn to utilize acceleration information to control the timing of interceptions by acquiring knowledge about regularities in acceleration over repeated trials and using that knowledge in the timing of subsequent attempts (Zago et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>). It was not initially clear whether this ability to take acceleration into account was restricted to accelerations of gravitational magnitude (&#x02248;9.81&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>) and that other accelerations (which are almost always of substantially smaller magnitude) are ignored. However, recent evidence shows that there are situations in which smaller amplitude accelerations are not ignored (e.g., de Rugy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>; La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>; Tresilian and Lonergan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). The results reported here to extend these latter results to show that people can learn to take smaller than gravitational magnitude accelerations (1.2&#x000a0;m/s<sup>2</sup>) into account for both positive (increasing speed) and negative (decreasing speed) accelerations with relatively little experience (&#x0003c;60 trials) and that this does not involve the use of cues regarding the source of the acceleration (an incline) or about the initial conditions of the motion.</p><p>The results of this experiment clearly showed that participant&#x02019;s interceptive timing performance, assessed in terms of temporal errors and hit rates, improved systematically over the first three blocks of trials (63 trials) with the larger part of the improvements occurring within the first two blocks (42 trials). These improvements were not only observed for accelerating/decelerating targets, but also for constant velocity targets: all three groups of participants improved in a somewhat similar way and from similar starting points. In the later trials (from trial 64 on), changes in performance were much smaller in all dependent variables. The constant error data and hit rate data (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed some small changes in performance over blocks 4&#x02013;7, but the variable errors remain essentially unchanged over these blocks in all groups. It is expected that performance improvements over initial trials would be observed when the target moved at constant speed, since the participants require a period of familiarization with the task to perform effectively as observed in the previous studies using a similar hitting task and constant speed targets (e.g., Tresilian and Plooy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). It was not expected that performance with accelerating and decelerating targets would be so similar to that observed with constant speed targets.</p><p>The hypothesis that accelerations are ignored and the hypothesis that a period of learning is needed to acquire an internal model of the acceleration would both predict that performance would initially be better for the constant speed target group than for the accelerating target groups. Exactly how much better depends upon the errors incurred by not taking accelerations into account. These errors can be estimated if we assume a control strategy in which the phase of a hitting movement completed prior to hitting the target (in effect, the acceleration phase of the movement, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) is performed visually open loop if its duration (the movement time) is less than about 150&#x000a0;ms (which is consistent with available data, see Elliott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>; Tresilian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>; Tyldesley and Whiting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1975</xref>). Consistent with this assumption, the analysis of movement trajectories did not reveal the presence of multi-phasic movements, which would indicate the presence of online corrective submovements (e.g., Meyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1988</xref>).</p><p>According to the tau-hypothesis, an interceptive movement is triggered when the perceived time to arrival of the moving target reached a criterion value after a short visuo-motor delay (Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1980</xref>; Lee and Reddish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1981</xref>). The lowest estimates for this delay are around 100&#x000a0;ms (Brenner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1998</xref>; Marinovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>) and so an appropriate value of perceived time to arrival to use to initiate the interception would be 150&#x02009;+&#x02009;100&#x000a0;ms. Thus, if it is assumed that the timing of movement is based on initiating a brief ballistic movement when perceived time to arrival reached a value of about 250&#x000a0;ms, the temporal error expected if acceleration were not taken into account can be estimated using Newton&#x02019;s equations for uniformly accelerated motion. The expected errors for the three speeds (173.6, 193.9, and 214.4&#x000a0;cm/s) are, respectively&#x02009;, +76, +73, and +70&#x000a0;ms (late errors) for the accelerating targets and &#x02212;&#x02009;18, &#x02212;17, and &#x02212;&#x02009;15&#x000a0;ms (early errors) for the decelerating targets. For comparison, if a 200&#x000a0;ms value of time to arrival were used (perhaps to correct an ongoing movement), the corresponding expected errors would be +16, +14, and +13 and &#x02212;&#x02009;12, &#x02212;11, and &#x02212;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;ms. We would expect, therefore, the initial (first block) temporal constant errors of the accelerating target group to be later than those of the constant speed target group and for those of the decelerating target group to be earlier than those of the constant target group. There was no evidence for such a pattern in the constant error data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>); indeed, in some instances, the pattern present was in the opposite direction to that predicted (e.g., the deceleration groups errors were, on average, more positive rather than more negative than the constant speed groups errors). Thus, there was no evidence in the constant error data to suggest that accelerations were being ignored, even in the initial 20&#x000a0;trials.</p><p>Given that there was an overall tendency for early (&#x02212;ve) temporal error (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), it would not necessarily be expected that late (+ve) errors would be observed in early attempts to hit the accelerating target. However, the similarity of the constant errors in the three groups and the complete absence of the expected pattern were unexpected and difficult to account for in terms of existing hypotheses concerning how interceptions are timed. One possibility is that in early trials, participants are trying out alternative strategies for timing interceptive movements sufficiently accurately to hit the target and that with more to learn when the target accelerates (i.e., the need to acquire knowledge about the acceleration that can be incorporated into control of movement initiation), the &#x02018;trying out&#x02019; process produces a greater variation in movement timing and hence a greater variation in timing errors (such a highly variable &#x02018;trying out&#x02019; phase is characteristic of the early stages in instrumental learning and skill acquisition, e.g., Schmidt and Lee <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>; Woodworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1899</xref>). This greater variation could mask the expected error pattern described above. The variable temporal error data (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) do not provide any clear support for this hypothesis. There is evidence to indicate that the initial (first and second block) VTEs were greater in the decelerating target group than in the constant speed group (consistent with the lowest hit rate for the deceleration group in the first trial block), but no evidence to suggest that it was greater in the accelerating target group (the mean VTE in the first block was always the smallest in this group). Thus, the absence of the expected pattern&#x02014;indeed, the fact that the means follow a pattern opposite to that expected&#x02014;is currently hard to satisfactorily explain.</p><p>Overall, the results reported here extend previous results to show that in the absence of information about the conditions of accelerated motion (slope, starting position) that could provide cues about the acceleration and/or the time of arrival at an interception location, participants can learn to time their interceptions of continuously accelerated moving targets (both positively and negatively accelerated targets) with an accuracy similar to that achieved when the targets move at constant speed. For the particular task used in this experiment, participants were able to intercept accelerating targets with a high degree of effectiveness (between 60 and 80% hit rate) after fewer than 60 practice trials. These findings are consistent with recent data showing that the acquisition of knowledge about target acceleration (perhaps in the form of an internal model) established to be used when intercepting targets falling under gravitational acceleration is also involved (at least in some form) for other, less familiar accelerations of smaller magnitude (de Rugy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>; La Scaleia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2014</xref>). The data presented here and in other studies are not sufficient to be able to state what kind of knowledge of acceleration and/or its effects is acquired: at this stage, it is only possible to say that some kind of knowledge is acquired, but this is not necessarily an estimate of the magnitude of the acceleration. Exactly what information is acquired is likely to depend upon the conditions and demands of the interceptive task, as the performer need only acquires sufficient knowledge to be able to perform the task effectively in the conditions experienced.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by a Warwick Postgraduate Research Scholarship to Jo&#x000e3;o V.
