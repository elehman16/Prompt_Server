The effects of adalimumab in controlling progression of structural damage in erosive hand osteoarthritis (HOA) were assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixty patients with erosive HOA on radiology received 40 mg adalimumab or placebo subcutaneously every two weeks during a 12-month randomized double-blind trial. Response was defined as the reduction in progression of structural damage according to the categorical anatomic phase scoring system. Furthermore, subchondral bone, bone plate erosion, and joint-space narrowing were scored according to the continuous Ghent University Score System (GUSSTM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The disease appeared to be active since 40.0% and 26,7% of patients out of the placebo and adalimumab group, respectively, showed at least one new interphalangeal (IP) joint that became erosive during the 12 months follow-up. These differences were not significant and the overall results showed no effect of adalimumab.</p><p>Risk factors for progression were then identified and the presence of palpable soft tissue swelling at baseline was recognized as the strongest predictor for erosive progression. In this subpopulation at risk, statistically significant less erosive evolution on the radiological image (3.7%) was seen in the adalimumab treated group compared to the placebo group (14.5%) (P = 0.009). GUSSTM scoring confirmed a less rapid rate of mean increase in the erosion scores during the first 6 months of treatment in patients in adalimumab-treated patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Palpable soft tissue swelling in IP joints in patients with erosive HOA is a strong predictor for erosive progression.

Among these, tumour necrosis ractor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;) directly stimulates osteoclast progenitors of the monocyte/macrophage lineage into osteoclasts, enhances the production of a series of proinflammatory cytokines, eg, interleukin-1 (IL-1), receptor activator for nuclear factor &#x003ba; B ligand, and increases the rate of tissue remodelling by matrix-degrading proteases.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref></p><p>Adalimumab (Humira; Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, Illinois) is a bioengineered fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to TNF&#x003b1;, preventing it from activating TNF&#x003b1; receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), adalimumab slowed down progressive joint destruction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of adalimumab, 40 mg subcutaneous administration, every 2 weeks, to control the structural damage to cartilage and bone, as determined by radiographic assessment, in erosive osteoarthritis of the interphalangeal finger joints in a double blind, placebo controlled randomised clinical trial of 1 year.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="s2"><title>Patient inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>Sixty patients were recruited from the outpatient rheumatology clinic of the Ghent University Hospital between May 2006 and January 2008.

Previous treatment with chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, avocado-soybean unsaponifiables, tetracyclines, corticosteroids or any immunomodulating drug with possible effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine metabolism within 90 days was another reason for exclusion. Patients with chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease (eg, RA, spondylarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, gout, chondrocalcinosis or other autoimmune diseases) were excluded as well as underlying comorbidities, eg, uncontrolled diabetes, unstable ischaemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, active inflammatory bowel disease, recent stroke (within 3 months before screening), chronic leg ulcer, lymphoproliferative disorders, history of cancer, active hepatitis B or C infection, positive HIV status and persistent or recurrent infections requiring treatment with antibiotics within 30 days before enrolment.</p><p>Levels of rheumatoid factor, anti-citrullinated cyclic peptide, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were measured at screening.

It can be estimated that after 1 year, 60% of patients in the placebo group and 10% of patients in the adalimumab group will have started the erosive phase in their &#x02018;S&#x02019; or &#x02018;J&#x02019; joints. Taking into account 20 patients in each subgroup, a power of 80% and an &#x003b1;-level of 5%, the present study should be able to detect a significant difference between the placebo and treatment groups when 50&#x02013;55% of the treated patients have started the erosive phase in one or more non-erosive interphalangeal joints.

Therefore, posteroanterior radiographs of the hands were obtained at baseline and after 26 and 52 weeks. All interphalangeal joints (distal interphalangeal 2&#x02013;5 and proximal interphalangeal 2&#x02013;5) of both hands were scored except the interphalangeal joints of the thumb because of decreased visibility and reproducibility to evaluate on posteroanterior views. A total of 960 interphalangeal joints was scored. In order to score the erosive progression of the interphalangeal joints on the radiographs, two validated scoring systems were used as co-primary endpoints. The first scoring system was based on the consecutive anatomical phases recognised during progressive disease in erosive hand osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> Non-erosive osteoarthritis joints (&#x02018;S&#x02019; or stationary osteoarthritis) have been shown to enter the &#x02018;J&#x02019; phase when the joint space disappears, followed by the &#x02018;E&#x02019; phase when manifest erosive changes occur. Next, the affected interphalangeal joint show signs of repair and the &#x02018;R&#x02019; (remodelling) phase ensues. A fusion (&#x02018;F&#x02019;), as an extreme form of joint remodelling, is seen extremely rarely. Characteristic features and changes are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>. Anatomical phases of all interphalangeal joints were characterised and changes in phase were recorded by two readers. The percentage of absolute agreement between the readers was 93.6% (&#x003ba;=0.92). Both readers showed intrareader reliabilities with a percentage of absolute agreement of over 95.9% (&#x003ba;=0.95). In case of dispute, agreement was sought by discussing the radiographs. The primary endpoint was a reduction in the numbers of &#x02018;N&#x02019;, &#x02018;S&#x02019; or &#x02018;J&#x02019; joints that become &#x02018;E&#x02019; within 1 year at the joint and at the patient level.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Clinical appearance of erosive osteoarthritis of the interphalangeal finger joints is illustrated in (A) where erosive progression and subsequent remodelling caused functional inability of the second, third and fifth digit, and in (B) where almost all interphalangeal joints of both hands were affected and disabled.

The three scores were summed to obtain the total GUSS score that ranged from 0 (severe joint destruction) to 300 (no damage) for each interphalangeal finger joint. &#x02018;E&#x02019; phase interphalangeal joints thus have, on average, lower GUSS scores than &#x02018;J&#x02019; or &#x02018;R&#x02019; joints.</p><p>Two readers (RW, GV) scored the films independently blinded for order, treatment assignment and clinical response. Interreader and intrareader intraclass coefficients of correlation scores rated excellent for the total GUSS scores: 0.86 and 0.97, respectively. The smallest detectable change,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> as calculated on the mean scores of the two readers was reduced to 18 units after training during routine in-house training sessions. The mean scores of the two readers were used for the GUSS readings.</p><p>Secondary endpoints consisted of effects on clinical variables. Clinical assessment was performed by the same experienced examiner, blinded for treatment assignment, at screening, baseline and after 6, 12, 26, 39 and 52 weeks. This included the evaluation of pain on palpation and the search for palpable swelling as a result of synovial thickening and intra-articular effusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> in 16 interphalangeal finger joints. The grip strength of both hands was measured using a hand grip dynamometer (My-Gripper; Yamasa, Tokei, Japan). The maximum of three attempts was recorded for the dominant and non-dominant hand. Level of pain, morning stiffness and function was registered by the self-reported AUSCAN questionnaire.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> The occurrence of any adverse events was questioned at every visit. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 6 and 12 months for routine safety tests.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive analyses were performed by the calculation of means, mean differences and proportions. t Tests and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests were used to explore differences between groups for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. For the evaluation of joints, the classic methods neglect the fact that treatment is given on a patient level. Therefore, additional generalised estimating equation (GEE) modelling with a logit link function was used to calculate OR and differences of means. An additional level (time) was added to the GEE models for longitudinal analysis.</p><p>A multi-step method was used to evaluate subgroups of patients that might benefit from anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapy: (1) potential predictors of erosive progression were evaluated by univariate analysis; (2) variables that showed a 50% difference in odds (OR &#x0003e;1.5 or OR &#x0003c;0.667) were added in one multivariate GEE model; (3) significant predictors from that model were evaluated by interaction terms with therapy (placebo or adalimumab) in further regression analyses. For these subgroup analyses, disease progression was assessed using the anatomical phase scoring system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> and the GUSS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> as follows: for the evaluation of classic calculated OR, a new erosive joint was defined if a joint with a baseline &#x02018;N&#x02019;, &#x02018;S&#x02019; or &#x02018;J&#x02019; phase evolved to an &#x02018;E&#x02019; phase after 1 year. In the GEE models, &#x02018;E&#x02019; joints were compared with all other phases at the two different time points. For the evaluation of the GUSS, differences between baseline were calculated and the different scores of these joints showing no evolution were imputed with zero.</p><p>Concerning the descriptive analyses and the analysis of differences, the last observation carried forward method was used in the case of missing values (one patient (placebo) missed the 12-month visit). For the calculation of inference by GEE modelling, no imputation was used.

It is likely that TNF&#x003b1; activity may be responsible for the destructive processes observed in cartilage and subchondral bone in erosive interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis.</p><p>TNF&#x003b1; blockade is thus a possible therapeutic option in erosive interphalangeal joint osteoarthritis as it could help to preserve tissue structure and hand function as a whole.</p><p>For this study we selected patients showing active erosive osteoarthritis in one or more of their interphalangeal finger joints. The natural history in these patients showed high rates of progression, as almost half of them on placebo had one or more non-erosive interphalangeal joints at baseline that became erosive during follow-up.</p><p>Fewer adalimumab-treated patients developed erosive osteoarthritis in their interphalangeal joints: 26.7% of patients in 2.1% of their non-erosive interphalangeal joints, whereas 40.0% of the placebo-treated patients did so in 3.6% of their non-erosive finger joints. These differences were not significant and the overall results thus showed no therapeutic effect of adalimumab.</p><p>However, the data obtained in the placebo group allowed potential predictors for erosive evolution in interphalangeal finger joint osteoarthritis to be identified. Most significantly, soft tissue swelling at study entry was a key predictor for erosive evolution. In the placebo group, a 10-fold increase in progression to the erosive &#x02018;E&#x02019; phase occurred in non-erosive interphalangeal joints presenting with soft tissue swelling. Neutralising TNF&#x003b1; significantly slowed down the progression of structural damage in these inflamed interphalangeal joints.</p><p>These results were confirmed when erosive progression in this particular form of hand osteoarthritis was scored by the novel scoring system GUSS, designed to monitor disease progression within a shorter time. Anti-TNF&#x003b1; therapy prevented GUSS from changing in interphalangeal joints with palpable effusion at baseline. In the placebo group, GUSS scores dropped dramatically in the interphalangeal joints before increasing towards the end of the follow-up period as a result of spontaneous repair. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref> It can be presumed that remodelling of an affected interphalangeal joint after major tissue damage will result in a marked change of the original anatomy and loss of the normal function.</p><p>Anti-TNF therapy retarded erosive progression in RA and psoriatic arthritis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref> and clinical improvement was associated with the inhibition of TNF activity in most although not in all of these studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

TNF&#x003b1; blockade, when retarding disease progression in some selected target interphalangeal joints, was not supposed to alter residual hand function and pain caused by multiple deformities that previously occurred in other finger joints.
