This was a randomized, crossover manikin trial with 87 paramedics. The correct location of intraosseous access when using NIO, BIG, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi was varied and was respectively 100, 90, 90, and 90%. The time required to obtain intravascular access (time T1) in the case of NIO, BIG, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi was varied and amounted to 9&#x000a0;s [IQR, 8&#x02013;12] for NIO, 12&#x000a0;s [IQR, 9&#x02013;16] for BIG, 13.5&#x000a0;s [IQR, 11&#x02013;17] for the EZ-IO, and 15&#x000a0;s [IQR, 13&#x02013;19] for Jamshidi. The paramedics evaluated each device on the subjective ease with which they performed the procedures. The intraosseous device, which proved the easiest to use was NIO, which in the case of CPR received a median rating of 1.5 (IQR, 0.5&#x02013;1.5) points.</p><p id="Par2">
<italic>Conclusion</italic>: Our study found that NIO&#x000ae; is superior to BIG&#x000ae;, EZ-IO&#x000ae;, and Jamshidi. NIO&#x000ae; achieved the highest first attempt success rate. NIO&#x000ae; also required the least time to insert and easiest to operate even by novice users. Further study is needed to test our findings in cadavers or human subjects.

At the end of the training, the instructor demonstrated the correct procedure of obtaining intraosseous access with all devices used in our study. Practicing with the devices prior to the study evaluation was not allowed. The order of both paramedics and intraosseous devices were randomized using a research randomizer program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Each paramedic was asked to perform a single attempt of intraosseous insertion with each device using the proximal tibia of the manikin. Before each insertion attempt, the paramedics were reminded that the &#x0201c;patient&#x0201d; needs emergent intraosseous access, in order to simulate a critical emergency situation. All insertion attempts were performed during ongoing chest compressions and a new needle was used for each insertion attempt. The same manikin tibia was used for the entire study, but the artificial skin was preplaced after each insertion attempt.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Flow chart of design and recruitment of paramedics according to CONSORT statement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="431_2017_2922_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

The NIO-P seemed to be the easiest to use and was the overwhelmingly preferred device among paramedics. Performance of BIG and EZ-IO were similar and outperformed Jamshidi. We note that the difference in total time of procedure (T1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T2&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;T3) between NIO-P and other devices is small (fraction of a minute) and whether this difference will translate to any improvement in clinical outcomes is questionable. However, it appears the NIO-P is at least comparable in performance to the other intraosseous devices.</p><p id="Par39">Rapid and high first attempt success rates in achieving a venous access are vital in a wide range of emergency settings including CPR. Failure rates for peripheral IV and central venous catheter in emergency situations can be as high as 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Average time for peripheral IV is 2 to 26.7&#x000a0;min and that for central line placement is 8 to 11&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Multiple previous studies demonstrated that intraosseous access outperformed peripheral IV and central line placement on first attempt success rate and time of procedure in emergency situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In a study by Andersen et al., the authors demonstrated that any minute of delay in administration of epinephrine in pediatric cardiac arrest was associated with decreased chance of survival, return of spontaneous circulation and less favorable neurological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With more than 5000 pediatric out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the USA annually, establishing venous access is a critical component of a quality CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, intraosseous access has potential to make a substantial impact on clinical outcomes.</p><p id="Par40">The performance of NIO-P in our pediatric model is comparable to several published studies. In our study, first attempt success rate of NIO-P is 100%. In a simulated adult CPR simulation using human cadavers by our study group, the success rate of first attempt with NIO is 97% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In another study by our group, the success rate of NIO in the adult cadaver tibia is 89% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. First attempt success is important because any first attempt failure means an extra 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;s will be spent on a second attempt on intraosseous access, which can potentially delay medical treatment and affect patient outcomes. Multiple punctures can potentially increase risk of complications, such as extravasation and infections. Our total procedure time for NIO-P placement averaged 39&#x000a0;s, which was significant longer as previously reported to be 17&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A plausible explanation is that our procedure time includes <italic>time to connect the infusion line</italic> (T3) and not mere achieving intraosseous access. The reason we measure T3 was that we believe connection of infusion line to the intraosseous device is also clinically important as starting infusion of drugs is the ultimate goal during CPR. If we only measure time to achieve access and stabilization, NIO-P required on average 18&#x000a0;s, almost equivalent to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, NIO-P was rated favorably on ease-of-use and an overwhelming majority (90.8%) preferred this device in a real-life scenario.</p><p id="Par41">The BIG and EZ-IO showed similar performance in our study. The total median time of BIG and EZ-IO were 56 and 57&#x000a0;s, respectively. Both scored very closely on ease-of-use. While 7% preferred EZ-IO in a real-life scenario, only 2% would use BIG. This is similar to previous report by Shavit et al. that showed EZ-IO was the preferred device over BIG in a turkey bone model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One plausible for our finding is that the EZ-IO required fewer steps versus the BIG. Compared to the BIG, which requires a number of steps releasing the needle (non-dominant hand holds the device perpendicular to the skin, pull out safety pin and the dominant hand release the spring mechanism), the EZ-IO has the theoretical advantage of being more intuitive and easier to use with a single step (one simultaneous motion of squeezing trigger and the needle is effortlessly drilled into the bone). An additional advantage of the EZ-IO is that its needles are color-coded based on weight for ease-of-use. The BIG required the user to twist the barrel to adjust the needle depth based on patients&#x02019; age, which might not be available in real-life scenarios. Although user preferences do not affect time of access, it reflects that more intuitive handling of EZ-IO and could have positive implications in clinical practice. Jamshidi, a manual IO device, had the lowest success rate, required longest time to perform and had the lowest preference rate. Our finding is supported by multiple prior studies that drill-assisted IO devices were had higher success rates and more reliable than manual devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Jamshidi needle required manual force to drive the needle forward. Too little force may not penetrate cortical bone, especially in older children, while excessive force may cause needle to bend.</p><p id="Par42">Although rare, accidental disconnection of catheters has been described during CPR and during interhospital transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A dislodged needle may prevent medications reaching central circulation and in cases where large volumes of fluids are infiltrated may lead to compartment syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A Scandinavian survey 1800 cases in intraosseous placement, there was a 12% incidence of needle displacement and extravasation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The BIG device requires the user to attach a &#x0201c;safety latch&#x0201d; to the intraosseous needle for stabilization; however, this extra step potentially causes needle dislodgement. The NIO-P potentially minimizes this risk with a built-in stabilizing manifold in the needle hub that secures the intraosseous needle during placement.</p><p id="Par43">There are several limitations in our study. First, we conducted our study using a manikin model which might limit our external validity in real patients. However, the Laerdal Manikin have been widely used in CPR research, including intraosseous device studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Manikins do not have medullary cavity therefore did not allow us to confirm &#x0201c;successful&#x0201d; with aspiration of marrow or injection of fluid. However, we used independent instructors who were experienced in advanced life support and anatomy to confirm a successful intraosseous placement. Our findings can only be applied to a 6-year old pediatric patient as dictated by our manikin. Older children, with a thicker bony cortex, may need more force to access the medullary cavity, thus yield better results with power-assisted devices. We also could not assess the maximum rate of fluid infusion and complications associated with these devices.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">In summary, our study found that NIO-P is superior to BIG, EZ-IO, and Jamshidi. NIO-P achieved the highest first attempt success rate. We found a small but statistically significant difference between insertion time of NIO-P and other devices and easiest to operate even by non-experts. Further studies in cadavers and human subjects are needed in order to confirm our findings.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AHA</term><def><p id="Par3">American Heart Association</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPR</term><def><p id="Par4">Cardiopulmonary resuscitation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ERC</term><def><p id="Par5">European Resuscitation Council</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMS</term><def><p id="Par6">Emergency Medical Service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p id="Par7">Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IO</term><def><p id="Par8">Intraosseous access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p id="Par9">Interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IV</term><def><p id="Par10">Intravenous access</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par11">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>We would like to thank all paramedic providers for their participation in our study.</p></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KB, LS, JS, and KR contributed significantly to the planning of the study and the study design.
