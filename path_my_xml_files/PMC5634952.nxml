Treatment usually involves lifelong medication use. Enalapril is a common drug for the treatment of hypertension in Ethiopia. However, the drug is expensive and, therefore, there is limited capacity for people to afford the treatment. Locally produced Enalapril is a cost-effective solution to treat the disease. However, as local medicines regulation does not include bioequivalence tests on locally produced drugs, physicians and patients need assurance about the effectiveness and safety of local generics. Evidence on therapeutic equivalence is needed on these untested local drugs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This is a hospital-based, randomized, partially blinded, three-cycle crossover trial in single patients, comparing a locally produced version of enalapril with enalapril imported from Europe. Patients involved in this trial are not blinded, as there is no local facility to produce relatively small numbers of placebos or encapsulated drugs. To ensure blinding of study investigators and data analysts, study medications are prepared by an independent pharmacy unit using opaque medication packaging. The importance of maintaining blinding is also part of patient pre-trial education. Each N-of-1 trial will consist of three successive 14-day treatment pairs, each pair comprising 7&#x000a0;days of 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg local and 7&#x000a0;days of 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mg imported enalapril taken once daily in the morning. The primary outcome will be the average difference in systolic blood pressure as measured by home blood pressure measurements.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The number of locally produced products, such as enalapril, being approved without proof of bioequivalence is dramatically increasing. By bridging the information gap on bioequivalence, the trial will give rigorous evidence on therapeutic equivalence of locally produced enalapril in the treatment of hypertension. If there is no difference, the hypothesized result, then patients can take the local medicine with confidence. This trial will also will determine whether aggregated N-of-1 studies are feasible to evaluate untested generic drugs in resource-limited countries where bioequivalence testing centers are unavailable.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p id="Par4">Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=371219">ACTRN12616001088437p</ext-link>.

In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 34% of the Ethiopian population dies from non-communicable diseases, with a national cardiovascular disease prevalence of 15% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In particular, hypertension is a major public health challenge because of its high frequency and associated risks. Ethiopian studies have found a significantly high prevalence of hypertension at the workplace (27.3%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and in an urban community (30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In 2008, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) identified hypertension as the seventh leading cause of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This makes it the single most important cause of mortality from non-communicable diseases in Ethiopia.</p><p id="Par31">Drug therapy for hypertension involves the use of a series of drug classes and often requires taking multiple drugs, which makes the treatment expensive for patients. In order to provide better access to affordable drugs, the Ethiopian Government legalized the production and commercialization of locally produced generic drugs. Because of their lower cost, the use of generic drugs is supported by health care systems which recommend that physicians prescribe them, rather than brand-name drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, treatment of hypertension with generics is an ideal option to reduce health care costs and improve therapeutic compliance in Ethiopia.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Lack of accredited bioequivalence center in Ethiopia</title><p id="Par32">In most places in the world, an application for marketing approval of a new generic product must reference a corresponding product, which was approved on the basis of clinical trials to support claims of safety and efficacy. This means that generics must show bioequivalence (BE) to a reference product and this is accepted by the European Union (EU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], the United States of America (USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, due to the lack of a bioequivalence testing center in Ethiopia, whether locally produced drugs are therapeutically equivalent, and thus interchangeable with the originally marketed products, is not known.</p><p id="Par33">One practical example for this, occurred when the Ethiopian medicines authority announced that the production of one particular locally manufactured drug was banned when it received claims of ineffectiveness of the drug from various health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several studies have also reported high levels of negative perceptions regarding generic drugs among health professionals and patients in Ethiopia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Enalapril</title><p id="Par34">Enalapril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor used in the treatment of hypertension, symptomatic heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Onset of antihypertensive activity is at 1&#x000a0;h, with peak reduction of blood pressure (BP) achieved by 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h after administration. The extent of absorption of enalapril from enalapril tablets administered per os is approximately 60%. The effective half-life for accumulation of enalapril following multiple doses of the drug is 11&#x000a0;h. It is metabolized in the liver and excretion is primarily renal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. One study demonstrated that the first dose of enalapril was effective and produced effects similar to those measured after 7&#x000a0;days, and after 1&#x000a0;month of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In Ethiopia, enalapril is commonly used to treat hypertension and is one of the first-line treatment options in the routine management of patients with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>What are N-of-1 trials?</title><p id="Par35">N-of-1 tests are double-blinded, multiple-crossover, comparative trials of effect. They are indicated whenever there is substantial uncertainty regarding the comparative effectiveness of different treatments being considered for an individual patient. Guidelines commissioned by the US Department of Health and Human Services, and a recently published book have both documented the use of N-of-1 tests as a means of formally assessing the bioequivalence of generic drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Researchers have used N-of-1 tests to prove therapeutic interchangeability of generic warfarin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and nifedipine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. An N-of-1 trial also concluded that follow-up of hypertension using home BP measurement is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">N-of-1 trials are suitable in the following conditions: stable or chronic conditions; treatments that have a rapid onset and offset of effect, and a short half-life resulting in minimal washout periods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].. Enalapril meets all the conditions of a treatment that is amenable to N-of-1 trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Justification for the trial</title><p id="Par37">High-quality clinical evidence is required to prove the comparative efficacy and safety of locally produced enalapril compared with an accepted comparator, without a bioequivalence profile being present. Though they are cheap, people distrust local drugs. Pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint bioequivalence studies can be used to establish bioequivalence of drug products when pharmacokinetic (PK) data is not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Compared with clinical endpoint bioequivalence studies, PD studies are more cost-effective, sensitive and less complicated methods for detecting drug formulation differences. Conducting classical clinical trials is difficult in Ethiopia. N-of-1 trials are relatively easy to conduct and generate results for each person. N-of-1 trials are not common in Africa. In particular, there are no published reports of N-of-1 methodology being used to assess the therapeutic equivalence (TE) of a product without a bioequivalence profile against another medicine that has a bioequivalence profile. If the tests prove feasible and acceptable, they can provide a bridge between the less rigorous regulatory environment in many resource-poor countries, and one in the future where bioequivalence tests are the norm.</p><p id="Par38">N-of-1 tests prove TE and interchangeability in individual patients. Furthermore, when N-of-1 tests from multiple individuals are aggregated (aggregated N-of-1 tests), a smaller sample size is required to produce generalizable data compared to parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, as a proxy measure to a bioequivalence study, the aggregation of a modest number of patients who are undergoing N-of-1 tests could be used to determine overall TE in the population. To inform the design of this study, we conducted a preliminary qualitative study to assess the views of patients and physicians on local drugs. (publication in process) We identified that participants preferred imported drugs from Western countries, particularly Germany. For this reason, the German version of enalapril has been chosen as a comparator drug for this trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par39">The objectives of the trial are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par40">Compare the TE of locally produced enalapril and the German version of enalapril using N-of-1 TE tests (both versions are registered to treat hypertension in Ethiopia)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par41">Assess whether N-of-1 TE tests are feasible to generate bioequivalence information for generic drugs in resource-poor settings</p></list-item></list>

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Their investigation included two successive studies. In study 1, the variance components of BP and the choice of treatment period duration were determined in 35 hypertensive patients who remained untreated during the measurements. In study 2, a series of individual N-of-1 trials of identical design was performed after study 1 completion in 44 other consecutive patients. The first phase of the study reported that a period of five consecutive days of BP measurement is sufficient to accurately detect a drug-induced fall in BP in a single patient, provided that there are at least 30 readings in each 5-day trial period. However, the study did not consider the washout period and the individual agreement between the two cycles was only moderate at best. The authors recommended a trial of longer periods with three cycles. The 5-day period is a compromise between acceptability of the length of the individual trial and the reduction of variance allowed by the repetition of measurements with time.</p><p id="Par57">An audit of sample sizes for pilot and feasibility trials undertaken in the United Kingdom reported that the median sample size for pilot trials was 30 participants per arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].

The Ethiopian guideline for registration of medicines states the need for clinical trial evidence on occasions when PK bioequivalence is not applicable. The guideline states that when in-vivo studies using plasma concentration time-profile data are not suitable, a comparative clinical trial then has to be performed to demonstrate equivalence between two formulations. However, as stated in the background, in East Africa including Ethiopia, local generics are marketed without evidence of effectiveness obtained through bioequivalence studies or clinical trials.</p><p id="Par98">By bridging the information gap on bioequivalence, the trial will give rigorous evidence on TE of local enalapril in individual patients. If there is no difference between the two treatments (the hypothesized result), then patients can take the local cheaper medicine with confidence. This trial will also will determine whether aggregated N-of-1 studies are feasible to provide a population level estimate of clinical equivalence for untested generic drugs in resource-limited countries where bioequivalence testing centers are unavailable. If TE is shown, it will encourage the use of cheaper local drugs by enhancing reliance on local pharmaceutical companies.</p><p id="Par99">However, there are a number of challenges in the design and conduct of reliable N-of-1 TE studies. Generally, comparison of drug formulations using TE studies are recommended if the PK approach is not possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. TE studies demonstrate that a test formulation has equivalent efficacy to a reference one. Often times, TE tests using clinical endpoints are less reliable due to lack of clearly defined endpoints and huge variability in the measured parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Therapeutic equivalence studies with biomarkers reflecting efficacy endpoints (e.g., BP reduction) are more sensitive than TE studies with clinical endpoints (e.g. survival rates, myocardial infarction and stroke) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Beside, N-of-1 trials are suitable only in chronic conditions where the drugs or interventions that are to be tested have a relatively short half-life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The use of technology (e.g., mobiles, BP machines, etc.) has a significant contribution in standardizing treatment measures. We are comparing antihypertensive effect (maintenance of BP) which is amenable to the use of these reliable technologies.</p><p id="Par100">Patients involved in this trial are not blinded. While double blinding is an ideal option, the need to adapt to local conditions is also very important. Apart from logistic issues (lack of an encapsulation machine locally), keeping the design less complex would make the trial resemble the usual way of switching drugs except that it is pre-planned, randomized and closely monitored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Our method of unblinding of patients and keeping study clinicians and investigators blinded is a compromise between feasibility and minimal potential effects on reported outcomes. The outcome of the study (BP) could be affected more than other possible, but not feasible, outcomes (e.g., serum renin levels). On the other hand, the use of electronic BP devices will help in standardizing the measure. The importance of maintaining blinding is part of patient education that is a routine part of patient preparation for participation in the trial. Study medications are prepared by an independent pharmacy unit. Therefore, study investigators and DSMB members will be blinded.
