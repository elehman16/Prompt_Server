Given the time-limited nature of consultations, a new and more time-efficient approach is needed which addresses multiple health needs simultaneously, and encourages patient self-management to address health risks. The aim of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention in improving patient self-management of health needs related to smoking, risky alcohol consumption and underscreening for cancers at 1&#x02005;month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Adult general practice patients will be invited to participate in a baseline survey to assess cancer risk factors, screening needs and depression. A total of 360 participants identified by the baseline survey as having at least one health need (a self-reported cancer risk factor, underscreening for cancer, or an elevated depression score) will be randomised to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive tailored printed feedback summarising their identified health needs and recommended self-management actions to address these. All participants will be invited to complete a telephone interview 1&#x02005;month following recruitment to assess self-management actions taken in relation to health needs identified in the baseline survey. Control group participants will receive tailored printed feedback on their identified health needs after their follow-up interview. A logistic regression model, with group allocation as the main predictor, will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on self-management actions.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical considerations and dissemination</title><p>Participants identified as being at risk of depression will be advised to speak with their doctor.

The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners (RACGP)<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the US Preventive Services Task Force<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> recommend that GPs screen for risk factors associated with cancer, and there is evidence that GP intervention can be effective in reducing the prevalence of cancer-related risk factors such as smoking,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> risky alcohol consumption,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> poor diet<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and physical inactivity.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> GPs also play an important role in encouraging cancer screening by identifying those who are underscreened and offering appropriate referral for screening. Chances of survival are enhanced where cancer is detected at an early, localised stage,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;10</xref> and Australian guidelines recommend regular mass screening for cancers including breast, colorectal and cervical cancer.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> GP endorsement of screening can significantly increase the likelihood of individuals engaging in screening tests.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The RACGP also recommends routine screening for depression where staff-assisted depression care support is in place.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For the remainder of this paper, the term &#x02018;health need&#x02019; is used to refer to either a cancer-related health risk factor (such as smoking or risky alcohol consumption), underscreening for cancer or depression.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Evidence practice gaps in delivery of preventive care and cancer screening</title><p>Despite the importance of assessing modifiable cancer risk factors, a recent Australian study of 287 GPs indicated that for smoking, nutrition, alcohol and physical activity, only 37&#x02013;46% of GPs report using guidelines.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Sixty-eight per cent of GPs give verbal advice on smoking &#x02018;very often&#x02019;, but only 10% refer &#x02018;very often&#x02019; for smoking management.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Similarly, less than half give verbal advice for nutrition (48%), and only 28% and 27% &#x02018;very often&#x02019; give advice on physical activity and alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Comparison between Australian studies<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref> conducted over the past three decades show that GPs' sensitivity in detection of smoking (56%, 66% and 63%) and risky alcohol consumption (28%, 40%, 26%) have not improved significantly over this time.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Australian rates of participation in routine screening for cancer are also suboptimal. Less than 60% of eligible women have been screened according to guidelines for cervical and breast cancer;<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> while only 37% of those approached for screening by the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program in 2013&#x02013;2014 returned a sample.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These figures suggest that there is a substantial opportunity to address health needs related to cancer screening and modifiable lifestyle risk factors in the primary care setting.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Why consider the management of depression?</title><p>It is well-established that certain risk factors and health conditions are likely to co-occur.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Our data show that among 3559 Australian primary care patients, those with moderate and severe levels of alcohol misuse had higher rates of depression (18% and 26%, respectively), compared with those with no alcohol misuse (8%) or mild misuse (13%).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Similarly, other studies have reported higher rates of depression among smokers.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Changing complex behaviours such as smoking and risky alcohol consumption are likely to be difficult in the context of untreated depression.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> Therefore, when attempting to identify and intervene with such risk factors, it is important that depressive symptoms are also assessed and addressed.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Why identify and address multiple health needs simultaneously?</title><p>Several studies have shown that interventions delivered in the primary care setting are effective in promoting reduction of individual cancer risk factors. For example, physician advice is effective at promoting smoking cessation;<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> brief GP counselling shows some effectiveness in reducing risky alcohol consumption;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and educational strategies and GP endorsement can improve uptake of cancer screening.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, this approach does not reflect the common clinical scenario in which a patient presenting for care has multiple health needs that could potentially be addressed, and overlooks potential interactions or inter-relations between health needs. For example, providing support for depression may reduce the patient's depressive symptoms, but also has potential to reduce alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Delivering interventions which focus on increasing identification of each specific health need in isolation may also not be feasible due to time constraints within the consultation. Therefore, time-efficient approaches that consider how multiple health needs can be identified and addressed may be more efficient and sustainable. Indeed, some authors argue that multiple risk factor intervention should be the cornerstone of primary prevention.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> A limited number of studies have found small, but significant, effects on health behaviour outcomes from intervention addressing multiple health needs (ie, behavioural risk factors) in primary care.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, the majority of prior studies have focused on secondary rather than primary prevention.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Therefore, there is a need to develop and test strategies for intervening with multiple health needs in the context of primary prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Testing the impact of a low-intensity intervention to increase patient self-management of modifiable health needs</title><p>A key barrier to provision of care for modifiable health needs is lack of time to assess these needs.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> GP time pressure may mean that there is little time to opportunistically assess patients' needs and preferences for help, or to deliver interventions. Therefore, approaches which assist in identifying modifiable health needs and which support patient self-management of health risk factors may be helpful. Self-management refers to the tasks that patients perform, often on a day-to-day basis, to manage their health. This can include seeking professional help from their doctor, taking medications and implementing lifestyle changes. Informational interventions alone have been shown to increase rates of cancer screening.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Provision of simple informational interventions may not always be sufficient on their own to change complex lifestyle behaviours such as smoking and risky alcohol consumption.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, such intervention may be effective in prompting self-management actions, including seeking GP advice, that lead to the uptake of more intensive interventions.</p><p>This study will test the impact of an e-health intervention in encouraging self-management of modifiable health needs. While there are a broader range of lifestyle risk factors such as poor nutrition and overweight which are associated with increased cancer risk, we chose to focus on risk factors which are more amenable to accurate reporting via self-report. For the purpose of this study, therefore, modifiable health needs include smoking, risky alcohol consumption, depression, and underscreening for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. The intervention will address key barriers such as GP identification of health needs and limited consultation time by assessing patient self-reported risk factors immediately prior to their general practice consultation, providing feedback to address knowledge and motivation barriers, and encouraging patients to seek advice from their GP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Primary aim</title><p>To test the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention in improving the proportion of patients who undertake one or more self-management actions for identified health needs related to smoking, risky alcohol consumption, and underscreening for bowel, breast and cervical cancer at 1&#x02005;month follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Secondary aim</title><p>To examine the impact of depression scores on self-management behaviours for health needs identified at baseline (cancer screening needs, smoking or risky alcohol consumption).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Compared with those allocated to the control group, the proportion of participants in the intervention group who report one or more self-management actions at 1&#x02005;month follow-up will be 15% higher.

We will conduct a sensitivity analysis for the treatment of missing data including an analysis under the assumption that the data are not missing at random using pattern mixture models. For the secondary aim of the study, a similar logistic regression model will be used to assess the effect of baseline depressive mood (as measured through the PHQ-9) on self-management symptoms at follow-up. A directed acyclic graph will be used to determine the confounding variables that need to be included in the model, and these will be initially selected for consideration based on content knowledge of the research team. A total of 360 participants will be recruited at baseline (180 per group). Allowing for 15% attrition at 1&#x02005;month follow-up, this will give an effective sample of 150 per group. Assuming a recruitment rate of 7 patients per day and allowing an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.01 for patients from the same day, a sample of this size, recruited over 42&#x02005;days (of which 21 are intervention days) will give 80% power to detect a 15% increase in the proportion of patients who report one or more self-management actions at the 5% significance level.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Data management</title><p>Baseline data completed by touchscreen computer will be automatically captured by the web software and exported using a comma-separated values file.

Study information sheets will include information regarding mental health helplines, and participants will be advised to speak with their doctor if their participation raises any concerns.
