Japanese patients in all treatment groups showed improvement in BCVA after treatment. The Rq4, 2q4 and 2q8 groups experienced similar gains in BCVA from baseline. The 0.5q4 group had higher gains due to an unexpected drop in BCVA between screening and baseline.

The low baseline VA observed for the 0.5q4 group is partially attributable to four patients whose BCVA scores decreased by more than 10 letters from screening to baseline (range: &#x02212;11 to &#x02212;20 letters).

The Japanese 0.5q4 group experienced a marked mean (SD) increase from baseline of 6.0 (10.1) ETDRS letters at week 1, compared with all other groups. Improvements among the three other groups were comparable (Rq4, 1.8 (5.4); 2q4, 2.3 (6.0); 2q8, 1.9 (5.5)).

Adjusted mean gains obtained by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including baseline value as a covariate to account for a possible baseline imbalance were generally comparable to these unadjusted mean values. The difference in improvement occurred during the first interval following the first injection administered, with an increase of six letters in this group as compared to a mean of two letters in all other treatment arms. The subsequent increase in BCVA over time was identical in magnitude and time among all groups. When the absolute BCVA from screening was considered, it became apparent that a transient and substantial decline in mean VA between screening and baseline in the 0.5q4 group contributed to this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BJOPHTHALMOL2014305076F2">figure 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="BJOPHTHALMOL2014305076F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) results.

This subgroup analysis represents the largest study of anti-VEGF treatment for AMD conducted to date in a Japanese population. All IVT-AFL arms were considered to be non-inferior to Rq4 on the primary outcome, referring to a 10% non-inferior margin. These results are consistent with those observed in the overall population of the VIEW 2 study. Visual and anatomical outcomes, as well as incidence of adverse events, were comparable between Japanese patients and the overall VIEW 2 population.</p><p>Mean ETDRS letter score at baseline in the 0.5q4 group (48.3) was the lowest among treatment groups. Results from this subpopulation analysis and from the complete VIEW 2 study population indicate that mean BCVA at baseline had an impact on mean change in BCVA from baseline, with higher baseline BCVA means associated with lesser VA gains, as reported in the Comparison of Age-related macular degeneration Treatment Trials (CATT) trial.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Among Japanese patients, 14 patients in the 0.5q4 group had a baseline BCVA score &#x0003c;50, 1.6&#x02013;2.8 times more than other groups. Additionally, there were three specific patients, evaluated at two different centres, whose BCVA score decreased by more than 10 letters from screening to baseline, and then increased by an average of 29.3 letters from baseline to week 1, whereas the average BCVA score gain in the other three treatment groups at week 1 was 2.0.</p><p>The high BCVA improvement seen in the 0.5q4 group may be explained by the relatively small sample size and imbalances in baseline disease characteristics (ie, BCVA score and area of CNV). Japanese patients in the groups unaffected by these imbalances showed a similar degree of mean BCVA changes compared to those of non-Japanese patients. Trends in BCVA scores throughout the first treatment year were similar among Japanese patients in the 2q8 group (which is the proposed dosing regimen in Japan) and the 2q4 group (despite a better 2q4 BCVA baseline) as compared with the complete VIEW 2 study population.</p><p>The mean areas of CNV at baseline in the 0.5q4 group (5.46&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>) and 2q4 group (5.07&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>) were lower compared to the other groups (Rq4, 8.06&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>; 2q8, 6.86&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>). A subpopulation analysis conducted on the full study populations of VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 indicated that the area of CNV at baseline has an impact on mean change from baseline in BCVA, with a larger area of CNV at baseline associated with less VA gains (Ho A, <italic>et al</italic> IOVS 2012;53:ARVO E-Abstract 3678).</p><p>Few major differences in VA outcomes were observed for Japanese patients compared with the overall VIEW 2 study population. The area of CNV lesion was slightly smaller in the Japanese subgroup compared with the complete VIEW 2 study population (range: 5.1&#x02013;8.1&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup> vs 7.7&#x02013;8.3&#x02005;mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively). As described earlier, this is related to the higher incidence of classic CNV in Asian patients with AMD. Although sample numbers were small for this subanalysis, the distribution of BCVA gains and losses showed a similar trend to those of patients in the full VIEW 2 study. Moreover, mean change in BCVA was one to two lines of vision for the Japanese subpopulation and the overall population of the VIEW 2 study for the currently recommended therapeutic doses of ranibizumab and IVT-AFL (Japanese range: 8.5&#x02013;15.9 ETDRS letters; overall VIEW 2 study population range: 7.6&#x02013;9.7 letters). Differences observed between regions are likely to be a reflection of natural variability, which may be confounded by the smaller number of Japanese patients (n=101) compared with patients outside Japan and the total study population (VIEW 1, N=1217 and VIEW 2, N=1240). Based on PMDA guidelines,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> results for the Japanese subpopulation were found to be consistent with the whole study population.</p><p>PCV was not a cause for exclusion from the study. Formal diagnosis of PCV requires indocyanine green angiography, which was not stipulated as a mandatory test in the VIEW 2 study. Therefore, Japanese patients&#x02019; PCV status was classified according to diagnostic criteria based on baseline FA/fundus photography findings. Further analysis of the effects of anti-VEGF treatment in patients with PCV is required.</p><p>IVT-AFL is as well tolerated and effective in the Japanese wAMD population as in the full VIEW 2 study population. This subgroup analysis suggests that the results of the overall VIEW 2 study are representative of wAMD Japanese patients despite some unique disease presentations in Asian, including Japanese, eyes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All Japanese investigators participated in the VIEW 2 study.
