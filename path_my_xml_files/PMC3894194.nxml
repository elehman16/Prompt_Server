Similar findings have been reported regarding aberrant feeding with acute periods (1 day) of fasting in clinical populations <xref rid="pone.0085970-Hetherington1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Telch1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Others, however, have found that acute fasting does not necessarily result in excessive energy intake or negative affect upon reinitiating <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding in non-clinical subjects <xref rid="pone.0085970-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. It is still unclear what factors underpin compensatory eating and altered hedonics in the early stages energy deprivation. There are conflicting data, but it appears that the short-term manipulation of satiety, most often achieved with a pre-load paradigm, does not reliably impact palatability <xref rid="pone.0085970-Booth1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085970-Yeomans1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. While the preload paradigm may be sensitive to possible short-term signaling of need (free)-state, a better manipulation has been less well studied and involves increasing the deprivation state through sustained energy deprivation. In support of the external validity of a sustained energy deprivation, it can be pointed out that recent NHANES data show that 63% of respondents were trying to lose weight <xref rid="pone.0085970-Nicklas1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and older data has shown that approximately 14% of Americans have reported using short-term fasting as a means of losing weight <xref rid="pone.0085970-French1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, the relevance of studying subjects under periods of deprivation longer than a few hours is reflected in the observation that day-to-day feeding typically occurs in response to learned cues <xref rid="pone.0085970-DeCastro1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, and not necessarily to a need-state.Thus, although it is clear that under challenges of negative energy balance feeding behavior can be altered with or without measurable changes in body energy reserves, what remains to be better described are the psychological and behavioral factors that drive changes in appetite, feeding, and food reward under such conditions.</p><p>Feeding behavior has been shown to be modulated by hunger-state, whereby prolonging inter-meal intervals or inducing weight loss can positively influence perceived taste pleasantness, a concept called alliesthesia <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Food reward can be operationalized as stimuli (internal and external) that contribute to the pleasure of and motivation to obtain food. Indeed, rigorous studies involving animal and human models of feeding have led to considerable progress in the understanding of the psychology of food reward <xref rid="pone.0085970-Blundell1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> and the neural substrates that mediate it (for review see <xref rid="pone.0085970-Berridge1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Berthoud1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>). In order to further examine the potential clinical importance of food reward in body weight regulation, and to better describe the overlapping pathways of food and drug reward <xref rid="pone.0085970-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, there has been a surge in studies examining hunger states (<italic>e.g.</italic> high hunger vs. sated) with brain imaging <xref rid="pone.0085970-Goldstone1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085970-Uher1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Concomitantly, there has been an emergence of standardized objective tools to measure psychological constructs of food reward (<italic>e.g.</italic> hedonics of food and food-related stimuli <xref rid="pone.0085970-Finlayson1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Lemmens1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and food reinforcement <xref rid="pone.0085970-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>). Energy deprivation not only impacts the palatability&#x02014;or &#x02018;liking&#x02019;&#x02014;of a particular food stimulus <xref rid="pone.0085970-Berridge2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085970-Yeomans2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, but also impacts the desire&#x02014;or &#x02018;wanting&#x02019;&#x02014;to engage a food stimulus <xref rid="pone.0085970-Berridge3" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In utilizing a computer task that applies behavioral economic theory to human feeding <xref rid="pone.0085970-Lappalainen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, ongoing research on the reinforcing value of food has demonstrated that &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; can change in a state-dependent manner (<italic>i.e.</italic> hungry vs. satiated) <xref rid="pone.0085970-Bulik1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085970-Raynor1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Similarly, several groups have demonstrated in human subjects that the hedonic &#x02018;liking&#x02019; evaluation of ingested foods can be impacted acutely by hunger-state <xref rid="pone.0085970-Blundell2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Laeng1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> or chronically by a state of reduced body energy reserves <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cameron1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Frankham1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Taken together, the dual qualities of food reward&#x02014;&#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019;&#x02014;can be described as susceptible to changes in the internal milieu, analogous to Michel Cabanac's concept of alliesthesia <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. It is unclear, however, what impact an acute 24 hour fasting challenge will have on the direction of &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019; for preferred food items or whether a relationship exists with changes in appetite, food reward and <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI.</p><p>There is a growing interest in fasting and alternate day (modified) fasting as methods to achieve weight loss or simply as a way of living (<italic>e.g.</italic> religious fasting periods). The main objective of this randomized crossover study was to examine the impact of a 24 hour complete fast (vs. fed state) on appetite, food reward, and EI. It was hypothesized that under the fasting condition there would be significantly higher appetite scores and <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI, and that correlations would exist between these changes. It was further hypothesized that relative to the fed state, snack food would become more rewarding, with increased explicit &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, and the meal-induced attenuation of explicit &#x02018;liking&#x02019; for the fasted condition would be less pronounced.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Subjects</title><p>Fifteen volunteers (9 male; 6 female) aged 28.6&#x000b1;4.5 yrs. with body weight 74.7&#x000b1;4.9 kg and body mass index (BMI) 25.3&#x000b1;1.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>i.e.</italic> normal weight/overweight) participated in this randomized crossover study, once in the fed state (FED) and once after performing a 24-hour complete fast (FASTED).

Specifically, for this study, computer software was used to set up a split screen that alternated between two different choices (a healthy food and palatable snack food) and was navigated with a mouse/pad (see <xref rid="pone.0085970-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>). Food points were earned by selectively working for the food item of choice. To obtain one fruit/vegetable point the reinforcement schedule was set at a progressive linear ratio with response requirements across five trials as follows: 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Thus, for example, at VR8 (3rd of 5 trials) the subject performed 8 button presses. For the snack foods the schedule was also set at a progressive ratio that doubled at each session as follows: 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64. The schedules of reinforcement were set to change differently between the two food stimuli in an effort to covertly disguise the discrepancy between the higher responding for the snack food.

Across-meal measures of the LFPQ for &#x02018;liking&#x02019; in the FASTED condition demonstrated an attenuated score for savory foods, but sweet foods maintained a strong hedonic saliency by failing to show the decrease in &#x02018;liking&#x02019; scores noted in the FED condition from pre- to post-meal.</p><p>Intuitively, one would anticipate that energy deprivation results in increased hunger ratings. But evidence suggests that as the fasting period is carried over from hours to days the appetite response can normalize to baseline levels previously noted in the fed state after approximately 4-5 days of fasting <xref rid="pone.0085970-Oh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Lappalainen2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Similar seemingly discrepant results have been found with less dramatic methods of energy deprivation, namely very low calorie diets, where on average subjects reported decreased appetite during the intervention&#x02014;described as &#x0201c;less food less hunger&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0085970-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0085970-Wadden1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. In a study with a fasting period (19 hours) comparable to our design, subjects without clinical eating pathology did not eat significantly more when allowed access to <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding <xref rid="pone.0085970-Hetherington1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Compared to FED, the appetite response to the current 24-hour fast was significantly impacted for all four AUC appetite measures. Most affected was hunger, which increased by 69%, followed by 50% and 30% increases in prospective food consumption and desire to eat, respectively, along with a 47% decrease in fullness. After 24 hours of fasting we demonstrate a significant 74% increase in mean <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI (kcal), which was positively correlated with increased AUC desire to eat scores. A similar study found significantly increased appetite scores following a 36-hour fast but they noted that when <italic>ad libitum</italic> feeding was reinstated there was only a 20% increase in EI, and this was unrelated to the changes in appetite <xref rid="pone.0085970-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>What is interesting is that our data is suggestive of alliesthesia for preferred food stimuli; that is, subjects rated &#x02018;liking&#x02019; of the <italic>ad libitum</italic> dessert significantly higher under the FASTED condition even after eating 74% more energy (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0085970-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). Corroborating these results are findings from deprivation periods of much shorter duration. By manipulating the period of energy deprivation with two separate test days, one day with a 3.5 hour period of deprivation and another with an overnight fast of approximately 12&#x02013;15 hours, Speigel et al. <xref rid="pone.0085970-Spiegel1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref> found that the deprivation period enhanced palatability, again consistent with the concept of alliesthesia. A strength of our findings lies in the fact that although neither the macronutrient nor the item content of the dessert buffet were controlled between subjects, there were no significant differences in percent fat or carbohydrate intake between the <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI in the FED and FASTED conditions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0085970-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref>). This observation is somewhat analogous to controlling for macronutrient intake and allows for better comparisons in overall changes in &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, either measured by VAS or by the LFPQ, thereby permitting a better analogue when comparing our results with previous work on alliesthesia (<italic>e.g.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac3" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac4" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>). To be sure, our &#x02018;liking&#x02019; measures obtained immediately post-consumption of the preferred food items do not mimic the pure measures of &#x02018;liking&#x02019; obtained by Cabanac with a 25% aqueous solution of glucose <xref rid="pone.0085970-Cabanac2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, but our findings are indeed consistent with the concept of alliesthesia.</p><p>Another interesting question that arises is whether there are differences in food reward or underlying trait differences (<italic>e.g.</italic> TFEQ) that can be attributed to the energy deprivation or to the noted increase in EI and palatability. The RRV task employed in the current study demonstrated that relative to FED, there were FASTED increases in the reinforcing value of palatable food as evidenced by significantly higher points earned and responses made for the snack item versus the preferred fruit (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0085970-t001">
<bold>Table</bold>
<bold>1</bold>
</xref>). To our knowledge there is only one other study using the RRV task under comparable levels of energy deprivation; after &#x0223c;13 hours of fasting food also became more reinforcing for normal weight non-dietary restrained females <xref rid="pone.0085970-Raynor1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. What is interesting is that there is some evidence that this increase in the reinforcing value of food can predict <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI, independently of rated &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, or hedonic ratings of foods <xref rid="pone.0085970-Epstein3" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Epstein4" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Our data, however, did not demonstrate a relationship between RRV and EI. That is, although snack foods were significantly more reinforcing under the FASTED condition, we found no indication that this increased desire or motivation to obtain more energy dense foods was related to the increased <italic>ad libitum</italic> EI noted under the FASTED condition. Regarding eating behavior traits, we have replicated recent findings that TFEQ scores for dietary disinhibition are related to food reinforcement <xref rid="pone.0085970-Epstein1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Specifically, our data show a positive association between disinhibition scores and the &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; for palatable energy dense snack food in the RRV task. Although the relationship between RRV, disinhibition and reward responsiveness remains to be better defined, there seems to be more consistent data confirming a positive relationship between BMI, or weight gain, and disinhibition scores <xref rid="pone.0085970-French2" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. This would suggest that individuals who score high in disinhibited eating may be more vulnerable to increases in food reward and food palatability ratings following a period of food deprivation, which may put them at greater risk of subsequently overconsuming food under such circumstances.</p><p>The LFPQ is different from the RRV task in that it allows the separate and concurrent assessments of explicit &#x02018;liking&#x02019; and &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; for the same target stimuli <xref rid="pone.0085970-Finlayson2" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. In our sample, explicit &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019; of food images increased under the FASTED relative to FED condition: except for the lack of change in &#x02018;liking&#x02019; for LFSW foods, both pre-meal scores and post-meal scores significantly increased for all four food categories. In previous work with the LFPQ measuring &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, once in a hungry state (3&#x02013;4 hours post-prandial) and then after eating a lunch meal on the same test day <xref rid="pone.0085970-Finlayson3" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, it was shown that &#x02018;liking&#x02019; for sweet foods did not decrease as much as that for fat foods. Here we show similar results in the FED condition, but under the FASTED condition only images of savory foods decreased in &#x02018;liking&#x02019;, while images of sweet foods maintained significantly heightened across-meal &#x02018;liking&#x02019; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0085970-g002">
<bold>Figure 2</bold>
</xref>). Our results are in agreement with recent imaging studies showing a robust activation of brain reward areas to sucrose taste <xref rid="pone.0085970-Haase1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref> and to images of high calorie foods <xref rid="pone.0085970-Goldstone1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, particularly after a period of fasting. Similar results were found in a study investigating alliesthesia to food images and found that foods rated with the highest &#x02018;liking&#x02019; scores (<italic>i.e.</italic> desserts) were less affected by energy deprivation than the savory foods <xref rid="pone.0085970-Stoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, suggesting that the hedonic value of a food stimulus may predict the magnitude of alliesthesia. Limited data on alliesthesia to food images exists: no effect of deprivation on ratings of &#x02018;liking&#x02019; has been reported <xref rid="pone.0085970-Drobes1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, while others have reported higher &#x02018;liking&#x02019; ratings under hungry versus sated subjects <xref rid="pone.0085970-Stoeckel1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Uher1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Jiang1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Rolls1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. It should be noted that the explicit &#x02018;liking&#x02019; responses from the LFPQ as they relate to alliesthesia are distinct from the &#x02018;liking&#x02019; measures we obtained from the VAS palatability measure immediately post-ingestion. That is, the &#x02018;liking&#x02019; of food images is a composite of learned hedonic features of the food (e.g. previous exposure of taste, texture, post-ingestive consequences, etc.), whereas, the VAS &#x02018;liking&#x02019; is a momentary evaluation of sensory qualia of the food.</p><p>Limitations for the current study are the fact that the fasting period was out of the laboratory and therefore there was the possibility that contrary to their self-reported fast, some subjects did not precisely follow the protocol. The relatively small number of moderately overweight but otherwise healthy subjects limits the scope of the current findings to similar populations. Also, because pizza was served as the standardized lunch, there could have existed a sensory specific satiety to savory food cues, which may partially explain the decreased post-prandial &#x02018;liking&#x02019; of savory food images. It is worthwhile to restate here that &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; of savory foods after the lunch was higher in males, thus we cannot discount sex-related differences in food evaluation <xref rid="pone.0085970-Lovejoy1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Macdiarmid1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Some of the strengths are in the randomized crossover design, that women were tested in the same phase of the menstrual cycle, and that the food items were personalized. Finally, to confirm our findings, more research is needed to clarify the role that sex has in responding to various degrees of negative energy balance, and in the subsequent response to food or food-related cues.</p><p>As a result of a 24-hour complete fast, preferred foods were both wanted and liked significantly more than in the fed state. Scores for appetite were dramatically affected, pushing up hunger, desire to eat and PFC, while simultaneously attenuating fullness. Higher disinhibition scores correlated with responding for palatable snack food stimuli in the RRV task, further indicating that RRV has strong ties with impulsivity and food sensitivity. Considering that there was a 74% increase in EI under the FASTED condition, our data suggest that alliesthesia was demonstrated by heightened hedonic ratings of &#x02018;liking&#x02019; following this much larger eating episode compared to the FED condition. The results from the LFPQ were in agreement with the abovementioned finding, whereby there was an increase in explicit &#x02018;wanting&#x02019; and &#x02018;liking&#x02019; to food images after 24 hours of fasting. The current study is also timely due to the recent, but still nascent findings, that alternating days of 24 hours of fasting may confer protection against coronary artery disease <xref rid="pone.0085970-Varady1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref> and improve insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0085970-Heilbronn1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref> in humans. More research is needed to better describe the degree that these measures of food reward are conceptually unique or structurally overlapping; furthermore, given the surge in brain imaging research and recent controversy regarding food addiction <xref rid="pone.0085970-Volkow1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0085970-Ziauddeen1" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, it becomes clear that validated computer tasks like those discussed here will compliment a more sophisticated biological and behavioral understanding of the human response to energy deprivation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0085970-Franklin1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
