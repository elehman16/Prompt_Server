We tested the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> variant on weight loss in response to 2-year diet interventions. <italic>FTO</italic> rs1558902 was genotyped in 742 obese adults who were randomly assigned to one of four diets differing in the proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate. Body composition and fat distribution were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. We found significant modification effects for intervention varying in dietary protein on 2-year changes in fat-free mass, whole body total percentage of fat mass, total adipose tissue mass, visceral adipose tissue mass, and superficial adipose tissue mass (for all interactions, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Carriers of the risk allele had a greater reduction in weight, body composition, and fat distribution in response to a high-protein diet, whereas an opposite genetic effect was observed on changes in fat distribution in response to a low-protein diet. Likewise, significant interaction patterns also were observed at 6 months. Our data suggest that a high-protein diet may be beneficial for weight loss and improvement of body composition and fat distribution in individuals with the risk allele of the <italic>FTO</italic> variant rs1558902.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased substantially in the U.S. and worldwide, and the health burden of obesity-related complications has grown accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Obesity is primarily determined by both genetic and lifestyle factors, including diet, as well as their interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In the past few years, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified a group of genetic loci associated with BMI and obesity risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Among them, the fat mass and obesity-associated gene (<italic>FTO</italic>) locus shows the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Accumulating evidence has suggested that this locus is involved in the hypothalamic regulation of appetite and dietary energy intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Recently, several studies have examined the effect of the <italic>FTO</italic>-diet interaction on body weight, but the results are not entirely consistent. Several cross-sectional studies showed that dietary factors such as low fat intake might modify the genetic effect of <italic>FTO</italic> on BMI or fat distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, the gene by diet interaction was not univocally observed in randomized intervention trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), although one study found that a Mediterranean diet intervention modified the association between the <italic>FTO</italic> variant and weight changes in a population with high cardiovascular risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These intervention trials, however, largely are limited by relatively small sample size or the short term of follow-up. In addition, animal studies have suggested that <italic>FTO</italic> might differentially affect various body compositions and fat distribution at different depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Few studies have evaluated systematically the effect of the <italic>FTO</italic> variant on these measurements.</p><p>The POUNDS LOST Trial thus far is the largest 2-year randomized intervention trial that tested the effect of four diets varying in proportions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate on weight loss in overweight or obese subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). By use of the data from this trial, we evaluated whether various weight-loss diets might modify the effect of the <italic>FTO</italic> variant on weight loss and long-term changes in body composition and fat distribution.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study population.</title><p>The POUNDS LOST Trial was conducted from October 2004 through December 2007 at two sites as follows: Harvard School of Public Health and Brigham &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts; and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of Louisiana State University System, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The design and sample collection have been described previously in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In brief, the study population was composed of 811 overweight or obese (BMI ranged from 25 to 40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participants aged 30&#x02013;70 years. Major criteria for exclusion were the presence of diabetes or unstable cardiovascular disease, the use of medications that affect body weight, and insufficient motivation as assessed by interview and questionnaire. Among the 742 participants who were genotyped successfully, 61% were women, 80% were white, 15% were black, 3% were Hispanic, and 2% were Asian or other ethnic groups by self-report. The participants were assigned randomly to one of four diets constituting a two-by-two factorial design; the target percentages of energy derived from fat, protein, and carbohydrate in the four diets were 20, 15, and 65%; 20, 25, and 55%; 40, 15, and 45%; and 40, 25, and 35%. After 2 years, 645 participants (80% of total population) completed the trial. The study was approved by the human subjects committee at each institution and by a data and safety monitoring board appointed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. All participants provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Measurements.</title><p>In the morning before breakfast, body weight and waist circumference (WC) were measured on 2 days at baseline; 6, 12, and 18 months; and 2 years. BMI was calculated as weight by height squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). A dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan was performed on 50% of a random sample from the total study participants (<italic>n</italic> = 424), including 242 (57.1%) women, using a Hologic QDR 4500A (Waltham, MA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Total fat mass (kg), total fat-free mass (FFM; kg), whole body total percentage of fat mass (FM%) and percentage of trunk fat were obtained once at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Computed tomography (CT) was used in 50% of a random sample from those participants who had DEXA scans, resulting in a sample of 25% of the total participants (<italic>n</italic> = 195), including 113 (58.2%) women. Total adipose tissue (TAT) mass, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) mass, deep subcutaneous adipose tissue (DSAT) mass, and superficial adipose tissue (SAT) mass within the abdomen were measured by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), once at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years. Because of radiation exposure, premenopausal women would not subject themselves to CT scans. A series of eight single-slice images were obtained every 10 cm from 2 below and 5 above the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae interspaces. These contiguous cross-sectional images were analyzed, and then the total volume was calculated from the individual slices. In this analysis, we only included data at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years with all the outcomes because the DEXA and CT scans were only performed at these three time points.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Genotyping.</title><p>DNA was extracted from the buffy coat fraction of centrifuged blood using the QIAmp Blood Kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1558902 was selected because it had emerged as the top variant of <italic>FTO</italic> locus for BMI and WC in recent obesity-related GWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The SNP was genotyped successfully in 742 of 811 total participants and 603 of 645 participants who completed the trial using the OpenArray SNP Genotyping System (BioTrove, Woburn, MA). Of the 424 participants who received DEXA scans, 391 were genotyped at baseline, and 224 participants who completed the trial were genotyped. Of the 195 participants who received CT scans, 175 were genotyped at baseline and 105 participants who completed the trial were genotyped. The genotype success rate was 99% in available DNA samples. Replicated quality control samples (10%) were included in every genotyping plate with greater than 99% concordance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The allele frequency in two major ethnic groups (white and black) was compatible with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>The primary outcomes were changes in body weight and WC. Secondary outcomes were changes in body composition including total fat mass, FFM, FM% and percentage of trunk fat, and fat distribution (TAT, VAT, SAT, and DSAT). Data were pooled from the diets for the two factorial comparisons: low protein versus high protein and low fat versus high fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Because the majority of the study population were white (80%), we also analyzed the main effects and interactions among white participants separately. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and comparison of categorical variables at baseline were assessed with &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Differences in continuous variables at baseline were tested using ANCOVA, with adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity. The main effects of genotype and diet intervention on outcome changes at 6 months and 2 years were analyzed using general linear regression models, with adjustment for covariates including age, sex, ethnicity, carbohydrate, the baseline value for the respective outcome, and baseline BMI. We excluded individuals with missing measures at each time point in the analysis. Moreover, to analyze the potential interactions between genotype and diet intervention, an interaction product term of genotype-diet was included in the models. In a secondary analysis, we used linear mixed models, with time as a repeated measurement factor, to test genetic associations with the trajectory of changes in outcomes in the participants who provided measurements at baseline, 6 months, and 2 years in each of four diet groups over the 2-year intervention by including genotype-time interaction terms. Because an additive genetic effect was reported in the original large-scale GWAS in which the SNP was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), additive models were analyzed for genotype. All reported <italic>P</italic> values were two-sided and a <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Carriers of the risk allele (A allele) of the rs1558902 genotype had a greater loss of weight and regional fat in response to a high-protein diet compared with noncarriers, whereas an opposite genetic effect was observed regarding changes in fat distribution in response to a low-protein diet. Our data indicate that the modification effects of dietary treatment were more evident with prolonged intervention. We did not observe significant modification of dietary fat intake on the genotype effects.</p><p>The rs1558902 genotype was reported to show the strongest association with obesity in the European (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and other ethnic populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), and it has strong linkage disequilibrium with other obesity-associated <italic>FTO</italic> variants such as the rs9939609 genotype. In this study, the MAF of the polymorphism in all participants was similar to those in the HapMap CEU population (0.45). At baseline, no significant difference was observed in anthropometrics and metabolic estimates, body composition, or fat distribution across genotypes. The lack of association with baseline BMI is probably largely due to the fact that the participants were all overweight or obese, so that the groups had relatively smaller variances in BMI than the general population.</p><p>Several cross-sectional studies showed that diets might modify the effect of the <italic>FTO</italic> variant on obesity, but the data from randomized diet intervention trials are conflicting and limited by small sample size or short term of follow-up (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1799/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 3</ext-link>). Two lifestyle intervention studies with follow-up periods of 9 and 12 months did not find significant influence of <italic>FTO</italic> polymorphisms (rs8050136 and rs9939609) on changes in body weight or fat distribution related to diet among 200 overweight and obese individuals treated by diets with reduced fat and increased fiber or reduced fat and sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In another 10-week, hypo-energetic diet intervention with either low fat or high fat content, the <italic>FTO</italic> variant had an effect on only changes in resting energy expenditure, insulin release, and sensitivity, not on weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Similarly, in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, the <italic>FTO</italic> variant did not modify weight change by individualized diet intervention with reduced fat and increased fiber during the 4-year follow-up of 255 individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In our study, when macronutrient components of diets were not considered, we found no main effects of the <italic>FTO</italic> variant on changes in weight and body composition during the intervention.</p><p>Grau et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) reported that dietary fat/carbohydrate content interacted with some genetic variants including the <italic>FTO</italic> variant on weight reduction or change in obesity-related phenotypes. In our study, we also found significant gene-diet interactions on changes in body composition and fat distribution. However, our data indicate that it is the dietary protein component, rather than dietary fat, that might drive the observed interactions. In previous studies, high-protein intervention has been found to result in a greater weight loss and abdominal fat mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Our results suggest that individuals with a certain genetic background may benefit more in weight loss by following a high-protein diet. The mechanism of how protein intake interacts with <italic>FTO</italic> genotype is unclear.</p><p>Our data indicate that the genetic effects on certain fat compositions or depots may be more evident than the effects on overall adiposity. Functional studies have shown that the loss or overexpression of <italic>FTO</italic> in mice led to different changes in fat distribution at different dissected sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). <italic>FTO</italic> mRNA expression was fat depot&#x02013;specific and was found to differ significantly in subcutaneous fat and in visceral fat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Epidemiological studies also have shown that <italic>FTO</italic> variants are significantly associated with distribution of fat depots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that genetic effects of <italic>FTO</italic> on the change of fat mass at various sites may be different, and changes in anthropometrics may not adequately reflect the effects of an <italic>FTO</italic> variant.</p><p>The genetic effect in our study seemed to be more evident at 2 years than that at 6 months. The results were in line with a recent study by Razquin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) in which it was found that <italic>FTO</italic> risk allele carriers had the highest weight reduction after 3 years of intervention with a Mediterranean diet compared with several short-term diet interventions (less than 1 year) in which no influence of an <italic>FTO</italic> variant on weight loss or change in fat distribution was found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Of note, between 6 months and 2 years of intervention in our trial, the participants regained weight. Therefore, it seems that the genetic variant might affect both the reduction and regain of the adiposity measures. These data suggest that the modification effects of diet treatment on an <italic>FTO</italic> genotype effect are more likely to be identified in long-term interventions.</p><p>Several limitations need to be considered when interpreting our findings. Even though our study is thus far the largest and longest diet intervention weight-loss trial, the relatively small sample size of the subgroups may limit the power to detect very moderate genetic effects or interactions. We did not adjust for multiple testing according to the recommendation by Rothman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) and Lai et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>) because outcomes and the repeated measurements at 6 months and 2 years were highly correlated in our study. Overadjustment for multiple comparisons may increase the type II error and reduce power to detect significant differences. In addition, the majority of the total participants were white, and further studies are needed to determine whether our findings are generalizable to other ethnic groups. Even though the randomized clinical trial is thought to be the best model to test gene-environment interactions, we acknowledge that replication in diverse populations is needed to verify our findings.</p><p>In summary, we found that dietary protein intake might modify the <italic>FTO</italic> variant&#x02019;s effect on changes in body composition and fat distribution. A high-protein diet may be beneficial for weight loss in individuals with the risk allele of an <italic>FTO</italic> variant. Further studies are warranted to verify our findings and explore the potential mechanisms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>This article contains Supplementary Data online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1799/-/DC1">http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/db11-1799/-/DC1</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was supported by grants from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (HL071981), the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (DK091718), the General Clinical Research Center (RR-02635), and the Boston Obesity Nutrition Research Center (DK46200).
