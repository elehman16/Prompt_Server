During this treatment, patients recall traumatic memories while making horizontal eye movements (EM). Studies have shown that EM not only desensitize negative memories but also positive memories and imagined events. Substance use behavior and craving are maintained by maladaptive memory associations and visual imagery. Preliminary findings have indicated that these mental images can be desensitized by EMDR techniques. We conducted two proof-of-principle studies to investigate whether EM can reduce the sensory richness of substance-related mental representations and accompanying craving levels. We investigated the effects of EM on (1) vividness of food-related mental imagery and food craving in dieting and non-dieting students and (2) vividness of recent smoking-related memories and cigarette craving in daily smokers. In both experiments, participants recalled the images while making EM or keeping eyes stationary. Image vividness and emotionality, image-specific craving and general craving were measured before and after the intervention. As a behavioral outcome measure, participants in study 1 were offered a snack choice at the end of the experiment. Results of both experiments showed that image vividness and craving increased in the control condition but remained stable or decreased after the EM intervention. EM additionally reduced image emotionality (experiment 2) and affected behavior (experiment 1): participants in the EM condition were more inclined to choose healthy over unhealthy snack options. In conclusion, these data suggest that EM can be used to reduce intensity of substance-related imagery and craving. Although long-term effects are yet to be demonstrated, the current studies suggest that EM might be a useful technique in addiction treatment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>EMDR</kwd><kwd>eye movements</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>food craving</kwd><kwd>cigarette craving</kwd><kwd>working memory taxation</kwd><kwd>mental imagery</kwd><kwd>addiction memory</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn01">ZonMw<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100001826</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn01">40-00812-98-12030</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn02">Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/501100003246</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="cn02">452-08-015</award-id></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="70"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="8912"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) is a well-established, effective treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD: (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)]. During EMDR, patients recall their traumatic memories while making horizontal eye movements (EM). This decreases the sensory richness of the memories and makes them less emotionally intense. Interestingly, mounting research shows that EM can also decrease the vividness and emotionality of positively laden memories (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and images of possible future events (flash-forwards) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). This suggests that EMDR might be suitable for the treatment of other types of psychopathology in which maladaptive memory and mental imagery plays a role, including addictive disorders (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>Addictive disorders are chronic and relapsing in nature and pose a widespread problem with great societal, economic, and personal costs. Remission rates are extremely high, with more than 85% of individuals returning to substance use within 1&#x02009;year after quitting (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Over the past years, there has been little progress in identifying new, effective interventions, and relatively few existing interventions have been validated experimentally (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). The present studies were designed to provide proof-of-principle for the use of EMDR in the treatment of addiction. More specifically, it was examined whether making EM during the recall of substance-related images can reduce their vividness, emotionality, and ability to elicit craving, as well as general craving and substance-use behavior.</p><p>Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing was originally developed by Shapiro (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) to facilitate the cognitive processing of traumatic memories. In the basic EMDR protocol (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), the client is instructed to hold an unpleasant memory in mind, while EM is induced by having the client follow a side-to-side motion of the therapist&#x02019;s index finger. The client then reports current sensations, cognitions, and emotions, including the distress caused by the memory. Sets of EM are repeated until the client reports that the distress has been reduced to a minimal level. Then, the client is guided to practice a positive cognition to go with the memory. Multiple meta-analyses show that EMDR is effective in the treatment of PTSD (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Practice guidelines now consider both cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and EMDR to be treatment of choice. Importantly, a meta-analysis by Lee and Cuijpers (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) shows that the EM component of the therapy has significant additional value over and above repeated activation of the memory without EM. In addition, numerous lab studies [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>); and also see Ref. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) for an overview] show that autobiographical memories become less vivid and emotional after applying only the EM component of EMDR, as compared to memory recall only. Hence, EM seems important for EMDR to have its effects, but it is still unclear how this works.</p><p>A plausible explanation of the effects of EM is provided by the working memory (WM) theory. WM is a cognitive system for temporary storage and manipulation of information (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and has limited capacity. During EMDR, people simultaneously recall traumatic memories and make EM, two processes that have both been demonstrated to tax WM (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The subsequent competition for its limited capacity affects memory recall. Memories are processed in a more detached manner and become less vivid and emotional. This memory &#x0201c;blurring&#x0201d; does not only take place during or immediately after the intervention but also appears to have long-term effects [i.e., 1&#x02009;day or week later; (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)]. EMDR seems to exploit the fact that the retrieval of memories returns them to a labile state, during which they can be altered or updated (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). After memory recall plus EM, less vivid, less emotional, and less detailed versions of memories are reconsolidated into long-term storage.</p><p>Evidence for the WM theory of EMDR is provided by many well-controlled lab studies. They show that simultaneous EM reduce memory vividness, but so do other dual WM tasks, such as mental arithmetic (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) or copying a complex drawing (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), compared to memory recall without a dual task. Furthermore, and as noted before, negative memories are affected by dual WM tasks, but so are other kinds of taxing mental images, including positive memories [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)] and distressing images about possible future events (flash-forwards) (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>In addictive disorders, the retrieval of substance-related memories is crucial to the experience of craving, which is, in turn, a strong predictor of substance use maintenance and relapse (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). These substance-related memories include classically and instrumentally learned associations between cues and effects (e.g., the association between feeling stressed and smoking and between smoking and becoming relaxed). They also include episodic memories, such as memories of specific encounters with the substance (e.g., a great first use experience), memories of substance use consequences, and memories of loss of self-control and relapse (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Craving is often maintained and augmented by sensory imagery [e.g., imagining sight, smell, future use: (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>)]. Research shows that instructions to form mental images of substance use increase craving [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>)], with more vivid imagery predicting higher craving intensity (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).</p><p>Craving can be reduced by dual task procedures. Many studies have shown that engaging in non-substance-related imagery or visuospatial tasks while experiencing high craving levels reduces craving frequency and intensity [for overviews, see Ref. (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>)]. Concurrent cognitive activity therefore provides a valuable way of coping with the acute effects of craving and can be easily implemented in clinical practice [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>)]. When craving is experienced, one can engage in a dual task. However, this method requires substance-dependent persons to identify craving while it can still be controlled, whereas self-monitoring, self-evaluation, and cognitive control are often compromised in addiction (<xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Furthermore, and in contrast to EMDR, this method is not designed to alter substance-related representations in memory storage, and long-term effects are not expected after one quits using it. To achieve prolonged craving reduction, specific instructions must be given to retrieve the images before engaging in the dual task. Only reactivated memories enter a labile state and are susceptible to alteration or disruption (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Three studies so far have investigated the effects of visuospatial WM tasks (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) during <italic>instructed</italic> imagery of favorite foods in a sample of healthy (non-preselected) students. All tasks significantly reduced the vividness of the food-related imagery and craving compared to a control condition. Although long-term effects were not measured, these studies provide first indications that concurrent tasks can degrade substance-related images.</p><p>Research on the effectiveness of the full EMDR procedure in addiction is limited. In most studies, EMDR predominantly focused on traumatic memories constituting comorbid PTSD and not on memory representations or sensory imagery constituting substance craving and dependence itself (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The investigations of EMDR that did specifically target substance-related memories are clinical anecdotes or case reports [for a list, see Ref. (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>)]. Although most of them describe positive results, some found mixed (<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) or negative results (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). Only one controlled study has been published so far (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In this study, thirty alcohol-dependent patients received either treatment as usual (TAU) along with two EMDR sessions or TAU only. Target memories were memories of specific instances of intense craving and relapse. Patients in the TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EMDR group showed a significant reduction in alcohol craving one as well as six months posttreatment, compared to patients receiving TAU only. In addition, fewer patients from the TAU&#x02009;+&#x02009;EMDR group relapsed. Unfortunately, the study has several limitations, including small sample sizes and multiple drop-outs on follow-up measures. Nonetheless, the results are encouraging for the application of EMDR targeting specific addiction memories, especially because the effects were obtained after only two sessions.</p><p>In order to determine whether EMDR can serve as a promising adjunct to current treatment options for addiction, more research is necessary, including well-controlled proof-of-principle studies showing that EM can desensitize addiction-relevant memory representations and imagery. In the present studies, the effects of EM on the vividness and emotionality of substance-related images and associated craving were investigated. Because craving is triggered by addiction memories and exacerbated by mental imagery, both were used as targets in each of the two studies. In the first study, EM targeted food-related <italic>imagery</italic> and food craving in healthy dieting and non-dieting participants. It extends the studies by Kemps et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), McClelland et al. (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), and Steel et al. (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), by placing more emphasis on the retrieval or formation of food-related mental images before the dual task was introduced. Moreover, our study solely focused on the effects of EM as dual task to reduce craving. Furthermore, there were methodological differences, such as the use of a between-subjects design, which prevents possible carry-over effects of interventions on craving. The second study was concerned with smoking-related <italic>memories</italic> and cigarette craving and was conducted in smokers. Both studies employed the EMDR lab model [cf., Ref. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>)], in which half of the participants recalled a substance-related image while making EM (recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM), whereas the other half of the participants recalled the image while keeping eyes stationary (RO). Image vividness, emotionality, and craving were measured before (pretest) and after the intervention (posttest). We expected that recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM, relative to RO, would decrease image vividness, emotionality, and craving from pre- to posttest.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Study 1: The Effects of EM on Food-Related Imagery and Food Craving</title><p>The first study focused on craving for food. Although food craving is commonly experienced and plays a significant evolutionary role (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), it is associated with unfavorable outcomes, including high-calorie food consumption and body mass index (BMI) (<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), binge eating (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>), development of obesity (<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), and having difficulty in maintaining a diet (<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). Many lines of research demonstrate that parallels exist between drug and food cravings in neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and learning (<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>), providing the rationale for study 1.</p><p>Dieting and non-dieting participants were instructed to actively imagine eating their favorite food. We compared the effects of recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM versus RO on the vividness and emotionality of these food-related images, as well as specific craving in response to these images and more general craving for their favorite food. Furthermore, we compared snack choice at the end of the task. It was expected that, compared to RO, recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM would decrease craving, vividness, and emotionality of the food-related imagery. We also expected healthier snack choices after EM than RO. Because dieters are trying to exert control over their food intake, they are likely to experience motivational conflict when they think of their favorite food (<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Therefore, we expected that food-related imagery would be more taxing for dieters, resulting in greater effects of the intervention in this group. Generalizability of effects was explored by comparing craving for two other favorite foods at pre- and posttest.</p><p>Both the present study and study 2 were approved by the local ethics committee of the Faculty of Behavioral and Social Sciences of Utrecht University.

After signing informed consent, participants were asked several questions about their diet and reported their height and weight, in order to calculate their BMI, and filled out the G-FCQ-T. Then, participants were instructed to select three food items that they craved most at that specific moment. These were entered into the software, and intensity of craving for each food was assessed using on-screen VASs. Out of the three selected foods, participants then picked their favorite one, i.e., the food they craved most at that specific moment. This food became the target for the EM or RO intervention, whereas the other two foods did not (non-targets). First, participants filled out the G-FCQ-S, of which the word &#x0201c;food&#x0201d; was replaced with participants&#x02019; target food. They were asked to vividly picture this food and imagine its taste and smell as if they were eating it right now. When the image was clear, they rated vividness and emotionality of this image and image-specific craving using VASs. Subsequently, the EM task started. Half of the participants recalled their image while making EM. The other half recalled their image while keeping eyes stationary (RO). Immediately after the recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM or RO intervention, target images were again scored on vividness, emotionality, and craving. The two non-target images were also scored on craving. Then, the G-FCQ-S was filled out for a second time. After finishing this questionnaire, participants proceeded to the behavioral task and were offered the choice between a candy bar and an apple.

This effect was most pronounced in non-dieting participants. In addition, there was a trend for recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM to decrease food image vividness, whereas it increased after recalling the image without making EM. General craving for the selected food (G-FCQ-S) did not decrease after recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM, but remained stable over time. Note that general craving for food increased after RO, which can be expected due to the passage of time (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>) and repeated craving imagery (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Accordingly, one might argue that making EM during recall attenuates craving. After only a brief application of EM (4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;24&#x02009;s), we consider this a clinically relevant result, especially because the G-FCQ-S is a broad measure that incorporates items that do not specifically refer to the preferred food (e.g., &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m hungry&#x0201d;). Finally, a brief session of EM during food-related imagery affected subsequent snack choice; participants in the EM condition chose the healthier options more often than expected by chance, whereas participants in the RO condition did not.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Study 2: The Effects of EM on Smoking-Related Memories and Cigarette Craving</title><p>In study 2, we compared the effects of recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM versus RO on the vividness and emotionality of smoking-related memories, memory-related cigarette craving, and general cigarette craving in daily smokers.

We extended these studies by applying the methodologically sound EMDR lab model to investigate the effects of EM on substance-related mental images, with special emphasis on the reactivation of these images prior to the EM task [cf., the EMDR protocol (<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>)]. In addition, we investigated effects of EM on both sensory imagery and substance-related memory representations, we used a different range of outcome measures, including a behavioral measure in study 1, and we were the first to test effects of recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM in smokers.</p><p>Both in study 1 and 2, intervention effects were partially driven by vividness and craving increments in the RO condition (see also Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, observing post-intervention dissociations between EM and RO after only four or six sessions of 24&#x02009;s, while craving naturalistically increases during abstinence (<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>), and even more after active imagery (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), is still clinically relevant. Because craving increases over time and/or due to imagery, one might assume that <italic>if</italic> craving would be increased to a maximum level prior to the experiment, an EM intervention would reduce craving. In the second study, we used a small craving induction procedure. Although craving significantly increased, the mean QSU-brief score after the craving induction was still only 3.3 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.5), which is, on a scale from 1 to 7, definitely not maximal. Future studies should employ more thorough craving induction procedures to maximize craving levels at the start of the experiment.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Mean cigarette craving, emotionality, vividness, and Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (QSU-brief) scores per Condition [recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;eye movements (EM), recall only (RO)] at pre- and posttest</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyt-07-00014-g003"/></fig><p>Not all follow-up tests reached statistical significance. This might be explained by the fact that participants did not select the most suitable target images and memories. In study 1, not all participants selected foods that are typically craved (<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In fact, only 47.2% selected high-caloric, sweet, or fatty foods (e.g., chocolate, cookies, fries, etc.). The other participants selected fruit, vegetables, and lunch or dinner meals. These more &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; foods are probably less sensitive to the EM intervention (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). In study 2, participants selected memories of specific, recent situations, and emotional states during which they experienced craving and smoked a cigarette. However, at pretest, image-specific craving scores were only 43.0 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;30.8) on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. These relatively low pre-intervention craving scores might have prevented more substantial effects of EM and might explain why effects did not generalize to the more general craving measure (QSU-brief) at the end of the session. Also, because of these low craving scores, it is unclear how relevant these recent smoking memories actually are to smoking dependence. Memories of craving instances further back in the past might have a larger impact on current craving and smoking behavior. In future studies, an effort should be made to find out what specific memories contribute to current craving in each participant, and these memories should be targeted during the intervention. Other mental representations might serve suitable targets as well, such as trigger situations that someone is confronted with daily or weekly (e.g., waiting at a bus stop), associations of substance use with extremely pleasurable memories (e.g., first shot), or memories of prior relapse and loss of control (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, dieting participants did not exhibit larger decreases in craving or image vividness after EM. This is in line with results from Kemps et al. (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) showing that watching dynamic visual noise during food imagery reduced image vividness and craving in both dieting participants and non-dieting controls. In the present study, however, there was a trend for dieters to show reduced intervention effects compared to non-dieters. This unpredicted finding might, however, be explained by their selection of food-related images: 33.3% chose a fruit or vegetable as their target food, compared to 12.8% in non-dieters group. As noted before, these foods are not typically craved, and more &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; targets have been observed to be less sensitive to recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM (<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, no spontaneous generalization effects were found for recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM on craving for non-recalled favorite foods, indicating that making EM during the imagination of one favorite food does not simply cause any other favorite food to become less desired. However, this finding might be explained by current methodology: non-targets were not explicitly retrieved prior to craving scorings, which might have prevented elaboration upon craving-related thoughts. Pretest craving scores were indeed lower for non-target foods (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;66.9, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;15.2) than for target foods (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80.7, SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;14.0).</p><p>In sum, despite non-maximal craving levels at the start of the experiment, and despite the fact that suboptimal target images were selected, we found significant effects of EM on the sensory richness of substance-related memories and imagery, associated craving, and subsequent behavior in two non-clinical samples. In line with previous studies, these data suggest that EM can be used as coping skill to temporarily reduce the intensity of craving. It remains to be investigated if EM can definitely alter substance-related memory and serve to reduce the occurrence or intensity of future cravings, without simultaneous taxing of WM. However, as noted before, several studies that adopted a similar design, i.e., the EMDR lab model, did observe effects that lasted over time [e.g., Ref. (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>)].</p><p>It seems implausible that very short recall&#x02009;+&#x02009;EM interventions of the type used here will result in therapeutic effects. Note that in EMDR for PTSD, a series of sessions lasting 1&#x02009;h or more are used to reduce the intensity and occurrence of trauma related flashbacks outside the clinic. It would be fascinating to test if the full EMDR procedure for food or drug craving may decrease craving in the long run and reduce relapse rates. However, it should first be established which images should best be targeted (memories, imagery, associations, cues, etc.), whether the effects are observed for all facets of craving [reward, relief, obsessive craving, see Ref. (<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>)], whether the effects of EM generalize to actual substance use behavior, and whether they generalize to people trying to control or quit their substance use, i.e., the eventual target group for the EMDR intervention.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>ML: designed the experiments and supervised students during data collection, analyzed the data, and wrote the paper.
