Bone mass density is critical for strong bones. Since over 40% of bone mass in the adult is established during adolescence thus increasing of it through these years may be an important issue that will prevent osteoporotic fractures during later life.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Many risk factors for osteoporosis has been noted, such as age, sex, genetic, race and body structure that is not changeable, but preventive life style behaviors such as a balanced diet, physical activity and also avoiding risk factors such as smoking, salt, cola-type beverages and caffeine should begin at childhood and adolescence. These choices play a significant role in the attainment of picking bone mass. Nof 2013.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Several studies have estimated that 20-50% of the variation in bone density is affected by lifestyle.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Enough dietary calcium consumption, regular weight-bearing physical activity, adequate consumption of Vitamin D make the most of peak bone mass during this period of time.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Vitamin D is the main factor, because it helps body to absorb the calcium in the diet and Sunlight exposure is a strong source of vitamin D.

The investigation was approved by The Medical Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Science.</p><p>This is the second phase of the field trial, which had been carried out in three all- female High Schools between September 2013 and February 2014 in Isfahan, Iran. The sample size of the trial was estimated 210 participants (70/group) after consideration 10% attrition rate to increase the power of the study (power = 80% with type I error = 0.05, standard deviation [SD] = 20). Each subject gave informed consent before participating in the intervention.</p><p>Sampling was conducted in three stages. The First one includes a list containing all 120 public female high schools in Isfahan province, was prepared by the Department of Training and Education then within the sampling frame of six urban education and training regions, three schools were selected by simple random sampling. To prevent contamination, the groups were selected from different schools the schools were classified into three groups based on randomized allocation. After coordination with managers, the first school was selected for education of girls (daughter centered = group A), the next selected for education of the mothers (Mother centered = group B) and the last one, was selected as a control group (group C). All three schools have had a health educator. The next step was to select students in both groups A and C. Through the sampling frame 70 students were selected. The sampling flow was about the official number in each grade. They were asked to take participate at the specified time in the meeting. Furthermore, in group B 70 mothers randomly selected from the list of the parents. They were invited by letter to participate in training sessions that is about healthy lifestyles in order to prevent osteoporosis in their daughters.

They specified items regarding their sun exposure quality and quantity they were asked about daily and weekly physical activity. The range of lifestyle score based on diet and sun exposure were 0-172 points (139 poins belonged to The diet and 33 points about sun exposure) that categorized to three levels, undesirable: Rating from 0 to 86 (below 50%), semi-desirable: 87-144 (between 50% and 84%) and desirable: More than 145 (between 85% and 100%).

The results illustrate the fact that, an educational intervention for primary prevention of osteoporosis in adolescent might be improve girl's diet and sun exposure, regard that whom is educated, mothers or teenagers. Giving information about the importance of osteoporosis give us enough insight to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Health education is effective to prevent diseases that are related to lifestyle. Results of the studies provided evidences that osteoporosis prevention education was effective for a change in behavior, and this should begin in adolescence and continue throughout adulthood.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>As a fact, lifestyle wasn&#x02019;t desirable regarding the nutrition exercise and sun exposure in the studied subjects. On the other hand, the majority of them had semi desirable diet condition; no subject had desirable condition in this respect regarding the exercise 64.4% of the participants did not have an acceptable lifestyle, and 35.6% had a desirable lifestyle. Regular daily sun exposure quality and quantity was not favorable in most of the studied subjects. The findings of the other studies consistent with our pretest findings. In Rahnavard <italic>et al</italic>. study the most of the female teenagers did not have a desirable condition regarding the nutrition and exercise.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Kristal study revealed that 25% of female adolescents were smokers, 58% consumed calcium less inadequately, and 52% had low to moderate physical activity levels.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] in Yekefallah <italic>et al</italic>. study 66.7% female adolescents and 34.7% of male adolescents used diet Including Vitamin D, cola-type drinks and caffeine. Approximately, 33.5% of the boys and 26.9% of the girls drank one cup of milk per day. Furthermore, only 9% of male students and 6.7% of female students were exposed to sunlight.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>After the intervention, students in mothers and daughters groups showed significant improvement in relation to the diet. The increase in the mean percentage point of the diet in Mothers group was 11, while this was 1.8 in daughters. These values gradually decreased in both groups, after 6 months, although in the daughters group approximately equal to the basic level, in mothers it was still 3.47% higher than the baseline. Winzenberg study on 345 mothers, demonstrated that parental education on nutrition and Vitamin D, led to an increase in calcium intake in children by 47%. According to this study: &#x0201c;Change in calcium supplement use alone perhaps demonstrates some motivation to change osteoporosis preventive behaviors, but less than that needed to accomplish physical activity change in children&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>At the mothers&#x02019; meeting, there was a further attention on making ca-rich girl's diet. To encourage mothers to go along with their daughters to do physical activities, which was recommended at the sessions, to create a background by the basic &#x0201c;equipment&#x0201d; for osteoporosis prevention such as buying calcium-rich foods against harmful substances that excreted calcium and on positive support for the girls. Women are the family health center. They are also responsible for preparing meals and spend more time with their children so they can play an effective role on improving them. On The other hand, mothers are more than concerned children about the future health condition and consequences, so they can play an effective role on improving disease preventive behaviors in their children.</p><p>Another component of lifestyle is sun exposure in our study, the mean percentage of desirability of sun exposure quality and quantity improved 13.8% in mother centered group and 8.34% in daughter centered group after 4 weeks, but this rising was more significant in group B than group A. Both of the intervention groups returned back to the basic score after the 6 months follow-up. In a randomized clinical trial in The Netherlands, subjects were randomly assigned to daily Vitamin D supplementation or advice for sunlight exposure in order to treat Vitamin D deficiency for 3, 6 and 12 months. After 3 months, mean serum 25(OH)D increased in both groups. Though this was more in the supplementation groups than in the advised sunlight group. At 6 months, these measurements were lower than 3 months. At 12 months, the percentage of Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25(OH)D &#x0003c;25 nmol/l) in subjects, was still less than the initial time, except for the sunlight group.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Probably the reason for a reduction in the educational impact is &#x0201c;to forget&#x0201d; over the course of the time. Despite knowing the advantages of using sunlight as a strong source of Vitamin D in osteoporosis prevention; few intervention studies have been conducted concerning sun exposure that prevents osteoporosis.</p><p>Concerning physical activity, there was no changes in our study at the whole times follow-up. In this field, a high percentage of students did not have satisfactory activities. These findings were supported by the other studies. Kelishadi <italic>et al</italic>., in 2001 in Isfahan, Iran, showed that most of the girls of middle and high schools did not have suitable physical activities.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Findings of the other study to promote physical activity in children, revealed that even quite complex and rigorous interventions did not unavoidably increase physical activity.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The results of Winzenberg study that examining parental impacts on children's physical activity showed no change on this behavior. Physical activity seems to be a more difficult and complex behavior to change, compared with taking calcium-rich diets. This was shown by the absence of success at improvement physical activity compared to calcium intake in trials specifically trying osteoporosis preventive behavior change.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Perhaps education alone, cannot be effective and community-based interventions may be more effective than individual training.</p><p>Current policy in Iran's high schools is based on about 2 h of physical activity per week, which cannot meet the needs in the field of osteoporosis prevention. These findings suggest that there is a need for a special attention on a policy level in Education and Training system of Iran to enhance exercise training hours at schools, to create a favorable environment at school, to train educational forces that are able to teach effective exercises related to preventing chronic diseases and to provide sports facilities for girls and also appropriate vehicles for transportation seems essential. Since Iran is a land where there is much sunlight, and Muslim women have limitations, creating specific environments like the parks until they can exercise for a few minutes in the sunlight would be helpful for their health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Although the education about the effectiveness of proper use of nutrition and sun has shown a significant impact on both groups, but this is more effective in mothers group. Hence that such training can be held for mothers at the schools of their daughters. In order to prevent the forgotten and maintaining impact on education, booster sessions with low interval are offered.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>All authors have contributed in designing and conducting the study.
