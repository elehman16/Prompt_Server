All patients found to satisfy the inclusion criteria were told about the study. The patients were administered informed consent and those who gave consent were included. Comprehensive diabetic education was imparted to all subjects and they were treated on an outpatient department basis. Patients were on a stable dose of antidiabetic medicines for the initial 6 months, in which they were maintaining an HbA1c level between 6 and 9%. At 6 months, they were randomized into two groups: group non-SKY and group SKY. Randomization was performed by computer-generated numbers using the n Query advisor program. The SKY group patients underwent a comprehensive yogic breathing program for 3 days. This course included yogic movements and postures (asanas), relaxation practices, meditation, group processes and discussion of stress-relieving principles. Patients underwent 1 h of long group breathing technique, which included three stages of Pranayam, three rounds of 20 each of Bhastrika, three times Om chanting and Sudarshan Kriya (long kriya) followed by rest in supine position on the first and second day. On the third day, they were taught the short breathing technique, which included three stages of Pranayam, three rounds of 20 each of Bhastrika, three times Om chanting and Sudarshan Kriya (short kriya) followed by rest in supine position.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This process took a total of 25&#x02013;35 min and was learnt under the guidance of a certified teacher.</p><p>Patients in the non-SKY group continued the standard treatment of diabetes while patients in the SKY group continued the standard treatment and practice of short kriya daily at home. To ensure home practice, they were asked to fill a follow-up book in which they marked the days on which they did SKY and got it countersigned by a relative or attendant. They were required to come weekly for group Sudarshan Kriya Yoga and Pranayam (long kriya) to a center in the hospital and get the follow-up book signed by the yoga teacher each time they attended.</p><p>Compliance was defined as number of short kriya &#x02265;30 (33% of short kriyas) and number of long kriya &#x02265;3 (25% of long kriyas) or number of long kriya &#x02265;6 (50% of long kriyas). To ensure compliance, telephonic reminders were given to the patients the day after the course was completed for daily practice of short kriya and weekly to come for the group practice of long kriya.</p><p>At the time of enrollment, the following tests were carried out: fasting plasma glucose (FBG), plasma glucose postprandial (PPBS), HbA1c, electrocardiogram, ocular tension measurement, blood urea and serum creatinine.</p><p>After 3 months, assessment of plasma glucose-fasting and -postprandial, HbA1c and QOL by WHOQOL BREF questionnaire were performed.</p><p>HbA1c was measured by the BIO-RAD D-10 Hemoglobin A1c Program.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann&#x02013;Whitney) test using STATA/IC 11.1 software.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>A total of 210 patients were screened.

Although there was a trend toward improvement in glycemic control in patients practicing SKY and taking standard treatment compared with those taking standard treatment alone, this improvement was not statistically significant.</p><p>Yoga is practiced worldwide for its health benefits, including physical fitness, relaxation and awareness of self. It is based on the principle that the mind and body are intimately related. Stress produces a state of physical and mental tension. In yoga, physical postures and breathing exercises improve muscle strength, flexibility, blood circulation and oxygen uptake. While many researchers conceptualize yoga as a form of physical activity, others argue that comprehensive yoga, an approach incorporating body postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayamas), meditation, cleansing, nutrition, attitudinal and behavioral modification and mental discipline, is more beneficial and loyal to its ancient tenets.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies suggested that SKY may be useful for relieving depression,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] improving the antioxidant[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and immune[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] defenses of the body. In an open preliminary study, there was a significant decrease in fasting blood sugar, cholesterol and triglycerides after the practice of SKY for 4 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Although this study suggested a promising potential of SKY as complementary therapy in diabetes, it was limited by its sample size and design. Systematic scientific experiments are necessary to establish the efficacy of SKY as a complementary therapy in chronic diseases like diabetes.</p><p>There is growing evidence concerning the potent effect of psychosocial factors on physical health outcomes. People with diabetes often feel challenged by their disease and its day to day management demands. This itself can lead to stress. The psychosocial toll of living with diabetes can often affect self-care behavior, long-term glycemic control, QOL and risk of developing long-term complications. There is now good evidence that psychosocial issues are critical to good diabetes care. Psychosocial factors often determine self-management behaviors, and psychosocial variables (such as depression) are often strong predictors of measures such as the presence of complications, body mass index (BMI) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]</p><p>Yoga has been studied for its role in the management of several chronic diseases, including obesity, hypertension,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] asthma,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] neuromuscular diseases[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] and psychiatric illnesses.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Yoga has been studied for controlling both the symptoms and the complications associated with diabetes mellitus type 2.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Yoga can be easily learned and performed. Once learned, yoga can be practiced at any time on an individual basis thus reducing common barriers to physical activity such as time conflicts and poor weather. It is not as simple as swallowing a drug. It needs acceptance, motivation, a will for improvement, time, silent space for practice and active participation on the part of the patient and the patient's family. Also, it does not show immediate effect and, for attitudinal change and health benefits, it needs to be practiced regularly.</p><p>A controlled pilot study in healthy volunteers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] showed that subjects who practice SKY felt that they had gained a tool that can be used in stressful situations that would make it easier to relax and better handle them.</p><p>Five studies were included in a review[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] with 10 arms, comparing the intervention of yoga practice alone or combined with other modes of interventions. Five arms (200 participants with the control group in which two arms and 40 participants) received nothing apart from the conventional medical therapy,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] one arm and 72 participants received recommendation on unsupervised training at home,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] one arm and 30 participants received herbal, diet and exercise[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and the last arm with 20 participants reviewed recommendation for diet and walking exercise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] A total of 362 participants (200 intervention group and 164 in the control group) were analyzed. The mean trial duration was 14 weeks (range from 6 to 24 weeks). These studies were conducted in India and in the USA. Yoga practice alone was used in three studies,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] while it was combined with lifestyle modification only in one study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Yoga was accompanied with lifestyle modification, diet and herbal intake in one study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] All of the participants received training for yoga practice. The range of frequency of each session of yoga practice was different: e.g. two 20-min sessions per day for one of the trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and three to five 90-min sessions in another.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Four studies provided results on FPG. These four studies provided favorable results for the intervention in lowering FPG. The mean differences ranged from 28.8 to 41.1 in lowering the plasma glucose between the intervention and control groups, and they were all significant in three studies;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] however, the difference in the Elder study was 3.6, and it was not significant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Three of the included studies reported the value of HbA1c.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The mean differences indicated that the intervention lowered the level of the HbA1c. However, the results were only statistically significant in one study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>The main objective of treating all chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus is to improve well being and attain a satisfactory QOL. Pooled analysis of population-based surveys in Germany (<italic>n</italic> = 9579) has shown that type 2 diabetes has negative consequences for health-related QOL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] In another study, the mean total score of QOL in physical dimension, mental&#x02013;emotional and feelings of well being dimensions and behavioral activity dimension were significantly higher in the healthy population than in the diabetes mellitus group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Other studies have also shown that type 2 diabetes adversely affects the QOL[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] and good QOL is significantly related to good compliance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there was improvement in all four domains and total mean score of QOL post intervention in the group practicing SKY compared with the group getting standard treatment of diabetes alone [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. The improvements in domains 1, 2, 3 and total mean score of QOL were significant.</p><p>In the previous study of SKY in reducing anxiety, practice of SKY for 2 months was accompanied by a significant reduction in anxiety score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.039) and stress score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.017) and by marginal improvement in patience score (<italic>P</italic> = 0.134).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] A sense of well being was reported by 67% of the subjects, improved sleep quality was reported by 50% and 33% experienced increased enthusiasm for doing their work.</p><p>In another pilot study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] in healthy volunteers, those practicing a comprehensive yogic breathing program experienced increased wellness, reduced stress, feeling of balance and living in present moment and a new outlook in life compared with a group that was instructed to relax in an arm chair each day during the same period.</p><p>Our study is the first randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of SKY on glycemic control and QOL. The major challenge in our study was the compliance in practicing SKY. That is why we selected patients from nearby only. We ensured compliance by providing them a logbook. They had to get the logbook signed daily by a relative after finishing a short yogic breathing exercise at home. Their logbook was reviewed weekly at the yoga center when they came for the weekly group breathing program and signed by the yoga instructor.</p><p>Compliance was defined as number of short kriya &#x02265;30 (33% of short kriyas) + number of long kriya &#x02265;3 (25% of long kriyas) or number of long kriya &#x02265;6 (50% of long kriyas).</p><p>Reasons for non-compliance were failure to complete the 3-day comprehensive yogic breathing program (engagements at home, sudden illness or demise of relative), lack of motivation, illness, travel, lack of time due to long working hours or household work, all of which led to inability to pursue the home practice and weekly group processes.</p><p>Because there was evidence for weekly follow-up and performance of long kriya as the log books had to be signed by the yoga instructor, the number of long kriya was given more weightage. At 3 months (90 days), 33% amounted to 30 short kriyas. As the short kriyas were self-reported, the criteria of 25% of total long kriyas was added (3 months amounts to 12 weekly follow-ups, 25% of which is three long kriyas).</p><p>However, this study has limitations. Firstly, patients in the SKY group on an average had longer duration of diabetes compared with those in the non-SKY group. This is a potential contributing factor to the final results. Secondly, the compliance of daily practice was self-reported by patients. Thirdly, because there are no parameters by which we can define compliance, the definition of compliance used in this study was arbitrary. Fourthly, the sample size is limited. Fifthly, the small sample size of compliant versus non-compliant limits a valid statistical comparison between the two groups. Lastly, the study could not be not blinded.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>This study was a randomized controlled intervention trial to assess the effect of Sudarshan Kriya Yoga and Pranayam on glycemic control and QOL in patients with diabetes in addition to the standard treatment of diabetes.</p><p>There was a trend toward improvement in glycemic control, which was only marginal and not statistically significant.
