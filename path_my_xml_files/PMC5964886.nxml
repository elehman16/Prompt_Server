Following the conclusion of the strategy, a continued focus on prevention is needed to maintain progress and reduce disparities in conception rates between different parts of the country. Data from 2017 indicate that there is a sixfold difference in the under-18 conception rate between local authorities (LAs) and 60% of LAs have at least one electoral ward with a significantly higher rate than the average for England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The teenage birth rate remains higher in England and Wales than comparable Western European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Even after controlling for prior disadvantage, teenage pregnancy is associated with adverse medical, social, educational and economic outcomes for both mothers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Teenage pregnancy is a symptom of and contributes to the maintenance of health inequalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In 2006, it was estimated that teenage pregnancy cost the NHS &#x000a3;63 million per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STI) disproportionally affect young adults and cost the NHS large sums [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, effective prevention saves money. Return on investment analysis of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, for example, calculated that for every &#x000a3;1 spent, &#x000a3;4 was saved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Social marketing interventions to prevent teenage pregnancy</title><p id="Par15">A recent systematic review of social marketing interventions to reduce teenage pregnancy examined studies of interventions embracing social marketing elements regardless of whether these were explicitly termed &#x02018;social marketing&#x02019; in their description [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis but narrative synthesis concluded this was a promising approach to addressing unintended teenage pregnancy.</p><p id="Par16">&#x02018;Safer Choices&#x02019; and the &#x02018;Children&#x02019;s AIDS Society (CAS) Carrera&#x02019; Program were two effective social marketing interventions identified in the above review. Safer Choices is a school-based intervention involving a school health promotion council coordinating intervention activities, a classroom-based sexual health curriculum, student-led social marketing campaigns and information for parents. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) of this intervention in the US reported reduced unprotected last sex and reduced numbers of partners with whom unprotected sex occurred but did not measure effects on pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The &#x02018;CAS Carrera&#x02019; Program is an after-school intervention providing careers, academic, arts, sports and life-skills sessions and sexual health services. An RCT of this intervention in New York City reported fewer pregnancies and delayed sexual debut among girls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. An attempted replication trial in other US locations reported no such reductions, reportedly due to poor fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Gatehouse project, although not cited in the above review, is a further intervention that adopts social marketing principles and was found to be effective in postponing age of sexual debut. The Gatehouse project is a school-based intervention which includes a student needs survey and classroom-based curriculum addressing social and emotional learning. Although primarily addressing mental health, an RCT in Australian high schools reported participants&#x02019; increased age of sexual debut, but did not measure impacts on teenage pregnancy explicitly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">School-based social marketing initiatives to prevent unintended teenage pregnancy and promote sexual health have not been trialled in the UK. Our study aims to optimise, feasibility test and pilot trial in English secondary schools a whole-school social marketing intervention called &#x02018;Positive Choices&#x02019;. Positive Choices is informed by selected components from the Safer Choices, CAS Carrera and Gatehouse programmes and &#x02018;whole-school&#x02019; approaches to health improvement found to be effective in addressing a range of health risk behaviours, including those related to teenage pregnancy and sexual health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The Positive Choices intervention involves multiple components comprising a student needs survey, a student/staff led School Health Promotion Council, a classroom curriculum addressing social/emotional skills and sex education, student-led social marketing, parent information and a review of school sexual health services. The use of a student need survey to inform school coordination of the intervention by a student/staff council was informed by the Gatehouse intervention. The use of a school health promotion council, classroom curriculum and student-led social marketing was informed by the Safer Choices intervention. The intervention was informed by the CAS Carrera intervention not in terms of specific activities but more in terms of a focus on aiming to promote sexual health via a focus on developing positive skills and attitudes. In this study, our aim is not to assess the effects of Positive Choices, but to optimise the intervention with the National Children&#x02019;s Bureau Sex Education Forum (NCB SEF)&#x02013;&#x02013;a voluntary sector organisation that advocates for and provides resources to support the delivery of evidence and rights-based relationships and sex education in England&#x02013;&#x02013;one state secondary school and other stakeholders, feasibility test and refine the intervention in the optimisation school, and conduct a pilot RCT and process evaluation in six schools to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and our trial methods. The study will determine the feasibility and utility of conducting a phase III trial of intervention effectiveness and cost effectiveness.

However, if participants nonetheless describe any sexual abuse, or otherwise become upset in any way, our researchers will be trained in how to respond. In the case of focus groups, researchers will be trained to ensure that discussions do not move in the direction of personal disclosures of sexual behaviour since this is not the purpose of the groups and it would be very difficult to ensure that all focus group participants did not talk about such disclosures outside the group. Staff will be trained to identify the potential for such disclosures, work to avoid them but then to approach participants immediately after the focus group to offer support and to assess whether any other response is needed, using the same procedures as described above.</p><p id="Par119">Any member of the research/fieldwork team visiting a school will be required to have a full Disclosure and Barring Services (DBS) check. All work will be carried out in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Data Protection Act 1998 and the latest Directive on GCP (2005/28/EC).</p><p id="Par120">The trial steering group (which because this is a pilot not a phase III RCT will undertake data monitoring and ethics duties) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine ethics committee will be provided with anonymised reports of all disclosures of serious abuse and any other serious adverse events. These will categorised by type, circumstances and the extent of any possible connection with intervention or research activities.</p><p id="Par121">In each school and within NCB a senior member of staff will be identified who is not directly involved with the intervention and whom staff or students may go to if they have complaints about any elements of the research study. This will be communicated to students outside of the research process to increase trust that this is truly independent.</p><p id="Par122">Quantitative and qualitative data will be managed by project staff using secure data management systems and stored anonymously using participant identification numbers. Quantitative data will be managed by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine accredited clinical trials unit (CTU). Where collected, participant identification numbers and corresponding participant names will be held in separate files; these files will be password-protected folders. The names used in qualitative data will be replaced with pseudonyms in interview/focus group transcripts. In reporting the results of the process evaluation, care will be taken to use quotations which do not reveal the identity of respondents.</p><p id="Par123">In line with MRC guidance on personal information in medical research, we will retain all research data for 20&#x000a0;years after the end of the study. This is to allow secondary analyses and further research to take place and to allow any queries or concerns about the conduct of the study to be addressed. In order to maintain the accessibility of the data the files will be refreshed annually and upgraded if required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Public and patient involvement (PPI)</title><p id="Par124">In preparing this protocol, we have collaborated with staff and students from five schools involved in UCL Partners Schools Health Research Network (co-directed by CB) via consultations in September&#x02013;October 2014. These informed our decisions to focus our year 9 curriculum on social/emotional skills and our year 10 curriculum on sexual health and contraception/protection, include a focus on school sexual health services, ensure student-led social marketing embraces social media, use interviews where appropriate in our process evaluation and interview students as well as staff in control schools to assess usual provision.</p><p id="Par125">We also consulted with five members of the ALPHA (Advice Leading to Public Health Advancement) youth group based at the DECIPHer Centre, Cardiff University, on 29 October 2014. Participants were enthusiastic about the intervention, supported this starting in year 9, very supportive of school-based sexual health services and felt that targeting would be problematic. Although some components are already being delivered in some schools, none use a coherent programme informed by social marketing principles.</p><p id="Par126">Ongoing consultation with NCB SEF and one secondary school in London is inbuilt into the optimisation phase of the study. Policy stakeholder&#x02019;s events and consultation with the ALPHA youth advisory group will continue to take place throughout the duration of the project.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Expected output of research/impact</title><p id="Par127">As well as reporting in the NIHR Public Health Research journal, we would submit two open-access papers to high-impact journals reporting our key findings regarding (1) process evaluation of integrated social marketing strategy and (2) student/staff experiences of the intervention. We will present our findings at two international conferences (Society of Prevention Research and International Association for Adolescent Health) in 2019, as well as national conferences. We will disseminate the results to participating schools, to the ALPHA youth group based at DECIPHer and to schools in the Institute of Education/UCLPartners School Health and Wellbeing Research Network and Healthy Schools London network, both of which we are already heavily involved in. We will draft an article for the Times Education Supplement about the research. The research team will also use blog-posts and Twitter to increase public awareness of the study. Knowledge exchange is built into the proposed work from the outset via the stakeholder group. We will present emerging findings at two meetings with policy stakeholders, including policy officials and public health commissioners in the UK nations. Two policy and practice dissemination events will be held: one seminar in partnership with Public Health England and one at the Association for Young People&#x02019;s Health.</p><p id="Par128">The most important scientific outputs generated by this project will be increased knowledge about the feasibility and acceptability of delivering and trialling an intervention which uses social marketing strategies and is informed by existing effective interventions to prevent unintended teenage pregnancies. This will inform the development of a subsequent proposal for a phase III effectiveness trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec40"><title>Research governance</title><sec id="Sec41"><title>Trial registration and conduct</title><p id="Par129">The trial is registered with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com">www.controlled-trials.com</ext-link> (ISCTN 12524938).

The study takes an innovative approach, encompassing the systematic optimisation of the Positive Choices intervention, feasibility testing and refinement in one school followed by a pilot trial in six schools and accompanied with integral process evaluation that draws on principles of realist evaluation to understand processes and mechanisms of action. If the pilot trial proves feasibility and acceptability of the optimised Positive Choices intervention in English secondary schools, plans will be initiated for a phase III trial of intervention and cost-effectiveness. As a universal whole-school social marketing intervention, if found to be effective, Positive Choices has the potential to make significant population-level health improvements.</p><sec id="Sec43"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par137">At the time of submission (November 2017), the optimisation school has been recruited, the needs survey has been carried out in this school, the first set of intervention materials have been optimised and implementation of the intervention for the feasibility assessment phase has begun.
