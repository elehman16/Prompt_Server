The aim of this study was therefore to characterize the effects of GABA-B agonist baclofen on perception of heartburn and distension-induced esophageal reflex subsequent to esophageal capsaicin infusion in healthy volunteers. Specifically, it was hypothesized that acute administration of baclofen may change capsaicin excited sensorimotor characteristics of secondary peristalsis using rapid or slow air esophageal distension.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>We studied 15 healthy volunteers (7 women; mean age 26.9, range 21&#x02013;38 years) enrolled from the community by advertisement. None of the participants had any history of esophageal symptoms or chronic illness. They did not take any prokinetic medication or have frequent consumption of red chili pepper as their diet (at least three times a week) before this study. All the participants gave written informed consent before the study, which was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Taiwan.</p></sec><sec><title>Esophageal manometry</title><p>We recorded intraluminal pressures with a Koenigsberg 4-channel probe with 4.5&#x02009;mm in diameter (Sandhill Scientific, Highlands Ranch, CO). The manometric assembly was designed with one circumferential solid-state pressure sensor at 5&#x02009;cm and three unidirectional pressure sensors at 10, 20, and 25&#x02009;cm from the tip. The infusion port was located in the mid-esophagus between 15 and 20&#x02009;cm from the tip. The catheter was passed through the nose of fasting subjects in the supine position into the esophagus up to a depth of 60&#x02009;cm. We performed stationary pull-through technique to allow most distal sensor in the high-pressure zone of the lower esophageal sphincter. Intraluminal pressures were continuously recorded and stored on the computer during the entire study period. Swallowing event was monitored by the most proximal channel of the catheter, which was located in the pharynx for differentiating primary and secondary peristalsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Secondary peristalsis was recorded 10&#x02009;min after the infusion of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce on two separate occasions, in which all participants had a pre-treatment (90&#x02009;min ahead) with oral baclofen (40&#x02009;mg) and placebo with double-blind in randomized order. Capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce including 5&#x02009;ml of red pepper sauce (Tabasco; McIIhenny Company, Avery Island, LA), diluted with 15&#x02009;ml of saline was infused into the mid-esophagus via the manometric catheter at a rate of 10&#x02009;ml/min. Subjective symptoms (nausea, heartburn, stick, and pain) was evaluated with a visual analog scale score (0&#x02013;100) shortly after each session of the infusion. The total amount of pure capsaicin included in the infused red pepper sauce suspension (5&#x02009;ml of Tabasco) was 0.84&#x02009;mg.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup></p><p>Secondary peristalsis was performed first by a slow air injection (0.25&#x02009;ml/s) into the esophagus via an automatic pump connected to the infusion port of the manometric assembly. We determined the amount of volume tested for slow injection of air with the pump machine. Secondary peristalsis was then generated by rapid air injection, in which we started at 1-ml volume and gradually increased the volume by 1-ml increments until the presence of a secondary peristalsis or the injected volume reached 20&#x02009;ml. The threshold volumes for both slow and rapid air injections were determined as the lowest injection volume for triggering a secondary peristaltic event.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Then, the frequency of secondary peristalsis and relevant manometric parameters was measured by ten 10&#x02009;ml boluses of air injections within 0.5&#x02009;s to determine the effectiveness of secondary peristaltic response (%). The peristaltic response was judged to occur with an interval of 20&#x02009;s, during which each subject avoided spontaneous swallowing. At the end of 20&#x02009;s, they were allowed to have a dry swallow to clear any residual air and reduce the desire to swallow before the next distension. The frequency (%) was therefore calculated as the number of secondary peristaltic responses/10 &#x000d7; 100/100.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Secondary peristalsis was considered to be complete if the pressure wave of &#x02267;12&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg was noted in the proximal esophagus and &#x02267;25&#x02009;mm&#x02009;Hg in the distal esophagus with normal propagation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> The minimal latency of wave onset between two recording channels was 0.5&#x02009;s.

In addition, the perception of heartburn subsequent to capsaicin infusion appears to be greater after the application of baclofen. Furthermore, baclofen decreased the effectiveness of secondary peristalsis as induced by abrupt air injection. In accordance with prior work,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> baclofen did not change any of peristalsis activities of secondary peristalsis subsequent to capsaicin infusion during either slow or rapid air injection.</p><p>In this study, we noticed that subjective perception of heartburn after capsaicin infusion was significantly greater with baclofen than the placebo. In prior study using red pepper sauce containing capsaicin, it was demonstrated that direct intraesophageal instillation of capsaicin with a dose equivalent to 0.84&#x02009;mg can provoke typical heartburn symptom in non-gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) healthy volunteers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> Our new finding in this work is that baclofen appears to exaggerate the intensity of heartburn symptom after esophageal capsaicin infusion in healthy volunteers. Although previous work has demonstrated inhibitory mechanotransduction within gastroesophageal vagal mechanoreceptors through GABA-B agonist,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> our study may indicate that baclofen may in some way influence the chemosensitivity of mucosa afferents while TRPV1 receptors receive direct activation by capsaicin infusion inside the esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> The explanation for such finding is yet unclear, but can be possibly attributed to the notion that a recent study has shown that activation of TRPV1 also triggers endogenous GABA release from peripheral nerve endings, which serves as a modulator of nociceptor sensitization in the periphery.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Consequently, sensitization of TRPV1 by capsaicin has been widely accepted as important characteristics for this receptor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> but it is still unclear whether the receptor may become further sensitized after the application of baclofen or activation of GABA-B receptors.</p><p>In addition to earlier study showing inhibitory effects of GABA-B receptor agonist on esophageal mechanosensitivity in response to distension-induced secondary peristalsis, distension thresholds of secondary peristalsis subsequent to capsaicin were attenuated by baclofen regardless of the type of esophageal stimuli. Inhibitor effects of GABA-B receptors on transmitter release from sensory fibers have been extensively studied. By releasing inhibiting transmitters from central afferent terminals in the spinal cord or medullary vagal nuclei,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> GABA-B receptor agonists are able to inhibit somatomotor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup> respiratory,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref></sup> cardiovascular,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref></sup> and gastrointestinal reflexes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> In addition, GABA-B receptors in the periphery have been demonstrated to inhibit transmitter release from intrinsic neurons in the myenteric plexus inside either the gut<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup> or peripheral axon collaterals of extrinsic primary afferent fibers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref></sup></p><p>In this work, most of secondary peristaltic parameters subsequent to capsaicin infusion were comparable between baclofen and the placebo. It is well established that esophageal peristalsis origins from successive contraction of circular muscle in conjunction with longitudinal muscle. Between these muscle layers is myenteric plexus that modulates esophageal peristalsis, which is also influenced by complex interactions among the peripheral muscle part of the esophagus, the enteric nervous system, and central nervous system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> In addition, motility characteristics of secondary peristalsis are also affected by a number of physiological factors including bolus characteristics and subject position, etc.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> The change in these parameters are therefore likely to be influenced by local neuromuscular reflexes as well as by vagovagal reflexes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup> although activation of GABA-B receptor can decrease acetylcholine release from preganglionic vagal receptors potentiating motor activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Therefore, similar to our previous findings,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> the effect of baclofen on peristaltic parameter of secondary peristalsis subsequent to capsaicin infusion may be limited. Alternately, the activation of GABA-B agonist by baclofen may solely trigger a localized response instead of a complete activation of the whole peristaltic neural pathway together with motility events.</p><p>The therapeutic implication of baclofen has been demonstrated in human esophagus with its major advantage in reducing transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations and increasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure in healthy adults and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> however, other work failed to show its clinical role in patients with duodenal reflux and associated reflux symptoms despite acid suppression therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> In this work, we demonstrated that baclofen significantly attenuated distension thresholds subsequent to capsaicin infusion with also inhibiting the frequency of secondary peristalsis. The mechanism for current findings is possibly explained by the notion that direct involvement of GABA-B receptors in inhibitory modulation at the sensory receptive field was disclosed by Page <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> who confirmed that GABA-B receptors inhibited mechanotransduction in primary sensory endings. The clinical implication for this study may not support to consider its utility in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease in that baclofen is likely to attenuate esophageal mechanosensitivity relevant to capsaicin exciting secondary peristalsis as induced by abrupt esophageal distension. Moreover, baclofen adversely exaggerates perception of heartburn following capsaicin infusion, which also contradicts previously established clinical role in treating gastroesophageal reflux disease and alleviating reflux symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> As secondary peristalsis might be important for acid clearance when voluntary swallowing is suppressed,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> our work may support previous findings by suggesting careful use of GABA-B receptor agonists for treating reflux disease in terms of potentially negative impact on secondary peristalsis, especially in patients with significant erosive gastroesophageal reflux disease who are more vulnerable to have impaired secondary peristalsis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup></p><p>Our study has some limitations that need to be acknowledged. First, although we have used current dose of baclofen 40&#x02009;mg to detect the effects of GABA-B receptors activation in <italic>vivo</italic> for TRPV1 mediating heartburn perception and modulating secondary peristalsis, it remains to be determined whether such dosage is desirable to produce optimal effects for addressing our hypothesis. Second, the manometry with fewer channel in this work is less sensitive than applying high-resolution impedance and manometry for better physiological data of esophageal peristalsis. Finally, the time interval between baclofen administration and capsaicin infusion is of another concern. The time frame we used is based on prior work using 90&#x02009;min as an interval.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> It is unclear whether ideal time frame for achieving observable effects can be more accurate; however, the findings of the hypothesis are achieved and such concern is less important and beyond our main scope.</p><p>In summary, the administration of baclofen attenuates the mechanosensitivity of distension-induced secondary peristalsis subsequent to esophageal excitation with capsaicin infusion. Despite no changes in motility aspects of secondary peristalsis, the administration of baclofen provokes greater heartburn perception relevant to capsaicin infusion in healthy adults without any history of reflux disease. Our study provides novel physiological evidence for the involvements of GABA-B receptors in inhibitory modulation of capsaicin-induced excitation of secondary peristalsis. Although baclofen has been potentially recommended to be useful in a subset of gastroesophageal reflux disease patients with refractory symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref></sup> our work may suggest more careful use of such agent in term of its negative impact on secondary peristalsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ctg201746i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Guarantor of the article:</bold> Chien-Lin Chen, MD, PhD.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions:</bold> Data collection, design of the work, and drafting the work: L.W.Y. and C.L.C.; analysis and interpretation of data: J.S.H., L.T.T., C.H.Y.; approved the final version of the submitted work: all the authors.</p><p><bold>Financial support:</bold> This study was supported by a grant, TCRD 105-08, from Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan.</p><p><bold>Potential competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="bib1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">Helm JF, Dodds WJ, Pelc LR et al. <article-title>Effect of esophageal emptying and saliva on clearance of acid from the esophagus</article-title>. <source>N Engl J Med</source>
