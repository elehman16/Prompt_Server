</p><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>For individual patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), prognostic models based on baseline clinical characteristics may be used to predict survival but are not currently used to monitor responses to therapy [<xref rid="mdx044-B1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref>]. Serial bone scans [<xref rid="mdx044-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and advanced imaging methods [<xref rid="mdx044-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] may serve this purpose, but simpler, less invasive, less expensive methods are needed to dynamically monitor therapy and inform decisions regarding treatment modification [<xref rid="mdx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. A surrogate marker that predicted overall survival (OS) in individual patients would be particularly useful in decisions regarding treatment modification [<xref rid="mdx044-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Surrogacy requirements for OS in advanced prostate cancer were met for patients receiving docetaxel therapy by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decreases&#x02009;&#x02265;30% after 3&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in the SWOG 99-16 [10] and TAX327 [<xref rid="mdx044-B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] trials, and for patients receiving abiraterone acetate plus prednisone therapy or prednisone alone by the number of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment [<xref rid="mdx044-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These surrogates may eventually aid in monitoring therapy with these agents, but further clinical investigation and validation are required [<xref rid="mdx044-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. For &#x0223c;70% of advanced prostate cancer patients with bone metastases [<xref rid="mdx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], bone-related markers (eg, total alkaline phosphatase [tALP]) are prognostic for OS [<xref rid="mdx044-B13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref>] and tALP changes may be an early indicator of bone progression [<xref rid="mdx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Both PSA and tALP changes are closely associated with survival, but PSA levels do not provide accurate information regarding extent of skeletal metastases or treatment effects on disease progression in bone. Therefore, tALP changes may correlate better with OS than PSA [<xref rid="mdx044-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The phase 3 ALSYMPCA trial established radium-223 efficacy and safety in CRPC patients with bone metastases [<xref rid="mdx044-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. With radium-223, versus placebo, OS improved significantly (median 14.9 versus 11.3&#x000a0;months; hazard ratio [HR]=0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58, 0.83). Time to first symptomatic skeletal event was significantly prolonged (median 15.6 versus 9.8&#x000a0;months; HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.66; 95% CI: 0.52&#x02013;0.83), and secondary end points (including time to tALP increase, tALP response rate, and tALP normalization rate) favored radium-223 treatment [<xref rid="mdx044-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>For mCRPC patients treated with radium-223, tALP changes properly established as a surrogate for survival could optimize treatment, allowing quick change of direction of therapies to patients most likely to benefit from such changes. Thus, exploratory analyses were conducted from ALSYMPCA to evaluate the treatment effect of radium-223 on changes in tALP, LDH, and PSA levels and assess their prognostic and predictive value.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>ALSYMPCA compared efficacy and safety of radium-223 versus placebo, each plus best standard of care, in CRPC patients with symptomatic bone metastases [<xref rid="mdx044-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Randomized patients (2:1) received six intravenous injections of radium-223 (50&#x000a0;kBq/kg IV [55&#x000a0;kBq/kg IV following US National Institutes of Standards and Technology update]) [<xref rid="mdx044-B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] or matching placebo, one injection every 4&#x000a0;weeks. The primary end point was OS.</p><p>Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazards models assessed the potential prognostic value for survival of selected baseline variables in placebo patients, radium-223 patients, and the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Selected variables included prior docetaxel, prior hormone therapy, hemoglobin, serum albumin, tALP, PSA, LDH, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), opiate use, and age at study entry [<xref rid="mdx044-B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis, after tertile grouping using baseline values, further illustrated the association of baseline tALP, PSA, and LDH with OS for radium-223 and placebo patients.</p><p>Changes from baseline in tALP, PSA, and LDH were assessed as least-squares mean percentage change at week 12, the halfway point of treatment, allowing consistency in protocol-defined timing of tALP and PSA measurements. Waterfall plots of maximum percentage change in tALP, LDH, and PSA from baseline to week 12 for each patient illustrated the magnitude of treatment effect. Dynamics of mean percentage change from baseline in biomarker levels, at each treatment visit and follow-up visits 12 and 24&#x000a0;weeks after last study-drug dose, were evaluated. OS by confirmed tALP or LDH decline at week 12 (decline confirmed&#x02009;&#x02265;3&#x000a0;weeks from week 12) was evaluated. The relationship of relative risk of death to percentage changes from baseline at week 12 (last observation carried forward) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling, including all baseline covariates.</p><p>Changes in tALP, PSA, and LDH from baseline to week 12 were evaluated as potential measures of OS surrogacy, as defined by Prentice [<xref rid="mdx044-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and quantified as a proportional treatment effect (PTE) [<xref rid="mdx044-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. PTE describes how much of the treatment effect on OS is explained by biomarker changes. PTE was calculated as 1 minus the ratio of (a) HR in the Cox proportional hazards regression model for survival with treatment (radium-223) plus the surrogate marker (tALP, PSA, LDH) to (b) that with treatment alone. Perfect surrogacy would be indicated by PTE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1; no surrogacy, by PTE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0. CIs were calculated according to Lin et al. [<xref rid="mdx044-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], with a strong degree of surrogacy suggested if the 95% CI lower bound exceeded 0.5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Baseline prognostic factors</title><p>Multivariate analysis of baseline prognostic values as continuous variables was performed for placebo and radium-223 patients separately and for the entire ITT population (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="mdx044-T1">1</xref>). For radium-223 patients, poor baseline ECOG PS and elevated baseline values for LDH, tALP, and PSA were associated with highest risk of death; for placebo patients, elevated baseline values for LDH and tALP were significantly associated with an increased risk of death. For the overall ITT population, opiate use was an additional significant baseline prognostic variable for OS. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis showed longer median survival among radium-223 patients in the lowest tALP tertile (&#x02264;131&#x000a0;U/L), versus those in the highest tertile (&#x02265;334&#x000a0;U/L) (23.9 versus 10.2&#x000a0;months); no overlap in the 95% CIs indicated a consistent trend across subgroups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S1A</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). Placebo patients in the lowest (&#x02264;153&#x000a0;U/L) versus highest (&#x02265;360&#x000a0;U/L) tALP tertile also survived longer (median 18.8 versus 7.5&#x000a0;months) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S1B</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online). Similarly, longer survival was seen for radium-223 and placebo patients with lower versus higher baseline LDH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">supplementary Figure S1C and D</xref>, available at <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> online, respectively) and PSA values (data not shown).

With radium-223, tALP decreases occurred as early as 4 weeks after treatment initiation, remained consistently low until treatment completion at 24 weeks, and remained significantly lower versus placebo patients at all time points to 46&#x000a0;weeks (<italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F1">1</xref>A). With placebo, tALP increased continuously through treatment and post-treatment follow-up. LDH levels for radium-223 patients were significantly lower versus placebo patients throughout most of the 24-week treatment period, but remained above baseline and increased through post-treatment follow-up at a rate similar to the placebo group rate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F1">1</xref>B).

Among 497 patients with tALP values determined at baseline and week 12, 400 patients with a confirmed tALP decline had a median survival of 17.8&#x000a0;months and 55% lower risk of death (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45; 95% CI: 0.34&#x02013;0.61; <italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.0001) versus 97 patients with no confirmed tALP decline (median survival, 10.4&#x000a0;months) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F2">2</xref>A). Baseline characteristics were similar between patients with and those without confirmed decline. Although heavily weighted at the lower end by number of patients experiencing a tALP decrease, Cox regression modeling shows a near-linear relationship between percentage change in tALP from baseline (increase or decrease) at week 12 and risk of death, relative to no change in tALP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F3">3</xref>A). Similarly, 196 radium-223 patients with an LDH decline from baseline to week 12 survived a median of 19.5 months and had a 45% lower risk of death (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.55; 95% CI: 0.42&#x02013;0.73; <italic>P&#x02009;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x02009;</italic>0.0001) versus 277 patients with no LDH decline (median survival, 14.5&#x000a0;months) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F2">2</xref>B). Greater LDH increases, however, were associated with exponentially rapid increase in risk of death. Patients with a 300&#x02013;400% increase in LDH at week 12 had an &#x0223c;7- to 14-fold greater risk than those with no LDH change (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F3">3</xref>B). In contrast, among 493 radium-223 patients with PSA values determined at baseline and week 12, PSA increased in 358 (73%) patients, often by factors of 10-fold or more. Multivariate analysis of the correlation between OS and PSA changes at week 12 showed that the impact of PSA changes at week 12 on risk of death was negligible (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="mdx044-F3">3</xref>C).

Our findings for mCRPC patients with bone-only disease are consistent with similar studies in less defined populations and highlight the relative importance of tALP in this setting [<xref rid="mdx044-B2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>].</p><p>In ALSYMPCA, radium-223 treatment prolonged survival for patients with CRPC and bone-only metastases [<xref rid="mdx044-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In this <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, we report confirmed tALP declines in 80% of evaluable patients after 12&#x000a0;weeks of receiving radium-223 and their association with decreased risk of death, suggesting that changes in tALP could potentially be a surrogate for survival useful in managing patients receiving radium-223 therapy. The ALSYMPCA findings meet the requirements for a surrogacy analysis as described by Prentice [<xref rid="mdx044-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. PTE surrogacy analysis showed tALP decreases at 12&#x000a0;weeks from baseline to be a moderate predictor of survival, with PTE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.34 and a broad CI (0.0, 0.746). The analysis also indicated that radium-223 effects on LDH or PSA contributed little or nothing to the radium-223-associated survival benefit. Our tALP findings were consistent with those reported in TAX327, which showed an association with OS but could not establish surrogacy for tALP changes in patients with bone metastases [<xref rid="mdx044-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Responses to chemotherapy are likely related to a combination of factors: the patient&#x02019;s underlying physical condition and probably other factors reflected or not in biomarker levels, such as pain score and visceral organ involvement. Scher and colleagues [<xref rid="mdx044-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], in their phase 3 study of abiraterone acetate&#x02013;prednisone, reported a high level of surrogacy for a biomarker panel consisting of the combination of circulating tumor cell (CTC) count and LDH level at 12&#x000a0;weeks. They used Prentice criteria [<xref rid="mdx044-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to establish relative surrogacy, but did not assess PTE. The CTC-LDH combination was superior to CTC or LDH alone or to CTC combination with any other biomarkers, including tALP decreases and&#x02009;&#x02265;30% or&#x02009;&#x02265;50% PSA decreases. Future assessments of the validity of markers in predicting effectiveness of chemotherapy may be more successful when combinations of factors are considered.</p><p>Limitations in our study influenced our conclusions: The exploratory analysis was not included in the original ALSYMPCA study plan; other relevant bone markers and markers such as CTCs, not prospectively determined in this phase 3 study, could not be considered. We analyzed only biomarker level decreases from baseline to 12&#x000a0;weeks. If we considered specific rates of decline, as in the PSA studies, we may have arrived at a higher PTE value, but the patient number in each group may have been inadequate for statistical analysis. We evaluated markers individually, not in combination; the proportion of patients showing LDH and PSA decreases did not appear to justify the more extensive analysis. Future prospective studies addressing these limitations may identify more promising candidates for surrogacy. With these caveats, we found that changes in tALP, LDH, and PSA levels after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment are not surrogates for survival for patients with CRPC and bone metastases treated with radium-223. The effective course of radium-223 treatment in ALSYMPCA was 24&#x000a0;weeks, with 6 cycles given at 4-week intervals. Using biomarker changes, particularly rising PSA levels, to make decisions about continuing radium-223 presents a substantial risk that a large fraction of patients who may benefit will be denied effective treatment. Monitoring biomarkers during treatment may have benefit as an indication for radiologic evaluation of disease status [<xref rid="mdx044-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The observed tALP changes with treatment raise questions about radium-223 treatment duration and underline the need for a reliable marker of radium-223 efficacy. In ALSYMPCA with radium-223, the rapid and sustained tALP declines and the increasing tALP suppression with continued therapy reflected the radionuclide mechanism of action in the bone microenvironment, consistent with rapid and progressive inhibition of ALP production by osteoblasts. Dynamic profiles of both tALP and LDH levels during the study suggest that treatment durations &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;weeks should be tested. Although we could not determine whether tALP changes were a direct effect on cancer cells or on osteoblasts, preclinical studies suggest that tALP is a marker of pharmacodynamic effect and that radium-223 impacts both osteoblasts and tumor cells [<xref rid="mdx044-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In a human prostate cancer model, characterized by osteoblastic growth, PSA production, and systemic metastases when inoculated into the bone marrow cavity, radium-223 inhibited disease progression, reduced tumor volume, and decreased areas of tumor in tumor-bearing tibias. Tumor-induced osteoblastic bone growth was suppressed and normal architecture was maintained, leading to reduced bone volume in tumor-bearing bone. Radium-223 induced double-strand DNA breaks in tumor cells and osteoclasts, consistent with potent radiation effects of radium-223 in the tumor microenvironment [<xref rid="mdx044-B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="mdx044-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Such models in prostate cancer, and others in breast cancer [<xref rid="mdx044-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], are important in addressing questions about radium-223 mode of action in cancer patients.</p><p>In conclusion, significant tALP declines (versus placebo) occurred as early as 4 weeks after initiation of radium-223 therapy. tALP or LDH decline at 12&#x000a0;weeks correlated with longer OS, but did not meet statistical surrogacy requirements. Changes in tALP and LDH are dynamic during radium-223 treatments and may be useful to monitor, but do not serve as surrogates for survival. </p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sup1"><label>Supplementary Data</label><media xlink:href="mdx044_Supp.zip"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Research support was provided by Bayer AS (formerly Algeta ASA) and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals.
