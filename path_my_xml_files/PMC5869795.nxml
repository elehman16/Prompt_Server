Almost all patients in ICU receive antibiotic either prophylactic or therapeutic based on local antibiogram of particular ICU or hospital. However, prophylaxis of urinary tract infection (UTI) with systemic antibiotics or sporadic antibiotic treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria should be avoided because these interventions have little effect on prevention of symptomatic UTI and may increases colonization with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Nosocomial infections such as CAUTI and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) are the most common.

All patient that catheterized within 24 hours were included in our study and on meeting the inclusion criteria they were randomly divided into two groups of 50 each: Group I: Received bladder washes with normal saline and Group II: To receive bladder washes with neomycin and polymyxin sulfate solution. Patient with history of pregnancy, immunocompromized patients (AIDS, chemotherapy), diabetes, recurrent UTI, renal insufficiency, use of antibiotics within the previous 7 days and catheter removed before the 3<sup>rd</sup> day were excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sampling technique</title><p>Urine samples was collected after 24 h of admission and transported immediately for culture in microbiology laboratory according to hospital protocol. Urine culture sensitivity was performed on days 3, 7, and then weekly until the removal of catheter or discharge. We made our diagnosis of CAUTI based on findings of bacteriuria, along with an elevated white blood cell count on a urinalysis examination, but in our study, the diagnosis of CAUTI was only made when the urine culture shows 10<sup>5</sup> colony-forming units/mL of urine from a catheterized patient. Urine samples were taken from the distal end of the catheter after disinfection with 70% ethyl alcohol.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Bladder irrigation</title><p>Under strict aseptic and antiseptic precaution the irrigation procedure involved disconnecting the catheter tubing, attaching a syringe containing 30 mL of irrigant, and pushing the plunger of the syringe to instil the solution into the bladder through the foleys catheter where it remained for 20 min. The syringe was disconnected, and the catheter was reconnected to the tubing of the bag. Both test and control group, patients were subjected to bladder wash twice daily. Both groups received standard catheter care including perineal care; the only difference was the bladder wash.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A prospective sample size calculation indicated that 45 patients were required in each group to have a 80% power to detect a 25% difference at an type I (&#x003b1;) error of 0.05 for finding CAUTI in patient undergoing with or without bladder wash and assuming a drop out of 5%, fifty patients was included in each study group. Statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft &#x000ae; Excel &#x000ae; 2016 (Redmond, WA, U.S.A) and SPSS version 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Range and median was used for all continuous variables having nonnormal distribution (age and duration of catheterization) and the two groups was compared using Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test. For continuous variables having normal distribution, data was summarized using mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, and the groups was compared using independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Frequency and percentage was used for all categorical variables and the groups were compared using Pearson's Chi-square test with Yates correction and Fisher's exact test.

An efficiency of bladder irrigation using various different solutions have been studied in the past in an attempt to reduce the incidence of CAUTI, majority of the investigators found it to be a time-consuming and costly procedure that did not have an impact on CAUTI.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In contrast, this study revealed that neomycin-polymyxin sulfate solution bladder wash is effective in preventing CAUTI. In previous studies, the incidence of CAUTI ranged from 11.0% to 73.3%.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Neomycin and polymyxin are the only antimicrobial agents sold commercially in the United States as a urinary bladder irrigant. This combination is bactericidal and active <italic>in vitro</italic> against several members of the <italic>Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but it is not active against <italic>S. marcescens</italic>, streptococci, and enterococci. The fact that these antibiotics are poorly absorbed systemically in the absence of compromised renal function makes this solution potentially less likely to generate resistant bacteria or induce toxic side effects than other agents. However, both of these agents are known to produce toxic effects when administered systemically, especially ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. However, study by Puri <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that the risk was significantly higher for females, elderly patients, critically ill patients, and those on prolonged catheterization.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This study showed only severity of the disease (low motor score of GCS) as a statistically significant risk factor. This might be since a lower GCS corresponds to the severity of tissue injury, where there is hyper metabolism and increased protein catabolism, which eventually leads to decreased immunity that makes the person more susceptible to infections. However, the present study did not show any influence of sex, age, catheter size, duration of catheterization, and systemic use of antibiotics. This might be due to the small sample size and inclusion of long-term catheterized patient's only pathogenic organisms responsible for CAUTI and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern vary with time. In a study, Jha <italic>et al</italic>. found that most common organisms responsible for CAUTI were <italic>E. coli</italic> (49%), <italic>S. aureus</italic> (23%), <italic>Proteus</italic> spp.(3.6%), <italic>Klebsiella</italic> (9.71%), <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (0.8%), and <italic>Citrobacter</italic> (2.8%).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Where as in the present study, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (51%), <italic>E. coli</italic> (17%), <italic>Proteus</italic> spp., <italic>Citrobacter, Klebsiella</italic>, and <italic>Acinetobacter</italic> (8% each) were the most common. Similarly, antibiotic resistance pattern also varied. In their study, Taneja <italic>et al</italic>. found the highest frequency of antibiotic resistance was for ciprofloxacin (68.6%) followed by netilmicin (60.7%), ceftazidime (58.8%), imipenem (43.7%), amikacin (43.1%), and piperacillin (39.2%).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In the present study, the pattern of antibiotic resistance was ceftazidime, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, and meropenem but universally sensitive to polymyxin. In this study, we have shown that neomycin-polymyxin sulfate solution bladder wash is very effective in preventing CAUTI. Thus it can be included in the routine catheter care, especially if catheterization is needed for more than 5 days. It is easy to implement and cost effective.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>Our studies have three main limitations. First, we did not study the effect on mortality, ICU stay and ventilatory days. Second, we did not send the culture before catheterization. Third due to small sample size and single center study our result may vary from other studies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study showed that twice daily bladder wash with the neomycin-polymyxin solution is effective in the prevention of CAUTI.
