As in the previously published assessment immediately after the end of the intervention, none of the three primary outcomes differed between children in schools allocated to the intervention, compared with those in control schools at the end of the long-term follow-up (1 year after the end of the intervention). Differences in secondary outcomes were consistent with those at the immediate follow-up, with no evidence that these had diminished over time. Comparing intervention with control schools, the difference in mean child-reported screen viewing at the weekend was &#x02212;16.03&#x02005;min (95% CI &#x02212;32.82 to 0.73), for servings of snacks per day, the difference was &#x02212;0.11 (95% CI &#x02212;0.39 to 0.06), in servings of high-energy drinks per day &#x02212;0.20 (95% CI &#x02212;0.39 to &#x02212;0.01) and in servings of high-fat foods per day &#x02212;0.12 (95% CI &#x02212;0.39 to 0.00).

However, previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of such interventions have potentially important sources of bias and few have explored long-term outcomes beyond the end of the intervention period.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of 44 school-based RCTs found beneficial effects on moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school hours, but the authors noted that benefit might have been exaggerated due to the outcome assessment being self-reported/parental-reported and not blind to school allocation in most trials and because of the marked loss to follow-up in several trials.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> In many of those RCTs, the intervention included extra compulsory physical activity lessons or activities during school break-times. Those have the advantage that they do not interrupt the school curriculum, but in the absence of any long-term follow-up beyond the intervention period, it is impossible to determine whether the greater time spent in MVPA is simply as a result of a level of compulsion to be more active. Evidence from observational epidemiological studies suggests that compulsory physical activity in lessons or break-time in school are associated with more school-based activity, but not with more activity outside of school or if the activity stops being compulsory.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A systematic review restricted to studies that had used objectively assessed activity using accelerometers and did not restrict the outcome to activity during school hours found some evidence of benefit of a similar magnitude in family-focused and school curriculum interventions, but noted that the magnitude of effect was modest.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Reviews of interventions to reduce time spent in sedentary behaviour have similarly noted some evidence of effect, but cautioned about likely sources of bias, including lack of adequate concealment of random allocation, subjective outcome measurements with no blinding of participants and little evaluation that effects were sustained long-term postintervention.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Likewise, two systematic reviews of school-based interventions to increase fruit and vegetable consumption found some possible evidence of modest effect but were concerned about lack of adequate concealment of random allocation and failure to take account of clustering within analyses.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>The Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> was a large school-based cluster RCT. It was designed to address many of the limitations that had been identified in previous RCTs of interventions to improve physical activity and diet in children<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;16</xref> by objectively measuring physical activity and sedentary behaviour and by determining effects on outcomes immediately after the end of the intervention and 12&#x02005;months later. At the end of the intervention period (immediate follow-up), the intervention was ineffective at improving any of the three primary outcomes (time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity, time spent in sedentary activity and fruit and vegetable consumption); however, it did result in improvements in three of the nine secondary outcomes (child-reported time spent screen-viewing at weekends, consumption of snacks and consumption of high-energy drinks).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A cluster RCT design was necessary, given the intervention is at the level of schools (rather than individual children).</p><p>In this paper, we report the long-term effects of the intervention on the primary and secondary outcomes that were assessed &#x0223c;12&#x02005;months postintervention. Our initial aim when designing the study was to be able to determine whether any effects of the intervention would last beyond the period of the intervention. Given we now know the immediate postintervention results,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> our aim in this paper was to determine whether any effects on primary outcomes emerged at the 12-month follow-up assessment (ie, whether there was a delayed effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes) and whether effects on secondary outcomes that were observed immediately after the intervention were maintained, decreased or increased 12&#x02005;months after the intervention. In this and the previous paper, the intervention is delivered at the cluster (school) level and outcomes are measured and analysed on individual children, with the clustering appropriately taken account of in the statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>AFLY5 was a school-based, cluster RCT.

<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Training for classroom teachers and learning support assistants, provided by the trial manager, a nutritionist and physical education specialist. The training took place over a whole day (8&#x02013;9&#x02005;hours) in a non-school location and where the teachers/learning support assistants and those delivering the training would not be interrupted. Teachers/learning support assistants were given a choice of days to attend the training and schools were financially compensated for the cost of replacement teachers while their staff attended training. At the training days, the rationale for the intervention was explained and each lesson and homework activity was discussed and then taught in interactive ways. Time was provided for questions and discussion. Teachers were instructed to deliver 16 lessons, 10 of which had associated homework. They were told that they could adapt the teaching plans and materials, as they would with other lessons, for example, to suit their own style and the range of abilities in their class, but the aims and knowledge/skills to be imparted should not be changed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provision of 16 lesson plans and teaching materials, including pictures, CDs and journals for teachers or learning support assistants to deliver over two out of the three school-terms (6&#x02013;7&#x02005;months). The 16 lessons included 9 that were primarily related to how to be more active and less sedentary and why this was important, 6 to healthy nutrition and how to achieve this and 1 about reducing screen viewing. Each lesson did, however, combine different aspects of healthy behaviour. For example, in the physical activity lessons, the children played games based on the food groups using photographs of food which reinforced the content of the nutrition lessons. Similarly, in the lesson (and associated homework) for reducing screen-viewing (called &#x02018;Freeze my TV&#x02019;), children were taught how to replace regular television watching with active play on some days.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Provision of 10 parent&#x02013;child interaction homework activities. The activities were designed to involve parents and other family members in the behaviour change process and reinforced the messages delivered during lessons. The homeworks included activities such as: &#x02018;Freeze my TV&#x02019;, in which a specific time that would normally be spent watching television would be replaced with physically active play involving the parents and other family members that the child would write a log about; cooking simple healthy food at home; playing &#x02018;Top Grubs&#x02019; a card game based on trumps with pictures of food, such that higher scoring (trumping) foods are the healthier ones; and measuring the sugar content of drinks that the family have at home or include in school/work lunch packs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information was provided for schools to insert (as they wished) in their school newsletters about the importance of increasing physical activity, reducing sedentary behaviour and improving diet. The inserts were sent to all intervention schools on three occasions over the period of the intervention. Schools were free to edit these and insert none, all or some of them.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Written information for parents on how to encourage their children to eat healthily and be active was delivered via the school children at the start of the intervention.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The intervention took place when the children were aged 9&#x02013;10&#x02005;years (in UK school Year 5) after baseline assessment.

Immediate follow-up assessment was completed immediately postintervention &#x0223c;12&#x02005;months after the baseline assessment and the long-term assessment (with which this paper is concerned) took place 12&#x02005;months after the immediate assessment, during which time the children were not exposed to the intervention.

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> They were completed by trained fieldworkers who were blinded as to which arm of the trial schools had been allocated. Full details of these assessments have been published previously<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and are summarised here. Questionnaires asked for information on dietary intake and screen-time viewing and other characteristics and were administered in the classroom with at least one fieldworker present. Weight, height and waist circumference were measured in a private room by one of the trained fieldworkers, with a second fieldworker present in the room. All fieldworkers had passed Criminal Records Bureau checks, as required for working with children at the time that these data were collected. Physical activity was assessed using ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers (Actigraph LLC, Pensacola, Florida, USA) and time spent per day being sedentary and in moderate to vigorous activity were calculated using standard protocols as described previously.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> We recruited 60 schools and a total of 2221 pupils, and included between 1066 and 2052 pupils in our analyses for different outcomes. Analyses for accelerometer-based outcomes were on fewer participants than our sample size calculation suggested (N=1066) because of a large proportion of participants not returning or not wearing the accelerometer for at least 8&#x02005;hours for 3&#x02005;days, the minimum required to be included in the study.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>

Multilevel regression models were used to account for clustering (non-independence) of children within schools.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> All analyses included adjustment for the following baseline variables: age, sex, baseline measure of the outcome being analysed, involvement in other healthy behaviour promoting activities and school level deprivation. A secondary per-protocol analysis was undertaken, in which classes in the intervention arm were only included in analyses if teachers had taught at least 70% (11 of 16) of the AFLY5 lessons. There was one school for which we were unable to confirm how many lessons had been taught. For that school, we first did analyses assuming that they had been taught at least 11 lessons and then repeated them assuming that they had been taught fewer than 11; the results were identical whichever of these alternatives were used. We additionally assessed whether the effect of the intervention on accelerometer-assessed outcomes differed by week or weekend day and whether the results were affected by implausible values as defined previously. The researchers undertaking the analyses were blinded to (unaware of) whether schools had been allocated to intervention or control arms.</p><p>As detailed in the published statistical protocol,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> we initially planned to assess change in outcomes between baseline and the long-term follow-up using multilevel models to estimate a trajectory of the repeat measurements (baseline, immediate follow-up, long-term follow-up) within each individual, with random effects to quantify the estimated person-specific deviation from the study mean in terms of the intercept (baseline measurement) and rate of change (slope). However, when we attempted to run these models, they did not converge. This is likely because there were only three measurement occasions, meaning that the model did not have sufficient df. Therefore, we conducted analyses at a single time point as described above (ie, assessed the effect of the intervention on outcomes at the long-term follow-up) and plotted differences between the randomised groups at each time point in order to illustrate any notable changes in estimates of the primary and secondary outcomes between baseline and immediate and long-term follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010957F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the trial profile. Of the 2242 potentially eligible children in the 60 participating schools, 10 left the school prior to randomisation and baseline data collection and for 11, their parents or carers did not provide consent to participate in any aspect of the study. All other children (N=2221; 1064 in the schools that were randomised to intervention and 1157 in those randomised to control schools), irrespective of whether or not we have all the data for them, are included in the analyses presented here (with numbers differing for each outcome in the main analyses as a result of some missing data).

The lack of any effect on the three primary outcomes&#x02014;time spent in MVPA, time spent in sedentary behaviour and fruit and vegetable consumption&#x02014;was still observed 12&#x02005;months later and the beneficial effects on three secondary outcomes (reported screen-viewing at weekends, consumption of snacks and of high-energy drinks) were still somewhat present at 12&#x02005;months postintervention. However, slight attenuation of the effect on these secondary outcomes meant that at this long-term follow-up, none of our outcomes (primary or secondary) reached our prespecified level of statistical significance.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Meaning of study findings</title><p>While the effects for these secondary outcomes were consistent in magnitude with those seen at the immediate follow-up, they did not reach our prespecified level of statistical significance. Thus, these results suggest that apparent benefits on these secondary outcomes are due to chance.</p><p>As discussed in our previous publication of effects immediately at the end of the intervention,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the lack of effect on primary outcomes, in particular on the objectively assessed accelerometer outcomes, might highlight the importance of societal and structural changes to support greater levels of activity, over and above any intervention at a school level.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our intervention was based on theory,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> built on a similar intervention that had been previously shown to work in the USA<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> and in pilot work, conducted by us, it was shown to fit well with the primary school national curriculum in the UK.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, the detailed process evaluation conducted as part of the full AFLY5 RCT, in which we used quantitative measures of intervention delivery and qualitative focus groups with children and indepth interviews with teachers and parents,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> showed that on average 77% of the intervention lessons and homeworks were delivered and reached 95% of the children in intervention schools. However, teachers felt lack of time and the need to prioritise numeracy and literacy skills over the health-promoting lessons of our intervention were important barriers to them and the children being more fully engaged with AFLY5.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The process evaluation also highlighted that in general, teachers did not like teaching physical activity, and had a tendency to delegate such lessons to teaching assistants. This might also have contributed to the null effects, particularly for the activity outcomes. Finally, our process evaluation suggests that in the context of rapidly developing technologies, the time taken to develop, test the feasibility of, and pilot, school-based interventions before completing large scale RCTs, as we have performed in AFLY5, may mean that by the time school-based interventions get to the full-scale RCT, the intervention is being implemented with out-of-date methods of delivery.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>While using schools for universal promotion of healthy behaviours is appealing, a key implication of our findings is that this alone is unlikely to have benefit. Pressures on schools to deliver academic success and the fact that teachers do not necessarily feel equipped, responsible for, or in the case of physical activity, enjoy promoting health behaviours,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> suggest that curriculum-based health promotion alone is unlikely to benefit population health. Our RCT was large and well conducted and the results suggest that further investment in RCTs of curriculum-based interventions (alone) to improve children's diet and activity are not wanted. Whether investing in extracurricular activities, including in the necessary human resources (eg, people who are appropriately trained and skilled), structural resources (appropriate space) and equipment, would be beneficial at a population level is unclear and may warrant further evaluation. Societal interventions such as those that were envisaged as a legacy of the 2012 Olympics, and the more recent &#x02018;sugar tax&#x02019; may be beneficial but will require a natural experiment type approach,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> rather than an RCT, for their evaluation. Evaluation of past major sporting events and early assessments of the 2012 Olympics suggest that like our assessment of a school-based curriculum, much more intense, comprehensive (across all levels of society&#x02014;home, neighbourhoods, schools, work, government, transport systems) and long-term investments are required to support the next generation to be more active and eat healthier.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The study was designed to take account of known sources of bias in other RCTs in this area. A protocol was published before recruitment started, and a detailed analysis plan was written before any access to the study data. We developed an intervention according to guidelines for complex interventions, with the theoretical rationale for the intervention described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Our sample size calculation, which took account of the likely degree of clustering within schools, indicated that we needed a total of 1275 children to be included in the analyses. For all outcomes, except those related to accelerometer data, we achieved considerably higher numbers than this target. The number included in the main analyses for accelerometer-based data was somewhat smaller than this at 1066. Sample size calculations are an approximation of the numbers needed, and we doubt that such a small difference will have had a major effect on our conclusions. Furthermore, wear time was similar in children in intervention and control schools; moreover, in sensitivity analyses using different approaches to dealing with missing data and which included 2052 children even for the accelerometer outcomes, the results were essentially the same as in the main analysis. One school refused to deliver any of the intervention, and others did not deliver all of the lessons. However, the per-protocol analysis, which did not differ from the main intention-to-treat analysis, shows that this does not explain the null results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This long-term follow-up of a large well-conducted school-based RCT has found similar results to those found immediately after the intervention period. None of the primary or secondary outcomes reached our predefined levels of statistical significance, suggesting that apparent benefits on some secondary outcomes are due to chance. Overall, together with our process evaluation, these findings suggest that curriculum-based interventions alone are unlikely to make a major impact on promoting healthy levels of physical activity and healthy diets in primary school children.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank all the students and teaching staff who took part in AFLY5 and thank all of the AFLY5 staff who include fieldworkers, administrative staff, computing and data management staff and the trainers who provided teacher training.
