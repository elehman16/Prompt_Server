Most recently, the European Working Group in Sarcopenia in Older Adults has established a consensus definition and assessment criteria for sarcopenia that includes a below-normal muscle mass and muscle function (either or both of below-normal muscle strength and physical performance). Using these criteria, work is needed to identify the prevalence and risk factors among the old, and those most susceptible to sarcopenia, the very old. This manuscript describes the recruitment and data collection methodology, and direct burden to participants, among a very old cohort residing in a residential aged care (RAC) setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eleven RAC facilities participated in the study. Potential participants were identified by the facility service manager and then randomised into the study. All participants gave self or substitute decision maker consent.

When coupled with increasing need for intensive RAC services and the growth of the &#x02265;85&#x000a0;years population to 3.1 million by 2054 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the economic impact will be substantial. A primary cause in institutionalisation is the age-associated loss in muscle mass and muscle function, termed sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Sarcopenia is a significant geriatric syndrome, a major cause of disability and increasing healthcare utilisation that cost the US health care system&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;$US18.5 billion in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recently, due to a lack of term clarity, a number of international organisations have been working to establish a consensus definition. Among these, the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP) have developed a definition and diagnostic criteria that required the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (muscle strength or physical performance) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While earlier interpretations had evaluated sarcopenia as an age-associated decline in muscle mass alone, a recognised precursor to disease and disability, it is the loss in muscle function which has the most debilitating consequences for later life disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In particular, for those in end-of-life care (residential aged care or a nursing home) declining functional muscle strength and physical performance equate directly to increased dependency and care needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous research had estimated the prevalence of sarcopenia to be 6&#x02013;50&#x000a0;% among the very old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Using the revised EWGSOP definition and assessment criteria, a prevalence of 33&#x000a0;% among very old adults has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, prevalence may be under-estimated due to the exclusion of the disabled, bedridden, non-ambulatory or those with advanced disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With this, the population assumed to be most vulnerable, those in end-of-life care are significantly understudied in relation to prevalence.</p><p>Several factors lead to the onset and progression of sarcopenia including muscular disuse and age-related alterations in sex hormones, protein synthesis, proteolysis, neuromuscular integrity, endocrine function, nutritional balance and an increase in muscle fat content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Whereas a number of these mechanisms are well-understood, the effects of lifestyle choices as risk factors for sarcopenia are less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date, data are mixed in relation to the influence of body weight, level of disease, gender, health and physical activity background. Further, the importance of other factors known to influence healthy ageing (e.g., education, socioeconomic background or smoking history) as risk factors for sarcopenia is currently poorly understood. It is established that reduced muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance increase the risk of disability, institutionalisation and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, a broader understanding of these as risk factors in relation to sarcopenia is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, physical inactivity and muscle disuse are suggested to influence the development of disability later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], but more work is needed to define the relationship with sarcopenia.</p><p>This paper describes the methodologies employed to collect sarcopenia prevalence and risk factor data from old and very old Australians residing in high- and low-care RAC. In addition to the recruitment and assessment strategies, we describe participation burden. Given the renewed interest in the area of sarcopenia due to its detrimental effect on disability and associated economic burden, the updated diagnostic criteria and the difficulty recruiting frail older people, this paper reports a detailed protocol on recruitment strategy and collecting information on risk factors and prevalence of sarcopenia within residential care settings, and may serve as valuable guide for others looking to collect data in a similar setting. The aims of the present study were to establish the prevalence and risk factors to sarcopenia among a group of older adults with compromised wellbeing residing in RAC facilities. As a risk factor to sarcopenia, the use of an activPAL3&#x02122; motion inclinometer was trialled, and study feasibility was assessed through participant burden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and recruitment</title><p>A cross-sectional study with random sampling was undertaken to measure the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with functional and clinical risk factors in older adults residing in RAC facilities. Eleven purposefully selected RAC facilities within one care organisation and a 100-km radius of Bond University, Gold Coast, in South East Queensland, Australia, were identified and invited to participate. At pre-organised times, facilities were visited by members of the research team and a discussion undertaken with the facilities Service Manager or Director of Nursing as to the eligibility of all residents to participate in the study. Inclusion criteria were (i) age over 60&#x000a0;years, (ii) residing in a RAC facility and (iii) could provide informed consent, or if unable, proxy-informed consent obtained from the substitute decision maker. Residents were excluded if, (i) they had a pacemaker due to reported contraindications to bioelectrical impedance analysis, (ii) they were end-stage palliative or terminal (iii), they had difficult behaviours that would limit data collection or (iv) they had medical or other issues that would limit data collection. Medical issues raised as a reason for exclusion were total uncommunicable deafness and significantly advanced dementia or a comatose status.</p><p>Eligible participant were randomly selected within three levels of care (low- and high-care or residing in a secure dementia ward). Randomisation was undertaken using a random number generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://stattrek.com/statistics/random-number-generator.aspx">http://stattrek.com/statistics/random-number-generator.aspx</ext-link>). Reasons for ineligibility or refusal to participate were recorded. The study was approved by the human ethics committees of UnitingCare Queensland, Bond University and the University of Queensland.</p><p>Following randomisation, at a pre-organised time, facilities were re-visited and participant information sheet and consent forms delivered to the service manager or director of nursing. In addition, facilities were supplied with a list of residents randomised to participate and an instruction document outlining information sheet dissemination and consent. In brief, facilities were asked to deliver the information sheet to the participant with a request for the participant to read and sign the consent form if interested. For those cognitively challenged participants, the facility service manager or director of nursing was asked to contact the substitute decision maker, inform them of the study and inform them of the need for consent for participation. All participants were required to give informed consent directly or by the substitute decision maker, or by the service manager or director of nursing following discussion with the substitute decision maker. Facilities were then followed up 1&#x000a0;week later and a date set for participant assessments to take place. All participants were de-identified and assigned a study registration number.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Data collection</title><p>At a pre organised time, the study research assistant (RA), an experienced allied health professional, met with the facility&#x02019;s service manager and resident nurse to establish the level of care required for each participant. Following this discussion, a carer accompanied the RA to visit and make the initial contact with the participants. For low-care participants, the RA was then left to conduct the data collection without assistance. For high-care and dementia participants, the carer remained. Where necessary and with the aim of a reduced falls risk, carers assisted the RA with any physical mobilisation of high care and dementia participants. In addition, for dementia participants, the carer was specifically from the participants ward. Their presence served to increase familiarity for the participants and thereby reduce anxiety, and to help the RA identify assessment components, the participant was unable to complete. Participants were assessed individually in a one-on-one format, and data were collected from all participants at one facility before moving to the next facility. To reduce any potential burden to participants undertaking assessment, participants were encouraged to rest as needed and were given verbal support and encouragement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Measures</title><p>Although facility staff had previously familiarised participants with the project, the RA reviewed these documents before commencing the assessment. Participants who did not provide consent were asked a short series of questions about why they did not want to participate, and then thanked for their time. All measures are validated for use among old and very old adults. Data for each participant was entered on site and then forwarded to the project manager at Bond University at the completion of each day. Prevalence was determined using the project&#x02019;s primary outcome of sarcopenic status and the EWGSOP definition and assessment criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Secondary measures were collected to determine risk factors for sarcopenia in this population. In case a participant was unable to undertake a physical measure, self-report or answer a question, this variable was left blank, except for the 2.4-m walk which was scored as 100&#x000a0;s to ensure a walking speed of &#x0003c;0.8&#x000a0;m/s and that they were scored 0 for this component of the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) summary score.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Primary outcome: sarcopenic status</title><p>According to the EWGSOP, the diagnosis of sarcopenia requires the presence of both low muscle mass and low muscle function (muscle strength or physical performance). In accordance with EWGSOP and appropriate for use among very old low functioning adults, (a) muscle mass was measured using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA), (b) muscle strength by hand grip strength and (c) performance by the SPPB 2.4-m walk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The cut-off point to define low muscle mass are &#x02265;2 standard deviations below the norm of a young healthy population, to define low muscle strength are &#x0003c;30 and &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;kg for men and women, respectively, and to define low physical performance is a gait speed of &#x0003c;0.8&#x000a0;m/s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>BIA (Maltron BF-906, Maltron International Ltd., Rayleigh, UK) is a non-invasive, non-intrusive diagnostic system that estimates the volume of fat and lean body mass, BMI and resistance (ohms).

This was: 29&#x000a0;% low care, 58&#x000a0;% high care and 13&#x000a0;% in a secure dementia ward. Of the 273 residents invited to participate, 91 provided consent and 11 were consented by proxy (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;102; 37&#x000a0;%). Therefore, of the total available sample, 53&#x000a0;% were eligible for participation and 14&#x000a0;% consented to participate. Participant recruitment and assessment occurred over October to December 2012. The flow of recruitment to assessment is represented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Project CONSORT diagram of recruitment and assessment</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13539_2014_144_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Reasons for non-consent were (i) &#x02018;didn&#x02019;t want to participate&#x02019; (79&#x000a0;%), &#x02018;My GP doesn&#x02019;t want me to participate&#x02019; (7&#x000a0;%), they were not available during the facility testing period (2&#x000a0;%), a change in their situation occurred (generally health related) (7&#x000a0;%) or they died after being identified as potentially eligible prior to consent (3&#x000a0;%). Five people claimed they were too sick on the day of their assessment and four did not provide a reason.</p><p>Participants ranged in age from 60.7 to 101.3&#x000a0;years with the average age of 84.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.2&#x000a0;years and were in the RAC facility for 1,204.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1,220.1&#x000a0;days (65&#x02013;7165&#x000a0;days). Level of disability and need for care was represented by a group ACFI score of 2.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7 (1 being the highest needs and 7 the lowest), with low functional status supported by a SPPB score of 3.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.4 (1&#x02013;11). Participants had an average of 1.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.0 chronic diseases (0&#x02013;6) and took 11.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.9 medications (2&#x02013;31). The BMI for participants was 27.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.7&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (13.4&#x02013;44.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Six participants were unable to complete the MMSE and GDS. Of the remaining group, 33 had normal cognitive capacity, 19 were mildly, 30 moderately and 14 severely cognitively impaired. Nine adults had severe depression, 13 were moderately and 22 mildly depressed and the remaining 52 had no depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Burden</title><p>Time to complete the data collection ranged from 11.0 to 59.0&#x000a0;min dependant of the participant capacity to complete measures, with an average of 27.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.0&#x000a0;min across the group. When asked about the burden of assessment, 84&#x000a0;% of participants either agreed or strongly agreed that the assessment was an appropriate length and 83&#x000a0;% either agreed or strongly agreed that the instructions given with each measure were clear. In relation to the number of questionnaires, terminology employed and assessment fatigue, &#x0003e;70&#x000a0;% of participant felt the assessment protocol was appropriate for the target cohort. Of those who participated, only one individual required a break during testing and 87&#x000a0;% said they would be happy to be followed up for future work in this area.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>ActivPAL sub-study</title><p>For the activPAL3&#x02122; sub-study, a total of 41 residents agreed to participate from an eligible 86. Most common reasons for not consenting were &#x02018;didn&#x02019;t want to participate&#x02019; (73&#x000a0;%) and &#x02018;believe it will be too difficult&#x02019; (19&#x000a0;%). Two people were unavailable during the testing period, one person saw no benefit to participating, and six residents said &#x02018;My GP doesn&#x02019;t want me to participate&#x02019;. Six monitors were lost during the course of the study, and two participants were subsequently found to be ineligible. The final participant sample consisted of 33 residents. Of those, 2 did not return their diaries, 3 did not complete the diary, 14 (42&#x000a0;%) partially completed the diary, and 14 (42&#x000a0;%) completed the diary in full. Five (15&#x000a0;%) provided at least one comment regarding wearing the monitor. All comments were positive and participants did not report any adverse outcomes.</p><p>Informal interviews with key contact personnel at each centre reinforced that residents were not burdened by wearing the monitor. There were no reported cases of skin irritation or complaints from residents. Furthermore, staff members indicated the monitor wear did not significantly impede on their daily duties. Discussions during the face-to-face interview indicated there was a need to include RAC staff members in the activPAL3&#x02122; process from the very beginning. Furthermore, staff members suggested that more information regarding the monitors and the overall goal of the sub-study would have been beneficial in order to better explain the study to residents and answer questions they may have had, and to avoid confusion and minimise the risk of losing monitors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Demonstrated by a topical presence at the 2013 International Association of Geriatrics and Gerontology Congress and Global Aging Research Network symposium, sarcopenia is re-emerging as a growing area of research interest (see <italic>Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging</italic>, Issue 6, Supplementary, June 2013). While sarcopenia has always generated some research, the revised European Working Group in Sarcopenia in Older People diagnostic criteria has significantly influenced the clinical acknowledgment of the consequences of sarcopenia, and the association to disease and disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Using this definition and assessment criteria, more work is needed at the community and in-care level to establish population prevalence and the associated risk factors. This paper describes in detail the feasibility and processes undertaken in studying these variables in an Australian population of very old RAC adults. It is suggested this work could service as a guide for others interested in undertaking similar research among other international populations.</p><p>The feasibility of our approach is indicated by the low participant burden, efficient collection time and agreement by participants that the methodologies were appropriate for the cohort. The group in question are typical of RAC in Australia in relation to age, length of stay and ACFI score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with a low functional status supported by a SPPB summary score indicative of negative health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. We involved the RAC facility in the research, using the facility service manager or director of nursing to identify potential participants, and coordinating through the facility the delivery of project information, obtaining of consent and assistance in data collection. However, while the study had a liberal inclusion criteria that aimed to capture adults independent of disease or disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], ethical and patient difficulty limitations excluded almost half of the total available population. This exclusion may limit the accurate reflection of the population in question. This is a concern for all end-of-life research, but unavoidable given the invasive nature of data collection, and the need for consent and the level of communication in collecting secondary variables questionnaires included to identify risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Of further concern is that 67&#x000a0;% of those randomised to the study declined, commonly affirming a lack of interest in participation. This could be related to a number of factors including no participation incentives such as the benefits gained from a trial intervention (i.e. exercise intervention), a fear of something new, the need for greater project understanding by the staff responsible for disseminating information, as was voiced in the sub-study, and/or cognitive wellbeing, where depression is a known de-motivator to participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. While this low participation rate may reduce the generalisability of results across RAC population, they are by no means unusual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Another methodological limitation was that data were collected within one organisation and one region of Australia. Organisational differences in delivery of care and the effect of remote and rural living could influence levels of sarcopenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The present work had budget restriction that influenced recruitment, but to allow for these differences a broader scope analysis is planned.</p><p>The sub-study analysis of the activPAL monitor was also found to be feasible in this population. In order to improve the protocol, facility staff suggested that the sleep diary be simplified, more information provided to centre staff, and greater communication within centre be encouraged, to minimise monitors loss and adequately address residents&#x02019; questions.</p><p>In conclusion, certain limitations restrict blanket data collection in a RAC setting. However, the assessment of sarcopenia and sarcopenic risk factors such as physical inactivity is feasible among those without ethical considerations such as palliative status, behavioural or communications problem. To facilitate projects in this setting, key staff members need to be involved in the planning and execution of this process from the beginning in order to ensure their full understanding and leadership of the protocol within centres.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was supported by a Bond University Seeding Grant.
