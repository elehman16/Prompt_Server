In these areas, approximately two thirds of HBV-infected individuals, 50% of HCV-infected individuals, and 15%&#x02013;30% of HIV-infected individuals are unaware of their infection status [<xref rid="OFV162C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV162C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result, these persons are at substantial risk of infecting other individuals [<xref rid="OFV162C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV162C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and might not be able to benefit from appropriate care. If ignored and untreated, any one of these infections could lead to more advanced stages of disease, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="OFV162C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV162C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and posing, for HCV, a threat to treatment response, even among newer therapeutic regimens [<xref rid="OFV162C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>One reason explaining unawareness of infection status is the lack of available testing, especially among populations at high risk of infection. In recent years, a variety of health policy measures have advocated for increased testing and improvement in outcomes related to the cascade of care [<xref rid="OFV162C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Point-of-care (POC) testing could facilitate screening by reducing the material or psychological obstacles of standard testing and provide ease in obtaining results. Several studies have alluded to higher acceptability, more immediate test results, and higher test delivery when using rapid tests [<xref rid="OFV162C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Preliminary evidence has also suggested a beneficial impact for high infection risk groups [<xref rid="OFV162C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, rarely do these studies extend to immigrants populations, whose often difficult socioeconomic situation prevents them from seeking adequate testing [<xref rid="OFV162C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In France, unawareness of infectious disease status is slightly lower compared with the rest of the EU, yet it remains a widespread problem; with 55% of 280 000 HBV-infected [<xref rid="OFV162C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], 35% of 230 000 HCV-infected [<xref rid="OFV162C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and 15% of 150 000 HIV-positive individuals [<xref rid="OFV162C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] unaware of their disease status. Compounded with their shared transmission routes and potential health burden among untested and infected individuals, recent French recommendations have highlighted the need to offer simultaneous screening of chronic viral diseases, namely HIV, HBV, and HCV [<xref rid="OFV162C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This testing strategy would be of interest among immigrants, in whom prevalence of any one of these infections or even coinfection can be up to 10% overall [<xref rid="OFV162C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. For instance, recent data given by the &#x0201c;Medecins du Monde&#x0201d; (MDM) clinics in France, where mostly immigrants from Sub-Saharan or North Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East seek care, have reported that 2.8% of tested individuals were positive for HIV, 5.4% were positive for HCV, and 8.4% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) [<xref rid="OFV162C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. These proportions are approximately 6 to 14 times higher than the general population.</p><p>We then conducted a randomized control trial evaluating the feasibility of an intervention based on simultaneous HBV, HCV, and HIV POC tests as a means to promote screening and linkage-to-care in a population without healthcare coverage, almost exclusively immigrants, with high risk of viral infection.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>The Optiscreen III study was a randomized, prospective, pilot intervention trial. Volunteers were recruited from an inner-city clinic for persons without healthcare coverage (&#x0201c;M&#x000e9;decins du Monde&#x0201d;, Paris, France). From February 25, 2013 to June 21, 2013, individuals seeking care at the center were asked to participate if they were &#x02265;18 years old and could be available for further medical follow-up testing at H&#x000f4;pital Saint-Antoine (Paris, France), if necessary. Persons already followed for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV infection or persons whose HIV, HBV, and/or HCV test result from 3 months before inclusion was available were not included. The study was approved by the H&#x000f4;tel-Dieu Hospital Ethics Committee (Paris, France) in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study Interventions</title><p>Eligible participants were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 of 2 testing interventions for HIV, HBV, and HCV infection: a standard serology-based test (S arm) or a POC rapid test (RT arm). The central data management center (Inserm UMR_S1136, Paris, France) was responsible for randomization. A computerized random number generator was used to select permuted block of size 6. The randomization list was concealed from investigators, who assigned participants to testing groups through a Web site after validating eligibility criteria.</p><p>In the S arm, participants received a prescription to perform venipuncture for HIV, HBV, and HCV serology at an outside laboratory. They were then asked to return to the clinic within 8 to 10 days and obtain their results. HIV, HBV, and HCV serostatus were determined using commercially available immunoassays (enzyme immunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) respectively detecting anti-HIV antibodies and HIV p24 antigen (Abbott Architect HIV Ag/Ab combo test), HBV HBsAg, anti-HB core (HBc) and anti-HB surface (HBs) antibodies (Abbott Architect HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs Ab assay), and anti-HCV antibodies and HCV core antigen (Bio-Rad Monolisa HCV Ag-Ab ULTRA assay).</p><p>In the RT arm, HIV, HBV, and HCV status were determined using rapid tests that detected anti-HIV antibodies (VIKIA HIV, Biom&#x000e9;rieux), HBsAg (VIKIA, Biom&#x000e9;rieux), and anti-HCV antibodies (Oraquick HCV, Orasure), respectively. Rapid tests were performed by trained clinical research associates according to the manufacturer's specifications. Human immunodeficiency virus, HBsAg and HCV testing required whole blood collected from a finger stick; in case of insufficient blood collection, the HCV test could also be performed on an oral fluid collected via swab. Results were available within 30 minutes and given directly to the participant during a posttest counseling interview.</p><p>For both study arms, testing was performed completely free of charge. Any participant presenting with a positive test was given instructions to schedule an appointment at the infectious diseases department of Saint-Antoine Hospital (Paris, France).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Questionnaires</title><p>Participants were asked questions on their country of birth, healthcare coverage, history of HIV, HBV, and HCV testing, and their preferred method of screening (rapid or standard). Reasons for refusal were asked to persons declining participation.</p><p>After testing, participants testing positive were asked simple questions on test acceptability and which testing strategy they would have preferred. Physicians were also asked questions on testing feasibility when participants tested positive.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study Endpoints</title><p>The primary outcome was defined as the percentage of persons tested who obtained results for all 3 tests (HIV, HBsAg, HCV). The secondary outcome was linkage-to-care among infected individuals, which was defined as percentage of persons infected with any of the 3 viruses who sought care at Saint-Antoine Hospital within 4 months.</p><p>The proportion of individuals accepting to participate in the study and proportion of rapid test failures were also considered as secondary endpoints. We also evaluated the proportion of preferred testing strategies among both participants and study physicians.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>At the time this study was conceived, the impact of rapid testing was rarely evaluated on infection awareness and had not yet been evaluated on linkage-to-care, specifically in the context of the French healthcare system. We then approached our analysis as a pilot study with the aim of addressing feasibility. Typically, 70% of patients seen at the MDM clinic obtain a test result with standard serology. Assuming a 20% increase in infection awareness and a type 1 error (&#x003b1;) of 0.05, and a power (1-&#x003b2;) of at least 0.9, a minimum of 82 participants per group would be needed. We decided to recruit all volunteers seen in the clinic during the 4-month time span, which approximately equates to the sample size calculation.</p><p>Outcomes were compared using Pearson's &#x003c7;&#x000b2; test. The proportion of patients linked-to-care could be influenced by the potential number of infected persons who did not receive testing, thus we performed a sensitivity analysis accounting for missing data. From estimates obtained in the overall tested population, the expected number of infected patients without testing was added to the denominator and the proportion was recalculated. A range of estimates was calculated based on the 95% confidence interval (CI) of disease prevalence.</p><p>Because the number of infected individuals was assumed to be low and only few covariables were to be obtained during the study, no multivariable adjustments were planned. All statistical analysis were performed using STATA (version 13.1; StataCorp, College Station, TX), and significance was determined using <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT01790633).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV162F1">1</xref> illustrates participant flow during the study. A total of 551 participants were initially screened for eligibility, 150 did not meet inclusion criteria, and 16 had a medical condition requiring immediate referral to a specialist. The remaining 327 were randomized to an intervention arm. Three of those participants were later observed to be ineligible (2 were already followed for HIV or viral hepatitis, and 1 was referred to an emergency department) and were further excluded. In total, 324 patients were considered for analysis.

No co- or tri-infection was observed. There were no significant differences in the proportion of participants testing positive between S and RT arms (15.7% with 4 HIV, 10 HBV, 4 HCV; vs 12.6% with 3 HIV, 13 HBV, 4 HCV; <italic>P</italic> = .5). Of note, 36 of 38 (94.7%) infected individuals and 227 of 236 (96.2%) noninfected individuals collected their test results (<italic>P</italic> = .7).</p><p>In the S arm, 15 of 18 patients (83.3%; 95% CI, 58.6%&#x02013;96.4%) testing positive for 1 of the viruses were linked to specialized care.

As a result, an estimated 60.0% of infected participants in the S arm (ranging from 55.6% to 65.2%) and 90.0% (ranging from 85.7% to 90.0%) in the RT arm were linked to appropriate care.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Perception of Rapid Tests by Participants and Medical Professionals</title><p>Among participants, 76% (n = 246) said that they would prefer to undergo HIV, HBV, and HCV testing using rapid rather than standard serological tests, whereas 7% (n = 23) preferred serological tests and 17% (n = 55) had no preference. The most common reasons for preferring rapid tests (<italic>N</italic> = 246) were less stress with same-day results, (n = 171, 52.8%), followed by more practical use (n = 83, 25.6%). In contrast, reasons for preferring serological test (<italic>N</italic> = 23) were being able to perform several tests at the same time (11 of 23) or because participants felt that serological tests were more reliable and accurate (n = 5, 20.8%) or caused less anxiety (n = 2, 8.3%). In the posttesting questionnaire, 3 of 12 (25%) participants testing positive in the S arm would have preferred to have a rapid test, whereas the remaining 9 (75%) had no testing preference. Of those testing positive in the RT-arm, 1 of 16 (6.3%) patients would have preferred to have a serological test and the remaining 15 (93.7%) had no particular preference. Among the 20 physicians relaying a positive test result, 10 said that rapid testing simplified their consultation, 7 claimed it had no effect, and 3 stated that it became more complicated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this randomized control trial, the feasibility of an integrated approach based on POC rapid testing for multiple viral infections was evaluated, specifically as it relates to the cascade of screening and linkage-to-care in a targeted population. Among those living in difficult socioeconomic situations, a clear difference was observed between randomization arms in the proportion of participants actively tested for HIV, HBV, and HCV. From this observation alone, the use of POC tests demonstrated clear superiority in promoting screening access within this particular context.</p><p>The M&#x000e9;decins du Monde clinic, where this study took place, represents a typical source of healthcare for predominantly immigrant populations. For years, this clinic has been fully invested in HIV and viral hepatitis screening by providing comprehensive information on testing; routinely offering testing and personalized medical counseling; and proposing social and administrative support; all of which is free of charge. Yet, before this study, its medical professionals expressed concerns regarding rapid testing, as has been stated by others in the past [<xref rid="OFV162C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV162C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], notably the psychosocial stress related to a positive test result and the general unpreparedness of participants receiving such a result. Nevertheless, many of the physicians relaying a positive rapid test result observed that it had in effect facilitated their consultation.</p><p>Likewise, participants more readily accepted combined rapid tests than standard serology, which is in line with previous observations evaluating the acceptability of HIV or HCV rapid tests alone [<xref rid="OFV162C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="OFV162C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This strong preference is supported by the difference in the proportion of participants tested between intervention arms. Furthermore, very few participants who completed a blood draw for serological-based testing at an outside clinic did not return to obtain their test result, which was perhaps slightly lower than another study conducted in French sexually transmitted disease clinics [<xref rid="OFV162C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It would then seem that the major hurdle to screening with standard prescription-issued testing lies in the individual's motivation to seek an appropriate center and not necessarily in obtaining results.</p><p>At the end of screening, one third of all participants included in the serology arm remained unaware of their HIV, HBV, and HCV status&#x02014;which was in total 10 times higher than in the rapid test arm. Other studies have reported the gain in viral-infection awareness when using rapid tests compared with standard serology [<xref rid="OFV162C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One other study conducted in France has shown that only 38% of individuals receiving a prescription for HIV-HBV-HCV testing by their general practitioner completed testing [<xref rid="OFV162C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Oftentimes, previous evaluations of the &#x0201c;cascade of care&#x0201d; have represented screening outcomes in a perhaps too simplistic manner, using a broad definition of whether or not an individual has been screened [<xref rid="OFV162C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. As a whole, this one-time outcome is largely insufficient and could render screening programs difficult to evaluate. We based our primary endpoint on what we term the cascade of screening [<xref rid="OFV162C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="OFV162F3">3</xref>. Within the context of the French healthcare system, we labeled 5 distinct steps: [<xref rid="OFV162C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] having access to a testing facility or network, [<xref rid="OFV162C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] being proposed testing, [<xref rid="OFV162C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] accepting testing, [<xref rid="OFV162C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] executing a screening test, and [<xref rid="OFV162C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] receiving test results.
<fig id="OFV162F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Main steps of the cascade of screening. In this figure, the steps needed to appropriately screen individuals for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or hepatitis C virus are elaborated in detail, as they apply to the French healthcare system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ofv16203"/></fig></p><p>We were able to observe marked improvements in executing a screening test and receiving test results with rapid testing, as reported in a meta-analysis evaluating rapid HIV-tests [<xref rid="OFV162C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Other intervention studies, conducted among specific target populations with few options for testing, have suggested a positive impact of HIV and/or HCV rapid tests. These studies saw improvements in the proportion of individuals with access to a testing facility or network, who were proposed testing, and who accepted testing; especially when these tests are used by community educators and activists [<xref rid="OFV162C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="OFV162C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, in our study, we were only able to evaluate acceptance of screening in our study, which was fairly high for both arms.</p><p>It would appear that individuals testing positive for any one of the viral infections studied, be it from rapid or standard serological testing, were likely to pursue further care at a specialized facility. Of course, the fact that specific populations, namely undocumented immigrants, could have access to healthcare in France might have facilitated seeking care. At any rate, this proportion could be highly biased by whether testing was completed in the first place. By assuming that disease prevalence is the same between individuals with and without testing, we observed a stark advantage of rapid testing in the proportion of participants with appropriate care. This analysis demonstrates the close interplay, or rather dependence, between the cascade of screening and proper linkage-to-care.</p><p>Some limitations need to be addressed. First, this was a single-center pilot study, which may prevent generalizability to other testing centers or for other at-risk populations. Second, the small number of participants and infected individuals may have decreased power to detect certain differences in linkage-to-care. Third, we attempted to conduct a sensitivity analysis for participants with missing data, assuming that they had the same disease prevalence. This assumption might not be correct; yet nonetheless it would be difficult to evaluate. Finally, not all rapid tests were approved for routine use in France, and testing was conducted in a research setting, within a specific organization, and with staff designated to perform rapid testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In conclusion, a combined approach to HIV and viral hepatitis screening seems to improve the overall cascade of screening and consequently linkage-to-care in a population with high risk of chronic viral infection. As these testing strategies gain acceptance for use in other communities and screening programs, these encouraging results need to be confirmed in other settings. In the future, the development of a single rapid test for the detection of all 3 chronic viral diseases could ease the burden of multiple testing, allowing a simplified way of identifying infected HIV/HBV/HCV individuals and increasing awareness of disease status.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all study participants as well as all medical and paramedical staff from the Parisian &#x0201c;M&#x000e9;decins du Monde&#x0201d; clinic and the data management center, especially Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric Chau, Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric Fotre, Isabelle Goderel, Sylvain Bitschine, and Gr&#x000e9;gory Pannetier.
