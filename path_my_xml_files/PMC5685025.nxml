Glycosuria provides an energy and osmotic drain that could alter body composition. We therefore conducted a pilot study comparing the effects on body composition of two SGLT2 inhibitors, remogliflozin etabonate (RE) 250&#x000a0;mg TID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9) and sergliflozin etabonate (SE) (1000&#x000a0;mg TID) (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), with placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12) in obese non-diabetic subjects. Both drugs were well tolerated during 8 weeks of dosing, and the most common adverse event was headache. No urinary tract infections were observed, but there was one case of vaginal candidiasis in the RE group. As expected, RE and SE increased urine glucose excretion, with no change in the placebo group. All the subjects lost weight over 8 weeks, irrespective of treatment assignment. There was a reduction in TBW measured by D<sub>2</sub>O dilution in the RE group that was significantly greater than placebo (1.4&#x000a0;kg, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.029). This was corroborated by calculation of fat-free mass using a quantitative magnetic resonance technique. All but one subject had a measurable decrease in fat mass. There was significant between-subject variability of weight and fat loss, and no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Despite a lack of a difference in weight and fat mass loss, the leptin/adiponectin ratio, a measure of insulin resistance, was significantly decreased in the RE group when compared to placebo and SE, suggesting that this SGTL-2 inhibitor may improve metabolic health independent of a change in fat mass.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Key words</title><kwd>SGTL-2 inhibitors</kwd><kwd>Experimental medicine</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Glycosuria</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The incidence and prevalence of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are increasing as the result of a worldwide epidemic of obesity <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Medical management of patients with T2DM includes diet, exercise and weight reduction, together with oral anti-diabetic medications or insulin therapy, when appropriate <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Frequently, the treatment of T2DM now requires multiple agents acting via complementary mechanisms in an attempt to achieve tighter glycemic targets. Consequently, new agents with unique mechanisms of action and limited side effect profiles are needed when these targets cannot be reached <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.</p><p>Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) reduce circulating glucose concentrations via a renal mechanism distinct from other current anti-diabetic agents <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. SGLT2 is primarily expressed on the luminal side of the renal proximal tubule. It has high solute translocation capacity and low substrate affinity, and serves as the primary, but not exclusive, pathway for renal glucose reabsorption. Sergliflozin etabonate (SE) and remogliflozin etabonate (RE) are orally-active prodrugs of sergliflozin and remogliflozin, respectively. Sergliflozin is an SGLT2 inhibitor that increases urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner in rodents and dogs, and lowers plasma glucose levels following oral glucose challenge in diabetic rats <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Remogliflozin works similarly in mice and rats and exhibits antidiabetic efficacy in animal models and humans <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. These two SGTL2 inhibitors have different effects on glucose excretion in humans. The maximal glycosuria observed with RE is greater than the maximal glycosuria achieved with SE&#x000a0;<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>SGLT2 inhibitors improve plasma glucose concentrations and lower body weight in subjects with T2DM <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Administration of RE for 12 weeks to T2DM subjects resulted in a reduction of HbA1c of up to 1.07% versus placebo treatment, and a reduction in body weight of up to 3.51&#x000a0;kg (unpublished data). In another 12-week study conducted with T2DM subjects, dapagliflozin, a different SGLT2 inhibitor, improved HbA1c and produced weight changes of&#x000a0;&#x02212;2.5 to&#x000a0;&#x02212;3.4&#x000a0;kg compared to&#x000a0;&#x02212;1.2&#x000a0;kg for placebo <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. No detailed body composition analyses were included in these studies to investigate the mechanism of the weight loss.</p><p>The renal glycosuria produced by SGLT2 inhibitors could alter body composition through loss of calories in the urine and by osmotic diuresis. In addition, initial weight changes during negative energy balance could be the result of diuresis caused by glycogen mobilization from the liver. If the sustained weight changes are the result of reduced adipose tissue stores caused by energy excretion as glucose, then this may explain, in part, the metabolic improvement seen with SGLT2 inhibitors.</p><p>The primary objective of this pilot study was to investigate the effect of RE and SE, administered for 8 weeks, on glucose excretion and body composition changes measured by quantitative magnetic resonance (QMR) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and by the 4-compartment (4C) body composition model <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In addition, we measured the changes in total body water (TBW) to determine the contribution of fluid loss caused by osmotic diuresis to the overall change in weight seen with these SGLT2 inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was conducted at the Addenbrookes Centre for Clinical Investigation (ACCI), Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, in the GlaxoSmithKline Clinical Unit in Cambridge (CUC) and the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility (WTCRF). The study was performed in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the 1996 version of the Declaration of Helsinki and it was conducted between September 2006 and July 2007. The experimental protocols were approved by the protocol review panel at GlaxoSmithKline, the Cambridge Local Research Ethics Committee (06/Q0108/254) (EUDRACT 2006-003864-71), the Addenbrooke's Hospital R&#x00026;D office, and by the WTCRF Scientific Advisory Board. All patients provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p><p>Thirty healthy subjects were recruited by direct advertisement. The sample size of this pilot study was based on feasibility. Enrollment criteria included body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and age between 18 and 55 years. Subjects with T2DM were excluded. The use of recreational drugs, alcohol, caffeine and strenuous exercise was forbidden. A qualified dietician advised subjects on a hypocaloric diet targeting a daily energy deficit of 2090&#x000a0;kJ <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> relative to the estimated daily caloric requirement of each subject, assuming a physical activity level of 1.3. After a 2 week run-in on diet&#x000a0;alone, baseline 24&#x000a0;h urine glucose excretion, weight and fat mass were measured using QMR and 4C methods. Subjects were then assigned at random in a 3:3:2:2 ratio to SE 1000&#x000a0;mg three times daily [TID] (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), RE 250&#x000a0;mg TID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), SE-placebo TID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), or RE-placebo TID (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6). Subjects were managed as outpatients and returned to the clinical unit every two weeks for eight weeks to receive counseling and to review safety endpoints. After eight weeks of dosing, they again underwent measurement of 24&#x000a0;h urine glucose excretion, weight and fat mass. Intermediate measurements of some pharmacodynamic endpoints were made at weeks 2, 4 and/or 6 and at a follow-up visit at week 12. Plasma sampling occurred at Week 6 to determine steady-state pharmacokinetics (PK) of RE, remogliflozin and GSK279782 (the main remogliflozin metabolite), and SE.</p><p>Fasting blood samples were collected at the beginning of the study and at clinic visits for leptin, adiponectin, IGF-1, VCAM-1.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Body composition measurements</title><sec id="sec2.1.1"><title>Quantitative magnetic resonance</title><p>The characteristics of the QMR (Echo MRI-AH, Echo Medical Systems, Houston, TX, USA) have been described previously <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.

As a result, we investigated the actions of two SGTL2 inhibitors with different effects on glucose excretion in obese, non-diabetic subjects, and attempted to relate the energy lost through glycosuria to changes in weight and body composition as assessed by the state-of-the-art methods, QMR&#x000a0;and the 4C model. Previously, we had demonstrated that QMR was the most precise way of detecting changes fat mass <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. We also used D<sub>2</sub>O dilution to measure TBW to quantify the fluid shifts produced by SGLT2 inhibition in these non-diabetic subjects. After we started our study, two SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to cause weight loss in T2DM subjects. Administration of RE for 12 weeks to T2DM subjects resulted in reductions in body weight of up to 3.5&#x000a0;kg compared to placebo, in addition to lowering HbA1c, but no data were collected on body composition changes (unpublished data). Dapagliflozin administered for 24 weeks to T2DM patients reduced total body weight and fat mass <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we have extended the initial observations of the actions of SGLT2 inhibitors to obese non-diabetic subjects. As anticipated, there was a statistically significant treatment-related effect of RE and SE on urine glucose excretion, with RE producing greater urine glucose excretion than SE, as expected from the differences in drug exposure and potency of the two inhibitors. There was no change in glucose excretion in the placebo groups. These treatment- and visit-related changes in urine glucose excretion translate to mean differences in urine energy loss of 55.8&#x000a0;MJ, 35.4&#x000a0;MJ and 0.06&#x000a0;MJ for the RE, SE and placebo groups, respectively. In contrast, urine volume measures were relatively consistent among treatment groups and stable over the treatment periods (data not shown).</p><p>All the obese subjects lost weight over 8 weeks, irrespective of treatment assignment, and all but one subject had a measurable decrease in fat mass. Notably, the degree of weight and fat loss varied considerably between individuals (e.g., weight loss on placebo ranged from 1.3 to 11.9&#x000a0;kg over the eight weeks period). In light of this large between-subject variation and the small size of the study population, it is not surprising that there were no statistically significant differences between active treatment and placebo groups with regard to weight or fat loss. The weight changes in these subjects would be expected to result from the difference between energy intake and energy expenditure or energy loss as glycosuria. In our study, the protocol required a behavioral modification that should have resulted in a negative daily energy intake of 2090&#x000a0;kJ (500 calories) for all subjects over the duration of the trial. In addition, the estimated mean total daily energy loss as glycosuria was approximately 1000&#x000a0;kJ/day (240&#x000a0;kcal/day), 630&#x000a0;kJ/day (150&#x000a0;kcal/day) and 1.1&#x000a0;kJ/day (0.3&#x000a0;kcal/day) for the RE, SE and placebo groups, respectively. Furthermore, the RE group at week 8 showed a reduction in TBW measured by D<sub>2</sub>O that was significantly greater than placebo (1.4&#x000a0;kg, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.029). This was corroborated by calculation of fat-free mass (weight&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;fat mass measured by QMR) which remained unchanged in the placebo group at 8 weeks, but was significantly decreased in the SGTL-2 inhibitor-treated groups. We found that the changes in fat-free mass correlated with TBW changes (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.55), but the former seemed to decrease more in the SGLT2 treated groups than TBW changes. We have no data on changes on glycogen storage, but these would occur early and would be expected to have little impact on absolute hydration status at the end of 8 weeks of treatment.</p><p>The size of the study population was limited, but taken together these data suggest two possibilities for the lack of differentiation of the weight changes seen with the SGLT2-treated and placebo-treated subjects: (i) placebo-treated subjects were more compliant with the behavioral modifications required by the protocol, creating a more variable, and in some cases greater, negative energy balance, and/or (ii) the SGLT2 inhibitors stimulated food intake as a compensation for the energy loss as glycosuria, and this was large enough to overshadow the weight loss from urinary calorie loss and osmotic diuresis. The food intake and energy expenditure information collected during the study by the dieticians was not sufficiently detailed to investigate this possibility. However, it has been reported that SGLT2 inhibition may increase food intake in an animal model of obesity <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The leptin/adiponectin ratio has been proposed as a measure of insulin resistance in non-diabetic individuals <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and it was surprising that there was a significant decrease between baseline at the end of the intervention in the RE group when compared to placebo and SE, suggesting that this SGTL-2 inhibitor improved metabolic health independent of a significant change in fat mass. The difference between the RE and SE groups may indicate that the degree of glycosuria may be important in activating a novel mechanism leading to the reduction of the leptin-adiponectin ratio.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that administration of SGLT2 inhibitors to obese non-diabetic subjects increases energy loss via urine glucose excretion. We observed statistically significant and comparable reductions of weight and fat mass in the SGLT2 and placebo groups which may indicate that SGLT2 inhibition drives some compensatory increase in energy intake. In addition, RE produced a statistically significant reduction of fat-free mass and TBW. The reduction of the leptin-adiponectin ratio suggests that RE, but not SE, treatment is capable of improving the metabolic status of on non-diabetic obese subjects. As this was a small pilot study, a long-term weight loss trial would be required to confirm our observations. Ideally, the trial would thoroughly assess energy balance and monitor food intake and energy expenditure, to allow deconvolution of the factors contributing to the variability between individuals in response to an SGLT2 inhibitor. The favorable body composition and metabolic changes in non-diabetic obese subject should be investigated further when SGLT2 inhibitors are used as monotherapy or when combined with other weight loss treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaw</surname><given-names>J.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sicree</surname><given-names>R.A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>P.Z.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Global estimates of the prevalence of diabetes for 2010 and 2030</article-title><source>Diabetes Res Clin Pract</source><volume>87</volume><issue>1</issue><year>2010 Jan</year><fpage>4</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19896746</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Inzucchi</surname><given-names>S.E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bergenstal</surname><given-names>R.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Buse</surname><given-names>J.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Diamant</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrannini</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nauck</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD)</article-title><source>Diabetes Care</source><volume>35</volume><issue>6</issue><year>2012 Jun</year><fpage>1364</fpage><lpage>1379</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22517736</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref3"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Del Prato</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Felton</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Munro</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Nesto</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zimmet</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Zinman</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><collab>Global Partnership for Effective Diabetes Management</collab></person-group><article-title>Improving glucose management: ten steps to get more patients with type 2 diabetes to glycaemic goal.
