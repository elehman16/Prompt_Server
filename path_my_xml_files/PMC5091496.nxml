However, evidence is limited to evaluate socioeconomic support to achieve this change in policy and practice. The objective of the present study was to investigate the economic effects of a TB-specific socioeconomic intervention.</p><p>The setting was 32 shantytown communities in Peru. The participants were from households of consecutive TB patients throughout TB treatment administered by the national TB programme. The intervention consisted of social support through household visits and community meetings, and economic support through cash transfers conditional upon TB screening in household contacts, adhering to TB treatment/chemoprophylaxis and engaging with social support. Data were collected to assess TB-affected household costs. Patient interviews were conducted at treatment initiation and then monthly for 6 months.</p><p>From February 2014 to June 2015, 312 households were recruited, of which 135 were randomised to receive the intervention. Cash transfer total value averaged US$173 (3.5% of TB-affected households' average annual income) and mitigated 20% of households' TB-related costs. Households randomised to receive the intervention were less likely to incur catastrophic costs (30% (95% CI 22&#x02013;38%) <italic>versus</italic> 42% (95% CI 34&#x02013;51%)). The mitigation impact was higher among poorer households.</p><p>The TB-specific socioeconomic intervention reduced catastrophic costs and was accessible to poorer households. Socioeconomic support and mitigating catastrophic costs are integral to the End TB strategy, and our findings inform implementation of these new policies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="short"><p><bold>Socioeconomic intervention defrays costs of accessing TB care in impoverished TB-affected households in Peru</bold>

In order to enhance TB control, the World Health Organization's (WHO) End TB Strategy mandates complementing the existing biomedical response with approaches that combat the financial burden of TB. Specifically, the strategy recommends providing social protection for TB-affected households and includes a milestone of zero TB-affected households incurring catastrophic costs by 2020.</p><p>Previously, catastrophic costs were defined financially as TB-related out-of-pocket expenses that led to worsening impoverishment of TB-affected households [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In recent research, we defined a clinically relevant catastrophic costs threshold, demonstrating that TB patients from households that incurred total TB-related household costs of &#x02265;20% of their household annual income were more likely to die, or not complete, or not be cured by, TB treatment [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Additionally, this research suggested that such catastrophic costs led to as many adverse outcomes as multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This catastrophic costs' threshold has been included by the WHO within a tool to estimate country-specific TB-related and catastrophic costs of TB patients and their TB-affected households, which is being piloted and rolled-out in sentinel countries in 2015&#x02013;2016 [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>However, collecting costs data is complex, labour-intensive, and thus may be logistically difficult for national TB programmes to perform in addition to their routine day-to-day activities, especially in resource-constrained settings. Moreover, in primarily agrarian societies or communities, such data may not truly reflect the financial hardship that some households experience or encompass any related coping strategies. A potential solution may be to collect data on other indicators of financial hardship, weakening or shock, called &#x0201c;dissaving&#x0201d;, as part of catastrophic costs surveillance [<xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Examples of dissaving include households using savings, taking out a loan, taking a child out of education, and/or selling household items or assets. The WHO costs tool includes measurement of dissaving but evidence is needed concerning the accuracy and validity of dissaving as a proxy measure for catastrophic costs.</p><p>Social protection, such as cash transfer interventions, aim to reduce or prevent further poverty and vulnerability by improving people's capacity to manage social and/or economic risks [<xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Socioeconomic interventions include social protection and may additionally aim to defray TB-related costs, incentivise and enable care and reduce TB vulnerability. Social risks of having TB disease include TB-related stigma whereas economic risks include incurring TB-related costs. TB-related costs may be considered in terms of national economic costs (<italic>e.g.</italic> impact on or proportion of gross domestic product), health system costs (<italic>e.g.</italic> healthcare service and provision), and human costs (<italic>e.g.</italic> direct and indirect costs of patients and their households). In the setting of Peruvian shantytowns, the human costs associated with TB are generally experienced and shared by all the members of the household in which someone receives TB treatment [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this manuscript we focus on costs experienced by TB-affected households that are henceforth referred to as TB-related costs [<xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. There is minimal operational research assessing the impact of socioeconomic interventions on mitigation of the effects of TB-related costs. Such interventions may be a cost-effective investment from a societal perspective [<xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] through their potential ability to enhance TB control as part of the post-2015 End TB Strategy.</p><p>Socioeconomic support aiming to enhance TB control and elimination may be: 1) &#x0201c;TB-specific&#x0201d; &#x02212; offered only to TB-affected people or households; 2) &#x0201c;TB-inclusive&#x0201d; &#x02212; adapting existing support interventions to explicitly include TB-affected people in their eligibility criteria with objectives that include, but are not limited to, TB; or 3) &#x0201c;TB-sensitive&#x0201d; &#x02212; adapting existing support interventions which do not explicitly include TB-affected people in their eligibility criteria but are expected to impact TB prevention, care, and/or control by being sensitive to TB risk reduction strategies and reaching groups at high risk of TB.</p><p>Building on the findings of the Innovative Socioeconomic Interventions Against TB &#x0201c;ISIAT&#x0201d; study [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], we designed a new, more focused, clearly defined TB-specific socioeconomic intervention aiming to support TB-affected households in order to better achieve TB prevention and cure [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. During a household-randomised controlled study, we performed an initial phase assessment of this intervention in order to optimise its impact for the larger Community Randomised Evaluation of a Socioeconomic Intervention to Prevent TB (CRESIPT). Here we report the economic effects of the intervention during the initial phase of the CRESIPT project, including an evaluation of dissaving as a possible proxy marker for catastrophic costs and an assessment of the intervention's impact on defraying TB-related costs and catastrophic costs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants, study setting and description of the socioeconomic intervention are provided in greater detail in <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table">tables 1</xref> and <xref rid="TB2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and in a related publication concerning the intervention's planning and implementation [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>The initial phase of the CRESIPT project: socioeconomic intervention methods, participant recruitment and impact of the intervention [18]</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Study setting</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The study took place in 32 shantytown communities in Callao, Peru, with an estimated population of one million people and TB rates that are higher than the national average [19]</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Intervention</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The intervention aimed to increase: 1) screening for TB in household contacts and MDR-TB testing in TB patients; 2) adherence to TB treatment and chemoprophylaxis; and 3) engagement with socioeconomic support activities</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">This integrated intervention consisted of:</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Economic support component: conditional cash transfers throughout treatment to defray average household TB-related costs and thereby reduce TB vulnerability, incentivise, empower and enable equitable access to care; and</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Social support component: household visits and participatory community meetings for information, mutual support, stigma reduction and empowerment</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The cash transfers of the economic component of the intervention were designed so that if a patient achieved all possible conditions and thereby received all possible cash transfers throughout treatment, this would largely defray their direct out-of-pocket expenses for their entire illness that were previously found to be 10% of annual household income in this study site [5, 18].

All patients with MDR-TB recruited during the study received ambulatory treatment. <sup>&#x000b6;</sup>: income, expenses and costs are all measured in Peruvian Soles (average US$1 equivalent to 2.9 Peruvian Soles during the study period) at the household level unless otherwise stated.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Costs and poverty</title><p>A locally validated questionnaire [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] was updated and used to interview patients and collect sociodemographic data concerning household income and expenses throughout TB illness. Interviews were conducted at baseline with TB patients in intervention and control arms, as well as healthy controls. For all patients, this baseline interview occurred prior to or at the time at which treatment commenced. All patients (but not healthy controls) were subsequently interviewed after 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20&#x02005;weeks. At all baseline and subsequent interviews, data was collected characterising earnings, income, expenses, employment (paid or unpaid), days unable to work due to illness, additional household food expenditure due to TB illness (<italic>e.g.</italic> over and above normal food expenditure), and crowding since the previous interview. As per previous research [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], crowding was defined as both a continuous variable (number of people per room) and a dichotomous variable (percentage of households with greater than cohort median people per room). A final &#x0201c;exit&#x0201d; interview took place at 24&#x02005;weeks or, in those who continued TB treatment beyond 24&#x02005;weeks, at 28&#x02005;weeks of treatment. The baseline and exit interviews (but no other interview) included anthropometric measurement of height and weight, calculation of body mass index (BMI), and a detailed assessment of 13 key stable variables associated with socioeconomic position (<xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). These variables were used to create a composite household poverty index score in arbitrary units using principal component analysis (PCA), as described previously [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The Eigenvector loading values derived by PCA analysis were analysed in order to assess which of the socioeconomic variables contributed the most to the poverty score in this setting (variables with higher Eigenvector loading values being more discriminatory). The proportion of intervention patient households' TB-related costs that were defrayed by the conditional cash transfers was calculated. Additionally, changes in poverty score and BMI from recruitment to the exit interview were analysed in order to evaluate the impact of the intervention on nutritional and other poverty-related TB risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Dissaving</title><p>Elements of &#x0201c;dissaving&#x0201d; specifically related to the patient's TB illness were recorded at each interview (<xref rid="TB3" ref-type="table">table 3</xref>). Cumulative dissaving episodes (<italic>i.e.</italic> each separate occasion on which an element of dissaving occurred) were also measured. A composite dissaving score was then derived by PCA from all of the dissaving variables [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The dissaving score was measured as a continuous variable in arbitrary units with the mean dissaving score of the patient cohort being 0 units. A higher score implied greater dissaving and thus implied that the TB illness was causing a greater financial burden. The Eigenvector loading values derived by PCA analysis were analysed in order to assess which of the dissaving variables had the highest discriminatory power to explain the dissaving score in the setting. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses with stepwise exclusion of non-contributory variables were used to assess the association between dissaving and socioeconomic variables including catastrophic costs. For these analyses the dissaving score was considered as a binary variable of higher-than <italic>versus</italic> lower-than average dissaving. This dissaving analysis tested whether dissaving may be a possible proxy indicator of catastrophic costs (see introduction section).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data shown</title><p>Data concerning TB-related costs, catastrophic costs, and dissaving is shown for both intervention TB-affected households and control TB-affected households.

The financial burden of TB was high, especially amongst poorer TB-affected households, reinforcing Virchow's 150-year old assertion that TB is a social disease [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Over one-third of the TB-affected households experienced catastrophic costs and thus were at increased risk of adverse treatment outcome [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Households with greater dissaving were nearly twice as likely to incur catastrophic costs, suggesting that dissaving may be a useful and simple proxy indicator of catastrophic costs risk. The intervention defrayed only a fifth of patient households' TB-related costs but, despite this, households that were randomised to receive the intervention were less likely to incur catastrophic costs. TB-related costs were defrayed to a greater extent in poorer households and for female patients, suggesting that the intervention was equitable to these vulnerable groups. This evidence suggests a socioeconomic intervention including a social protection component can contribute to defraying TB-related costs, reduce the likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs, and may inform future implementation of such interventions in line with the post-2015 global End TB Strategy.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Impact of the socioeconomic intervention on defraying TB-related costs and catastrophic costs</title><p>The findings of this current research are important because they indicate that a socioeconomic intervention reduced the likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs: an encouraging finding that contributes to WHO's goal of eliminating catastrophic costs by 2035. However, despite reducing the likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs, the impact of the socioeconomic intervention may have been limited by the fact that the conditional cash transfers defrayed only 20% of patient households' total TB-related costs. During planning of the intervention, it had been estimated that if implemented nationally this conditional cash transfer programme would increase the Peruvian TB programme budget by between 5% and 26% per patient [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Focus group discussions with key stakeholders including local staff of the Peruvian TB programme and a civil society of TB-affected people suggested that such an increase in programme expenditure was locally appropriate, affordable and potentially sustainable [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A nationwide socioeconomic support programme designed for TB-affected households may benefit from collaborative implementation between the national TB programme and other social development and welfare organisations that share cash transfer and delivery costs. During planning of CRESIPT, leading members of the Peruvian national cash transfer programme &#x0201c;JUNTOS&#x0201d; were consulted as to the possibility of extending the reach of the scheme to the urban, TB-affected households of the study communities. However, this was not possible as JUNTOS provides cash transfers exclusively to female heads of household in rural communities [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, to enhance the future impact of the intervention in Peru, it will likely be necessary to increase the proportion of costs defrayed by conditional cash transfers in order to further incentivise TB-affected households, eliminate catastrophic costs, reduce TB vulnerability, and enable improved access to TB treatment and care. This could be achieved by a combination of: reducing system costs (<italic>e.g.</italic> through rapid diagnosis, and improved access to treatment and chemoprophylaxis); increasing the value of the cash transfers; and increasing access to and uptake of conditional cash transfers (<italic>e.g.</italic> stratifying the intervention so that high-risk groups receive greater and more frequent socioeconomic support).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Dissaving and the association of dissaving with catastrophic costs</title><p>Dissaving is a simple, proxy measure of financial shock [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A key research question to be answered prior to widespread adoption of dissaving assessment is how well the prevalence of certain dissaving measures correlates with likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs. This is important because certain communities (<italic>e.g.</italic> pastoralists) may not commonly use cash or banking services and, therefore, collecting pecuniary costs data only is likely to overlook the economic impact TB has on often marginalised and vulnerable TB-affected households within that community. In the current study setting, dissaving was associated with vulnerable, underserved individuals or households. Patients from households with more than average dissaving were poorer, and more likely to incur catastrophic costs and have greater food insecurity. In addition to a recently published study demonstrating the correlation of dissaving with TB-related costs in different settings [<xref rid="C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], our current results provide evidence to inform the potential role of dissaving and provide provisional support for dissaving as a proxy marker of catastrophic costs. Our previous research has shown that catastrophic costs were associated with adverse TB treatment outcome and may be assumed to have a negative effect on TB control. The same may be the case for dissaving. If dissaving was to be adopted as a proxy indicator of catastrophic costs, it is probable that local adaptation of dissaving measures will be necessary. In specific settings, certain dissaving variables may be more relevant to, and correspond more closely with, the likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs. For example, in rural sub-Saharan Africa where formal loans or payments may be less frequent, other dissaving variables such as selling livestock may be more important contributors to dissaving [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In addition, while there is scope for measuring dissaving elements longitudinally as a binary variable at different time points throughout TB treatment (<italic>e.g.</italic> loan taken, up to present day), collecting only dissaving data would risk losing the richness of quantitative costs data and the opportunity to estimate the equivalent cash transfer amounts required to defray TB-related costs. Piloting of the WHO TB costs tool including dissaving measures may soon shed new light on this under-researched area.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Equity of the socioeconomic intervention on TB-related costs mitigation</title><p>There was evidence suggesting the intervention was equitable because the proportion of direct expenses, lost income, and total costs defrayed by conditional cash transfers was higher in poorer households and female patients. These findings are encouraging because such vulnerable and marginalised patient groups have previously been found to have reduced access to TB care and prevention in the study setting, and thus are more likely to experience adverse TB treatment outcome [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In order to reach these underserved groups in the future, national TB-specific socioeconomic interventions may benefit from a broader approach than simply money and education, including cross-sector provision of improved access to health insurance, social housing, housing improvements (<italic>e.g.</italic> optimising ventilation), employment services (nearly half of total TB-related costs were due to lost income), and multidisciplinary drug and alcohol addiction clinics (services not widely available during the study period in the study setting). In addition, alternative forms of DOT may be beneficial to reduce TB-related financial burden and allow an early return to work, such as video-observed or peer-observed therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Limitations</title><p>First, the study sample size was determined by TB outcomes, so no <italic>a priori</italic> power calculations were made to evaluate the impact of the intervention on financial outcomes. In addition, the impact of frequency of conditional cash transfers on TB-related costs and household finances was not analysed during this preliminary phase of CRESIPT but will be evaluated during the main CRESIPT study. Secondly, despite the encouraging findings concerning equity of the intervention, research nurses reported their subjective impression that patients who declined to participate in the study were much more commonly from groups associated with high-risk of adverse treatment outcome (including the formerly incarcerated, homeless and/or those with drug addictions). However, this qualitative observation cannot be quantitatively verified because these patients chose not to give informed consent and so we were unable to formally collect data on their specific risk factors. Thirdly, costs of accessing treatment for comorbidities such as HIV and diabetes throughout TB illness were not specifically examined during this study. However, only 6% of the cohort had diabetes and 5% HIV and these comorbidities were equally distributed in both the intervention and control TB-affected households, so it is unlikely that this would have influenced our results. Fourthly, we only studied the financial effects of MDR-TB for 6&#x02013;7&#x02005;months, whereas patients with MDR TB are usually treated for 18&#x02005;months or more. We decided <italic>a priori</italic> to analyse the catastrophic costs of both MDR-TB and non-MDR-TB patients together for 6&#x02013;7&#x02005;months, given the small number of MDR-TB patients, and in order to be consistent with our previous published research of catastrophic costs of TB-affected households [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Finally, there is currently no standardised, accepted method by which to measure mitigation of the effects of catastrophic costs or defraying of TB-related costs, the findings from Peru (an upper/middle-income economy country) may not be generalisable to other countries globally, and the impact of conditional cash transfers may be different if implemented within national TB programmes' day-to-day practice by programmes themselves rather than as part of a household-randomised study.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Accessing TB care that provided TB tests and treatment free of charge was associated with higher dissaving, high TB-related costs, and frequent catastrophic costs in Peruvian shantytowns, especially for poorer households. This research provides preliminary evidence concerning the use of dissaving as a proxy indicator of catastrophic costs. A novel socioeconomic intervention defrayed a substantial proportion of TB-related costs, especially for female patients and poorer households, and reduced the likelihood of incurring catastrophic costs. Informed by these findings, the cash transfers have been increased in value and the impact of the socioeconomic intervention on TB health outcomes is ready to be evaluated during the CRESIPT study.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Support statement<italic>:</italic> This study was supported by Joint Global Health Trials (award MR/K007467/1 from a consortium of the Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council and UK-AID/Dept For International Development), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation award OPP1118545, the Wellcome Trust award 105788/Z/14/Z and IFHAD.
