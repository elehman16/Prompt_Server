Height in puberty involves a growth spurt, the timing and intensity of which varies between individuals. Such data can be summarized with individual Preece&#x02013;Baines (PB) curves, and their five parameters then related to earlier exposures or later outcomes. But it involves fitting many curves.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold> We present an alternative SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) model, a shape invariant model with a single fitted curve. Curves for individuals are matched to the mean curve by shifting their curve up&#x02013;down (representing differences in mean size) and left&#x02013;right (for differences in growth tempo), and the age scale is also shrunk or stretched to indicate how fast time passes in the individual (i.e. velocity). These three parameters per individual are estimated as random effects while fitting the curve. The outcome is a mean curve plus triplets of parameters per individual (size, tempo and velocity) that summarize the individual growth patterns. The data are heights for Christ&#x02019;s Hospital School (CHS) boys aged 9&#x02013;19 years (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3245, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;129&#x02009;508), and girls with Turner syndrome (TS) aged 9&#x02013;18 years from the UK Turner Study (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;105, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1321).</p><p><bold>Results</bold> The SITAR model explained 99% of the variance in both datasets [residual standard deviation (RSD) 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;mm], matching the fit of individually-fitted PB curves. In CHS, growth tempo was associated with insulin-like growth factor-1 measured 50 years later (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1009). For the girls with TS randomized to receive oxandrolone from 9 years, velocity was substantially increased compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>).</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold> The SITAR growth curve model is a useful epidemiological instrument for the analysis of height in puberty.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Height</kwd><kwd>puberty</kwd><kwd>Turner syndrome</kwd><kwd>growth curve</kwd><kwd>random effects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A child&#x02019;s growth curve contains considerable information about their genetic make-up and environmental exposure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1"><sup>1</sup></xref> It can be useful to characterize the nature of the curve and relate it both to previous or current exposures and putative later outcomes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"><sup>2</sup></xref> Thus, the characterization of the growth curve is an important first stage in the life course study of early growth and later outcome.</p><p>By its nature the growth curve consists of a series of highly correlated measurements, and it is important to reduce the dimensionality of the data to simplify comparisons between individual children. The traditional approach is to identify a suitable parametric model for the given measurement and age range, for example the Jenss&#x02013;Bayley curve<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3"><sup>3</sup></xref> for weight in early life or the Preece&#x02013;Baines (PB) curve<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref> for height in puberty. The growth curve is then entirely characterized by the fitted parameters of the model, which can be used instead of the raw data to test for associations with exposure and/or outcome.</p><p>This article focuses on height in puberty, where the PB curve with its five estimated parameters fits individual growth curves extremely well, with a residual standard deviation (SD) of 6&#x02013;7&#x02009;mm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></xref> However, as a summary of the underlying curve its five parameters are relatively high-dimensional for many purposes.</p><p>The ideal approach would be to fit a form of curve to all subjects simultaneously, and to estimate the subject-specific parameter values as subject random effects. Such an approach could in principle be applied to the PB curve. However, Beath<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> introduced a considerable simplification to the analysis of growth curves by describing a <italic>shape invariant model</italic> of infant weight. This consists of a single growth curve, which can be applied to all subjects by applying just three subject-specific translations and rotations of the curve to fit the individual subject growth curves.</p><p>The aim here is to fit the model described by Beath<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> and show how effectively it summarizes height growth around the time of puberty. The second aim is to show how the estimated subject-specific parameters can be related to earlier exposures and later outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Data sets</title><p>Two data sets are used as examples, both of height in puberty. The first, the Christ&#x02019;s Hospital School (CHS) cohort, consisted of a sample of 3245 boys, who attended the school at some stage between 1939 and 1968 and were measured twice a term between the ages of 9 and 19 years [median 42 measurements per boy, inter-quartile (IQR) range 35&#x02013;47, range 1&#x02013;63], a total of 129&#x02009;508 heights. These were linked to follow-up data on 1520 adults, some 50 years later, when inter alia height and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels were measured. The cohort has been described in detail previously,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9"><sup>7&#x02013;9</sup></xref> and an inverse association between age at peak height velocity (APHV) and later IGF-1 has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></xref> This was based on estimates of APHV for each child derived from spline curves fitted to each child&#x02019;s data.</p><p>The second data set came from a randomized clinical trial of oxandrolone to increase final height in girls with Turner syndrome (TS). This is a chromosomal disorder where the second X chromosome is missing or malformed, leading to short stature and primary ovarian failure. A total of 106 girls with TS already on a standard dose of growth hormone were randomized to receive either oxandrolone or placebo from the age of 9 years (or the age at recruitment if later) until final height was reached. One girl dropped out immediately and 13 more later on, whereas 92 girls remained in the study and 82 had reached final height before the time of analysis. A total of 1321 heights were included in the analysis (median 12 per child, IQR 9&#x02013;17, range 1&#x02013;23). The trial, which also included a second randomization to early or late oestrogen for induction of puberty, is reported in detail elsewhere (EJ Gault <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication).</p></sec><sec><title>The SITAR model</title><p>The method used to summarize the individual growth curves followed that of Beath,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> and was also an extension of the model developed independently by the first author and colleagues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><sup>7</sup></xref> This is a shape invariant model<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"><sup>10</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"><sup>11</sup></xref> that involves fitting the following random effects model to the set of height growth curves:
<disp-formula id="M1"><label>(1)</label><graphic xlink:href="dyq115m1"/></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>y<sub>it</sub></italic> is height for subject <italic>i</italic> at age <italic>t</italic>, <italic>h(t)</italic> is a natural cubic spline curve of height vs age, and &#x003b1;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, &#x003b2;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and &#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> are subject-specific random effects. The aim is to choose the values of &#x003b1;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>, &#x003b2;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> and &#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> to make the individual growth curves as similar as possible, i.e. the mean spline curve <italic>h</italic>(<italic>t</italic>). Their interpretations are as follows:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>&#x003b1;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is a random height intercept that adjusts for differences in mean height&#x02014;here it is termed <italic>size</italic>.

Geometrically it corresponds to a subject-specific left&#x02013;right shift or translation in the spline curve, with &#x003b2;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> negative for early puberty and positive for late.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is a random age scaling that adjusts for the duration of the growth spurt in individuals. Its parameterization as exp(&#x02013;&#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) ensures that both positive and negative values are permissible, with zero corresponding to average velocity, and the minus sign means that it measures velocity rather than its inverse. (This minus sign is the reverse of Beath&#x02019;s notation.) Geometrically it corresponds to a shrinking or stretching of the age scale. Thus for a child with a relatively short spurt and a steep growth curve, &#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is positive to stretch the age scale and reduce the slope (i.e. peak velocity). Conversely, if &#x003b3;<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> is negative the age scale is shrunk and the curve slope increased. For this reason the parameter is termed <italic>velocity.</italic> Note that its effect is to make growth curves steeper or shallower, so it effectively <italic>rotates</italic> each curve (this terminology makes clear its similarity to a random slope effect, though strictly it is a scale change rather than a rotation).</p></list-item></list></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the meanings of the three parameters geometrically, i.e. the three ways in which the mean growth curve (black solid line) can be transformed to match an individual&#x02019;s growth curve. Size is an up&#x02013;down shift on the height axis (red dashed lines) and tempo is a right-left shift on the age axis (blue long dashed lines), while velocity is a shrinking&#x02013;stretching of the age axis (green dot-dashed lines). The pairs of lines represent 95% of the population variation (i.e. &#x000b1;2 SD). The principle is that by suitable choice of these subject-specific parameters, smoothed estimates of each individual growth curve can be obtained by transformation of the mean curve. This leads to a particularly simple way of assessing goodness of fit. If the model fits well, each individual curve can be back-transformed using the subject&#x02019;s triplet of estimated parameters, and all the curves should then sit on top of the mean curve. Expressed in words, the model allows individual curves to be super-imposed by translation and rotation, leading to the happy acronym SITAR (SuperImposition by Translation And Rotation). This is the SITAR model for growth curve analysis.

Despite this, the effect on the RSD was small. For the TS data, height and age were slightly better than height and log age by 19 units of deviance.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>a, a random height offset (i.e. the size parameter <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) is adjusted for, so that individual curves are shifted up or down to minimize the RSD, which is reduced to 2.3&#x02009;cm.

So tempo is closely related to APHV though their SDs differ&#x02014;1.6&#x02009;cm for APHV vs 0.97&#x02009;cm for scaled tempo.</p><p>The next strongest correlations (0.20&#x02013;0.22) are for age with tempo, APHV and IGF-1. These represent secular trends over the period of data collection (1939&#x02013;68), with puberty becoming earlier and IGF-1 higher.

Thus the tempo of puberty (but not size or velocity) is strongly correlated with IGF-1 50 years later, and tempo and APHV are equally predictive.</p><p>As tempo and IGF-1 are both correlated with age, the tempo vs IGF-1 association could be due to the secular trend.

As well as providing the mean growth curve, it summarizes the departure of each individual curve from the mean in terms of three biologically meaningful parameters: size, tempo and velocity. Furthermore, the model explains effectively all the heterogeneity in growth between individuals, as the residual variability about the fitted curves is no greater than that obtained by fitting individual PB curves.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"><sup>5</sup></xref> The name SITAR is proposed for the model as it superimposes by translation and rotation.</p><p>The SITAR model has some similarities with the random intercept&#x02013;random slope model, in that size is a random intercept and velocity can be viewed as a random slope. However, where the two differ is that SITAR expects a nonlinear mean curve, and this allows the tempo random effect to be estimated&#x02014;if the mean curve were linear the size and tempo effects would be indistinguishable. Thus, the most innovative aspect of SITAR is its random shift on the age scale.</p><p>The SITAR model should also be useful for endocrinologists in that it clarifies the nature of growth in puberty. The substantial population heterogeneity in pubertal height velocity shows itself as variability in PHV and APHV. However, these two quantities are effectively the same as the SITAR parameters velocity and tempo, and the present analysis makes clear that these parameters explain <italic>all</italic> the differences in growth velocity in both the CHS and TS cohorts. Note that the size parameter, which defines mean height and hence is important to set the relative position of the height distance curve, has no effect on the height velocity curve. The SITAR parameterization shows that differences in height velocity between individuals are entirely explained by differences in their internal &#x02018;growth body clock&#x02019;.</p><p>The correlations between the three growth parameters indicate that CHS boys entering puberty later tend to be taller and have a larger peak velocity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Girls with TS show similar correlations except that tempo and velocity are inversely related, with early puberty associated with greater velocity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). This accords with the fact that only a minority of girls with TS enter puberty spontaneously&#x02014;the others have puberty induced artificially with oestrogen therapy, and their growth spurt is much smaller.</p><p>The positive correlation between size and tempo appears to contradict the previously reported negative correlation between height at school entry and APHV.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></xref> Clearly, the correlations of the growth parameters with height at any particular age depend on the values of the other parameters, as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref> for later height. Repeating this analysis for height at different ages in puberty shows that for size, a 1-SD increase predicts an &#x0223c;6-cm increase in height at all ages (which fits with the SD of &#x0223c;6&#x02009;cm for size in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>). For tempo, a 1-SD increase is associated consistently with a reduction in predicted height, peaking at &#x02013;7&#x02009;cm at age 14. Thus around APHV the tempo effect eclipses the size effect. For velocity the effect is smaller, ranging from &#x02013;2 to +1&#x02009;cm. So conditional on the other parameters, tempo is consistently inversely associated with height at any particular age, which accords with the earlier finding.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>The SITAR model is useful for relating individual growth parameters to previous exposures and/or later outcomes. The TS example shows how SITAR provides a parsimonious analysis of the growth clinical trial, where the oxandrolone intervention is not only highly effective, but also is seen to operate primarily by increasing growth velocity (<italic>&#x003b3;</italic>) rather than tempo (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>) or size (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>). The strength of the oxandrolone effect (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02013;8</sup>) is remarkable given the modest number of growth curves involved (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;105). Its effect on the size parameter of +2.6&#x02009;cm is less than on final height (+4.5&#x02009;cm) as it reflects mean height throughout the study. In fact the Turner Study design was more complex than described here, with two separate randomizations in a factorial design, and the net effect of oxandrolone on final height exceeded 7&#x02009;cm (EJ Gault <italic>et al</italic>., submitted for publication).</p><p>The CHS analysis relates the growth parameters to IGF-1 50 years later, and again finds just one of the three parameters to be important, this time tempo. Hence, earlier puberty is associated with higher IGF-1 after a lag of 50 years. The association is exaggerated by secular trends in tempo and IGF-1, but it remains after adjusting for age.</p><p>APHV measured from individual growth curves gives the same results as tempo. The high correlation of 0.83 between the two suggests that they are measuring essentially the same quantity, albeit on different measurement scales. However, tempo is much easier to estimate, being a random effect from a single analysis, whereas APHV involves analysing each individual growth curve.</p><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion of findings</title><p>The fact that the model fits well both in boys and girls, even growth disordered girls with TS, highlights its generality. The fit in the CHS boys was far better with a log age scale, where a left&#x02013;right shift on the log age scale corresponds to a shrinking&#x02013;stretching on the age scale anchored at birth. This elasticity of the growth curve affects the curve&#x02019;s slope (i.e. velocity), so that it is steeper for individuals with an early puberty and shallower for those reaching puberty later (see Figure 7 of Cole <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"><sup>7</sup></xref>). This provides a statistical explanation for the clinical observation that PHV (velocity) is inversely correlated with APHV (tempo).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14"><sup>14</sup></xref> Thus log age provides a better fit for CHS because it models this correlation. Indeed, it over-compensates, as the negative correlation of &#x02212;0.19 between tempo and velocity on the age scale (result not shown) switches to +0.28 on the log age scale (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The log age scale did not provide a better fit for the girls with TS, which may be due to their mean velocity curve lacking a clear peak, due to most of them failing to enter puberty spontaneously. Thus there was less opportunity for an association between PHV and APHV.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The strengths of the study are the two substantial and contrasting datasets that provide a useful test of the generality of the SITAR approach. In addition, they include examples of both exposure&#x02013;growth and growth&#x02013;outcome associations, which highlight respectively the velocity and tempo parameters of the model.</p><p>A weakness of the study is that the results apply only to height in puberty. Their relevance to height at other ages, e.g. pre-school, or to other measurements, e.g. weight, is not known. That said, Beath&#x02019;s article describing the method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6"><sup>6</sup></xref> applied it to weight from 0 to 2 years, where it appeared to fit well, though the goodness of fit of the model was not examined in the same way as here.</p><p>There is a need for future work to test the generality of the SITAR model, particularly in puberty where the heterogeneity of height growth, which appears to depend on the individual&#x02019;s time clock, may be related to the timing of changes in sex hormone status. The SITAR approach would be useful to examine hormone status in the same way as for height.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Medical Research Council (grant number G0700961 to
