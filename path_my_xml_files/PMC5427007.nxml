Recent studies have found an association between vitamin D status and risk of pulmonary exacerbations in children and adults with CF. The ongoing Vitamin D for enhancing the Immune System in Cystic fibrosis (DISC) study, a multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, will test the hypothesis of whether high dose vitamin D given as a single oral bolus of 250,000 IU to adults with CF during a pulmonary exacerbation followed by a maintenance dose of vitamin D will improve time to next pulmonary exacerbation and re-hospitalization, improve survival and lung function compared to placebo and reduce the rates of pulmonary exacerbation. Subjects will be randomized 1:1&#x000a0;at each clinical site to vitamin D or placebo within 72&#x000a0;h of hospital admission for pulmonary exacerbation. Clinical follow-up visits will occur at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days, and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. Blood and sputum will be collected and determination of clinical outcomes will be assessed at each visit. The primary endpoint will be the time to next pulmonary exacerbation requiring antibiotics, re-hospitalization or death. The secondary endpoints will include lung function assessed by forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), blood markers of inflammatory cytokines, anti-microbial peptide expression by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and circulating concentrations in blood. Other exploratory endpoints will examine the phenotype of neutrophils and monocyte/macrophages in sputum. Nutritional status will be assessed by 3 day food records and food frequency questionnaire.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Vitamin D</kwd><kwd>Cystic fibrosis</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary exacerbation</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Nutrition</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0010">Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lethal genetic condition that results from a mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

Adults with CF are randomized to 250,000 IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo given orally as a single bolus within 72&#x000a0;h of admission for an acute pulmonary exacerbation of CF. If subjects are already on maintenance vitamin D therapy at the time of enrollment, they will be allowed to continue taking vitamin D as long as the vitamin D dose remains under 2000 IU daily. If subjects are not taking any vitamin D at enrollment, they will be provided 800 IU daily to prevent severe vitamin D deficiency. Subjects are re-dosed with 50,000 IU of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> or placebo every other week starting at 3 months after randomization and in accordance to their initial randomization group. Subjects are followed for 1 year for clinical trial endpoints. Blood sampling for secondary endpoints and safety monitoring occurs at baseline, 1, 2, 3, and 7 days during the initial hospitalization and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. Questionnaires on vitamin D intake and habitual diet are being administered at baseline and at the final visit. Potential adverse events are assessed at each follow-up study visit in person. Additionally, clinical outcome study endpoints e.g. rehospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation and/or adverse events that occur between study visits are documented from the electronic medical record.

About halfway through the study, investigators became concerned about the very limited number of observed events in the study population, namely number of deaths. Concerned about the futility of the study, the DSMB asked the investigators to recalculate the sample size based on a secondary outcome. The DSMB approved the investigators proposed change that the new primary endpoint would be the time from study enrollment to next pulmonary exacerbation requiring any antibiotics, re-hospitalization or death. Data on pulmonary exacerbations were not available to either study investigators or the DSMB at the time of the change in primary study endpoint. With 45 patients in each group (90 total) there is 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.5 between the high-dose oral vitamin D<sub>3</sub> group and the standard therapy group, assuming an event rate of 86% in the control group at 1 year using 0.05 significance level. A drop-out rate of 10% was converted into a group loss hazard to allow it to be incorporated in the sample size calculation.</p><sec id="sec2.13.1"><label>2.13.1</label><title>Analysis plan</title><p id="p0160">Analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat approach. A Cox-proportional hazards model will be constructed to estimate and compare the hazard rates of pulmonary exacerbation, re-hospitalization or death of each group. Kaplan-Meier curves will also be drawn to describe and compare graphically the two groups' survival experience. One of the benefits of the randomized study design is that the two groups are very likely to be comparable at baseline. In the event that a pre-intervention variable significantly differentiates between groups, this variable will be included a covariate in the Cox model to reduce the impact of the baseline imbalance. The proportional hazards assumption will be assessed using Schoenfeld residuals. Additionally, a generalized linear model, assuming a Poisson distribution for the total number of pulmonary exacerbations, will be fit, with the natural logarithm as the link function. This model will provide an estimate of the incidence rate ratio to compare the rates of pulmonary exacerbations between groups. In the presence of over dispersion, the Poisson distribution will be replaced by the negative binomial distribution. All tests of hypotheses will be two-sided and use a 0.05 level of significance. SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) was used in the sample size calculation (i.e., proc power) and will be used in the data analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.14"><label>2.14</label><title>Ethics and data safety</title><sec id="sec2.14.1"><label>2.14.1</label><title>Human subjects (IRB)- consent and confidentiality</title><p id="p0165">The study was approved by the Emory University Institutional Review Board (IRB) and the local IRBs of each of the participating site.

This study will be the largest randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study examining vitamin D administered during an acute pulmonary exacerbation in adults with CF. Although the trial was initially powered for the primary endpoint of survival, there were very few deaths that occurred midway through the study, and thus the primary endpoint was changed to time to next pulmonary exacerbation, re-hospitalization or death. The study still has adequate power to detect differences between vitamin D and placebo with the new study endpoints. Several other biomarkers of health will be evaluated as secondary endpoints, including markers of inflammation and anti-microbial peptide concentrations as well as markers of lung function.</p><p id="p0185">Vitamin D deficiency has been recognized as a major co-morbidity in the CF population with prevalence rates reaching up to 90% of adults with CF <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Vitamin D status is often challenging to correct in the CF population owing to the malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins such as vitamin D <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Other approaches such as UV light therapy have been considered as potential treatment options for correcting vitamin D status in CF; however, patients often have difficulty with adherence to these treatments <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Much larger doses of vitamin D are often required to raise vitamin D status in patients with CF <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Vitamin D status overall is improving with time in the CF population following updated recommendations by the CF Foundation calling for higher doses of vitamin D <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>; however, the evidence for improvement in clinical outcomes in CF from vitamin D therapy is still limited.</p><p id="p0190">No large, multi-center, prospective study has been conducted examining vitamin D in patients with CF. A few retrospective studies have indicated that low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration was associated with pulmonary exacerbation. Vanstone et&#x000a0;al. reported that low vitamin D status in children was associated with increased number of pulmonary exacerbations of CF <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. McCauley et&#x000a0;al. having a higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in children was protective of having a pulmonary exacerbation during adolescence <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Vitamin D may be enhancing the immune system to improve production of anti-microbial peptides to clear pathogenic bacterial from the blood and lung. Simoneau et&#x000a0;al. reported vitamin D insufficiency was associated with history of lung colonization with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>
<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In our previously conducted study, we found that a large dose bolus dose of vitamin D given at the time of pulmonary exacerbation of CF resulted in improved 1 year survival, decreased inflammatory cytokines, and a trend towards improvement of repeat pulmonary exacerbations <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p id="p0195">If the bolus dose of vitamin D is demonstrated to be superior to placebo on our primary endpoints, then there may be sufficient evidence to change clinical practice to rapidly correct vitamin D status at the time of pulmonary exacerbation of CF. Additionally, more concerted efforts would be undertaken to ensure vitamin D status is optimized in all children and adults with CF. Depending on our results, our study may also provide support for the hypothesis that vitamin D enhances innate immunity by increasing production of anti-microbial peptides and dampening inflammation which play a role in improving lung function and survival in CF. This study is not designed to determine the optimal concentration of serum 25(OH)D since participants will be given vitamin D or placebo without regard to baseline 25(OH)D concentrations unless they are severely deficient or in the mid upper range of normal. In post-hoc analyses, we will explore whether baseline vitamin D status influences the response to our high dose vitamin D<sub>3</sub> regimen. In addition, we may uncover other unknown effects of CF drug therapies on vitamin D metabolism that render vitamin D ineffective in triggering the innate immune system <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p id="p0200">There remains to be a great deal of enthusiasm for the administration of supplemental high-dose vitamin D to people with CF. Vitamin D has been linked to several other co-morbid conditions common in CF including diabetes and CF bone disease. The overall results of the DISC study will inform whether vitamin D has any impact on markers of innate immunity and inflammation, recovery of lung function, recurrent pulmonary exacerbations, and survival after 1 year following a pulmonary exacerbation of CF.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cutting GR</surname></name></person-group><article-title>Cystic fibrosis genetics: from molecular understanding to clinical application</article-title><source>Nat.
