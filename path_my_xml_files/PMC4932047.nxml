activity and Oswestry Disability Index by inducing trunk muscle activity through
increasing intra-abdominal pressure and activating muscles, contributing to spinal
stability. [Subjects and Methods] This intervention program included 20 male patients with
chronic low back pain. A total of 10 subjects each were randomly assigned to an exhalation
exercise group as the experimental group and a spinal stabilization exercise group as the
control group. [Results] There were significant differences in the activities of the
rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external oblique abdominal, and erector spinae
muscles as well as in the Oswestry Disability Index within the experimental group. There
were meaningful differences in the activities of the rectus abdominis, external oblique
abdominal, and erector spinae muscles and in the Oswestry Disability Index within the
control group. In addition, there was a meaningful intergroup difference in transverse
abdominis muscle activity alone and in the Oswestry Disability Index. [Conclusion] The
breathing exercise effectively increased muscle activity by training gross and fine motor
muscles in the trunk. Moreover, it was verified as a very important element for
strengthening body stability because it both released and prevented low back pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Breathing exercise</kwd><kwd>Chronic low back pain</kwd><kwd>Trunk muscle activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low back pain (LBP) is a representative musculoskeletal disease with a current prevalence
of 60&#x02013;90%; more than 80% people will experience LBP at least once in their lifetime. Among
them, approximately 15% have from chronic LBP<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>LBP occurs when a poor lifestyle weakens the muscular strength of the waist and excessive
loads on and tensions of the muscles create pain. Mediating muscle weakening to stabilize
the trunk is an important aspect in the recovery of body function in patients with LBP<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Structural changes of the waist muscles and
histomorphological changes lead to chronic LBP; in particular, weakening and atrophy is more
common in the muscle fibers that stabilize the waist<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, if pain develops in the muscles, weakening and atrophy
will occur, the ligaments and joints will become stiff, and activity will decrease. A
vicious circle of worsening pain repeats by muscle rigidity and sprain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is important to maintain mechanical alignment
of the trunk muscles to prevent LBP. It is necessary to keep an upright pattern of muscle
activity as well as proper muscle length and strength<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Intra-abdominal pressure that is produced by the connection of
trunk stabilization and respiratory muscles affects waist stability and protects the trunk
muscles<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Effective mediation is
reportedly accomplished using simultaneous breathing exercises to relax excessive muscle
tension<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, if
intra-abdominal pressure increases by diaphragm stimulating activity by performing breathing
exercises, even the pelvic floor muscles will be activated. As such, contraction of the
abdominal muscles during breathing can easily activate even the deep stabilization
muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinicians recognize that
stabilization exercises to strengthen the waist and abdominal muscles are very important.
Mediating breathing exercise activates the trunk muscles more effectively and decreases LBP.
As such, this study intended to induce activity of the trunk muscles that contribute to
spinal stabilization and increase intra-abdominal pressure by performing exhalation
exercises as well as to investigate the effects on trunk muscle activity and Oswestry
Disability Index (ODI) by comparing spinal stabilization and exhalation exercises. We intend
to utilize this exercise method to effectively treat lumbar pain in the future.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were 20 male patients (age 31&#x02013;45&#x02005;years) with chronic LBP who visited B hospital

acute pain, continuous severe pain, spondylolysis, or spondylolisthesis were excluded from
the study. Those who had paresthesia, myoparalysis, or psychological problems as well as

number: 2015-7).</p><p>This study included 20 male patients with chronic LBP, and 10 subjects each were randomly
allocated to the exhalation exercise group (experimental group) and trunk stabilization
group (control group). The intervention program consisted of daily 30-minute sessions once
daily 4 times a week for 6 weeks. The trunk muscle activities and ODI were calculated,
compared, and analyzed before versus after the intervention program by using surface
electromyography (sEMG).</p><p>A surface electromyography (EMG) MP 100 system (Biopac system inc, Goleta, USA) was used to
measure trunk muscle activities, with a sampling rate of 1,000&#x02005;Hz. The frequency band-pass
filter was set at 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. Each subject&#x02019;s hair was removed and dead skin cells were
removed using a thin sandpaper to minimize skin resistance to the EMG signal. The skin was
then cleaned with alcohol-soaked cotton. Two Ag/AgCl surface electrodes were attached to the
belly of each muscle in a direction parallel to the muscular fiber at 2-cm intervals.
Standard electrodes were attached to the spinous process of the 12th thoracic vertebrae and
scapula spine. The EMG signals of the right rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, external
oblique abdominis, and erector spine muscles were collected. The sampling rate for the EMG
signal collection was set to 1,000&#x02005;Hz, the notch filter was set to 60&#x02005;Hz, and the band pass
filter was set to 20&#x02013;450&#x02005;Hz. The signals were converted to root mean square (RMS) values,
and an EMG signal analysis was conducted using Acqknowledge 3.9.1 software (Biopac). EMG
data were collected while the subjects were performing the stabilization exercise and 6 of
the 10 seconds were used.</p><p>Maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) was used to standardize the EMG signal
during the stabilization exercise<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
MVIC of the rectus abdominis muscle was measured in the knee-bent position, with both arms
on the chest and the trunk bent at 45&#x000b0; at maximum resistance. The MVIC of the transverse
abdominis muscle was measured in the knee-bent position, with both arms on the chest and
during sit-ups, twisting the trunk from left to right at maximum resistance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The MVIC of the external oblique
abdominis muscles was measured while rotating the trunk to opposite side with the trunk
bending, while the MVIC of the erector spinae muscles was measured in a prone position, with
both hands on back of the head and the trunk extended at maximum resistance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. MVIC was measured when the researcher
made the subjects perform isometric contraction maximally while a beep was played for 5
seconds. The first and last seconds of the measurements were excluded; thus, a 3-second
measurement was analyzed. The researcher continuously encouraged subjects to maintain a
maximum contraction and the percentage value of the muscle was the highest average value of
3 measurements. The subjects were given a 30-second rest after the MVIC of each muscle was
measured<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The ODI was measured using the Korean version of the ODI to quantify physical difficulties
in daily life due to LBP (Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha=0.92). The original ODI is composed of 10 items
evaluated as 0&#x02013;5 points (low to high severity). In the Korean ODI, considering the Korean
culture, the item about sex life was excluded, so a total of 9 items were evaluated (for a
highest possible score of 45). The total score was divided by number of items &#x000d7;5 and was
expressed as a percentage<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A trunk stabilization exercise, the modifying exercise method of Urquhart et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and Steven et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, which consists of 3 stages<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, was used.

breathing to improve vertebral joint stability and motor control is increasing<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Hodges et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> found that the respiratory muscles are an important factor
affecting spinal stabilization. In particular, if respiratory and abdominal muscle
activities are uncertain, spinal stabilization will decrease due to decreased
intra-abdominal pressure.</p><p>Urquhart et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
activities of the deep abdominal muscles should be evoked using a combination of breathing
and stabilization exercises rather than stabilization exercises alone. Marshall et al.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> classified 20 patients with non-idiopathic
LBP into a stabilization exercise group with abdominal respiration exercise (n=10) and a
general exercise group (n=10) and compared their muscle activity and range of motion. The
muscle activities of the abdominal rectus, external oblique abdominis, and erector spinae
muscle increased, as did range of motion of the waist. This study&#x02019;s findings support
advanced research by drawing a conclusion that the activities of the rectus abdominis,
transverse abdominis, external oblique abdominis, and erector spinae muscles increased in
the experimental group performing breathing exercises. There was a meaningful intergroup
difference in the transverse abdominis alone, in terms of the change of trunk muscle
activities. The transversus abdominis muscle is located in the deepest part of the abdomen
and is called the corset muscle because it plays a role in stabilizing the waist and
creating abdominal pressure owing to being attached to the thoracolumbar fascia. Of all of
the abdominal muscles, the transverse abdominis has the widest and closest attachment to the
thoracolumbar fascia. As such, it is essential to spinal stability.</p><p>Ki and Heo<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> classified 24 patients with
chronic LBP into a spinal stabilization exercise with feedback respiratory exercise group
and a trunk stabilization exercise group that they performed 30&#x02013;45 minutes a session, 3
times a week, for 6 weeks. The spinal stabilization exercise with feedback respiratory
exercise increased stability of the vertebral joints and flexibility of the thoracic
vertebrae more than the spinal stabilization exercise only. Ferreira et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that improvement in transverse
abdominis muscle activity was higer after postural control exercise than after conventional
physiotherapy, targeting 34 patients with chronic LBP. In particular, those findings
supported ours since they showed that the transverse abdominis muscle plays an important
role in controlling vertebral shearing force.</p><p>However, Yoon et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 10
patients with chronic LBP who performed 3 types of stabilization exercises in the
quadrupedal position for 20 minutes and then compared trunk muscle activities. The
activities of the back muscles of the trunk showed a higher increase in the group in which a
hand and a foot were asymmetrically lifted in the quadrupedal position than in the group in
which a hand was lifted in the quadrupedal position or in the group which a foot was lifted
in the quadrupedal position. However, there was no P value for the abdominal muscle
activities. That finding was opposite those of this study. This study induced abdominal
muscle activities using exhalation exercises. However, advanced studies have limited ability
to induce abdominal muscle contractions because most agonists were back muscles of the trunk
when the stabilization exercise was performed in various quadrupedal positions. Niemisto et
al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> found that ODI in the trunk
stabilization exercise group decreased meaningfully when trunk stabilization exercise and
conventional physiotherapy were mediated in 203 subjects with chronic LBP for 3&#x02013;12 months.
Sung<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> found that ODI decreased
meaningfully after mediating spinal stabilization exercise for 4 weeks in 16 subjects with
chronic LBP. Kang and Jeong<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
ODI decreased in a spinal stabilization exercise group as a result of mediating spinal
stabilization exercises for 34 patients with chronic LBP for 4 weeks. This study drew a
conclusion supporting advanced research because there were meaningful differences in ODI.
The reason for this is that the delivery of stimulation on pain receptor tissues such as
those around the spine and articular capsules and ligaments decreases as trunk stabilization
and breathing exercises strengthen the deep stability muscles and it affects abdominal
muscle functional recovery. We found that they are effective to functional disability of LBP
by decreasing the delivery of stimulation to the pain receptor tissue such as that around
the spine and articular capsules and ligaments. Son<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup> found a disability index change, center of body gravity change, and
area decrease in both a spinal stabilization exercise group with abdominal respiration and a
spinal stabilization exercise group; however, no intergroup change was seen. Regardless,
there was a meaningful difference in this study in direct opposition to that of advanced
research. Abdominal respiration mediation in advanced research is a type of breathing
exercise used in the resting state. On the other hand, exhalation exercise is more effective
at reducing ODI because compensation in the lumbar region decreases largely as back and
waist mobility increase. Breathing exercises effectively increase muscle activity due to
training of the gross and fine muscles of the trunk. Since it strengthens the muscles that
stabilize the body, the breathing exercise proved to be a very important element as it
relieves LBP, prevents lumbar pain, and prevents recurrence. Future studies of deep muscle
strengthening are needed to confirm our results.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the SehanUniversity Research Fund in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>CW</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>IS</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>The effect of horse-riding exercise on the balance ability
