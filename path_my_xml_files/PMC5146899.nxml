It provides a link between the dentist&#x02019;s and the dental technician&#x02019;s work for an exact reproduction in the clinical situation. Precision in the impression procedure is a prerequisite for accurate casts and subsequently for the precise fitting of restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Beside the conventional technique in which diverse impression materials are used, currently the digital impression technique is also available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Conventional impression techniques require no special expensive machinery and accurate results can be achieved if working steps are conducted properly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Impression materials frequently used for this technique are polyvinyl siloxane, polyether or polysulfide based materials. For attaining a perfect cast these materials must demonstrate properties like accuracy, elastic recovery and dimensional stability as well as rheological and thixotropic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Various factors like uncontrolled saliva flow during the procedure, undercuts, storing for extended periods of time, moisture, material deformations and incompatibilities with other materials can influence the accuracy of the impression and subsequently lead to inaccuracies and misfit of restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The goal of the initial developments in computer aided design and in the computer aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technologies was to achieve digital intraoral impression techniques that simplify the production process, reduce costs and improve patient comfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The reduction of both intermediate production steps and possible sources of error is of particular clinical importance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore digital intraoral impression allows for a fully digitalized production workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Working steps such as tray selection, tray try out, impression disinfection, transportation, plaster pouring, trimming or articulation can be omitted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover it facilitates not only real-time imaging and chair-side analysis of the preparation but also selective scanning of particular areas, digital archiving and faster communication with the dental lab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the digital production process the preparation is captured by the acquisition unit and converted into geometrical digital data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The subsequent data processing results in a virtual model of the prepared tooth. Based on this virtual model the restoration is first designed and then fabricated in the CAM unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Applying this digital workflow in clinical practice introduces new working steps for both dentist and dental technician that possibly influence the accuracy of the scan and ultimately of the fit of the restorations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The marginal fit in restorations is of utmost importance for their quality and longevity, and was one of the main initial concerns of the CAD/CAM systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The marginal fit is theoretically represented by a linear contact line or a gap-free transition between the preparation and the restoration margin. For clinical use, Christensen et al. concluded that visible margins wider than 39&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m are clinically unacceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, due to various factors, it seems almost impossible to achieve these ideal values in the clinical setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. According to literature, a marginal gap between 50 and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m is considered to be technically feasible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Larger marginal gaps would provide a niche for oral pathogens and saliva, leading to problems like periodontal inflammations, secondary caries as well as cement dissolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>Marginal fit that was considered to be clinically sufficient was achieved when using digital, intraoral impression procedures with the Lava&#x02122; Chairside Oral Scanner (Lava&#x02122; C.O.S., 3&#x000a0;M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However to our knowledge, there are no studies on the marginal fit of cemented zirconia copings using digital, intraoral impression procedures with the Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. in comparison to conventional impression procedures. Therefore we investigated the marginal fit of cemented zirconia copings manufactured after digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. in comparison to conventional impressions with polyvinyl siloxane. The analyses are based on optical microscope pictures and scanning electron microscope pictures, respectively. Furthermore, the results gained by the optical microscope and the scanning electron microscope were compared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the marginal fit of cemented zirconia copings manufactured after digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. in comparison to conventional impressions with polyvinyl siloxane. A flowchart of the experimental procedures is given in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. One typodont plastic tooth (left first molar, KaVo Dental, Biberach/Ri&#x000df;, Germany) was prepared with a circumferential reduction of 0.8&#x02013;1.2&#x000a0;mm, occlusal reduction of 1.5&#x000a0;mm, chamfer finish line of 0.8&#x000a0;mm and convergence angle of the axial walls of 6&#x000b0;. The master die was replicated 40 times using a high quality vinyl silicone (DUOSIL D, SHERA Werkstoff-Technologie, Lemf&#x000f6;rde, Germany) and highly precise model resin (Mirapont<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Hager &#x00026; Werken, Duisburg, Germany). Afterwards, the replicated dies were randomly divided into two groups according to the impression-taking technique (digital or conventional). The dies of each group were fixed in plaster blocks (five dies in each block) and marked in order to facilitate the identification in further steps.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Experimental design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2016_323_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Conventional impressions were taken with a polyvinyl siloxane impression material (Imprint II Garant&#x000ae;, 3&#x000a0;M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) in a one-step technique using individual trays fabricated with cold-curing material (SR Ivolen, Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein). The impressions were inspected by the same operator under a microscope at 10&#x000d7; magnification (Stemi DV4 Spot, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany) and then poured with a type IV plaster (SHERAHARD-ROCK, SHERA Werkstoff-Technologie, Lemf&#x000f6;rde, Germany). From the plaster models a saw-cut model was fabricated and each of the plaster model dies was individually digitalized with a laboratory dental scanner (3Shape Scanner D700, Wieland Dental&#x02009;+&#x02009;Technik, Pforzheim, Germany).</p><p>Digital impressions were taken with the Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. (Software version 3.0.2), an intra-oral digitizing system that creates the impressions by means of continuous 3D video images. These video images are possible due to three sensors that simultaneously capture the dies from three different perspectives. The dies were slightly dusted with titanium oxide powder for optical scanning (Lava&#x02122; Powder for Chairside Oral Scanner, 3&#x000a0;M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) with the corresponding sprayer (Lava&#x02122; Sprayer, 3&#x000a0;M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) directly before the scanning process. The data sets were sent to the company 3&#x000a0;M ESPE via Internet and were made available for download in the Lava C.O.S. Lab Software (3&#x000a0;M ESPE, Seefeld, Germany) 24&#x000a0;h later. The dies were then virtually cut and marked.</p><p>Scanned data from the digital and conventional group were transmitted to the 3Shape DentalDesigner&#x02122; software (Wieland Dental&#x02009;+&#x02009;Technik, Pforzheim, Germany) in order to design the copings. The marginal fitting parameters were set to 0.01&#x000a0;mm thickness to a level of 1&#x000a0;mm above the margin and the cement space was set to 0.04&#x000a0;mm. The data of the virtually constructed copings were then transferred into the Zenotec CAM basic software V 2.2.17 (Wieland Dental&#x02009;+&#x02009;Technik, Pforzheim, Germany) for computation of the milling paths and the milling strategies. The milling process took place in a ZENOTEC mini milling machine (Wieland Dental&#x02009;+&#x02009;Technik, Pforzheim, Germany) from a Zenostar Zr Translucent blank (Wieland Dental&#x02009;+&#x02009;Technik, Pforzheim, Germany). The enlarged copings were sintered in a Cercon&#x000ae; heat plus furnace (DeguDent GmbH, Germany) for 8&#x000a0;h at 1350&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The copings of both groups were placed on their respective dies and checked for irregularities under a microscope at 10x magnification (Stemi DV4 Spot, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Jena, Germany).</p><p>For cementation, the copings were seated on their respective dies using zinc oxide phosphate cement (HOFFMANN&#x02019;S CEMENT quick setting, Hoffmann Dental Manufaktur, Berlin, Germany) after try on. The copings were held under constant finger pressure for 10&#x02013;15 min until the cement was set. The cement was mixed to the manufacturer&#x02019;s specified powder/liquid ratio with a spatula on the rough side of a pre-cooled mixing glass slab to a fixation consistency. After removing the cement residues from the margins the dies were detached from the plaster blocks.</p><p>After 24&#x000a0;h all specimens were dehydrated and degreased in absolute ethanol for 2&#x000a0;days and subsequently infiltrated with a light-curing resin (Technovit 7200&#x000ae;, Kulzer &#x00026; Co., Wehrheim, Germany) in ascending grades of ethanol/resin mixtures. Finally the specimens were embedded in pure resin. Each embedded specimen was cut in mesio distal direction with a diamond-coated band saw (EXAKT 300, Exakt, Norderstedt, Germany) for obtaining two parts of the same size.</p><p>Thin ground sections of approximately 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m thickness were prepared from one half of the specimen using the cutting-grinding technique of Donath [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] for the measurements using the optical microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus, Japan) Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>). Images with a resolution of 0.16&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m per pixel were captured on 40x magnification using the Olympus dotSlide 2.4 - digital microscopy system (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

</p><p>The remaining half of the dissected ceramic specimens was prepared for measurements using the TM-1000 tabletop scanning electron microscope; Hitachi, Krefeld, Germany Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). Images in 200&#x000d7;, 300&#x000d7;, and 400&#x000d7; magnification were taken and analyzed using the Hitachi&#x02019;s SEM software Ver. 03&#x02013;02.</p><p>Marginal gap (MG) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref> (b) and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref> (b)) and the absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>. (a) and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">B</xref> (a)), were measured in accordance with Holmes et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Marginal gap is defined as the perpendicular distance between the internal surface of the restoration and the preparation line for overextended copings or the perpendicular distance from the restoration margin to the tooth surface for underextended copings. The absolute marginal discrepancy represents the distance between the restoration margin and the preparation line. By rounded preparation margins the measuring point was determined by extending the main contours of the die and drawing an angle bisector as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>

</p><p>For both groups on each specimen MG and AMD were measured with an optical microscope and SEM on the mesial and distal aspect (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The values for either MG or AMD for the mesial and distal aspect of each slice were summed up and mean values for MG and AMD were calculated. Consequently, the groups were as follows: i) AMD OM, ii) AMD SEM, iii) MG OM and iv) MG SEM.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>

</p><p>Five additional dies and their respective copings were manufactured in order to compare the results of MG and AMD when another technique, namely the replica technique was used. For this a light body silicone impression material (Imprint II Garant&#x000ae;, Light Body) was used to fill the copings before they were seated on the respective dies by applying constant finger pressure simulating the cementation process. After five minutes the copings were removed together with the adhered impression material, which indicates the gap between die and coping. To be able to perform the measurements of MG and AMD a regular body material with a different colour (Imprint II Garant&#x000ae;, Regular Body) was placed in the copings. After setting the silicone replicas were removed, sectioned in a mesio distal direction and the MG and the AMD were measured using the optical microscope. Since the replica technique is a non-destructive method for both, the dies and the copings, MG and AMD could be also measured after cementation using the zinc oxide phosphate cement as described above.</p><p>For each of the measurements (AMD OM, AMD SEM, MG OM and MG SEM) Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic>-tests between the digital and conventional technique were performed. Statistical outcome was adjusted for multiple testing using Holm&#x02019;s method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to assess agreement of SEM and optical measurements. R 2.15.1 (R Core Team 2012) and ggplot2 0.9.2.1 were used for all computations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Results</title><p>Altogether 306 measurements were collected. 14 measuring locations were excluded (6 from the conventional and 8 from the digital group) because of damages on the slice surface.</p><p>The mean values for MG in the digital group were 96.28&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m measured with the optical microscope and 99.27&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m measured with the SEM, respectively.

The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the fit of cemented zirconia copings manufactured after a digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. with copings manufactured after conventional impression. In this study the measurements of the marginal gap (MG) and of the absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD) with an optical microscope and a SEM showed no significant difference between the digital and the conventional impression technique group. Furthermore mean MG values of the copings for both groups were smaller than 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, showing clinically acceptable margins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Calculation of the intra class correlation coefficient showed a relatively high value of 0.921, which suggests similarity of measurements with the optical and the SE-microscope.</p><p>It is difficult to compare the results of this study with recent literature due to differences in measuring techniques and measuring parameters used for the evaluation of fit of fixed dental restorations. An in vivo study evaluating the Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. showed significantly better fit of crowns in favor of the digital impression. Median marginal gap was 49&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m compared to 74&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m for the conventional group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Compared to the abovementioned study, in the present in vitro trial the median marginal gap for the digital group was 79.57&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m measured with the optical microscope and 88.02&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m with the SEM. First thoughts were that the main reason for the elevated values in the present study was the cementation of the copings with zinc phosphate cement, which might have elevated the marginal parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] especially since the measurements in the abovementioned studies were performed using the silicone replica method. The results of fit using this method depend on the viscosity of the selected silicone material and cannot totally reproduce the thickness of ZnO phosphate cement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In order to verify this idea additional experiments were performed comparing the marginal parameters when the replica technique was used with the cemented copings. Contrary to expectations, MG and AMD showed similar results when using the replica technique and the cementation technique. Nevertheless this is in accordance with studies by Rahme et al., showing that the marginal fit was similar after using the replica technique and after cementation with glass-ionomer cement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another study investigating inter alia the marginal fit after using the replica technique compared to cemented samples also showed no significant differences, reporting values of about 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m independent of the technique, which is also in accordance with the values of the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In another in vitro study a travelling microscope and digital micrometer heads were used to evaluate the influence of conventional and digital impressioning techniques on the accessible marginal inaccuracies (AMI) of crowns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Crowns manufactured after digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. showed an AMI value of 48 (&#x000b1;25) &#x003bc;m, which is in accordance with the studies named above. In a further study 3D and 2D assessment of the marginal gap was conducted on crowns produced after conventional and digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A new method with a precise scanner and best fitting algorithm software was used for the measurements. The Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. group showed mean 3D values for MG of 84&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m and mean 2D values of 74&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m, similar to the MG results of the presented study, which are reported to fit the clinical acceptable range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The higher values of the AMD could be explained by the fact that the AMD reflects the total misfit, which also includes horizontal discrepancies, while the MG only measures the vertical discrepancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>The impressions and the manufacture of the copings in the present study were performed under laboratory conditions, so the influence of difficulties such as subgingival preparation margins, blood and saliva contamination, or the reaction of the patient to the digital or conventional impression cannot be taken into consideration. Furthermore the marginal gap (MG) and the absolute marginal discrepancy (AMD) measured on the copings in this study are not a direct evaluation of the accuracy of the impression method but rather an examination of the whole working process from preparation up to cementation. Possible errors on each part of the manufacturing process, such as setting of the milling parameters, designing and sintering shrinkage have direct influence on the marginal fit. In order to simulate the clinical situation the cement mixing procedure and the cementation of the copings were performed manually accepting a non perfectly standardized procedure. Ditto for the replica technique constant finger pressure was used to seat the copings on the respective dies.</p><p>Another limitation of our study was the section of the copings in the mesio-distal direction, which made available only two points of the circumference of the die for the measurement process. Thus, besides the samples were destroyed and not available for repeated measurements it was not possible to evaluate the level of fit at the whole circumference whereby larger values of the MG and AMD could be missed. Therefore further studies visualizing and measuring the whole marginal and cement gap using non-invasive methods such as micro computed tomography or virtual fit assessment should be performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of this in vitro study we can conclude that:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Copings manufactured after digital impression with Lava&#x02122; C.O.S. show comparable marginal parameters with the copings manufactured after conventional impression with polyvinyl syloxane.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The mean marginal gap values of the digital and the conventional group fit in the clinically acceptable range.</p></list-item></list>
