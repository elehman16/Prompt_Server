This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of spontaneous dental sensitivity and tooth sensitivity to cold produced through a thermal stimulus during and after whitening with carbamide peroxide, with or without oxalate.</p><p>The hypotheses tested were: (1) dental bleaching performed with carbamide peroxide with potassium oxalate added would reduce the intensity of spontaneous dental sensitivity, and (2) increase the dental sensitivity threshold under cold stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>This clinical trial was approved by the Committee of Ethics in Research (00278/2011) and is registered in the Registro Brasileiro de Ensaios Cl&#x000ed;nicos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br">http://www.ensaiosclinicos.gov.br</ext-link>; register number: RBR- 4m94g4). The study was a randomized, split-mouth design, double-blinded and factorial clinical trial. The factors studied were: (1) two levels of bleaching treatment including 10% carbamide peroxide, and 10% carbamide peroxide containing potassium oxalate, and (2) six evaluating times including baseline, 24 h, 7, 14 and 21 days after the beginning of the treatment, as well as 7 days after the conclusion of the treatment.</p><p>Sample size was calculated for superiority trial, because we wanted to detect if one bleaching product would be more effective in reducing the intensity of the tooth sensitivity than the other. Furthermore, we considered the outcome intensity of tooth sensitivity for the sample size calculation and the variation used for this purpose was 5%.</p><p>We used a statistics calculator and it was considered the type-I error rate (&#x003b1;=5%) &#x02014; the probability of finding a difference when a difference does not exist; type-II error rate (&#x003b2;=20%) &#x02014; the probability of not detecting a difference when one actually exists, a 5% level of significance, which means that the chance of the finding being true is 95%; and a power of the test of 80%, which means that, if indeed there is any difference, the probability of detecting it will be 80%. Thus, the minimal sample size required was 10.</p></sec><sec><title>Volunteer selection</title><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The volunteers were healthy individuals between 18 and 25 years of age, who presented healthy oral soft tissues and vital maxillary lateral incisors with no carious or non-carious lesions and the baseline tooth color A3, according to the Vitapan Classical Shade Guide scale (Vita Zahnfabrik; Bad S&#x000e4;ckingen, Baden-W&#x000fc;rttemberg, Germany).</p><p>Conversely, smokers, pregnant women, those who used braces, had received prior bleaching treatment, reported past adverse reaction to peroxides, were using opioids, were pacemaker patients, presented neurological, chronic or acute diseases, tooth sensitivity or treatment history of tooth sensitivity, dentin exposure, conoid teeth, direct or indirect restorations in the region of interest, tetracycline, injury, fluorosis or unknown staining, etiologies were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study groups</title><p>Thirty patients were recruited for the research, however, five of them did not meet the inclusion criteria. Thus, 25 volunteers underwent both bleaching treatments using products containing the same hydrogen peroxide concentration (10%). The treatment used in each hemi-arch was randomly determined by lottery. Thus, in one maxillary hemi-arch, Power Bleaching Gel 10% (BM4-Brazil Ltda. Materials and Instrumental; Palho&#x000e7;a, Santa Catarina, Brazil), which contains potassium oxalate, was used. The other maxillary hemi-arch was treated with Opalescence 10% (Ultradent Products Inc.; South Jordan, Utah, United States of America). Both bleaching products were dispensed in 3 ml-disposable opaque luer-lock syringes and randomly identified with codes A and B. The patients were told to use approximately 0.1 ml of the product in the area corresponding to the buccal surface of each tooth inside the tray. A researcher who did not participate in the clinical phase of the experiment performed the product and application drawings, so both volunteers and operators were not aware of the treatment they were undergoing in each hemi-arch.</p></sec><sec><title>Bleaching treatments</title><p>Bleaching treatment was performed at the University Dentistry Clinic. Superior dental arch impressions were taken using alginate Jeltrate (Dentsply; Mildford, Delaware, United States of America) to obtain stone molds. The vestibular surface of the molds was coated with nail varnish, except for the last teeth of the arch. Over this mold a 1-mm-thick, 100% ethylene copolymer and vinyl acetate tray was fabricated for each volunteer in a vacuum-forming machine Plastvac P7 (Bio-art Equip. Odontol. Ltda.; S&#x000e3;o Carlos, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). The trays were extended to the first molars, and cut at the marginal gingiva level. Each hemi-arch was randomly labeled with codes A and B to guide the volunteers to the correct use of the intended product in the proper quadrant. The volunteers were instructed to deposit one drop of the product on the bottom of the tray for each tooth to be bleached. The tray was then applied to the maxillary arch, and the excess product was removed with a toothbrush or gauze. The volunteers were informed of the dosage, and received a syringe of each product, which was applied daily for 4 h over the following three weeks. They were also instructed to use the trays during the afternoon, and to avoid brushing the teeth before that. All patients received oral hygiene kits to standardize the toothbrush and Oral B Pro-Sa&#x000fa;de toothpaste (Procter &#x00026; Gamble Manufactura; Naucalpan de Ju&#x000e1;rez, State of Mexico, Mexico) with fluoride in the composition. All treatments were monitored, since the volunteer returned to the clinic once a week.</p></sec><sec><title>Spontaneous tooth sensitivity during and after treatment</title><p>Spontaneous sensitivity was evaluated using a pain visual analogue scale two times a day, before and after the bleaching procedure. An intensity scale ranging from 0 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) was established.</p><fig id="f1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Scores related to the intensity of dental sensitivity</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-7757-jaos-26-e20170284-gf01"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Cold sensation on the teeth threshold analysis</title><p>The analysis of cold sensation on the teeth was performed at the University Dentistry Clinic, in a calm and controlled environment at room temperature, at the six pre-determined evaluating times on the upper lateral incisors. For this procedure, a TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer (Medoc; Ramat Yishai, Northern District, Israel) containing a delicate intraoral thermode was positioned in the flat region of the tooth surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>). To standardize the dental region to be examined, a new 100% ethylene copolymer and vinyl acetate tray was manufactured in the same way described above. Each tray had circular perforations with a diameter similar to the active tip of the intraoral thermode. The perforations were done on the buccal tooth surface, on the flattest area of the teeth. Prior to analysis 0.02 mL of a thermally conductive paste containing a silver oxide base IPT - Implastec Thermal Grease (Implastec Ltda Electrochemical; Votorantim, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil) at room temperature were applied in this are to optimize thermal conduction.</p><fig id="f2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Scheme of the neurosensory analysis using the equipment TSA II</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="1678-7757-jaos-26-e20170284-gf02"/></fig><p>The test was performed in a dental office between 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m., in a quiet environment with a constant temperature of 26&#x000b0;C. To verify the cold sensation threshold (CST), the TSA II analyzer was configured in the &#x0201c;Limits&#x0201d; function, where three tests with descending temperatures (from 36&#x000b0;C to 0&#x000b0;C) were performed at each time of evaluation. Thus, three temperatures were recorded, and the average temperature was used as the result. Each test initiated at 36&#x000b0;C, with a temperature cooling speed rate of 1&#x000b0;C/s. When the thermal stimulus was detected, it was immediately interrupted by the patient. After that happened the temperature detection was recorded, and from that point forward, the temperature was gradually increased until the comfort temperature (36&#x000b0;C) was restored. This temperature remained constant for 20 s, and another analysis took place. All analyses were performed three times.</p></sec><sec><title>Computerized Visual Analogue Scale (CoVAS)</title><p>To evaluate dental sensitivity during the bleaching treatment in the six pre-set study periods, the Computerized Visual Analogue Scale (CoVAS) (Medoc; Ramat Yishai, Northern District, Israel), which is part of the TSA-II Neurosensory Analyzer hardware accessories package, was used in real time, after the dental cold sensation threshold analysis. A constant thermal stimulus (0&#x000b0;C) was applied to the upper lateral incisors for 15 seconds. During this period, the volunteer recorded the intensity of discomfort experienced on a scale of 0 to 100, using a manualcontrolled potentiometer. The responses obtained were synchronized, to compare the dental sensitivity generated by the different treatments in individual volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical analysis of gingival condition</title><p>The clinical analyses of periodontal condition were performed once a week during all treatments. For this purpose, a dental mirror and artificial light were used. During the procedure, the presence or absence of bleaching-related gingival irritation around the teeth that underwent the bleaching procedure was evaluated, and the following scores were assigned: (0) healthy gingiva or (1) gingiva altered by erythema, swelling, bleeding, or a shiny surface.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The spontaneous sensitivity was recorded before and after the bleaching treatment and ranked, according to previously established scores to determine the results.

Consequently, we can infer that the presence of this salt may be a primary cause of the irritation. Another hypothesis to consider is the pH difference between the bleaching products used. Although the two products had pH values close to neutral, the bleaching agent that contained oxalate was slightly more acidic. However, although there are reports of gingiva sensitivity during the bleaching treatment, there are no reports of the bleaching treatment causing severe harm to the gingiva<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
