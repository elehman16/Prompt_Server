Biomechanical stresses are associated with waking cervical symptoms. This paper adds to the scant body of research investigating whether different pillow types produce different types and frequencies of waking symptoms in asymptomatic subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A random-allocation block-design blinded field trial was conducted in a large South Australian regional town. Subjects were side-sleepers using one pillow only, and not receiving treatment for cervicothoracic problems. Waking cervical stiffness, headache and scapular/arm pain were recorded daily. Five experimental pillows (polyester, foam regular, foam contour, feather, and latex) were each trialed for a week. Subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow was the control (a baseline week, and a washout week between each experimental pillow trial week). Subjects reported waking symptoms related to known factors (other than the pillow), and subjects could &#x02018;drop out&#x02019; of any trial pillow week.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Disturbed sleep unrelated to the pillow was common. Waking symptoms occurring at least once in the baseline week were reported by approximately 20% of the subjects on their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. The feather trial pillow performed least well, producing the highest frequency of waking symptoms, while the latex pillow performed best. The greatest number of &#x02018;drop outs&#x02019; occurred on the feather pillow. The foam contour pillow performed no better than the foam regular pillow.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>&#x02018;Own&#x02019; pillows did not guarantee symptom-free waking, and thus were a questionable control. The trial pillows had different waking symptom profiles. Latex pillows can be recommended over any other type for control of waking headache and scapular/arm pain.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pillow type</kwd><kwd>cervical stiffness</kwd><kwd>arm pain</kwd><kwd>headache</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The main role of a pillow during sleep is to support the cervical spine in a neutral position.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-3-137">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jpr-3-137">6</xref> This prevents adoption of more &#x02018;end-range&#x02019; cervical spine postures during sleep, which are believed to increase biomechanical stresses on cervical spine structures.

However, there is scant research on the effect of different pillow types on the production of waking symptoms in healthy subjects. Consequently different pillow types have proliferated in the market place over recent years, with accompanying but variably-evidenced claims that they produce symptom-free sleep, no waking symptoms, and/or high quality sleep experiences.</p><p>Our telephone survey of over 800 randomly-selected participants without diagnosed cervical problems in a large South Australian rural town (9.6% total town population), identified a surprisingly high frequency of waking symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-3-137">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-jpr-3-137">13</xref> At least once in a usual week, 27% reported waking with scapular or arm pain, 19% with a headache, and 17% with cervical pain and/or stiffness.

Over the next 9 weeks, subjects in each treatment-administration block tested the trial pillows for 7 consecutive nights each, interspersed by 7 night&#x02019;s sleep on their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. Returning to their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow for 1 week between using each trial pillow provided a &#x02018;washout period&#x02019;, allowing subjects to return to their &#x02018;normal&#x02019; waking symptom state.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jpr-3-137">17</xref> Subjects were encouraged to test each trial pillow for the whole 7 nights, unless symptom production, or lack of sleep, necessitated cessation of its use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Invalid data</title><p>Throughout the trial, data relating to the occasions on which subjects reported the presence of waking symptoms associated with identifiable causes (other than the pillow) were excluded from analyses.

It considers commonalities of responses across the trial pillows compared with responses to subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. Data were described in symptom categories per pillow, age and gender. Multivariate ANOVA models were used to test the significance of the effect of the block order of administration of trial pillows, age, gender and pillow type on waking symptom production (any, and weekly symptom duration scores). The likelihood of each symptom occurring on the trial pillows was considered in 2 ways, and reported as odds ratios (ORs, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]). Firstly, each trial pillow was compared with subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow for any, versus no, waking symptoms, as well as symptom clusters (short-term versus longer-term waking symptoms). Secondly the association was considered between the trial pillows and any waking symptom production, arbitrarily using the polyester pillow as the default comparator.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>One hundred six subjects commenced the study. Seven participants withdrew completely from the trial at various points throughout the subsequent 9 weeks: 3 due to production of cervicothoracic symptoms while trialing the feather pillow, and single participants due to emergency lumbar spine surgery following a fall, transfer from town for work purposes, a loss of interest in participating while trialing their usual pillow, and death of a spouse. There were also dropouts for each trial pillow. The sample demographics and the completions for each trial pillow week are outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-3-137">Figure 1</xref>.</p><sec><title>Demographics</title><p>There was congruence between gender and age distribution in the study sample, and the population characteristics of the rural town.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-jpr-3-137">16</xref> The findings are therefore generalizable to the wider Australian population.</p></sec><sec><title>Identifiable reason for waking symptoms</title><p>The number of valid and excluded observations for analysis for each pillow accounted for any night of identifiable reasons (other than the pillow) for waking symptoms (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-3-137">Figure 1</xref>). These included the effects of alcohol, illness, wakeful spouse, children, pets, weather or external noises. There was no significant difference between pillows, gender or age groups regarding the excluded observations. The daily reports of known reasons for waking symptoms were greatest for subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, followed by the feather pillow.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study completions</title><p>All subjects completed the initial &#x02018;own pillow&#x02019; trial week. However the number of subjects who completed each pillow trial varied, with the feather pillow having the lowest percentage of completers (67.3%) and latex pillow having the highest percentage of completers (97%) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-3-137">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Block design effect</title><p>There was no significant effect of the order of administration of the trial pillows on any symptoms, which suggests that subjects responded similarly to each trial pillow irrespective of the order in which they were tested.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline symptom reports</title><p>When using their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, 33.9% subjects reported any waking cervical stiffness, 19.6% reported any waking headache and 17.9% reported any waking scapular/arm pain (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-3-137">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Waking cervical stiffness</title><p>There was no significant effect of gender or age on weekly symptom duration scores for waking cervical stiffness (critical F values <sub>df=2</sub> 0.97 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) and <sub>df=1</sub> 0.06 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) respectively). However there was a significant effect of pillow (critical F value<sub>df5</sub> 3.25 (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05)) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-3-137">Table 1</xref>). The largest weekly symptom duration score for waking stiffness occurred during the feather pillow trial, and significantly more subjects reported sustaining occasional half-day stiffness after sleeping on this pillow (considering symptom duration clusters). The likelihood of any reports of waking cervical stiffness occurring on subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow compared with the trial pillows, as well as symptom duration clusters of short-term versus longer-term stiffness, is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-3-137">Table 2</xref>. These findings highlight the significant effect of the feather pillow on any occurrence of waking cervical stiffness, compared with subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. It also indicates that once stiffness occurred, whatever subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, the trial polyester, foam contour and feather pillows were significantly associated with longer symptom duration. When compared to the polyester pillow, no other trial pillow showed an elevated risk of waking cervical stiffness (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-3-137">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Headache</title><p>The percentage of subjects with valid observations who reported any waking headache on any pillow is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-3-137">Table 1</xref>. There were significant effects of gender, age and pillow on waking headache weekly duration scores (critical F values <sub>df=2</sub> 3.4, <sub>df=1</sub> 7.8, and <sub>df=5</sub> 2.7 respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 in each instance). The significant differences occurred between the feather and latex pillows. These findings were congruent with those for stiffness, where the feather pillow was by far the most problematic. Fewer subjects reported being headache-free when trialing the feather pillow, and significantly more subjects reported being headache-free when trialing the latex pillow. The significant gender effect was explained by the finding that 2 women to every man reported a waking headache on any trial pillow. The age effect for waking headache was less clear, although for each experimental pillow, a higher frequency of middle-aged subjects (aged 40&#x02013;59 years) consistently reported no waking headache, compared with the other age groups. Younger subjects consistently reported more waking headaches on their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow and all trial pillows except latex, than the other age groups (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-3-137">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The likelihood of any reports of headache occurring on subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow compared with the trial pillows is reported as crude and adjusted ORs and 95% CI in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-3-137">Table 3</xref>. The crude findings were adjusted for the effects of age and gender, as both had significant univariate associations with frequency of occurrence. The feather pillow produced a significantly greater likelihood of any event of waking headache occurring compared with subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. There were no other significant associations, although there was an emergent protective effect of latex pillows compared with &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, highlighted by the Upper 95% CI just spanning one (1.1). Once a headache occurred however, none of the pillows mitigated against headache duration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-3-137">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>Only the latex pillow showed a significantly protective crude association for headache compared with the polyester trial pillow (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-3-137">Table 3</xref>). This association was sustained after adjusting for gender and age. Once a headache occurred however, the type of trial pillow made no difference to headache duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Scapular/arm pain</title><p>The least number of subjects reported being free of scapular/arm pain on waking on the feather pillow, whilst the greatest number reported being pain-free when waking on the latex pillow (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-3-137">Table 1</xref>). Subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow and the regular foam pillow also produced low numbers of reports of waking scapular/arm pain. There were significant effects of gender and pillow on scapular/arm pain weekly duration scores (critical F value <sub>df=1</sub> 7.9 and 3.4 <sub>df=5</sub> respectively). The significant gender effect was produced by the male&#x02013;female differences in weekly duration scores for scapular/arm pain for the foam regular, foam contour and feather pillows (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jpr-3-137">Figure 3</xref>). More women reported waking scapular/arm pain than men on these pillows, with the feather pillow producing the greatest gender effect.</p><p>The likelihood of any scapular/arm pain of any duration, occurring on subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, compared with the trial pillows is reported as crude and adjusted ORs (95% CI) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-3-137">Table 4</xref>. The crude association was adjusted for gender because of its significant univariate association with scapular/arm pain. The feather pillow was significantly more likely to be associated with any waking scapular/arm pain, compared with subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow. However no trial pillow was associated with symptom duration compared with &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow.</p><p>The latex trial pillow had a significantly protective crude association with scapular/arm pain compared with the polyester trial pillow. However the significant effect was lost when the association was adjusted for gender, and there was no differential effect of any trial pillow on scapular/arm pain duration (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-3-137">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper provides the first known information about the association of different pillow shapes and fillers with waking symptoms of stiffness, headache and scapular/arm pain in side sleepers without cervicothoracic spine injury. Our findings suggest that a feather pillow should not be recommended if individuals seek a pillow better than their &#x02018;own&#x02019; to reduce the frequency and duration of waking stiffness, headache and/or scapular/arm pain. Polyester and foam contour pillows should not be recommended to subjects who suffer from waking cervical stiffness. However, latex pillows can be recommended when subjects seek to decrease waking headache or scapular/arm pain. Foam pillows (contour and regular shaped) were similarly associated with waking headache and scapular/arm pain. Hence, recommendation of a foam contour pillow over a foam regular pillow for side sleepers with these symptoms is inappropriate. The benefits of a latex pillow for minimizing waking headache and scapular/arm pain, and heightened symptom occurrence with feather pillows, concurs with our previous findings for waking cervical pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-jpr-3-137">14</xref></p><p>These findings are congruent with recent research into the effect of pillows on symptomatic cervical spines, as a pillow moulded to, or specifically supportive of, the neck, was found to be protective of waking pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-jpr-3-137">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jpr-3-137">10</xref></p><sec><title/><sec sec-type="results"><title>Invalid findings</title><p>Reasons for waking symptoms (other than the pillow) were consistently reported over the study period.

Whilst this highlights that sleep is regularly disturbed for a high percentage of uninjured people, it also raises concerns that subjects were perhaps most aware of classifying reasons for waking symptoms on their &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow at study commencement, rather than later in the study period, when they may have been more focused on trial pillow performance.</p></sec><sec><title>Drop outs</title><p>All study dropouts occurred before the fifth trial day, and hence 7 days appears to be a suitable period for an experimental pillow study. The &#x02018;washout period&#x02019; of &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow use for 7 days between experimental pillows also appeared to be appropriate to reduce trial pillow symptoms and participant fatigue. Despite the high number of drop-outs on the feather pillow, the total number of valid observations on this pillow collated over the trial week exceeded the estimated sample size for robust observations on any one pillow (500), thus alleviating concerns about appropriate power to detect differences between pillows.</p></sec><sec><title>Symptom reports</title><p>Other than our previous work, little has been reported on the prevalence of waking stiffness and scapular/arm pain. However, Jull et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-3-137">18</xref> reported that 58% of cervicogenic headache sufferers reported their headache on waking. Our study could not determine the anatomical mechanisms underlying waking headache, stiffness or scapular/arm symptoms. Waking symptom causality is likely to be complex and involve increased biomechanical load on more than one anatomical structure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-3-137">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-3-137">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-jpr-3-137">18</xref> Our findings provide support for the need for targeted laboratory research to establish the anatomical structures and biomechanical mechanisms underlying waking symptoms, and how pillow type contributes to this. Moreover, as latex pillows appear to be consistently effective in reducing the frequency of any waking symptom in a noninjured population, trials of this pillow for symptomatic subjects is now indicated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study biases</title><p>Despite using a rigorous research design to reduce bias from measurement or allocation to pillows, limitations of this study included an inability to completely blind subjects to pillow type, reliance on daily self-report measures of symptom occurrence and duration, and limited information about subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillows. A high number of waking symptom reports on subjects&#x02019; &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillows may have been related to increased vigilance in responses during the first week of the trial, or may simply validate the previously reported, high percentage of noninjured healthy people who experience regular waking symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-3-137">11</xref> If increased vigilance were the reason for high frequency reports of waking symptoms on &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, then reports of waking symptoms on the subsequent trial pillows may have been related to reasons other than the pillow, but were ascribed to the pillow as a result of expectation or anticipation bias.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jpr-3-137">19</xref> The potential for over- and under-reporting of symptoms during the trial pillow weeks should also be considered. Thus further pillow field trials should be undertaken with randomly selected subjects, whose &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillows are well described, with predetermined sensitivities to different trial pillows because of their choice of &#x02018;own&#x02019; pillow, and who provide greater detail on their usual sleep behaviors and waking symptoms.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study highlights the common nature of sleep disturbance in the never-injured population, and the variability of waking symptoms related to different pillow types. The study findings indicate the consistently good performance of latex pillows in reducing the frequency of waking headache and scapular/arm pain, and thus these pillows should be recommended to reduce waking symptoms. Feather pillows should not be recommended as they are associated with greater likelihood of waking symptoms.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-jpr-3-137"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>McDonnell</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Sleep posture: its implications</article-title><source>Br J Phys Med</source><year>1946</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>46</fpage><lpage>52</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21028552</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2-jpr-3-137"><label>2.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><source>The Cervical Spine</source><edition>3rd ed</edition><publisher-loc>Springfield, Il</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Charles C.
