OTEMTO&#x000ae; 1 and 2 were two replicate, 12-week, Phase III studies investigating the benefit of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol on lung function and quality of life in patients with moderate to severe disease. <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses were performed to assess the benefits for patients according to disease severity and treatment history.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Four subgroup analyses were performed: Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2/3, GOLD A/B/C/D, treatment naive/not treatment naive and receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) at baseline/not receiving ICS at baseline. Primary end points were change in forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) area under the curve from 0 to 3&#x000a0;h response, change in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) focal score was a secondary end point, and SGRQ and TDI responder analyses were further end points; all were assessed at 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In all subgroups, patients receiving tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol responded better overall than those receiving tiotropium monotherapy. Improvements with tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol over placebo or tiotropium monotherapy were noted across GOLD 2/3 and GOLD A/B/C/D; however, improvements in SGRQ total score were most evident in the GOLD B subgroup. Moreover, lung-function outcomes were generally greater in those patients who had been receiving previous long-acting bronchodilator and/or ICS maintenance treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol should be considered as a treatment option in patients with moderate COPD who are initiating maintenance therapy, as well as those with more severe disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01964352">NCT01964352</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02006732">NCT02006732</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12931-016-0387-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>Long-acting bronchodilator</kwd><kwd>Tiotropium</kwd><kwd>Olodaterol</kwd><kwd>Severity</kwd><kwd>Treatment history</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008349</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The use of long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) is central to the pharmacological management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The aim of treatment is to improve lung function, reduce symptoms and risk of exacerbations, and improve health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Tiotropium is an established once-daily LAMA that improves lung function, patient-reported outcomes such as dyspnoea and quality of life, and reduces exacerbations in patients with COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The combination of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol has been extensively studied in a large Phase III clinical trial programme that demonstrated improvements in lung function and patient-reported outcomes compared to tiotropium monotherapy, with tolerability similar to tiotropium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recent <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the TONADO&#x000ae; studies showed that tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol significantly improved lung function in Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) severity groups 2, 3 and 4, compared to monotherapy, irrespective of whether patients had received prior LAMA or LABA maintenance treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The OTEMTO&#x000ae; studies were two replicate, randomised, double-blind, Phase III studies investigating the effects of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol on lung function and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Unlike the TONADO&#x000ae; trials, OTEMTO&#x000ae; included a placebo arm as well as tiotropium as an active comparator in order to properly understand the effect size of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol on patient-reported outcomes. Overall, tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol was superior to tiotropium at improving quality of life as measured by the St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and, importantly, the improvement versus placebo was &#x0003e;4 units (the minimum clinically important difference) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The OTEMTO&#x000ae; studies provided the opportunity to study the effectiveness of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol in different COPD subgroups based on lung function (GOLD 2 or 3), GOLD combined assessment (A, B, C or D) and previous treatment focusing on treatment-naive patients (no prior use of LAMAs, LABAs and/or inhaled corticosteroids [ICS]).

Odds ratios were calculated between groups using a logistical regression including the fixed categorical effect of treatment. A restricted maximum likelihood-based mixed effects model repeated measures approach was used for the analysis of continuous end points, including the fixed categorical effects of treatment, test day and treatment-by-test-day interaction, as well as the continuous fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-test-day interaction.</p><p>The TDI responder analysis was based on the TDI focal score; patients were classed as responders if they had a value that was &#x02265;1.0 unit.</p><p>As these analyses are <italic>post hoc</italic> and performed within subgroups with potentially small sample sizes, they are not powered for statistical comparisons within subgroups; therefore, results are presented as forest plots of treatment differences with corresponding 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals (CIs). Differences in treatment effects between subgroups are discussed and emphasis is not put on statistical significance within subgroups alone (assessed based on the 95&#x000a0;% CI).

Subgroup analyses confirm that tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol is equally effective in patients with moderate COPD (GOLD 2), as for those with severe disease (GOLD 3). Using the GOLD A&#x02013;D categorisation, tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol showed a similar effect on lung function in all the subgroups but the benefit of this dual bronchodilator combination versus tiotropium monotherapy on patient-reported outcomes was most apparent in GOLD B patients. Tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol was also superior to tiotropium monotherapy irrespective of previous treatment history, even in those patients naive to all maintenance therapy.</p><p>The responder analyses are an alternative way of understanding the treatment effects on patient-reported outcomes. Importantly, there was a greater proportion of SGRQ and TDI responders with tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol compared to tiotropium in GOLD 2 patients, demonstrating the potential benefits of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol in terms of quality of life for patients with moderate disease.</p><p><italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses of the TONADO&#x000ae; studies showed that tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol was superior to tiotropium and olodaterol monotherapies for lung-function changes in patient subgroups classified by lung-function impairment severity, age and previous treatment history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Our analyses generally agree with these previous findings on lung function and further extend these observations by investigating responses in patients with GOLD A&#x02013;D disease, as well as investigating patient-reported outcomes. The analysis of patients with GOLD A&#x02013;D disease showed that the effects of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol on lung function versus tiotropium monotherapy or placebo were similar in all subgroups. However, for SGRQ, the benefit of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol was most apparent in GOLD B patients. There has been some debate about which patients with COPD benefit most from dual bronchodilator treatment compared to long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy. The current findings in GOLD B patients suggest that the symptomatic benefit of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol is greater in patients with higher baseline symptoms and FEV<sub>1</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;50&#x000a0;% predicted and this may indicate that early combined treatment would be beneficial for these patients. The treatment difference was less pronounced in GOLD D patients compared to GOLD B patients, suggesting that in highly symptomatic patients with COPD (<italic>i.e.</italic> GOLD B and D) the greatest benefit of LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA compared to long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy on patient-reported outcomes is in patients with less severe airflow obstruction, although all groups showed benefit from LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA therapy. A note of caution for this interpretation of the GOLD A&#x02013;D analysis is that the patients were split into four subgroups, thereby producing the smallest sample size of all the analyses presented here, and this reduced sample size may influence these results.</p><p>There was a trend towards greater lung-function improvements with tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol in patients who had received previous maintenance therapy. However, this pattern did not translate to a greater benefit on patient-reported outcomes. The mean treatment effects were similar in both groups of patients and the wide 95&#x000a0;% CI for the treatment effect in patients receiving previous maintenance treatment suggests a large variation between individuals in this group, and results may have been influenced by selection bias. Overall, we conclude that treatment with tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol showed evidence of similar efficacy, irrespective of previous maintenance treatment.</p><p>In this study, there was a large proportion of patients receiving ICS treatment at baseline, the majority of whom were classed as having severe or very severe (GOLD 3 or GOLD C/D) disease. This is in accordance with current GOLD guidelines, which recommend ICS treatment for patients with severe/very severe COPD and frequent exacerbations who are not adequately controlled with long-acting bronchodilators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Clinical trials of LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA combinations usually allow patients receiving ICS treatment to continue during the study. This is mostly for ethical reasons, as stepping patients down from both long-acting bronchodilator treatment and ICS in the placebo arm is potentially unsafe. However, the use of LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA combination inhalers in real life is likely to be mostly without concomitant ICS treatment. Although this sub-analysis of OTEMTO&#x000ae; cannot exclude an effect of ICS treatment on the clinical response to tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol, it would appear that any effect, if present, is small. Further studies are required to better assess whether patients with GOLD D disease should be treated with LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA or LAMA&#x02009;+&#x02009;LABA&#x02009;+&#x02009;ICS.</p><p>The main limitations of these analyses are that they are <italic>post hoc</italic> and not powered for statistical comparisons between subgroups. However, as the analyses were performed to confirm that the positive results of the OTEMTO&#x000ae; study hold true for patients of all disease severities included, and for patients irrespective of prior medication use, this is not a major concern. A pattern of results for the lung-function changes noted in this subgroup analysis is that often the 95&#x000a0;% CI for tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol versus tiotropium crossed zero for trough FEV<sub>1</sub> but not for FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub>. This, again, is likely to be related to sample size for these subgroups and the greater effect size for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub>.</p><p>One reason why it is of interest to examine the benefits of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol in patients by disease severity, and in patients who are treatment naive, is that the fastest decline in lung function in COPD is seen in the initial stages of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, selecting the most appropriate treatment for initial therapy may be important. Even in mild to moderate COPD, patients start to limit exercise and activities, which are further limited as lung function declines, leading to a sedentary lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. It has been suggested that intervening early in COPD may benefit patients, as they are able to maintain levels of activity and health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and treatment may improve health-related quality of life and potentially slow disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Furthermore, a subgroup analysis of the UPLIFT&#x000ae; tiotropium study showed that in patients with GOLD 2 (moderate) COPD, early intervention with tiotropium appeared to slow the course of FEV<sub>1</sub> decline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Improvements in lung function are associated with better quality of life and reduced symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. By targeting earlier disease, it is hoped that treatment may maintain the patient&#x02019;s functionality and postpone disease progression for longer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, the added benefits of tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol compared to tiotropium monotherapy in patients with moderate COPD and treatment-naive patients suggest that tiotropium&#x02009;+&#x02009;olodaterol should be considered as an option for patients at the point where there is a need to initiate maintenance therapy, as well as in patients with more severe disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub>, area under the curve from 0 to 3&#x000a0;h; CI, confidence interval; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; FEV<sub>1</sub>, forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s; GOLD, Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease; ICS, inhaled corticosteroids; LABA, long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist; LAMA, long-acting muscarinic antagonist; SGRQ, St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire; TDI, Transition Dyspnoea Index.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec19"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12931_2016_387_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Methodology; <bold>Table S1.</bold> Trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub> responses, TDI focal score and SGRQ total score at 12 weeks in GOLD 2 and GOLD 3 subgroups (full analysis set, combined studies); <bold>Figure S1.</bold> (a) Responder analysis of SGRQ total score and (b) TDI focal score, all at 12&#x000a0;weeks: treatment comparisons for T&#x02009;+&#x02009;O 5/5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g versus T 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and versus placebo in patients with GOLD 2 and 3 disease, GOLD A&#x02013;D disease, patients who were treatment naive/not treatment naive at baseline and for patients who were receiving/not receiving ICS treatment at baseline.
