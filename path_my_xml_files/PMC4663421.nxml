<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> our intervention (UCCDIP) was developed using data from a previous focus group study.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> UCCDIP consists of two booklets, one for the patient and one for the relatives (see online supplementary file 2). The front page of the patient booklet includes an individualised patient discharge summary, written by ICU bedside nurses; trained to use a template designed by the project team (CW, PH). The pack also contains information aimed at preparing the patient/family for ICU discharge and the transition to the ward. It encourages active participation by offering space for expression of individual questions and concerns. It also includes diary pages for both the patient and family to record their thoughts and feelings during the in-hospital recovery period, if they wish. In accordance with SRT, UCCDIP was designed as an information resource, to help users develop revised illness perceptions, more consistent with effective coping.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>

No guidance was given for this and the quality and quantity of information delivered was totally dependent on each staff member's usual practice. To minimise the risks of additional attention, given to participants in the intervention group having a placebo effect,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> in addition to the &#x02018;ad hoc&#x02019; information given to all participants, a second &#x02018;attention control&#x02019; group received alternative written information in the form of a booklet produced by the ICUsteps charity.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In contrast to UCCDIP, the information in the ICUsteps booklet covered the whole trajectory of critical illness from ICU admission to after hospital discharge. In addition, the ICUsteps booklet did not offer opportunities for participants to reflect on their experience or feelings, or prompt them to consider their individual information needs.</p><sec id="s3c1"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p>Immediately after recruitment, patient participants in all clusters were given an identical looking folder containing a covering letter, study information and, where applicable, written discharge information (either UCCDIP or the ICUsteps booklet).

The questionnaire survey was completed prior to a patient's hospital discharge (participants) or at the end of the trial period (nurses) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006852TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><p>Data were collected by one researcher (SB), with back-up provided (TD). To maximise the chance of retrieving a full data set, researchers facilitated completion of forms (by reading questions and writing responses) for some of the less able patients. Relatives were asked to complete forms on the ward or at home, and to return them directly to the research team (by email or post) or to leave them for collection at the patient's bedside.</p><p>Demographic information, length of ICU stay, ICU readmissions, medical history, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> therapies received and complications pertinent to the critical illness period were retrieved from local databases and medical notes immediately after each patient participant was recruited. At this point, participating relatives were also asked to complete a form detailing their demographics, previous experiences of critical illness and relevant medical history (such as anxiety and/or depression). The number of unit discharges per day during the trial period and other feasibility data, such as comments received from staff and challenges associated with intervention delivery, were also recorded by the research nurse. All completed discharge summaries were photocopied and retained.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Sample</title><p>Based on data from a previous RCT by Gammon and Mulholland,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which examined the effect of information giving on the HADS of a sample of perioperative patients, the sample size calculation for the present trial was carried out using G*Power V.3.1.2. To detect a moderate effect size of 0.6 (mean difference of 3&#x02005;units, SD 5) with a power of 80% and &#x003b1; set at 0.05, a minimum of 45 participants in each group were required. To account for attrition and the likely variation in ICU discharges in each cluster (discharge day), our accrual target was 50 participants in each of three study arms.</p><p>Sample size was not based on an intracluster correlation (ICC) calculation, as insufficient information was available to determine the real extent of any homogeneity between clusters. As only those discharged on weekdays were recruited, it was anticipated that every day would produce a fairly similar and randomly determined clinical case load (local data 2010/2011), thus limiting the likelihood of homogeneity (eg, similar diagnoses) within and heterogeneity (eg, care led by different medical teams) between clusters. The intervention for each cluster was also preallocated on a random basis, thus minimising (although not eradicating) the chance of clusters being homogeneous.</p><p>There was no opportunity to influence cluster size, and so to maximise the chance of recruiting the required number of participants, data collection was planned to continue for at least 132&#x02005;days, providing 44 potential clusters in each of the three study arms, significantly greater than the minimum of five recommended by the UK Medical Research Council.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>As described by Hayes and Moulton,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> this trial used cluster randomisation for pragmatic reasons, with an aim to reduce the risk of cross-contamination between study arms. All patient participants (and their relative where applicable) discharged from either ICU on a particular day (a cluster) were allocated to one of the three study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2014006852F1">figure 1</xref>). Particular days of the week were not allocated to specific arms; instead each day was randomly allocated to a study arm and treated as a distinct cluster, based on the allocation schedule.</p><p>To ensure that the sequence of allocation was not predictable, the day on which the intervention, control and attention control was used was randomly assigned using a computer-generated random sequence, prepared by a statistician. This involved simple randomisation with no blocking or stratification for defined variables.</p><p>The allocation schedule was prepared by persons independent of the trial and concealed by being wrapped in a blank piece of paper and placed inside sequentially numbered, sealed envelopes. These envelopes were signed across the seal and opened by the research nurse (KH), in the presence of another member of the research team, only after a recruited patient was identified for discharge to the ward on a particular day. The clinical ICU staff only became aware of which study group the patient was allocated to when the bedside nurse was provided with a study pack to give to the patient. Allocation concealment for the whole cluster was revealed after the first envelope was opened on any day.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Blinding</title><p>It was not possible to achieve full blinding during this trial as intervention delivery required input by healthcare staff and trial participants.

Where possible, such practice is encouraged, particularly if a patient's cognitive function is compromised.</p><p>The intention of this trial was to determine the effect of adding UCCDIP into the usual care provided during discharge; thus, after discharge to the ward, no specific instructions were given to ward nurses or other healthcare staff about their role in facilitating its use. Knowledge of the intervention, obtained due to contamination of the allocation concealment after recruitment of the first patient on any day may, however, have influenced staff members&#x02019; verbal information delivery, both its quality and quantity. In addition, follow-up personnel, such as discharge coordinators and critical care outreach nurses, have been shown to aid patients&#x02019; and relatives&#x02019; interaction with written information.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Not providing this support as part of the intervention in this trial may account for some of the problems with engagement that we encountered, particularly for those with English as a second language, poor literacy and/or cognitive impairment. It may also have contributed to the excessive loss to follow-up we experienced, which in turn may have influenced our outcome data. We did not collect data on these participant characteristics and thus are unable to validate these assumptions. These issues are further discussed in Day <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>UCCDIP is a multicomponent intervention, which includes an individualised patient discharge summary written by ICU nurses. Survey data (reported in Bench <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) suggest that this element of UCCDIP was of particular value to the patients, relatives and ward nurses who took part in our study. In the protocols for the Scottish RECOVER and RELINQUISH trials,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> discharge summaries, similar to those used in the present trial, but written by doctors are also included as part of the intervention. In addition, &#x02018;lay summaries&#x02019; are now being written by physiotherapists in some parts of the UK (personal communication from Williams N, Edinburgh Critical Care Research Group 6th annual meeting; 26 June 2013). Healthcare professionals&#x02019; interest in using patient discharge summaries is also evident by the number of &#x02018;discharge summary training packs&#x02019;, designed by our project team, being downloaded from the ICUsteps website.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Based on these findings, we recommend that reflective opportunities, such as diaries, are included as part of all individualised rehabilitation programmes.</p><p>Our results suggest that medical as opposed to surgical patients may value interventions such as UCCDIP more; perhaps because this group have an increased tendency for psychological problems such as PTSD.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Elective surgical patients may also be better prepared for an ICU admission and their stay is generally expected to be shorter. In our trial, it must be acknowledged, however, that most admissions to the surgical ICU were unplanned. Further, admission to the medical or surgical unit was not always reflective of a patient's condition as beds were used flexibly to meet demand. Despite this limitation, defining subpopulations of critical care (eg, medical vs surgical, ventilated vs non-ventilated) that may benefit most from such an intervention remains an important future consideration, particularly where resources are limited.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Future research</title><p>Evaluating any complex intervention is practically and methodologically difficult.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> UCCDIP contains a number of different components, making it difficult to isolate those aspects likely to be most effective. Although findings from the questionnaire survey suggest that the patient discharge summary was considered valuable,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> future research is required to examine its effectiveness as a stand-alone intervention.</p><p>In this trial, the patients and relatives in all clusters received ad hoc verbal information as part of usual care practice. Ad hoc information delivery can be inconsistent and its quality can differ between healthcare professionals. As in other studies,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> it was unclear who was delivering the &#x02018;ad hoc&#x02019; verbal information during our trial, what was being said or whether it was actually provided at all. Although challenging, attention to qualifying and quantifying these data is a recommendation for further research.</p><p>The high prevalence of anxiety and depression experienced by patients and their families in our study suggests that a higher threshold (&#x02265;11) on the HADS tool, as used by other researchers<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> is required to differentiate the effects of interventions such as UCCDIP on participants. The relationship between emotional status, cognitive appraisal and coping behaviours is complex and individualised. Outcome assessment measures, more closely aligned with the theoretical basis of the intervention (in this case SRT) may, therefore, be better suited to evaluate information interventions in recovering critically ill patients. Development of a validated tool to provide more rigorous data to support the positive views of UCCDIP reported in the locally designed questionnaire survey<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> is also required.</p><p>Our data collection points were specifically chosen to identify any early effects of the intervention on psychological well-being that might influence ongoing recovery. However, the effects of our intervention on patients&#x02019; and relatives&#x02019; perceived anxiety, depression, coping and enablement may not have been visible during the early stages of recovery.<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> A longer follow-up period would enable both the early and ongoing impact of different methods of ICU discharge information to be better explored. The common problem of delayed discharge from ICU<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> should also be considered. Delays can have both positive (physically stronger) and negative effects (increased dependency) on psychological well-being at the point of ICU discharge, and thus may have important implications for evaluating information provision.</p><p>It is widely acknowledged that in complex intervention studies such as this, the risk of follow-up bias is high.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Reasons for low follow-up in this study were multifactorial, but key reasons included patients being discharged from hospital earlier than anticipated and relatives failing to return data collection forms. These factors need to be considered in the design of future trials. Including relatives in the evaluation of any critical illness rehabilitation intervention is important, as the family unit often provides substantial support to the patient and close relatives can also be affected by the patient's critical illness.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>
<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Our experience suggests, however, that once a patient leaves ICU, it is very difficult to maintain communication with relatives and that their commitment to completing study requirements is reduced. Alternate methods of data collection, such as individual telephone interviews, may help reduce the level of attrition we experienced in this study.</p><p>In line with best practice recommendations, one of the purposes of this pilot RCT was to inform the power calculation for future work.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Mean HADS-A and HADS-D was 7 (SD 5) in the patient sample. Based on a power of 95% and 0.05% level of significance, to achieve an effect size of 0.4 (difference of 2), a total sample of 286 (143 in each of two groups) would be required for a definitive trial. The different numbers of participants recruited on each weekday (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006852TB1">table 1</xref>) should also be accounted for. The recruitment rates we observed suggest that this would require a multicentre study to achieve. Given our attrition, it is difficult to judge if such a study would represent value for money although possible benefits for patients include an improved understanding of their critical illness experience, use of more positive coping strategies and improved psychological well-being during the rehabilitation period. Considering the feasibility challenges we experienced and have previously described,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> future research could focus on assessing patients&#x02019; and relatives&#x02019; perceived usefulness of written information resources and the extent to which specific information deemed important is successfully transmitted and retained.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Limitations</title><p>This was a single-centre pilot trial, with a short follow-up period and a high rate of attrition (particularly in the sample of relatives). Only recruiting patients discharged during weekdays and daytime hours may have led to a selection bias, as poorer outcomes are associated with night-time and weekend discharges.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Other potential biases may also have influenced our results. There were some pretest differences between study groups which might have attenuated any potential benefits. HADS were skewed and the sample was small at time point 2. This should be borne in mind when interpreting the statistical model; however, the results were consistent whichever approach was used. There was also a failure to maintain allocation concealment after recruitment of the first patient in each cluster and a possible Hawthorne effect, where staff may have provided verbal information differently from normal because they were aware of the nature of the study.</p><p>Results must therefore be viewed with caution and may not be generalisable to the wider critical care population. The study has, however, provided important data, which can inform future trials evaluating interventions like UCCDIP, enabling processes to be streamlined and a sample size based on a more accurate power calculation to be used.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52&#x02013;54</xref></p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This single-centre pragmatic pilot RCT used cluster randomisation to undertake an initial evaluation of UCCDIP, a discharge information pack designed by the project team. We were unable to prove the effectiveness of UCCDIP, supporting the view that information giving to those recovering from critical illness is a complex intervention. This research has, however, provided important preliminary data regarding how, when and for whom an intervention based on the principles of UCCDIP could be most effective and what it would look like.</p><p>To increase the likelihood of similar interventions improving health outcomes, key considerations for future work are: (1) medical as opposed to surgical critical care patients may be more likely to benefit from such interventions; (2) after discharge to the ward, patients need further input and support to help them engage fully with written information resources; (3) data collection time points should reflect the potential effects on both early and later recovery; and (4) outcome measures more sensitive to the effects of UCCDIP should be used for future evaluations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Professor Alison Metcalfe, Associate Dean (Research) at the Florence Nightingale Faculty of Nursing and Midwifery, King's College, London, who acted as principal academic PhD supervisor for SB during the period of the project.
