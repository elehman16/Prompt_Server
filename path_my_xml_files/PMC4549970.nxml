The aim of this study is to determine whether a patient-centered systematic review leads to more appropriate medication use in patients without negatively affecting quality of life and the course of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design </title><p>The trial is a two-armed, double blinded cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary care physicians (PCPs) will be randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Physicians in the intervention group undergo training with instruction of the algorithm. The control group is given a lecture on multimorbidity and instructions for collecting data in a usual care manner.</p><p>PCPs will approach patients aged 60&#x000a0;years or older who are taking 5 or more drugs. The study period is 1&#x000a0;year.</p><p>The primary outcome measure is the change in the number of drugs 12&#x000a0;months after the algorithm was applied by the PCP during consultation with the patient. Secondary outcomes are: change in the number of drugs immediately after the encounter and 6&#x000a0;months later, reason for a change of the medication, discrepancy in the decision to change between PCP and patient, number of drugs for which the patient is suggesting a change, number of drugs the patient is taking that are not known to the PCP, time consumption of the intervention, disease-specific variables to evaluate the course of the disease(s) for which the patient is being treated , quality of life, barriers against using the algorithm, numbers of drugs readopted due to an unfavorable course of the disease, and numbers of drugs which have been started.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Answering the four questions of the algorithm requires a weighing-up of risks and benefits and contains a shared-decision-making approach: a prioritization of the treatment goals is necessary. This can only be done in collaboration with the patient. The majority of patients with multimorbidity are treated in the primary care setting. This underlines the significance of our study carried out in this setting: given the high prevalence of adverse drug events in patients with multimorbidity an intervention like ours has a large potential to reduce drug-related morbidity.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN16560559">ISRCTN16560559</ext-link> 13 November 2014</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Multimorbidity</kwd><kwd>Polypharmacy</kwd><kwd>Shared-decision--making</kwd><kwd>Prioritization</kwd><kwd>Adverse drug events</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The intake of multiple drugs (polypharmacy), overuse and misuse of drugs are increasing problems in the care of people with a number of health conditions (multimorbid) as well as older people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One of the problems in polypharmacy is the danger of adverse drug reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This leads to an increase in morbidity, hospital admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], health-related costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and number of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Paradoxically, a clear relationship between polypharmacy and underuse of indicated drugs has been shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Up to now, several clinical tools and approaches to guide appropriate prescribing of drugs are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Deprescribing is a complex process that is required for the safe and effective cessation of inappropriate medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Barriers to and enablers of deprescribing from the point of view of the patients as well as from primary care physicians (PCPs) have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A recently published study using a newly developed algorithm for a systematic reduction of medication (Good Palliative Geriatric Practice, GPGP) showed that deprescribing resulted in a significant positive effect on health in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, we slightly adapted the GPGP algorithm and pilot-tested the algorithm in a primary care setting to assess feasibility and practicability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The algorithm enforces a systematic drug review considering patients&#x02019; perspective and preferences. As primary care physicians (PCPs) take care of the majority of patients with multimorbidity, our tool has a potentially high impact on polypharmacy in primary care settings. Previous studies, investigating interventions to reduce polypharmacy, have taken place in an older persons care setting. In primary care settings results are still lacking. This study intends to bridge this gap.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study hypothesis</title><p>The implementation of an algorithm adapted to the GPGP leads to a reduction of polypharmacy among patients with multimorbidity (60&#x000a0;years and older) in a primary care setting.</p><p>Furthermore, this implementation does not worsen the quality of life or the course of the disease for which the drug was originally prescribed for (safety issues of the intervention).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial (randomization on PCP-practice level) with primary care physicians in the northern part of Switzerland (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The design and methodology of our study is based on the experiences of a small pilot study.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_915_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Pilot study</title><p>The pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] was conducted with 14 primary care physicians. An evaluation was conducted to test the logistics, baseline measurements and the feasibility of the study. The pilot study resulted in minor changes in the questionnaire and an important element of shared-decision-making was added: beside the four major clinical problems defined by the PCP the four most important complaints in a patient&#x02019;s perspective were added. In order to detect potential undertreatment a special section was added entitled &#x0201c;medication started&#x0201d;. </p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment and eligibility of primary care physicians</title><p>PCPs are eligible for participation if they provide care in the routine primary setting to unselected patients. About 1700 PCPs in the Canton of Zurich will be invited by a formal letter of the Institute of Primary Care of the University of Zurich.</p><p>PCPs who finally agree to participate will be listed in alphabetical order. If two PCPs of the same practice agree to participate, the first name in the alphabet receives a number which is valid also for the second one in order to avoid contamination between groups. Randomization will be stratified according to the practice size (e.g. single-handed versus group practice). The randomization scheme will be generated by using the website Randomization.com (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">http://www.randomization.com</ext-link>) and group assignment will be performed by a study nurse not involved in further data analysis.

To achieve a degree of blinding, PCPs are not provided with specific information at invitation. They will receive a lecture (length: 2&#x000a0;hours) about multimorbidity in general and instructions for collecting data in a usual care group. PCPs from the control group will be told that the study purpose is to investigate best practices for physician-patient communication.</p><p>PCPs in the intervention group will undergo a physicians&#x02019; training with instruction on how to use the algorithm including a communication skills training. The adapted GPGP-algorithm used in our trial consists of four steps and is a patient-centered process. First, the drugs are listed together with the four main diagnoses as well as the four main disorders from the patient&#x02019;s perspective.

For each drug the PCP will note whether the patient agrees with the recommendation.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent from the patient, a practice nurse or the PCP creates a list of the patient&#x02019;s present medication. Then, the PCP defines the four major clinical problems and, together with the patient, the four most important complaints from the patients&#x02019; perspective. Physicians in the intervention group then decide, for every drug listed, whether the indication is correct, whether there are side effects, whether an alternative treatment would be suitable or whether a change in the dosage is indicated (key questions of the algorithm). After discussion with the patient, the PCP and patient decide together whether to stop a drug, to change the dosage of a drug or to switch to an alternative drug, with the option to restart if symptoms should increase or the disease deteriorate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary outcomes measures</title><p>Change in the number of drugs (deprescribing rate) 12&#x000a0;months after applying the tool.</p><p>The primary outcome will be calculated on the basis of the medication list, provided by the practice nurse or the PCP at baseline (before the intervention) and 12&#x000a0;months afterwards.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> displays the secondary outcomes with the appropriate measuring method.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Secondary outcomes and the appropriate measuring method</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Secondary outcomes</th><th>Measuring method</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.

The feasibility and acceptability was rated with a 5-point Likert scale in different items (means: 3.2&#x02013;4.2, SD 0.83&#x02013;1.3). Other studies concerning improving appropriate prescription in (mostly older) patients receiving complex polypharmacy present a more time-consuming algorithm or method than usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
