However, safety data of the new oral anticoagulants with a long-term use of 42&#x02005;days are not available for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, there are no clinical trials comparing dabigatran and/or rivaroxaban with nadroparin, which is used in most Dutch departments of orthopaedic surgery. Our aim is to compare the 42-day use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban versus nadroparin after TKA in a clinical explorative pilot study by assessing the incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding using a standardised model of bleeding definitions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised open-label pilot study was conducted. Patients &#x02265;18&#x02005;years and weighing more than 40&#x02005;kg who were scheduled for a primary elective TKA were included. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups. Patients took either a daily oral dose of dabigatran etexilate 220&#x02005;mg (n=50), 10&#x02005;mg of oral rivaroxaban (n=50) or subcutaneous nadroparin 0.3&#x02005;ml (n=50) for 42&#x02005;days. The primary safety outcome measure was the incidence of bleeding events. Major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events were defined according to accepted guidelines. The secondary measures of this study were the occurrence of VTE, time until the bleeding event, compliance, duration of hospital stay, rehospitalisation, outpatient clinic visits and interventions following complications. Additionally, coagulation monitoring, knee flexion range of motion and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of this trial provided insight into the validity of design for an adequately powered multicentre study investigating the safety of the new oral anticoagulants compared with nadroparin, an anticoagulant applied for prevention of VTE after knee arthroplasty in the Dutch situation.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01431456.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Health and Safety</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>After total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery, patients are at risk of developing venous thromboembolism (VTE). Approximately one-third of patients with symptomatic VTE manifest pulmonary embolism (PE), whereas two-thirds manifest deep venous thrombosis (DVT) alone. Without thromboprophylaxis, (venographic) DVT can be found in 40&#x02013;80% of patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> The risk of non-fatal and fatal PE for TKA surgery patients without thromboprophylaxis is 1.8&#x02013;7.0% and 0.2&#x02013;0.7%, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Hence, thromboprophylaxis is indicated for all patients undergoing TKA. Still, the choice of method raises discussion because treatments that effectively prevent VTE simultaneously increase the risk of bleeding. Patients are, for example, at a higher risk for bleeding when they have hypertension or when they take medication that increases the bleeding risk.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> Bleeding raises major safety concerns for orthopaedic surgeons who prescribe pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, although the full clinical impact of VTE and its status as a leading cause of preventable death in hospitals remains under-rated.</p><p>It is very important to select the most appropriate thromboprophylaxis, by balancing the risk of bleeding versus the prevention of VTE.</p><p>Recent research has focused on the development of oral anticoagulants that can be administered in fixed dosages with the expectation that they will provide safe and effective alternatives to existing therapies. Dabigatran etexilate (a direct thrombin inhibitor) and rivaroxaban (a direct factor Xa inhibitor) are new-generation oral anticoagulants. Such new oral agents have already shown efficacy in large-scale clinical trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8 R9">6&#x02013;9</xref> Both medicines have been approved for thromboprophylaxis after TKA in the European Union. Such new oral agents have a rapid onset of action and can be given at fixed doses without the need for routine coagulation monitoring.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref></p><p>Meta-analysis comparing the efficacy and safety of dabigatran with enoxaparin suggests that these medicines have a similar efficacy and bleeding rate in patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Huisman <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> showed that enoxaparin is less effective than rivaroxaban but has a lower risk of bleeding.</p><p>In clinical trials the new oral anticoagulants were studied on efficacy and safety with the comparator enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) preparation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6 R7 R8 R9">6&#x02013;9</xref> However, the external validity of such clinical trials may be limited for Dutch knee replacement surgery patients. Next to specific LMWH, also the dose and duration vary in clinical practice. More importantly, nadroparin is used in most Dutch departments of orthopaedic surgery after TKA for a treatment period of 42&#x02005;days. Compared with 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days in market authorisation for dabigatran and rivaroxaban, this is a much longer treatment period.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref></p><p>In this study we chose a treatment period of 42&#x02005;days for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and nadroparin. First, because a treatment period of 42&#x02005;days is in compliance with the Dutch guidelines, these guidelines suggest applying prophylaxis with anticoagulants for 6&#x02005;weeks after arthroplasty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> Second, the information on prescription numbers of the manufacturers of dabigatran and rivaroxaban, respectively Boehringer Ingelheim and Bayer, shows that 80% of the Dutch hospitals apply anticoagulants after TKA for a longer treatment period than market authorisation for dabigatran and rivaroxaban. Only 20% of the Dutch hospitals use dabigatran and rivaroxaban, according to the market authorisation duration of 10&#x02013;14&#x02005;days. Different guidelines exist regarding the prevention of VTE in orthopaedic surgery. Previous surveys in the Netherlands have revealed that guidelines regarding orthopaedic thromboprophylaxis were not followed and that a wide variation in protocols exists. Of the 84% of approached orthopaedic departments in the Netherlands, 78% used prophylaxis with LMWH. Eighty-five per cent of all these cases continued prophylaxis for 42&#x02005;days.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref></p><p>Third, White <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> suggested in their study that prolonged prophylaxis may be required, because less is known about the incidence and time course of symptomatic DVT or PE. The authors showed that the risk of developing a DVT or PE decreases when prophylaxis is given for at least 35&#x02005;days. Moreover, recent clinical trials have demonstrated that more prolonged prophylaxis with LMWH after hospital discharge significantly reduces the incidence of venographically detected DVT after arthroplasty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref></p><p>Given that dabigatran and rivaroxaban have market authorisation on prophylaxis after total hip arthroplasty for a treatment duration of 28&#x02013;35&#x02005;h, next to clinical trials on the safety of dabigatran and rivaroxaban after prophylaxis for 35&#x02005;days after hip arthroplasty,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20 R21">19&#x02013;21</xref> we expect a similar bleeding risk after 42&#x02005;days of thromboprophylaxis after TKA. Also the results of the clinical trials on efficacy and safety of dabigatran and rivaroxaban for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, with a treatment period longer than 35&#x02005;days, support the choice and safety of longer treatment duration.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref></p><p>Most orthopaedic departments in the Netherlands generally start perioperative prophylaxis with LMWH between 2&#x02005;h before and 6&#x02005;h after surgery. It appears that a preoperative start is no more effective than a postoperative start. A perioperative start is apparently more effective, but this is counterbalanced by a marked increase in the risk of major bleeding in comparison with a preoperative or postoperative regimen.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> That is the reason we chose postoperative prophylaxis with nadroparin within 6&#x02005;h after surgery, like the specific departmental protocol on thromboprophylaxis. In order to prevent deviations in medication quality and safety in medication administration, all three study medications were administered within 6&#x02005;h after TKA. The dose to be administered and the time of first administration of study medication were registered.</p><p>In randomised clinical trials the efficacy of a new anticoagulant is typically assessed to establish LMWH prophylaxis. However, safety endpoint definitions applied in these studies can vary. The wide range of definitions used to classify bleeding outcomes in the studies makes it difficult to interpret the comparative bleeding risk associated with the new anticoagulants.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>

Patients planning for a TKA surgery were screened for eligibility. If a patient can potentially be enrolled, he/she was informed about the trial and asked to participate. Having consented to participate, patients were included and received a study identification number, that is, were randomised.</p><p>Postoperatively, the patient received the allocated thromboprophylaxis. Patients took either a daily oral dose of dabigatran etexilate (two capsules of 110&#x02005;mg) 220&#x02005;mg (n=50) starting with a half-dose (110&#x02005;mg) within 6&#x02005;h after surgery (n=50) during 42&#x02005;days, or 10&#x02005;mg of oral rivaroxaban once daily, starting within 6&#x02005;h after surgery during 42&#x02005;days, or daily subcutaneous nadroparin 2850&#x02005;IE/ml, 0.3&#x02005;ml starting within 6&#x02005;h after surgery during 42&#x02005;days.

KOOS evaluates the functional status and quality of life of patients with any type of knee injury. Therefore, we wanted to measure the clinical condition of patients before and after treatment, to see if there was any difference in knee function and quality of life between the treatment groups, nadroparin, rivaroxaban or dabigatran. We assume that there will be a relation between clinical relevant (non)-major bleeding and knee function. Physiotherapy was continued until patients reached a full range of motion and an improvement in knee flexion was achieved.</p><p>Every day during hospital stay the patient was examined. Specific attention was given to DVT, PE and bleeding events.

At discharge, study medications were disposed for up to 42&#x02005;days after surgery. Patients were informed about the possibility to contact their orthopaedic surgeon or researcher about any adverse events they experienced during or after the treatment with the anticoagulant (in the home situation). On day 4 up until 6 after discharge the patients were contacted daily by an orthopaedic nurse. Bleeding events that occurred in the home situation were all registered, and there was no loss to follow-up.</p><p>Patients returned to the outpatient clinic of the hospital after 42&#x02005;days.
