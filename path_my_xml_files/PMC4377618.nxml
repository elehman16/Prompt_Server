GPs and other health professionals are thereby able to provide their patients with vouchers to attend meetings and use internet-based resources. However, there is some scepticism among patients about the profit-making interests of commercial companies and concern over the public funding of weight-loss services.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>This study draws on interviews with participants from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of primary care referral to a commercial weight-loss programme. It examines their attitudes and beliefs about accessing a commercial weight-loss programme via their doctor, and the ways in which these relate to their weight-loss experience. This study explores their views about an NHS commercial partnership and the provision of &#x02018;free&#x02019; weight management, paid for by the NHS, in order to understand the contextual factors that may facilitate participation in the programme.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Design and setting</title><p>This qualitative study was embedded within the WRAP Weight Loss Referrals for Adults in Primary Care) (ISRCTN82857232) randomised controlled trial, the full protocol for which is published elsewhere.<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The trial recruited adults who were overweight or obese and randomised them to either: referral to a commercial programme (Weight Watchers<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) for 12 weeks; referral to the same programme for 52 weeks; or a brief self-help intervention. Clinical measures (weight, waist circumference, body composition, and blood pressure) and self-report questionnaires were completed at baseline, 3, 12, and 24 months.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>How this fits in</title><p>Randomised controlled trials have shown that referral to a commercial weight-loss programme is a cost-effective intervention for people who are overweight and obese, and qualitative research has shown that it accords with patients&#x02019; views of weight management as a non-medical lifestyle issue. This study suggests that patients do not see a clear demarcation between the primary care and commercial sectors, and that the referral from the GP and subsequent clinical assessments (undertaken as part of a randomised controlled trial) frame patient experience of this community-based intervention to strengthen the focus on health benefits. The perceived investment and medical observation from the GP may increase motivation of patients to attend the commercial programme and engage in weight management. Short follow-up appointments, with clinical measurements fed back to the GP, could be incorporated into clinical practice to potentially enhance attendance, adherence, and sustain intervention effects for patients referred to commercial programmes.</p></sec></boxed-text></sec><sec><title>Recruitment and sampling</title><p>For the main trial, participating GP practices used their lists to identify all eligible males and females, (aged &#x02265;18 years with a body mass index [BMI] &#x0003e;28 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and sent them invitations to participate. In total, 1269 participants were recruited by three research centres (MRC Human Nutrition Research, Cambridge; the University of Oxford; and the University of Liverpool) from 23 GP practices across the UK.</p><p>A purposeful sample of 29 participants from the Cambridge centre participated in this qualitative study. A maximum-variation (heterogeneity) sampling technique was used to select potential interviewees based on BMI, intervention arm, and demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity, and education) obtained during the telephone screening questionnaire and through a questionnaire at the baseline visit. At the 3-month visit, one author met with selected participants (including some who had stopped attending meetings but not withdrawn from follow-up) and invited them to participate in the qualitative study. Interested participants were given a participant information sheet to take home with them and were asked to contact the author if they were happy to take part in an interview.</p><p>Participants could choose whether to be interviewed in their home or in a private office at the University of Cambridge. Interviews were not held where study procedures were conducted. This was to reduce associations between the interview and the measurement visits of the trial to encourage participants to speak openly about their experiences of the intervention to which they had been assigned. The interviewer told participants that she worked alongside the trial but was not part of the core trial team.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Face-to-face semi-structured home interviews with participants were conducted by one author between June and September 2013.

Nevertheless, patients welcomed what they interpreted to be a personal invitation from their doctor, and they frequently mentioned this letter rather than any of the following communications. Although the support was overtly through an existing commercial programme, the sense of personalised support from the GP was enduring.

It just seemed like well if my doctor starts sending me letters &#x02026; now might be a good time.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 32)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Overall, patients equated the letter from their GP with a more typical NHS referral letter from primary to secondary care, and recognised it as being the key means to access specialist resources and services. As a result, the letter played an important symbolic role for participants.</p></sec><sec><title>The significance of receiving vouchers</title><p>Patients viewed the vouchers, which are used to pay for weekly meetings, as a further symbolic link between the commercial programme, their GP, and the NHS. Although the vouchers were given to patients by the research team, patients interpreted them as originating from what they understood to be their GP&#x02019;s referral. With this came a sense of moral and financial obligation to the GP to attend the commercial programme meetings:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;It would be rather embarrassing to be perfectly honest to go to a weight-loss thing and say &#x0201c;Yeah</italic> [bangs table for emphasis] <italic>thank you for the free Weight Watchers things but I just didn&#x02019;t bother!&#x0201d; &#x02026; I don&#x02019;t want to let the doctors down.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Male, 38)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Because participants felt that their weight was caused by &#x02018;<italic>Self-indulgence</italic>&#x02019; (Female, 62), and was &#x02018;<italic>... essentially</italic> [their] <italic>fault.</italic>&#x02019; (Female, 34), they frequently expressed guilt about drawing on NHS resources to address their problem:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;GPs have got sick people to see rather than people who just eat too much.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 46)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>In this context, participants welcomed the use of vouchers to access a commercial programme because they would not be &#x02018;<italic>Wasting</italic> [the GP&#x02019;s] <italic>time</italic>&#x02019; (Female, 53), and because they believed it would cost less than the medical interventions that they associated with their problem (for example, bariatric surgery). Vouchers were therefore seen as a means to ensure funding was not taken from the &#x02018;deserving&#x02019; sick, whom were regarded as suffering from &#x02018;real&#x02019; diseases:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Because the NHS is strapped for cash, there&#x02019;s people that have got far more serious issues than the fact that I like eating chocolate and crisps, like you&#x02019;ve got people dying of cancer that they can&#x02019;t even save, there isn&#x02019;t enough money available &#x02026; I would consider that far more serious, because &#x02026; a lot of cancers are not preventable &#x02026; so my weight, my weight gain is preventable if I could sort myself out and do it, so I wouldn&#x02019;t expect someone else to pay for me to get a grip basically</italic> [laughs].&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 34)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>It is worth noting that although, in many accounts, use of the vouchers enabled participants to talk of attending the weight-loss programme &#x02018;for free&#x02019;, the majority acknowledged that the service was being paid for, and they therefore felt a sense of debt:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I know I&#x02019;m going to Weight Watchers each week, and I&#x02019;m not going to let myself down and I&#x02019;m not letting everybody else down, you know &#x02018;cos it&#x02019;s costing money, not for me personally but for everybody else, you might as well save the taxpayer, you know, and it&#x02019;s as simple as that.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 70)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Feeling obliged to use the vouchers because they were free (to them) was contrasted with the idea that if they had paid for the service themselves this would have given them the right not to attend:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I thought I can&#x02019;t mess people around, if I had decided to do</italic> [the programme] <italic>myself it was very possible that I would have done exactly what other people did</italic> [when] <italic>joining gyms, which is to pay and not go, and I think well it&#x02019;s alright &#x02026;</italic> [laughs] <italic>at least if I pay I don&#x02019;t have to go ... I would have felt I&#x02019;d done enough in paying and it would have confirmed all my worst feelings about myself, but because I felt that I would be wasting a valuable resource I&#x02019;ve felt entirely motivated to do those first visits.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 59)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>These findings reveal how the vouchers were perceived to be more than a substitute means for payment, and symbolically functioned to blur the demarcation between the NHS &#x02014; considered a free health service but with limited resources &#x02014; and a commercial programme.</p></sec><sec><title>The value of clinical measurements</title><p>Although participants attending the commercial programme were weighed by the group leader when they attended meetings, they attributed very different meanings to measurements conducted by the research team at both the baseline and 3-month assessment appointments. These measurements were not only regarded as more accurate, but were invariably contextualised by what the participants felt was a clinical framing.</p><p>Although all participants acknowledged that they were overweight, the vast majority with a BMI &#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> did not recognise themselves as being obese. In contrast to themselves, participants described obese individuals in extreme terms such as &#x02018;<italic>elephantine</italic>&#x02019;, (Male, 63), &#x02018;<italic>housebound and</italic> [needing] <italic>someone else to wash them</italic>&#x02019;, (Male, 63), unable &#x02018;<italic>to get out of bed ... or go to the toilet</italic>&#x02019;, (Female, 34), &#x02018;<italic>like</italic> [you see on] <italic>these American</italic> [television] <italic>programmes&#x02019;,</italic> (Female, 59).</p><p>Unlike the term &#x02018;overweight&#x02019;, patients associated &#x02018;obesity&#x02019; with what they considered were far more serious health consequences. Therefore they expressed surprise when they were told that their weight would classify them as obese. As a result, some reported feeling more motivated to lose weight because their problem was suddenly one associated with ill health:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;So when I went to the first meeting of the experiment they showed me the chart and said &#x0201c;You&#x02019;re here and this is for obese&#x0201d;</italic> [laughs] <italic>&#x02026; before I thought I would be in the overweight category &#x02026; I definitely do not want to be in the obese category &#x02026; I guess you are in an unhealthy place &#x02026; whereas if I was only in the overweight category &#x02026; it would lack the fact that I&#x02019;m &#x02014; I was surprised &#x02026; that I&#x02019;m not somewhere where I want to be, &#x02026; I&#x02019;m so out of control that I don&#x02019;t even know that I&#x02019;m in a bad place &#x02026; so that was for me more motivational &#x02026; because I&#x02019;m so far on the chart, so far beyond what I thought I was, so not in control.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Male, 28)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Waist circumference, body fat percentage, and in some cases blood pressure and BMI were experienced as relatively novel and additional forms of measurement that provided a further &#x02018;shock&#x02019; factor not experienced when simply measuring body weight:
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018; [The weight charts] <italic>are the same that I&#x02019;ve seen many times over really, there was no surprise to me &#x02026;</italic> &#x02018;<italic>cos you know I&#x02019;m a serial weight loser and putter oner</italic> [laughs] <italic>so I&#x02019;ve seen it all &#x02026; The only thing I was interested in finding out was the percentage of my body fat because I&#x02019;ve never had any means of doing that &#x02026; that was a bit shocking &#x02018;cos I&#x02019;ve got a lot of body fat.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 34)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Tied to an explanation of reducing one&#x02019;s risk factors for disease, and extending to other ideas they held about the body and health, these measurements gave meaning to weight loss. Patients reported that their previous attempts to lose weight by attending a commercial weight-loss service had been driven more by appearance, and usually precipitated a special occasion or a holiday, and that they felt more committed to losing weight for measurable health improvements:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;When I got to the last few weeks before I knew I was coming back to be weighed, the only thing I really could focus on or think about was that I wanted to know my circumference around my waist &#x02026;</italic> [the researcher] <italic>said &#x0201c;You&#x02019;ve lost 15 centimetres which means you&#x02019;re out of the danger zone, you&#x02019;ve reduced to negligible your chance of getting diabetes&#x0201d;, that one fact was much more easy for me to digest &#x02026; and hold on to. I have lost weight and now I can see for myself all of the benefits &#x02026; So that really helps to sort of tie it down to something that&#x02019;s very, very tangible.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 48)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>The measurement visits conducted by the research team provided participants with a new visual language concerning weight loss. For example, they spoke about wanting to move out of the &#x02018;<italic>danger zone</italic>&#x02019; or &#x02018;<italic>dark red part of the graph.</italic>&#x02019; (Female, 48).
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;Putting it on more of a chart, my blood pressure and that, &#x02026; it&#x02019;s helped me</italic> [because] <italic>I saw the health benefits of it &#x02026; it reminds me what I&#x02019;m doing</italic> [and] <italic>how it&#x02019;s improved.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 37)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>By seeing their position on charts, participants felt that what it means to be &#x02018;healthier&#x02019; was made more concrete and they expressed a sense of accomplishment from seeing their position alter.</p></sec><sec><title>Attending the commercial programme as a &#x02018;patient&#x02019; and trial participant</title><p>Some participants reported that they had not attended a commercial programme before because they thought that the &#x02018;<italic>target audience</italic>&#x02019; were people who wished to lose weight to improve their &#x02018;<italic>appearance&#x02019;.</italic> (Male, 38).</p><p>Participants considered usual attendance at the commercial programme as more of a leisure activity, which, in a context of limited financial resources, was often viewed as a luxury rather than a necessity:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I&#x02019;d always put my family first and think, you know, we need that</italic> [money] <italic>somewhere else &#x02026; I&#x02019;d feel guilty that again my family is suffering because of my weight, and then they&#x02019;d go without again because of my problem.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 37)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Men also communicated gendered perceptions of the commercial programme as a &#x02018;<italic>knitting club</italic>&#x02019; or &#x02018;<italic>Women&#x02019;s Institute type of situation.</italic>&#x02019; (Male, 51). However, within the trial, the GP invitation to the commercial programme not only served to redefine weight loss as being a medical goal for those who previously thought their problems were primarily aesthetic, but also endorsed the programme as suitable for those who already wanted to lose weight for health reasons.</p><p>Patients were also motivated by the fact that they were attending meetings with people who, unlike them, were paying to attend:
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I need to embrace this opportunity, 12 weeks free, because it is expensive to go, you know, &#x000a3;5 a week &#x02026; my friend joined about a week before I did it.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 37)</attrib></disp-quote>
<disp-quote><p><italic>&#x02018;I feel a bit guilty to them &#x02018;cos &#x02026; they&#x02019;re paying to come here.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Female, 34)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>The vouchers, provided in an initial 12-week pack to those randomised to both commercial programme interventions, served to make explicit the time commitment required. This was contrasted with the open nature of commitment for non-referral attendees, who, instead of time, are encouraged to pursue a weight-loss goal.</p><p>Although those in the intervention arms valued the weekly weigh-in at the commercial programme meetings and reported that this influenced their daily food choices, the measurement visits at the research centre provided further motivation. Participants described this as a &#x02018;<italic>compound effect</italic>&#x02019; :
<disp-quote><p>&#x02018; [The measurement visit] <italic>doesn&#x02019;t contribute towards the weight loss but it did contribute towards attending Weight Watchers. So if you think about it, you&#x02019;ve got the day-to-day stuff where &#x0201c;Do I, am I going to eat a cupcake?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;No, because I&#x02019;ve got Weight Watchers coming up&#x0201d;. There&#x02019;s that motivation but there&#x02019;s also &#x0201c;Should I actually bother going to Weight Watchers? Well it takes about half an hour or more out of my time &#x02026; but I&#x02019;ve got the study coming up so I really should turn up. So you&#x02019;ve got the two different motivators &#x02026; So I think there is a compound effect there.</italic>&#x02019;</p><attrib>(Male, 38)</attrib></disp-quote></p><p>Participants also thought the 12- and 24-month measurement appointments would keep them on track once their 12/52-week programme had finished. In this sense, the follow-up measurements maintained a sense of commitment to weight loss and so, from their perspective, constituted part of the intervention.</p><p>Overall, features of trial participation meant that participants reported that attending the commercial programme during the trial was different from if they had been more usual attendees. Although this might only be conjecture on their part, it seems clear that apparently inconsequential features of the study, introduced to enable the trial to take place, nevertheless played an important symbolic role. In particular, the letter and vouchers served to authenticate the status of the participant as an NHS &#x02018;patient&#x02019; and, where relevant, shifted their views of weight to being primarily a health issue.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Summary</title><p>Primary care referral to a commercial programme aligns with patients&#x02019; understanding of being overweight or obese as states that may have negative health consequences, but are ostensibly lifestyle issues requiring a non-medical solution. Despite this, participants in this trial appeared to carry their interactions with their GP and the NHS (and research staff viewed as conduits of the former) through to their experiences of the commercial programme via such symbolic elements as the GP letter and vouchers, shaping their experiences outside the NHS environment. The letter from the GP endorsed participation in the commercial programme and engendered a sense of obligation, providing motivation to attend. The weekly vouchers were experienced as a symbolic resource that maintained a link with the GP, legitimised meeting attendance as a &#x02018;medical&#x02019; necessity rather than a luxury, and associated the programme with public funding and a sense of responsibility. Finally, the range of clinical measurements, in combination with a discussion about disease risk, provided participants with a new language through which they could acknowledge the seriousness of being overweight or obese and recognise the &#x02018;tangible&#x02019; health benefits of weight loss. While participants acknowledged the impact that body weight had on their health, they did not view the NHS as the most appropriate space to address their weight. The clinical framing nevertheless provided a validating impetus for participants to seek support in an overtly non-clinical domain that aligned with their perception of weight loss as a non-medical &#x02018;lifestyle&#x02019; issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A qualitative design with open-ended questions allowed participants to focus on aspects of their experience that were most important to them. Home interviews with a researcher not directly involved in the trial may have facilitated free expression. For pragmatic reasons, the current study only included participants from the Cambridge centre of the trial. However, within this centre, participants were purposely selected to maximise demographic diversity.</p><p>Although participants were informed that the trial and assessments were for research purposes and separate from both their GP and the commercial intervention, they did not always perceive these distinctions. This can be considered a limitation in the attempt to isolate the impact of the intervention. However, this &#x02018;limitation&#x02019; is likely present but not acknowledged in most similar studies, and it is important to identify influential contextual factors outside the intervention itself. For this reason, the current study evaluated the ways in which the intervention and the trial procedures impacted patient experience in order to suggest how both aspects can be leveraged by GPs in practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Previous studies have shown that people often distance themselves from the social stereotype of &#x02018;obesity&#x02019; and therefore do not acknowledge the degree to which they are overweight or the health risks associated with this.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This study supports previous findings that adults who are overweight or obese feel ambivalent about approaching GPs for help with weight loss and see community-based support groups as a more appropriate intervention.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>However, in contrast to comparative studies that reinforce the distinction between commercial and health service sectors,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> this study provides a more nuanced interpretation of primary care referral to commercial programmes, and shows how patients experience the partnership between the two sectors. The findings that the GP introduction by referral letter and the taking of clinical measurements at follow-up appointments may enhance the intervention experience echoes previous research that suggests &#x02018;free&#x02019; GP referral for services which normally cost people money often encourage participation.<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The current study also suggests that by being able to visualise their charted measurements with regard to disease risk helps people acknowledge their current weight status and the associated health consequences, providing a new language with which they can experience a sense of progress that verbal expressions of weight alone cannot provide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>This study found that the letter of invitation, sent to all eligible participants in the practice, but individually addressed and signed by their GP, was interpreted as a personalised medical recommendation. The use of trial support staff to take a small number of clinical measurements and give easy-to-understand visual feedback framed the intervention around clear health goals. Patients perceived these measurements as medical monitoring because they were copied to their GP. If the main WRAP trial confirms previous findings that commercial programmes are more effective than usual primary care services,<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> then it may be valuable to consider to what extent explicit GP and NHS linkage to commercial programmes may provide an additional &#x02018;active ingredient&#x02019; in treating obesity. Short follow-up appointments (similar to those provided by the trial), with clinical measurements fed back to the GP, could be implemented to potentially enhance attendance, adherence, and sustain intervention effects. Further research should explore the most effective way for practitioners to conduct referrals and monitor progress in order to maximise the benefits for patients participating in commercial programmes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge their Co-Investigators on the WRAP trial (Paul Aveyard, Jason Halford, Susan Jebb, Adrian Mander, and Marc Suhrcke) who helped to obtain funding and to design the main trial, and the research staff who facilitated participant recruitment (Abbey Child, Ann Thomson, and Melina Tsiountsioura).
