Exendin-4 (Exd-4) activates the glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor thereby decreasing serum glucose levels and body weight. In addition, Exd-4 has been shown to reduce renal and cardiac complications in experimental models of T2D. We hypothesized that treatment with Exd-4 would ameliorate the detrimental effects of maternal and diet-induced obesity on renal characteristics in offspring. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either normal or high-fat diet (HFD) for 6 weeks prior to pregnancy, during pregnancy and lactation, and their offspring were weaned to normal or HFD. The offspring were randomized to Exd-4 or placebo from weaning and their kidneys harvested at Week 9. We found that the kidneys of offspring from obese mothers, regardless of postnatal diet, had significantly increased markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. Exd-4 ameliorated the negative renal effects of maternal obesity and in particular, reduced renal inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis. In conclusion, maternal obesity has persisting effects on renal structure in the offspring. GLP-1 analogues are potentially useful for protecting against the deleterious effects of maternal obesity on renal physiology in offspring.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The metabolic consequences of obesity have been well described and include type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidaemia and hypertension.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is less often considered as part of the metabolic syndrome or an end-organ complication of obesity. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that CKD is increasing in parallel to the rising epidemic of obesity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. A recent study showed that the risk of CKD was over 2.5 times higher in obese individuals compared with normal-weight individuals after adjusting for confounding factors including diabetes and hypertension<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

Maternal obesity and its effects on offspring have raised considerable public interest, especially considering that adult progeny of obese mothers have a 22% increased risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and all-cause mortality independent of their own weight<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. This, along with similar other associations, gives precedence to the theory of the developmental origins of health and disease, which states that offspring&#x02019;s health is integrally related to maternal health as a result of long-lasting effects of <italic>in utero</italic> and early postnatal exposure<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. The effect of maternal obesity on the offspring risk of renal disease is less well characterized.</p><p>Weight reduction by conservative management alone has been repeatedly shown to be difficult to achieve and sustain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Therapeutic options to assist with weight loss and maintenance are limited and would be a useful adjunct to lifestyle change. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as Exendin-4 (Exd-4) are a class of medications used in the management of type 2 diabetes as they have potent glucose-lowering effects. GLP-1 is a naturally occurring incretin hormone secreted from the L-cells in the lower gut; which stimulates endogenous insulin secretion in a physiological and glucose-dependent manner. In addition, GLP-1 receptor agonists promote weight loss through a reduction in appetite and increased satiety. Of note, it is increasingly understood that GLP-1 receptor activation has renoprotective properties beyond glucose lowering, as demonstrated in both animal models and preliminary data from human studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that offspring of obese rat dams display increased fat mass, elevated blood triglyceride levels and glucose intolerance compared with those from lean rats, which is further exaggerated by consuming a high fat diet (HFD) after weaning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. The current study utilized a rodent model to investigate whether maternal obesity has detrimental renal effects on the offspring; in particular promoting CKD by altering glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis within the kidney. We hypothesized that the treatment of offspring with Exd-4 would reduce renal inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrotic changes induced by maternal obesity.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Effect of maternal obesity, HFD consumption and Exd-4 on weight and glucose tolerance in offspring</title><p>We have previously shown that maternal obesity and diet-induced obesity have important consequences on offspring metabolic outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. In the present sub-study, despite no difference in total body weight, offspring of obese mothers had increased retroperitoneal and epididymal fat deposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>). Conversely, the body weight of offspring fed HFD was significantly increased at 9 weeks alongside increased fat deposition (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1A&#x02013;C</xref>).

The kidneys of HFD-fed offspring of obese mothers had more extensive tubular damage compared with their chow-fed littermates (HH vs. HC p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Furthermore, PAS staining demonstrated significant glomerular structural changes including glomerulomegaly, mesangial expansion and tubular distortion in the HFD-fed offspring of obese mothers (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2C,D</xref>).

There was a trend towards lower MCP-1 expression following Exd-4 treatment in chow-fed offspring of the obese mothers; however this difference was not statistically significant.

Similar to what was observed in the kidney, serum MCP-1 was increased in the offspring of obese mothers by 1.5 fold compared to the control group (HC vs. CC p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4E</xref>). In addition, serum MCP-1 levels were greater in the HFD-fed offspring of obese mothers (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and treatment with Exd-4 ameliorated this rise (HHE vs. HH p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).

HFD feeding in the offspring of obese mothers gave rise to increased serum IL-6 levels, which was ameliorated by Exd-4 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3G</xref>). Furthermore, serum PAI-1 was increased by more than threefold when offspring of obese mothers were fed HFD (HH vs. HC p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3H</xref>), which was normalised by Exd-4 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).

Strikingly, these outcomes are observed even in the absence of HFD-induced obesity in postnatal life. This suggests a powerful effect of developmental programming on kidney health as a consequence of maternal obesity. In addition, treatment with Exd-4 is associated with protection against the deleterious effects of maternal obesity on the renal physiology of offspring. As such, this study is the first to show a beneficial effect of a GLP-1 analogue on the modulation of kidney health in adolescence in the setting of maternal obesity.</p><p>Obesity is a key player in the development of metabolic syndrome and is associated with a multitude of chronic complications. Of note, several recent studies have suggested that obesity, independent of diabetes, can cause renal damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. We found that maternal obesity gives rise to inflammatory, oxidative stress and fibrotic changes within the offspring kidney, which collectively, are likely to lead to the development of CKD later in life. Interestingly, the deleterious effects of maternal obesity on the kidneys of rat offspring were observed irrespective of postnatal diet. Furthermore, these adverse effects are independent of the body weight or glucose tolerance, which were not altered by maternal obesity at Week 9 in chow-fed offspring<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, developmental programming makes an important contribution towards kidney health.</p><p>Adipose tissue secretes chemokines and cytokines which induce an overall pro-inflammatory state in the body<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Many of these chemokines and cytokines have known associations with renal fibrosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. Our model of both maternal obesity and diet-induced obesity shows increased fat accumulation in fat depots (retroperitoneal and gonadal fat) as well as in the kidney. We found increased systemic inflammatory markers including: (1) MCP-1, an important chemokine secreted by the macrophages and key inflammatory mediator of renal fibrosis, (2) PAI-1, a known mediator of renal fibrosis in obesity, and (3) TGF-&#x003b2;1 which is an important regulator of inflammation and fibrosis in the kidney. The results of our study suggest that increased inflammation is a significant mediator of maternal obesity-induced kidney changes in the offspring. Given that the direct effect of the maternal milieu <italic>in utero</italic> and in early postnatal life has well passed by Week 9 in the rat offspring, we postulate that the effects of developmental programming on inflammatory pathways must be sustained to adult life.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that oxidative stress <italic>in utero</italic> may be a key event in response to abnormal maternal nutrition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Nutrient excess leads to mitochondrial dysfunction that in turns leads to obesity related pathologies, in part due to the harmful effects of oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Oxidative stress has been reported early on during embryogenesis in offspring of obese mice, with the oocytes and zygotes having increased mitochondrial membrane potential, higher levels of oxidative phosphorylation and increased ROS production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of several kidney diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Our study is the first to report the influence of maternal obesity on renal markers of oxidative stress suggesting that maternal obesity induces sustained activation of deleterious oxidative stress pathways in the offspring, rendering them vulnerable to develop kidney diseases.</p><p>GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs) are predominantly expressed in the &#x003b2;-cells of the pancreas, but are also expressed in many other tissues including the kidney, where they have been localized to the glomeruli and endothelial cells within the kidney<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. A recent study used autoradiographic labeling to demonstrate that the GLP-1R is predominantly located in the renal microvasculature in rats, namely afferent arterioles<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. Thus, GLP-1R modulation may have beneficial effects in the kidney. We found that GLP-1R was expressed in the rat kidney and importantly, its expression was not altered by maternal obesity, diet-induced obesity or Exendin-4 treatment. It was previously shown that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide suppresses the progression of diabetic nephropathy in mice, as demonstrated by reduced markers of renal fibrosis and decreased glomerular oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. In the present study, Exd-4 therapy significantly reduced many of the adverse effects of maternal obesity and HFD consumption on inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrotic changes in the kidney. We did not see overt nephropathy, most likely due to the animals&#x02019; young age at the time of harvest, which is equivalent to late adolescence. Further studies are required to investigate the long-term outcome of maternal obesity on the renal outcomes in such offspring.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that we were unable to fully determine whether the detrimental changes in the offspring&#x02019;s kidneys induced by maternal obesity correlates with an alteration in kidney function and whether Exd-4 minimized this potential effect. Renal function as measured by circulating cystatin C was not altered by maternal obesity or Exd-4. In this study, the kidneys of rat offspring were studied at postnatal Week 9. It is possible that with longer exposure time, renal functional changes may have been seen. This would be an interesting focus for future studies. However, increased inflammation, oxidative stress and fibrosis are all known precursors to the development of CKD and are integrally part of renal disease pathogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. In addition, recent evidence has suggested that structural kidney damage may preface frank impairment in kidney function, as evidenced by increased early interstitial fibrotic changes and podocyte damage in the absence of microalbuminuria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. We found evidence of early renal fibrosis, increased oxidative stress and inflammation within the kidneys of offspring exposed to maternal obesity. This detrimental effect on renal parameters was further exacerbated by diet-induced obesity in the offspring. Thus, our results strongly suggest that maternal obesity induces pathophysiologic changes in the kidneys which may predispose offspring to renal disease in later life.</p><p>In the current model, there are two possible explanations for the protective renal effects of Exd-4 treatment: (1) direct pleiotropic effects of GLP-1 receptor activation on the kidney by reduction in pro-inflammatory and antioxidant effects ameliorating fibrotic changes induced by HFD; or (2) alterations in whole body metabolic profile including weight loss, reduced blood lipids and improved glucose metabolism. To further explore the above possibilities, a systemic or kidney-specific GLP-1 receptor knockout animal could be utilized to determine whether the effect observed was due to a systemic or kidney specific mechanism. Regardless of whether the effect is directly or indirectly mediated, our study has clinical relevance given it shows the beneficial renal outcomes of treatment with Exendin-4. An overview of the potential mechanisms of Exd-4 therapy on kidney health in offspring exposed to maternal obesity with or without diet-induced obesity is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref>.</p><p>To conclude, obesity-related nephropathy is an important complication of overnutrition. Maternal obesity has a detrimental impact on kidney health. As the prevalence of obesity increases worldwide, it is of clinical significance to better understand the effect of maternal obesity on kidney health and find therapies that may ameliorate such detrimental effects. Our findings point towards GLP-1 receptor agonists as a potential novel therapy for the reduction of kidney damage associated with maternal obesity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal experiments</title><p>Virgin outbred female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (aged 9 weeks) were sourced from Animal Resource Centre (WA, Australia). The study protocol has been previously described<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Briefly, dams were fed standard rodent chow (11kJ/g, 14% fat, Gordon&#x02019;s Specialty Stockfeeds, NSW, Australia) or pellet HFD (20kJ/g, 43% fat; SF03-020, Speciality Feeds, WA, Australia) for 6 weeks prior to mating, throughout gestation and lactation. Only male offspring were studied given that previous studies have shown male gender to be more susceptible to renal damage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>. All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee (ACEC) of University of New South Wales (ACEC#09/3A) and complied with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes. At postnatal day 20 (normal weaning age), pups from lean dams were fed standard rodent chow diet (CC). Half of the pups from the obese dams within the same litter were fed chow (HC), while the other half was fed HFD (HH). Within each dietary cohort, half the rats were treated with daily injections of Exd-4 (15&#x003bc;g/kg/day i.p. Auspep, VIC, Australia) and the other half were treated with saline. This resulted in 6 experimental groups, CC, CCE, HC, HCE, HH, and HHE.</p><p>An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT) was performed on offspring at 8 weeks of age. After 5 hours fasting, a baseline glucose level was measured at time 0 using a blood glucose meter (Accu-Chek&#x000ae;, Roche Diagnostics, NJ, USA). Animals were then administered glucose (2g/kg i.p.) and blood glucose levels were measured at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes post-injection as previously described (19). Area under the curve (AUC) of the glucose levels over the time was calculated for each rat.</p><p>At 9 weeks of age, the rats were fasted for 5 hours before being deeply anesthetized with Pentothal&#x000ae; (0.1mg/g, i.p.
