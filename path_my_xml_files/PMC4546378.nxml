The method has been proven to be sensitive in detecting a drug&#x02019;s potential to cause fatal arrhythmias, yet lacks specificity [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. TQT studies denote significant cost to the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore valid assessments have been comprehensively discussed to integrate alternative methods in clinical trials [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136369.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, amendments or revisions of the S7B and E14 ICH guidelines were under discussion and current proposals [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] include a comprehensive in vitro pro-arrhythmia assay (CiPA) in combination with high precision ECG assessments in Phase I studies. Consequently, Intensive QT trials (IQT) have been developed, which resemble the TQT study designs in many aspects. These trials include triplicate ECGs and multiple collection time points, but they differ from a TQT trial in the smaller number of subjects, the omission of a positive control and at times the lack of a placebo arm.</p><p>Literature evidence has suggested that understanding the relationship between the plasma drug concentration and the QT interval can provide important information [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136369.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In 1976, the first study of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) modelling of drug effects on the QT interval was published by Galeazzi and co-workers where the effects of procainamide on the QT interval were reported [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Concentration-effect analysis may have particular value during early phase multiple ascending studies if high-quality ECGs and correlative PK testing can be regularly obtained. The time course analysis as described in ICH E14 has been increasingly supplemented by more sensitive PK-PD analyses [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Its application requires linearity between the PK-PD relationship concerning plasma concentrations of the drug and its effect on the QT interval without showing hysteresis as prerequisites.</p><p>In TQT studies, concentration-response modelling was initially based on the placebo-corrected change from baseline (double difference) [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it has recently been extended to parallel group designs [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] allowing for a placebo-corrected prediction of the drug effect at a given plasma concentration with an unbiased standard error. The estimate of a time effect can be used to show ECG assay sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136369.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This second point also makes the use of a model with time effect attractive for crossover studies [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe the application of a concentration-effect analysis validated by meal effects on the ECG to a four-way crossover Phase I study in order to investigate the PK, PD and safety of escalating single doses of E-52862.

Each period consisted of a placebo baseline ECG day (Day -1) and the treatment day (Day 1) (<xref rid="pone.0136369.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). There was at least a seven day washout interval between study drug administrations in Periods 1-4. The ECG measurements on Day -1 were taken at the corresponding clock time points as the ECG measurements and samples for PK analysis on Day 1. The addition of a baseline day enhanced the ECG assessments resulting in a study design which is very similar to a standard single dose crossover TQT study.</p><p>Since each subject received the 4 treatments, comparisons between treatment effects were made intra-individually reducing the anticipated variability of the time course analysis. On Days -1 and 1 standardised meals with similar nutritional value were served as follows: lunch (5 h post-dose), dinner (9 h post-dose). The average daily intake was of approximately 2000 kcal with an approximate carbohydrate:protein:fat:fiber ratio of 60:20:10:10% [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0136369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

All ECGs recorded during the study were stored electronically on the MUSE information system. Only ECGs recorded electronically at a stable heart rate were valid for QT interval measurements.</p><p>ECG recordings were made at the following time points, pre-dose, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-dose of each Period (1-4) after the subjects had been resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. Clinical staff ensured that subjects were awake during all ECG recordings to avoid autonomic QTc changes occurring during sleep. A semi-permanent skin marker was used to ensure consistent placement of the leads for consecutive study days. At each time point, the ECGs were recorded in triplicate, to reduce variance and improve the precision of measurement. The triplicates were performed at approximately one-minute intervals and each ECG recording (trace) lasted 10 seconds.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>ECG Analysis</title><p>Each electronic ECG data file contained the raw waveform ECG data as well as the result of the automated interval measurements performed by the Marquette 12SL ECG Analysis Program (MEAP), software which processes the data within and each of the ECG recorders.</p><p>All ECGs and their unconfirmed interval measurements were subsequently reviewed by qualified cardiologists following one of the methods listed in the ICH E14 Guidance for Industry document [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and ICH E14 Implementation Working Group Questions and Answers document [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] before any of the ECGs were used for the subsequent statistical analyses. This manual adjudication process applied in this study is also referred to in the ICH guidance and relevant literature as &#x0201c;manual over-read&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;computer-assisted&#x0201d;, or &#x0201c;semi-automated&#x0201d; ECG measurements.</p><p>The QT interval, RR interval and heart rate, PR interval and QRS duration, the presence or absence of U-waves, quantitative and qualitative ECG variations were assessed by cardiologists with extensive experience with manual on-screen over-reading with electronic callipers using the commercially available MUSE in its latest version to correct any implausible readings presented by the automated process. For all study ECGs (Periods 1-4), the over-reading cardiologists were blinded to time, date, treatment and any data identifying the subject. All ECGs pertaining to an individual volunteer were over-read by the same cardiologist to ensure consistency across all treatments. If manual adjustments of the automated measurement became necessary, a second cardiologist confirmed the assessment.</p><p>QT correction by Fridericia's formula (QTcF [QTcF = QT/RR<sup>0.33</sup>]) was used and an individual correction (QTcI) was derived from 12-lead Holter recordings taken for a 24 h screening to generate the baseline values of all four periods (i.e. the mean of all median values per subject per time point on the baseline Day -1) in addition to Fridericia's formula. For each subject, the best individual correction (QTcI) was estimated using linear and log-log-linear models using least square regression models in the following steps:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>If a model had the smallest absolute correlation coefficient between QTc and RR, the model was selected as the best model.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If correlation coefficients were equal, the model with the smallest absolute slope for the regression of QTc on RR was selected as the best correction method.</p></list-item><list-item><p>If slopes were equal, the log-log-linear model was selected as the best model.</p></list-item></list>

In each of them, the concentration of E-52862 or one of its five metabolites was used as an explanatory variable.</p><p>The first series of models was based on the difference to time-matched placebo of the change of QTcI from average baseline as dependent variable. A linear mixed effects model was used with period, sequence and sex as fixed effects and concentration of one of the six analytes (E-52862, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5) as covariate. A random intercept per subject was also included, and compound symmetry assumed. These series of models are appropriate for a crossover trial, where the time-matched difference to placebo can be obtained for each subject individually. However, an estimated time course corrected for plasma concentration is not allowed. A second series of models was defined as based on the change from average baseline, but without subtraction of the placebo value. Instead, placebo data were used in the model fit in addition to those obtained under the three doses of E-52862. For placebo, concentration values were set to 0. Since the time course (relative to the average baseline) is present in the change from average baseline data, time can and should be introduced as factor in the model [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. By doing so, the spontaneous time course can be estimated from all subjects and periods, and the regression coefficients for the plasma concentration ("slopes") are corrected for any time course effect and can therefore be considered equivalent to those obtained from "placebo-corrected" values. Apart from the models described above, models with additional random slopes were fitted. For the first series of models, i.e. those based on the difference to time-matched placebo, a model with fixed intercept set to 0 and random intercepts and slopes included was also used. Within the two series, the models with better Akaike information criterion (AIC) were to be used for predictions.</p><p>For each of the three doses, the geometric mean across subjects of the intra-individual observed maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) values of each analyte was computed. In agreement with current practice [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], the two-sided 90% CI for the predicted effect at this concentration taken for the appropriate analyte was calculated. This analysis ignores the variability of the C<sub>max</sub> estimate and therefore there is a risk that the CI for the predicted value is biased. Therefore it was planned that, should the point estimate of the effect at this C<sub>max</sub> be &#x0003e; 5 ms, the CI would be recalculated using bootstrap methods that take into account the random nature of the mean C<sub>max</sub>. All analyses described above were also repeated for Fridericia's correction.</p><p>A test for assay sensitivity based on the predicted effect of lunch served at 5 h was also specified. Based on the analysis of the change from average baseline, two sided 95% CIs for the differences between the two postprandial time points 6 and 8 h to pre-dose were to be completely below nought and the point estimate for the difference was to be well below -5 ms. In the sense of a Bonferroni correction, 95% CIs were used instead of 90% ones in order to correct for multiplicity introduced by the two time points.</p><p>The initial analysis were performed using SAS version 9.2. For the supplemental analysis R version 2.13 [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and in particular the nlme package [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] were used.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec014"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec015"><title>Subject Demographics</title><p>This study was carried out for a period of 7 weeks from the date of first enrolment to the date of last follow-up.

The results of the QTc analysis show that a single dose of 500 mg, 600 mg, and 800 mg E-52862 had no QTc prolonging effect. Instead, a small tendency for a shortening of the QTc was observed (<xref rid="pone.0136369.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>).</p><p>Anticipated plasma concentrations of E-52862 associated with analgesic activity, estimated from preclinical models of pain, suggest that the estimated therapeutic dose range for E-52862 in humans based on C<sub>max</sub> should be around 100-400 mg and estimated by AUC could be as low as 20-150 mg [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Food did not appear to affect the extent of absorption of E-52862, but seemed to delay the absorption rate (unpublished data). The doses administered in this study and the resultant plasma exposures were clearly higher than those expected to be used in efficacy trials and exposures achieved should cover the exposures anticipated in patient trials. In any event, the 800 mg dose showed a much higher incidence of adverse events and it would appear that the range of doses used in this trial would be difficult to exceed in a single dose healthy volunteer trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Linear mixed effects model analyses</title><p>The aim of this research was to use a concentration-effect analysis and apply it to a four-way crossover Phase I study to investigate the PK, PD and safety of escalating single doses of a S1RA E-52862 and to use the time course effect of a meal on the ECG as means of testing assay sensitivity. A statistically significant shortening of the QTc was observed at the two available postprandial time points of 6 and 8 h post dose or 1 and 3 h following a meal. This is consistent with our previous work where we have demonstrated that food produces a reliable and consistent QTc shortening effect with a slight variation depending on the heart rate correction used [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which arises from the postprandial increase in heart rate. The change in QTc was shown to be closely correlated with the release of C-peptide in response to raising blood glucose concentrations after a meal [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as a result of a physiological response rather than an effect of a blocking drug. In this previous study the concentration-effect analysis has confirmed a QTcF shortening effect with increasing C-peptide concentration [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Also concordant with these findings is the fact that correlated with an increase of heart rate, a QTc shortening was observed for 4 h after a first meal by Hnatkova et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Further analysis of baseline data showed that, in all 4 periods, the intra-subject variability for 6 and 8 h supports the robustness of this method and consistency of the physiological response triggered by food (<xref rid="pone.0136369.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 File</xref>).</p><p>The results showed that for both time points, 6 and 8 h, the 95% CIs for the difference to pre-dose were narrow, similar and clearly below 0. These analyses further support the premise that if pre-planned, a carbohydrate rich meal could be a good candidate for assessment of assay sensitivity in a non C-peptide deficient (Type I diabetes) study population.</p><p>This study also suggests that linear mixed effects modelling might be particularly useful in early phase dose-escalation studies when assessing the relationship between drug/metabolite plasma concentration and time-matched, baseline-corrected drug-placebo difference in the QT interval. In particular, it should be reinforced that this test for assay sensitivity is based on the same data as the analysis of the drug effect, not on a separate positive control arm. The concentration-effect method used for this study is applicable to any class of medicines, single or multiple doses, irrespective of half-life and large PK variability, including food effects on the PK. Compared to a per time point analysis, this method is more powerful in cases where PK between subjects differs due to variations in absorption or metabolism. Our data also indicate that the fixed algorithm QTcF heart rate correction seems to perform better than QTcI. This might be explained by the additional random variability introduced by the estimation of the individual correction coefficients.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec026"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides further evidence that E-52862 has no QTc prolonging effects. The assay sensitivity of the study was confirmed by using the effects of food on QTc.</p><p>The findings from this study show similar results from the well-established per time point analysis and concentration effect modelling methods: absence of any QTc prolongation of regulatory concern and a small tendency for a QTc shortening effect. The power of model based predictions becomes evident when comparing the confidence intervals shown in <xref rid="pone.0136369.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> to those shown in <xref rid="pone.0136369.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>. In this crossover study, the concentration analysis based on placebo-corrected values appears to be a better choice due to model simplicity. However, the concentration-effect analysis based on the change from baseline is a powerful alternative to the analysis based on the time-matched difference of placebo. This approach can provide an opportunity for early clinical information on the pro-arrhythmic risk of new drugs as discussed in Ferber et al. [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>This work further demonstrates that the value of IQT studies is significantly enhanced by the analysis of food effects allowing the benchmarking of the ECG data against a reproducible physiological probe for assay sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Although ICH guideline E14 does not specify the use of moxifloxacin as a positive control, it has been the most commonly used positive control and the effects on QT interval have been well documented [<xref rid="pone.0136369.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Currently no method has been accepted to replace this pharmacological positive control. Here we suggest that a standardised meal may be a good alternative for positive control in a situation where a separate arm is not available for the use of moxifloxacin, as in this particular case where a retrospective analysis was conducted, or in a typical Phase I SAD and/or MAD study which will not benefit from a pharmacologic control.</p><p>An advantage of the use of food as positive control is the fact that assay sensitivity is tested on the same dataset as the effect of interest. However, more experience from other studies would be desirable to further confirm the appropriateness of this method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136369.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136369.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136369.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136369.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0136369.s003"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>QTc changes at 6 and 8h on Day -1.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0136369.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the following individuals involved in ESTEVE for their contributions to the study development and/or manuscript review: Adelaida Morte, Alberto Puyada, Jesus Cebrecos, Montserrat Abadias, Sebasti&#x000e1;n Videla, Soledad Casals (Clinical Investigation); Jose-Maria Cendr&#x000f3;s, Gregorio Encina, Marisol Escriche (ADME and Bioanalysis); and Anna Vaqu&#x000e9;, Neus Gasc&#x000f3;n (Drug Safety and Pharmacovigilance).</p><p>We would also like to thank Sara Fernandes for her participation in writing and technical editing of the manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0136369.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
