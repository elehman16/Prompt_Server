Anxiety and Depression scale consists of 14 items and two subscales of anxiety and depression. Each item is a set of 4-point calibration, and a score of 8 or greater on one or both of the subscales indicates the presence of a depressive or anxiety disorder. Completion of the questionnaire takes only a few minutes. The developers aimed to discard all ambiguous somatic symptoms such as dizziness and lethargy and instead comprised the depression subscale around the psychopathology of anhedonia and the anxiety subscale based on the cognitive symptoms of anxiety. The HADS has been found to perform reliably in psychiatric, nonpsychiatric, and well populations as a screening tool;[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] however, its use as a diagnostic instrument for research may be inappropriate.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In a study in Iranian patients, the Iranian version of the HADS was found to be acceptable to almost all patients (99%).

Forty-eight patients with a recent MI had been included in this trial in two equal groups of intervention and control.</p><p>Setting the patients on educating the patients to planning exercise schedules, modifying wrong beliefs, changing lifestyle, and a date to return to work into an action plan, together with reinforcing controllable causal attributions were the main component of the intervention in this study. Emphasizing on the nature of atherosclerosis and muscle damage, modifying wrong beliefs, and explaining that heart disease is a chronic condition and need to change lifestyle were the another components of our intervention.</p><p>The intervention significantly improved the speed of return to work, physical health, depression and anxiety, and illness perception after 3 months compared to the control group. In other studies, it was found that increasing illness perception can lower patient anxiety and depression and improved patients&#x02019; information regarding MI. In these studies, it was indicated that patients who received the intervention felt more prepared to leave the hospital and reported higher intentions to attend rehabilitation classes than the control group. They reported greater increases in exercise and fewer calls to the general practitioner or hospital relating to their heart condition which could obtain by the following patients in our study.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In terms of illness perceptions, the intervention increased patients&#x02019; feeling of coherence about their condition, and this remained over the course of the 3-month follow-up. The intervention also significantly strengthened patients&#x02019; causal attributions for the heart attack to high cholesterol and lack of exercise in comparison to the control group. These changes in coherence and causal attributions gave the patients a coherent illness model on which to base their recovery and modifiable causal attributions and made them to have more physical health score and lowered anxiety and depression.</p><p>Regarding quality of life as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, if the physical health score in intervention group is better on follow-up, the quality of life scores decreased in both intervention and control groups in all domains during 3 month follow-up in comparison to the base scores. This finding shows that MI as a catastrophic accident has a serious side effect on all aspects of the life of affected patients and returning to pre-MI situation needs more time and rehabilitations.</p><p>Causal attributions to internal and controllable factors have been linked to faster return to work and improving depression and anxiety about the disease and changed lifestyle.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In a previous research, attributions to fate and luck predicted poor prognosis and lowered functioning in 12 years following of a group of MI patients.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Previous studies showed illness perceptions are well recognized as a target for treatment,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and illness perception interventions have shown promising results for patients with acute[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and chronic conditions.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>It is useful to consider why, in contrast to the previous trials, control perceptions were not changed. One possible reason is that the patient education about their disease is not performed routinely in hospitals which were studied and this fact is due to the high patient load in these centers and not having a systematized program of education after MI. Moreover, heart disease has been believed as disaster event in Iran, which can influence patient's lifestyle more than the other diseases.</p><p>The causal attributions have been explained much more than hereditary factors which may reflect a greater understanding of the cause of the patient's condition that could reduce anxiety associated with not knowing what caused the event. Having a solid causal framework could also increase the match between illness perceptions and the need for treatment and lifestyle modification. While a positive family history cannot be changed, recognizing a high genetic risk may make the patient more motivated to reduce other risk factors that are modifiable, such as high cholesterol, through exercise, diet, and medication.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the intervention was very brief, but it had some positive outcomes. This demonstrates that a brief education regarding illness perception for the MI patient can improve their understanding of the MI and lessen their anxiety and depression about the condition and improves them to return to work faster. Moreover, our study was based on bedside intervention which can have more influence on the patient's illness perception, also the length of intervention classes in our study was half-an-hour for 3 consecutive days. However, in other studies, the method of intervention was different that lead to have a less positive influence on the illness perceptions. Yan <italic>et al</italic>. used telephone follow-up intervention,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Broadbent <italic>et al</italic>. used one half-hour patient-and-spouse session,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and Williams <italic>et al</italic>. studied on type D personality.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Moreover, increasing illness perception could be more cost benefits due to decreasing the rehospitalization, mortality, and increase objective health outcomes by preparing them to return to work faster.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Recent studies in primary care highlight the importance of patients&#x02019; beliefs and emotional responses to their illness as being important in influencing their satisfaction with the consultation, reassurance following negative medical testing, and future health-care use. Recent research shows illness perceptions to have associations with a number of outcomes in chronic illness including self-management behaviors and quality of life. As yet, however, few interventions have been developed designed to change illness perceptions and improve illness outcomes.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</p><p>Illness perceptions influence the way, in which patients cope and their self-management of the illness. Illness perceptions can be assessed quite easily and directly, they inform health-care providers about the psychosocial responses of patients toward their illness, they are responsive to change in the clinical encounter or through self-management intervention training. Exploring patient's illness perceptions, therefore, is a crucial component of good clinical care.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Limitation</title><p>First, patients were selected from different hospitals in Isfahan and Kashan cities, so the results of the study may have limited generalizability.

However, our results showed that the quality of life of patients has not been affected as much as other studied variable which needs long-term follow-up.
