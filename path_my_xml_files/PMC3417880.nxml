Euflexxa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (high molecular weight hyaluronate), a bioengineered high molecular weight hyaluronan, has been shown to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with knee osteoarthritis. There is also support for the use of hyaluronate injection for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain associated with osteoarthritis or rotator cuff damage. This small-scale exploratory study was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high molecular weight hyaluronate for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain associated with osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects with glenohumeral osteoarthritis and chronic pain (n = 27) received one injection per week for 3 weeks of high molecular weight hyaluronate and were assessed for changes in pain (100 mm visual analog scale [VAS]), range of motion, and the subject&#x02019;s and physician&#x02019;s global assessment over 26 weeks. Subjects were also assessed for pain, stiffness, and physical functioning using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC). Finally, responses were evaluated using modified Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT)-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Proposition D criteria.

A survey of 312 general practice patients in the United Kingdom indicated that 31%&#x02013;48% had shoulder pain depending on the definition used, and 27% of all respondents had shoulder pain regardless of the definition.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-mder-4-099">1</xref> Results summarized in a comprehensive review of shoulder disorders indicated that the annual incidence of this condition is about 7%, the 1-year prevalence is 51%, and the lifetime prevalence is approximately 10%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-mder-4-099">2</xref></p><p>Chronic shoulder pain can result from bursitis, tendinitis, rotator cuff tear, adhesive capsulitis, impingement syndrome, necrosis, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and degenerative joint disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-mder-4-099">3</xref> Rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, and glenohumeral osteoarthritis are all common causes. Analysis of 692 office visits for shoulder pain collected through the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1993 to 2000 indicated that rotator cuff syndrome of the shoulder was the most common diagnosis (9.6%), followed by shoulder pain not otherwise specified (8.5%) and osteoarthritis (5.6%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-mder-4-099">4</xref> Degenerative joint disease of the shoulder is also common. The shoulder is the third most common joint to require surgical reconstruction after the knee and hip.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-mder-4-099">5</xref> The prevalence of idiopathic adhesive capsulitis ranges from 0.2% to 5.0% and it is most common in elderly patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-mder-4-099">6</xref></p><p>Effective treatment of chronic shoulder pain depends on an accurate diagnosis of the more common etiologies, ie, rotator cuff disorders, adhesive capsulitis, acromioclavicular osteoarthritis, glenohumeral osteoarthritis, and instability. Activity modification and analgesic medications comprise the initial treatment in most cases. If this does not lead to improvement, or if the initial presentation is of sufficient severity, a trial of physical therapy that focuses on the specific diagnosis is indicated. Combined steroid and local anesthetic injections can be used alone or as an adjuvant to physical therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-mder-4-099">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-mder-4-099">8</xref> There is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of oral pharmacologic treatments for shoulder arthritis. There is also insufficient evidence to determine whether intra-articular steroid injection is effective for the treatment of glenohumeral osteoarthritis. As few as 20% of patients with chronic shoulder pain self-report complete recovery after therapeutic intervention, and current recommendations support few nonsurgical options for the treatment of shoulder osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-mder-4-099">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-mder-4-099">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-mder-4-099">10</xref></p><p>There is limited support for the use of hyaluronan injection for the treatment of chronic shoulder pain associated with osteoarthritis or rotator cuff damage. Meta-analysis of results from 19 randomized controlled trials (2120 participants) revealed that intra-articular injection of hyaluronate can decrease symptoms of chronic painful shoulder. This treatment was associated with reductions in pain and improvements in total functional scores.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-mder-4-099">11</xref> Results from a study of 30 consecutive patients with idiopathic glenohumeral osteoarthritis who failed to respond to standard conservative measures and then received weekly intra-articular hyaluronate injections over 3 weeks in their affected shoulders indicated that this treatment significantly improved pain at 6-month follow-up.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-mder-4-099">12</xref> A study of 660 patients with persistent shoulder pain and limitations resulting from glenohumeral joint osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tear, and/or adhesive capsulitis in whom conventional therapy failed and who received either intra-articular hyaluronate or phosphate- buffered saline solution, was conducted, with patient follow-up for 26 weeks. Patients who received hyaluronate had greater pain relief than control subjects, and this effect was driven by results from patients with osteoarthritis. There was no significant benefit of treatment in patients with either rotator cuff tendonitis or adhesive capsulitis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-mder-4-099">13</xref> Results from 93 elderly patients with rotator cuff tear arthropathy indicated that treatment with hyaluronate significantly decreased symptoms for 4 months.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-mder-4-099">14</xref> Intra-articular hyaluronate injection was also shown to decrease pain and improve range of motion and ability to accomplish daily activities in a study of 51 patients with rotator cuff lesions but no tears.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-mder-4-099">15</xref></p><p>Euflexxa<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (1% sodium hyaluronate) is a highly purified high molecular weight hyaluronate preparation produced by bioengineering and extracted from bacterial cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-mder-4-099">16</xref> It has been shown to be safe and effective for treatment of patients with knee osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-mder-4-099">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-mder-4-099">18</xref> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of high molecular weight hyaluronate using three intra-articular injections for treatment of chronic shoulder pain associated with glenohumeral osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a nonrandomized, open-label study conducted in compliance with and according to 21 CRF Parts 50, 54, 56, and 812. The final protocol was approved by the Sterling local institutional review board. The study, conducted at a single center, aimed to enroll 25 subjects. All subjects were required to be 30&#x02013;79 years of age, provide written informed consent, have shoulder pain for at least 6 months but less than 5 years, with a pain intensity score &#x0003e;5, and be willing to discontinue all pain medications 4 hours before each clinic visit. Twenty-seven of 32 subjects recruited for the study met these criteria and had a diagnosis of osteoarthritis confirmed by radiographs taken within the previous 6 months and chronic pain with osteoarthritis as the primary source. Enrolled subjects also had a limited shoulder range of motion in at least one direction for the following active range of motions: internal rotation 60&#x000b0;, external rotation of 80&#x000b0;, or abduction with scapula fixed of 80&#x000b0;, and had an active range of motion of at least 40% in all directions. The pain medication regimen must have been stable for at least 1 month before treatment and subjects agreed to maintain pain medication doses within &#x000b1; 30% of the baseline dose during the course of the study.</p><p>Subjects were excluded if they had a history of full-thickness rotator cuff tear or joint effusion, a diagnosis of chronic acromioclavicular disease, active epicondylitis, or active carpal tunnel disease, had more than two corticosteroid injections in the previous 3 months, or had an infection or inflammatory condition of the trial shoulder. Other grounds for exclusion were acute or inflammatory arthropathy in the trial shoulder, history of systemic inflammatory arthropathies, diagnosis of cancer within 5 years, receipt of any hyaluronate agent or other chondroprotective agents in the trial shoulder, hypersensitivity to hyaluronate products, eggs, birds, or feathers, and history of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, or a psychiatric condition, that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with participation in the study. Subjects were also excluded for any medical condition that might increase the risk associated with intra-articular injections or other concomitant diseases that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of the trial treatment. Individuals involved in litigation involving workers&#x02019; compensation, who were pregnant, planning to become pregnant or lactating, or who had participated in a clinical trial within the past 4 weeks were also excluded. All subjects received three injections (one each, in weeks 0 [baseline], 1, and 2 of high molecular weight hyaluronate (2.5 mL each) using standard injection techniques in the anterior or posterior approach. Subjects were evaluated at screening and baseline, and at weeks 1, 2, 6, 14, 26, and 27 (last evaluation by telephone).</p><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Efficacy assessments included: pain, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, and 26; range of motion, measured as a percentage at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, and 26; subject&#x02019;s global assessment, measured on a five-point scale (higher score corresponds to worse condition) at weeks 3, 6, 14, and 26; physician&#x02019;s global assessment, measured on a 100 mm visual analog scale at the same times; internal and external rotation of the shoulder and scapula degrees, measured at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, and 26; and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain, stiffness, and physical functioning measured at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 14, and 26. Responses to treatment were also evaluated using modified Outcome Measures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT)-Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) Proposition D criteria. A high response was defined as &#x02265;50% or &#x02265;20-point improvement in pain as measured by the 100 mm visual analog scale, or in range of motion as measured by the 100-point American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) shoulder score of &#x02265;50% and absolute change of &#x02265;20 mm. Moderate improvement was defined as having met at least two of the following: pain reduction &#x02265;20% and absolute change &#x02265;10 points; ASES shoulder score &#x02265;20% and a change of &#x02265;10 points on a 100-point scale; and/or subject global assessment &#x02265;20% and absolute change &#x02265;10 points.
