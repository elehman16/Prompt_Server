To date, no information exists about the learning curve of Roboflex Avicenna compared to fURS without the robotic device. The use of flexible ureterorenoscopes demands specific skills acquisition during a training period. It has been demonstrated that surgeons can become familiar with a specific surgical procedure and improve their skills through simulators by repetitive training in a stress-free environment [<xref rid="cit0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Recently, it has been showed that a new simulator for ureteroscopy, the Kidney-box (K-box<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Porg&#x000e8;s-Coloplast), represents a valid training model for initiate medical students to flexible ureteroscopy [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the acquisition of basic ureteroscopy skills with and without Roboflex Avicenna by subjects with no prior surgical training, using the K-box<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> simulator.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec2"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>Ten 5<sup>th</sup>-year medical students were voluntarily recruited from Pierre and Marie Curie University of Paris.

Simulators can actively improve surgeons&#x02019; skills and may possibly accelerate this path. When comparing simulation vs non-simulation fURS training, Hu et al. showed in a cohort of 36 medical students, that those participants with previous training experience in transparent and non-transparent models performed objectively better than those without it. The analysis also showed an even better performance in the group with transparent simulators, with all differences being statistically significant [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A comparison between virtual reality and animal models reported that after a two month training period, all of their 36 participants evaluated by an objective qualitative scale, acquired adequate skills to perform a basic fURS independently of the simulator used [<xref rid="cit0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>In this study we used the K-box<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> simulator (Porg&#x000e8;s-Coloplast) which is an artificial model made of four different boxes that reproduces all anatomic variability of the upper urinary tract. This is a non-transparent model that permits the trainee to handle the actual ureteroscope while looking at a monitor with real time vision transmission.</p><p>The K-box<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> has proven to be a valid simulator to learn fURS in a prospectively randomized study that compared a non-trained control group with trainees that underwent a ten day practice experience (five days to learn the flexible ureteroscope handling and five more days to practice how to catch and release stones with a nitinol basket) [<xref rid="cit0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The comparison between groups made by an experienced endourologist with the objective endoscopic skill scale used in this paper (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t0001">Table 1</xref>), revealed that all scores obtained by trained students were significantly higher compared to non-trained students. Also, trained students performed the exercises significantly faster than the control group.</p><p>As for the recent introduction of robotic fURS [<xref rid="cit0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], there is no evidence in the literature about the learning curve of this technique. Also there is no evidence about simulation of neither the newly robotic fURS nor comparisons between skills gained comparing robotic and standard fURS simulations.</p><p>We conducted the first prospective randomized trial in the literature comparing the simulation between robotic and standard fURS. In our study, ten medical students after ten training sessions were able to acquire good ureteroscopic skills in a simulator model both in robotic and standard fURS. The skills were evaluated according the validation tool: Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills for surgical residents (OSATS) that analyzes the knowledge of the procedure, the instrument handling and the trainees&#x02019; competence [<xref rid="cit0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The results demonstrate the rapid acquisition of ureteroscopic skills for trainees with no prior surgical training, and therefore the efficacy of training models in fURS.</p><p>Moreover, no major significant differences were seen between the groups, except for the stability item that was better in the robotic group for the first exercise, although it took the same group longer time to perform the second exercise.</p><p>These data potentially suggest similar learning curves for robotic and standard fURS in a training model that may later maximize the surgeons&#x02019; skills and support the trainers&#x02019; proficiency and excellence. Nevertheless, these results should be considered with caution because our study certainly presents some limitations due to low numbers of students in each group and, consequently, a lack of adequate statistical power; but to our best knowledge, this is the first study that compares the acquisition of endourological skills with and without Roboflex Avicenna in a simulator model.</p><p>Further investigation with a wider cohort of participants is needed to establish the real lack of statistical differences in the acquisition of basic ureteroscopic skills with and without robotic fURS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>According to these preliminary results, the acquisition of basic ureteroscopic skills with and without robotic fURS in
