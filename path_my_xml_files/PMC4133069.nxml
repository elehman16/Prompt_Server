However, the notion that <italic>de qi</italic> must be achieved for maximum benefit has not been confirmed by modern scientific evidence. This study aims to compare the efficacy of acupuncture with either strong (intended to elicit <italic>de qi</italic>) or weak stimulation among patients with allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This study compares real versus sham acupuncture in 140 patients with a history of persistent allergic rhinitis (PER) or intermittent allergic rhinitis (IAR) and with a positive skin prick test (SPT). The trial will be conducted in the Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (China). In the study, patients will be randomly assigned into two groups by computer-generated randomization and assessed prior to treatment. They will then receive 12 sessions of treatments for 4 consecutive weeks and have a follow-up phase lasting 12 weeks. The main outcome measures include the primary and secondary indicators. Primary indicators are subjective symptoms scores as evaluated by visual analogue scales (VAS), rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaires (RQLQ), and the Modified Massachusetts General Hospital acupuncture sensation scale, Chinese version (C-MMASS). The secondary indicators are the results of laboratory examinations, such as serum allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE) nasal inflammatory cells counts (mast cells, eosinophils, and T cells), and nitric oxide concentration in nasal excretion. The use of anti-allergic medication will also be recorded as one of the secondary indicators. Furthermore, adverse events will be recorded and analyzed. Intention-to-treat analysis (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analysis will be performed to test and verify the results in this trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this trial will demonstrate the efficacy of using acupuncture to treat allergic rhinitis and verify whether the effectiveness of acupuncture is related to the needle sensation <italic>de qi</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org/usercenter/project/edit.aspx?proj=5399">ChiCTR-TRC-13003594</ext-link> (registered on 16 August 2013, and the first patient was randomized on 27 September 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1745-6215-15-301) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Allergic rhinitis</kwd><kwd><italic>De qi</italic></kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a symptomatic disorder of the nose resulting from an immunoglobulin E (IgE) -mediated immunological reaction to allergen exposure. Its major symptoms include rhinorrhea, nasal itching, obstruction, and sneezing, all of which are reversible either spontaneously or with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. AR has become a major health problem worldwide. It has been estimated by the ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma) 2008 document that over 600 million patients from all countries, in all ethnic groups, and of all ages suffer from AR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It dramatically impacts quality of life (QOL) and creates a high economic burden. The conventional treatment of AR symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching, includes the use of intranasal corticosteroids, oral antihistamines with or without decongestants, immunotherapy, and education [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A remarkable number of patients with AR are not satisfied with conventional medical treatment for they repeatedly experience side effects and incur additional healthcare costs. As an available and affordable treatment choice, acupuncture has been accepted as a therapeutic option for relieving symptoms of AR in China and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>However, studies on the efficacy of acupuncture in patients with AR have yielded inconclusive results. For example, Choi <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] stated that active acupuncture showed a significantly greater effect on symptoms of allergic rhinitis than sham acupuncture, while Magnusson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] found that there were no differences in clinical symptoms which had been seen between active versus sham acupuncture. At the same time, a number of trials have the same situation in migraine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], low back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and some other diseases. All of those trials did not find verum acupuncture more effective than sham acupuncture and did not emphasize that the verum acupuncture group must have the needle sensation of <italic>de qi</italic>.</p><p><italic>De qi</italic> is an internal compound sensation of soreness, tingling, fullness, aching, coolness, warmth, heaviness, and a radiating sensation at and around acupoints, and is elicited by manipulation of the needles (rotated as well as being moved both upward and downward). According to the traditional theory and clinical practice, <italic>de qi</italic> is one of the fundamental characteristics of acupuncture. The importance of <italic>de qi</italic> was first mentioned <italic>circa</italic> 100 BC, in the Huangdi Neijing (The Yellow Emperor&#x02019;s Classic of Internal Medicine). For example, Ling Shu (chapter 1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] reads, &#x02018;For acupuncture to be successful, the qi must arrive (qi zhi). Acupuncture&#x02019;s effects come about like the clouds blown away by the wind.&#x02019; Another example is in Ling Shu (chapter 9) where it is advised that &#x02018;The acupuncturist should devote all his/her concentration to the needle, keep the needle on the surface and move it gently, until the qi has arrived (qi zhi).&#x02019; There is a long-held belief in the theory of acupuncture that the intensity of the stimulus must reach a certain threshold to elicit <italic>de qi</italic>, which plays a pivotal role in achieving the best therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. So far, more and more studies have begun to assess <italic>de qi</italic> by using different scales, and to investigate the relationship between <italic>de qi</italic> and the therapeutic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, this long-held belief has not been confirmed by sufficient evidence from randomized controlled trials about AR.</p><p>As mentioned above, we have designed a randomized, double blind, large scale clinical trial to compare the efficacy of acupuncture with either strong (intended to elicit <italic>de qi</italic>) or weak stimulation among patients with AR. The design and methodologies of this study have been approved by the Sichuan Regional Ethics Review Committee on Traditional Chinese Medicine with an ethics approval number of 2013KL-025.

At the same time, television advertisements will be broadcast on local channels to promote study participation. Advertisements will also be published in local newspapers. Printed recruitment posters will be posted in the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>During the treatment process, all participants will be explained the meaning of acupuncture and <italic>de qi</italic> by the acupuncturists in the same way. Both the <italic>de qi</italic> and control group participants will receive acupuncture treatments respectively, 3 times a week for a total of 12 sessions over 4 weeks. The same number and type of needles (Hwato disposable sterile acupuncture needles Suzhou Medical Supplies Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China) will be used for both groups. The needle selected was 0.30 mm in diameter and the length of the needle selected varied according to the point location. Needle sites in both active and sham acupuncture groups will be swabbed with 75% alcohol before insertion. On withdrawal of the needle, dry sterilized cotton balls will be firmly applied to the insertion points. Medications which could affect the allergic rhinitis symptoms are not permitted.</p><p>In the <italic>de qi</italic> group, the needle was inserted transversely, obliquely, or perpendicularly depending on the acupoints selected with 10 to 30 mm in depth. The acupuncturist will manipulate the needles manually after insertion, using techniques such as lifting, thrusting, and twirling, until <italic>de qi</italic> was achieved. The needles will be left in place for 30 minutes. During the treatment session, the patient will be asked about <italic>de qi</italic> every 10 minutes and the needles will be manipulated to maintain the intensity of the sensation (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In the control group the needles will be inserted to a depth of 3 to 5 mm perpendicularly to the skin and left in place for 30 minutes without manipulation. Patients in the other treatment group are treated in different rooms. All sessions for each patient were performed by the same acupuncturist.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

These acupoints (bilateral: Yingxiang-LI20, Hegu-LI4, Quchi-LI11, Zusanli-ST36, unilateral: Yintang -EX-HN3) are selected according to the &#x02018;WHO Standard Acupuncture Point Location&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. According to traditional acupuncture theories, we know that the key pathogenesis of AR is an invasion of pathogenic agents such as cold, wind, and damp, which lead to the imbalance of the large intestine, stomach meridian, or governor vessel. Thus, the most frequently used specific acupoints for these meridians would be selected in this trial according to a previous review of ancient and modern literature. Yingxiang (LI20) is considered as a specific point on Yangming&#x02019;s large intestine meridian of hand. Hegu (LI4) is the source point of the large intestine meridian. Therefore, LI20, ST36, and EX-NH3 are selected to disperse pathologic <italic>Qi</italic> and blood from these meridians and improve the function of the nose and sinuses. The ancient Chinese believed that Yangming is a meridian abundant with blood and <italic>Qi</italic> and is the acquired foundation. Zusanli and Quchi will be used to fortify the spleen and replenish lung <italic>Qi</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics</title><p>This trial is performed according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (Edinburgh 2000). The trial protocol has been approved by the Sichuan Regional Ethics Review Committee on Traditional Chinese Medicine. Written informed consent will be obtained from each participant before registration. All patients will be given enough time to decide whether they would sign the informed consent, or they will be given treatment options other than acupuncture if they are not willing to participate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Outcome measurements</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>For the evaluation of the main outcome measures patients are requested to fill in a questionnaire including the Rhinitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the visual analogue scale (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and C-MMASS (Massachusetts General Hospital Acupuncture Sensation Scale, modified Chinese version) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In VAS, the severity of the combination of the nasal symptoms will be subjectively rated by the study patients on the scale. The severity of symptoms can be divided into mild, moderate, or severe based on the total severity VAS score (0 to 10 cm: mild, VAS 0 to 3; moderate, VAS 3.1 to 7; severe, VAS 7.1 to 10). VAS scores will be recorded every two weeks throughout the whole trial.</p><p>The RQLQ (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) evaluates impairment of everyday life (activity, sleep, everyday life problems, condition of health) caused by symptoms of the eyes and nose. It contains 28 questions related to these dimensions. Each question can be divided into seven degrees: 0 - not trouble, 1 - any trouble at all, 2 - somewhat troubled, 3 - moderately troubled, 4 - quite a bit of trouble, 5 - very troubled, 6 - extremely troubled. It will be measured by questionnaire at baseline, at the end of treatment, during the follow-up period, and at the end of the follow-up period (a total of five times). Both the scores of VAS and RQLQ questionnaire will be blindly assessed.</p><p>C-MMASS (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) is an accepted method of objectively scoring the sensation of <italic>de qi</italic>. Immediately after removing the needles during the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9<sup>th</sup>, and 12<sup>th</sup> sessions, patients will be asked to fill in the questionnaire. Patients were questioned about whether each of the sensations of <italic>de qi</italic> had occurred during the session.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>Secondary outcome measures include serum allergen-specific IgE, blood eosinophil count, nasal inflammatory cells counts (mast cells, eosinophils, and T cells), the level of nitric oxide concentration in nasal secretion, and side effects. The patients were examined by the otolaryngologist at the following times: on entering the study, at the end of the run-in period, in the middle and at the end of the treatment phase, and every 4 weeks during the follow-up phase. Nasal secretions and blood samples will be collected on entry, at the end of the treatment phase, and at 4 and 8 weeks after the end of treatment.

The data will be analyzed with SPSS 18.0 and SAS 9.0 (SAS Institute Inc. 100 SAS Campus Drive Cary, NC 27513-2414, USA) statistical software packages.

The per-protocol (PP) group is defined as the patients who completed the study and do not have major protocol violations. All analyses were based on the ITT group and PP group.

This objective has two aspects: one is whether acupuncture with <italic>de qi</italic> is more efficient than without <italic>de qi</italic>; the other is the relationship between <italic>de qi</italic> and efficiency. In this trial, we assess the strength of <italic>de qi</italic> by the score of C-MMASS and the efficiency by the score of RQLQ. We want to know whether a high score equates to high efficiency or not. The result of this trial is expected to provide convincing evidence that strengthened stimulation during acupuncture for the treatment of allergic rhinitis is more effective.</p><p>In the literature, sham acupuncture is considered to be a placebo treatment in acupuncture studies. There are two common types of sham control for the clinical study for acupuncture, one is a technique in which needles are inserted shallowly at defined acupoints, another is at locations of 1 to 2 cm away from the defined acupoints. In our study we chose to use the point superficial needle-insertion method. The needles are inserted into the sham points to a depth of 3 mm and are retained at the subcutaneous level. To ensure the efficacy and safety of the treatment, acupuncturists should undergo special training in Teaching Hospital of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and have sufficient knowledge, special technique, and good experience in acupuncture.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is currently recruiting participants (began at 1 September 2013).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13063_2013_2188_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
