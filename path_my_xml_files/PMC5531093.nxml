These symptoms are caused by decreased systolic and diastolic cardiac function. Decreased exercise tolerance because of heart failure is also likely to be complicated with skeletal muscle weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Indeed, the exercise tolerance of patients with CHF is known to be strongly related to skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A decrease in skeletal muscle strength and muscle mass (sarcopenia) is an important factor that largely affects the subjective symptoms of patients with CHF. Furthermore, sarcopenia is generally complicated with several abnormalities such as metabolic disorders and decreased vascular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sarcopenia is often induced by physical deconditioning because of rest during CHF treatment, and it can lead to a condition known as cachexia if concurrent metabolic disorders exist. Approximately 20% CHF patients are believed to suffer from sarcopenia, whereas 10% suffer from cachexia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and both are generally observed in elderly patients with cardiovascular disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Japan is experiencing an increasingly aging population; thus, CHF with coexisting sarcopenia and cachexia have become a big burden.</p><p id="Par20">From the fact that 10%&#x02013;50% of CHF patients who undergo a single pharmacotherapy intervention are repeatedly admitted for heart failure within a period of 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;months, it is evident that the presently available CHF treatments are quite insufficient. With a focus on sarcopenia and cachexia, cardiac rehabilitation is another comprehensive approach that improves cardiopulmonary functions, leading to the suppression heart failure events. Furthermore, in addition to an increase in exercise tolerance, cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to improve left ventricular function, endothelial function, and sympathetic activity, which may have favorable effects on the course of heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) preparations have been available for purchase in the market since 1996 with the aim of correcting amino acid imbalance in the blood in patients with decompensated cirrhosis and improving hypoalbuminemia. BCAAs play an important role in the formation of skeletal muscles because they account for approximately 35% of the essential amino acids that form these skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Indeed, BCAA preparations have been reported to promote postoperative wound healing and recovery from muscle fatigue after exercise and enhance muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Its easily absorbable trait may also fit the treatment of heart failure, because patients with CHF often decreased digestive abilities because of cachexia. Furthermore, reports from animal experiments have revealed that BCAA had some positive effects on heart failure through the improvement on the function of the skeletal muscle mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, incorporation of BCAA in cardiac rehabilitation is expected to have additional effect on the improvement of cardiopulmonary and skeletal muscle functions. In this study, we hypothesized that the concurrent use of a BCAA preparation during cardiac rehabilitation has synergistic effects on the clinical course of CHF as well as improvement of skeletal muscle function, and metabolism. In addition, we would also like to investigate whether continued administration of the BCAA preparation after cardiac rehabilitation preserves cardiopulmonary function and skeletal muscles.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par22">The primary objective of this study is to explore whether the addition of a BCAA preparation for cardiac rehabilitation of patients with CHF further improves cardiopulmonary functions, skeletal muscle functions, and metabolism in comparison with conventional cardiac rehabilitation.

The study consists of three periods&#x02014;pre-observation, intervention with concurrent cardiac rehabilitation, and BCAA single intervention. In pre-observation period (Day 1 to Week 4), the consent of patients undergoing cardiac rehabilitation at the hospital for CHF will be obtained, and their eligibility will be determined by blood tests and imaging tests (echocardiogram). In the period of intervention with concurrent cardiac rehabilitation (for 18&#x02013;22&#x000a0;weeks), patients who are confirmed eligible for study enrollment will be randomized into either group A (CR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;BCAA) or group B (CR). BCAA is orally supplemented with one pack of BCAAs granules (Aminovact Combination Granules &#x000ae;, Nichi-Iko Pharmaceutical Co, Toyama, Japan) which includes 1144&#x000a0;mg of L-valine, 1904&#x000a0;mg of L-leucine and 952&#x000a0;mg of L-isoleucine, two times a day. Cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPX) will be performed on each subject in both groups before intervention with the BCAA preparation as well as at Week 14 and Week 20 of the intervention with cardiac rehabilitation. In the BCAA preparation single intervention period (20&#x02013;24&#x000a0;weeks), re-randomization, i.e., randomization 2, will be performed after the cardiac rehabilitation program has ended. Subjects in group A will be assigned to Group A-1 or A-2, whereas those in Group B will be assigned to Group B-1 or B-2. As described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, subjects assigned to Group A-1 will continue the BCAA preparation. Similarly, subjects in Group B-1 will start taking the BCAA preparation.

With respect to differences in outcome measurement (%) in secondary endpoint between groups A and B, the t-test will be used to analyze statistical significance. Similarly, the difference between B-1 and B-2 sub-groups will be analyzed using the t-test. Also,, after confirming the assumption that there are no major differences among the treatment groups (no interaction), the two-way ANOVA will be used to test the treatment effect for addition of a BCAA, and maintenance effect for continuing administration of a BCAA by including group A/B and +1/+2 as factors. A box-plot will be used to visualize primary outcome and secondary outcomes between the 4 groups (A&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1, A&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2, B&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1, B&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2).

The main aim of nutritional intervention seems to be an assist of effect derived from exercise training interventions; however, the nutritional modification might itself have favorable effects on the skeletal muscle or cardiopulmonary capacity leading to the improvement of exercise capacity in patients with heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The study focused on the elderly patients with heart failure, who are potentially complicated with sarcopenia. However, we did not limit the study patients by excluding patients without subjectively confirmed sarcopenia because we would investigate the effectiveness of more general and easy use of BCAA agents for cardiovascular patients.</p><p id="Par34">One unique point in this study is that there are two terms of nutritional interventions, one with exercise training and one without it. The results help distinguishing the additional effect on exercise training or original effect derived from the nutritional intervention itself. In addition, the two-time randomization method may decrease the influence of the result of first randomization on the intension to exercise training.</p><p id="Par35">In the current study the effect of a promising new intervention will be assessed to determine whether BCAA addition improve exercise capacity in patients with heart failure, who are generally complicated with sarcopenia. We hope this study, with its design and data collection, will present novel insights addressing the effective nutritional intervention in cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AT</term><def><p id="Par5">Anaerobic threshold</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BCAA</term><def><p id="Par6">Branched-chain amino acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBC</term><def><p id="Par7">Complete blood count</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHF</term><def><p id="Par8">Chronic heart failure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Co-I</term><def><p id="Par9">Coinvestigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPX</term><def><p id="Par10">Cardiopulmonary exercise test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EDC</term><def><p id="Par11">Electronic data capture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EF</term><def><p id="Par12">Ejection fraction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p id="Par13">Hospital anxiety and depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICH-GCP</term><def><p id="Par14">International Conference on Harmonization of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p id="Par15">Interleukin-6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PI</term><def><p id="Par16">Principal investigator</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAEs</term><def><p id="Par17">Serious adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF</term><def><p id="Par18">Tumor necrosis factor</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par36">This work was supported by The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan through grant-in-aid 15&#x000a0;K19368 (to Takata M) and 26,461,103 (to Amiya E).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par37">Not applicable.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MT and EA participated in the design of the study, conducted the trial and drafted the manuscript.
