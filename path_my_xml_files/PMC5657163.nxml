Regarding the drawbacks of aphakic correction, intraocular lens (IOL) implantation with vitrectomy has attracted a lot of attention in recent years and is universally preferred over aphakic spectacles or contact lenses as a method for visual rehabilitation in aphakic eyes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Wearing aphakic spectacles is the safest approach but the least physiologic method of optical correction and can only be pursued for a short time before patient acceptance and feasibility become issues. Use of this method is reasonable in the young amblyopic child who is undergoing extensive patching and is monocular most of the time.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Fixation of IOLs in cases of insufficient or no capsular support is challenging and requires a large armamentarium of techniques to resolve different situations.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Other indications include traumatic phakic lens dislocation (cataractous or clear), surgically aphakic eyes, or anterior chamber IOL (ACIOL) with complications (persistent hyphema, uveitis). In the absence of sufficient capsular support, ACIOL, sulcus-supported posterior chamber IOL (PCIOL), and posterior chamber sutured or glued IOLs can be used.</p><p>The management approach depends on surgeon preferences and individual case specifics, including integrity of capsule remnants, type of IOLs, and coexisting ocular pathology.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] ACIOL implantation requires less surgical time and is less invasive as compared to implantation of scleral-fixated PCIOLs. Although there is no robust evidence of the superiority of scleral-fixated PCIOL over the open loop ACIOL, some surgeons prefer scleral-fixated PCIOLs to ACIOLs on the assumption that glaucoma, macular edema, and other complications occur less frequently with PCIOL implantation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Scleral fixation techniques require passage of sutures and manipulation of IOL haptics near the vitreous base. Several studies advocated pars plana vitrectomy with the removal of as much anterior vitreous as possible before scleral-fixated PCIOL implantation to prevent vitreous entwinement around the lens haptic and suture site, which may result in retinal breaks from vitreous traction.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Fibrin glue-assisted PCIOL implantation is a new technique started in December 2007 in eyes with deficient capsular support. Externalization of the greater part of the haptics into the scleral tunnel along its curvature stabilizes the axial positioning of the IOL and thereby prevents any IOL tilt and the partial thickness scleral flaps are repositioned with fibrin glue.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare and evaluate visual outcome and complication profile of various techniques of secondary IOL (i.e., ACIOL, suture-fixated PCIOL, and glue-fixated PCIOL).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>This randomized, prospective, interventional, comparative, clinical trial study was carried out at our institute after taking permission from the Ethical Committee from September 2010 to August 2012. After discussing the benefits and risk, informed consent had been obtained before surgery in all patients. Patients of either sex having aphakia, lacking posterior capsular support, or having subluxated or dislocated IOL were included in the study, and patients having corneal or scleral pathology, optic atrophy, uncontrolled glaucoma, retinal detachment, and other retinal pathology were excluded from the study.

</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Operative procedures</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Anterior chamber intraocular lens</title><p>All procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same surgical protocol in all cases. Under local anesthesia (peri- or retro-bulbar block), a 5.5 mm scleral tunnel incision was made 1 mm posterior to limbus and two paracenteses were performed at 10 o&#x02019;clock and 2 o&#x02019;clock positions.</p><p>Then, the pupil was constricted by an intracameral pilocarpine, which was then irrigated, and the AC was filled with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device and an ACIOL was inserted in the AC, rotated with a hook into an appropriate position, and centered over the pupil. The iris was hooked between the claw-like footplates to achieve perfect IOL centration over the pupil. Then, a peripheral iridectomy was performed at 12 o&#x02019;clock position and the viscoelastic material was carefully removed. Finally, the incision was closed with three interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Sutured posterior chamber intraocular lens</title><p>In eyes undergoing surgery, peribulbar anesthesia was used to complete IOL implantation. In all patients with vitreous loss, a complete anterior vitrectomy was performed.</p><p>For scleral-fixated intraocular lens (SFIOL) implantation, the surgeon used a modified ab externo technique, originally described by Lewis, in the following manner. A double-armed 10-0 polypropylene (Aurolene) suture with straight needles was used. Two fornix-based conjunctival peritomies were made from 2 to 4 o&#x02019;clock and from 8 to 10 o&#x02019;clock, respectively. The entry sites were marked 1.0&#x02013;1.5 mm posterior to the limbus, 1.0 mm above and below the 3 to 9 o&#x02019;clock horizontal meridian. The straight needle was passed through the sclera at the superior marking on one side and was retrieved within the barrel of a 26-gauge needle inserted through the inferior marking on the opposite side. The same needle then was reinserted into the eye through the superior marking and was retrieved through the inferior marking on the other side. The sutures were withdrawn through the corneal or scleral wound using a Sinskey hook and were cut in the middle. The two cut ends on each side were passed through the corresponding eyelet of the SFIOL and their ends were tied. A square knot was made to join the two cut ends on each side and then rotated into and out of the eye through the superior marking on each side.</p><p>After the SFIOL had been inserted into the posterior chamber, the sutures were tightened and tied with open knots. The corneal or scleral wound was closed with interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures (Ethicon). The open knots were converted to closed knots and then rotated through the inferior marking, which was the entry sites of the 26-gauge needle. The conjunctival peritomies were then closed.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Glued posterior chamber intraocular lens</title><p>Under peribulbar anesthesia, localized peritomy at the site of exit of the IOL haptics was done. Infusion cannula or AC maintainer was inserted. Positioning of the infusion cannula should be in the pars plana about 3 mm from the limbus (Anterior segment surgeons can use an AC maintainer or 23G trocar cannula infusion).</p><p>Two partial thickness limbal-based scleral flaps about 3 mm &#x000d7; 3 mm were created exactly 180&#x000b0; diagonally (using RK marker and pen) apart and about 1&#x02013;1.5 mm from the limbus. This was followed by vitrectomy through pars plana or anterior route to remove all vitreous traction. Two straight sclerotomies with a 20-gauge needle were made about 1 mm from the limbus under the existing scleral flaps.</p><p>A corneoscleral tunnel incision was then prepared for introducing the IOL in the case of PMMA nonfoldable IOL. While the IOL is being introduced with one hand, an end gripping 23G micro rhexis forceps was passed through the opposite sclerotomy with the other hand. The tip of the leading haptic was then grasped with the micro rhexis forceps, pulled through the sclerotomy following the curve of the haptic, and was externalized under the scleral flap. Similarly, the trailing haptic was also externalized through the other sclerotomy under the scleral flap.</p><p>The haptic tips were tucked into the intralamellar scleral tunnel made with a 26-gauge needle at the point of externalization of the haptics on either side. Then, the reconstituted fibrin glue prepared was injected through the cannula of the syringe delivery system under the scleral flaps. Local pressure was given over the flaps for about 10&#x02013;20 s for the formation of fibrin polypeptides. Corneoscleral wound was closed with 10-0 monofilament nylon in PMMA IOL. The AC maintainer or the infusion cannula was removed. Conjunctiva was closed with the fibrin glue in all eyes irrespective of the type of IOL.</p><p>All patients received postoperatively prednisolone acetate eye drop and moxifloxacin 0.3% eye drop 1 hourly for 2 days and then 4 times thereafter for 6 weeks.

Use of closed-loop ACIOLs marketed during the 1970s and 1980s was associated with complications. However, modern advancement in ACIOL design may provide a safe, effective alternative to PCIOLs. Malbran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] were the first to describe transsulcus scleral fixation of PCIOL in aphakia eyes that had previously undergone ICCE in 1986.</p><p>Fibrin glue-assisted PCIOL implantation is a new technique started in December 2007 in eyes with deficient capsular support. Our technique differed from other sutureless methods by the externalization of haptics under the scleral flaps instead of sclerotomy and also the use of fibrin glue. We preferred biological glue to stick the flaps as it prevents formation of subconjunctival bleb, which may happen when the scleral flaps are sutured. The risk of bleb-related endophthalmitis and suture-related complications are less when the flaps are closed with fibrin glue.</p><p>The commercially available tissue glue we used was Tisseel (Baxter, Deerfield, IL, USA). Tisseel is plasma derived. The commercial product is a two-component system. The first component contains highly concentrated fibrinogen, factor XIII, and fibronectin. The second component contains thrombin, calcium chloride, and aprotinin. Mixing of the two components promotes the formation and cross-linking of fibrin. Fibrin glue has been shown to provide airtight closure, and by the time, the fibrin starts degrading, surgical adhesions would have already occurred in the scleral bed. Although complete scleral wound healing with collagen fibrils may take up to 3 months,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] since the haptic is snugly placed inside a scleral pocket, the IOL remains stable.</p><p>As compared to the best-corrected VA after 1<sup>st</sup> postoperative week, there was significant improvement in the best-corrected VA at final follow-up. The best-corrected VA after 6 months in the range of 20/60&#x02013;20/40 of both Group A (ACIOL) and Group B (sutured PCIOL) is 36.4% and 40.6%, respectively. However, in Group C (glued PCIOL), there was drastic improvement in VA as compared to other groups. In Group C, 52.9% of patients had best-corrected VA in the range of 20/30&#x02013;20/20 [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Preoperative slit lamp image of a patient before glued intraocular lens implantation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-10-198-g011"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Intraoperative image of a patient after glued intraocular lens implantation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="OJO-10-198-g012"/></fig><p>Our study showed 40% of Group A (ACIOL) patients achieved best-corrected VA of 20/60 or better. These results were consistent with the study of Dadeya <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] who achieved best-corrected VA of 20/60 or better in 36.6% (11/30) of patients in ACIOL group and 30% (9/30) of patients in 11 SFIOL group after a mean follow-up of 3 years. Fasih <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] reported 63.33% of secondary ACIOL implantation achieved best-corrected VA &#x0003e; 20/60. We had poor visual outcome than this study that may be associated with complicated surgery, increased inflammation, and macular pathology such as cystoid macular edema.</p><p>About 50% eyes in secondary scleral-fixated PCIOL group (Group B) achieved postoperative best-corrected VA of 20/60 or better in our study. These results were comparable with the previous study carried out by Hahn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that reported a rate of 57.1%. This percentage was 76% in a study carried by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The decrease in best-corrected VA in our study was probably due to longer operative time, early and late postoperative complications such as corneal edema, secondary glaucoma, AC reaction, and cystoids macular edema. Our patients were of generally older age groups and might have endothelial cell decompensation, leading to decrease in best-corrected VA in final follow-up.</p><p>In Group C (glued PCIOL), there was drastic improvement in VA (67.6% patients had best-corrected VA more than 20/60) as compared to other groups. These results were comparable to results of the study conducted by Agarwal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The improvement in the best-corrected VA in this group was mainly because of less intra- and post-operative complications. The risk of bleb-related endophthalmitis and suture-related complications was less because flaps were closed with fibrin glue.</p><p>In this study, we also noticed that overall intraoperative complications were more common in sutured PCIOL group, and out of the various complications, intraoperative hypotony was most common which 40.6% in case of sutured PCIOL was. It was also found in glued PCIOL group (26.5%) but not as common as sutured group and was least in ACIOL group. This complication was mainly because of complexity of procedure and longer intraoperative time taken. The result of this study was comparable with the study by Bellucci <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] who had shown a complication rate of 6% in both ACIOL and sutured SFIOL, whereas more intraoperative and postoperative complications in SFIOL.</p><p>In our study, corneal edema, AC reaction, and increased intraocular pressure were the common complications in early postoperative period among Group A (ACIOL) patients, which was 20%, 25%, and 25%, respectively. In case of Group B (sutured PCIOL), the most common complication encountered was corneal edema (40.6%) and rest of other complications were minimal. In this group, the other important complications observed were endophthalmitis, retinal detachment, and iris capture and pupil deformation (6.25% each). In Group C (glued PCIOL), early corneal edema was the most common problem (32.3%) and other less severe complications were hyphema, increased intraocular pressure, and AC reactions.</p><p>In our study, we also compared the rate of complications in the late postoperative period (&#x0003e;1 months after surgery) and found that complications rate was reduced as compared to early postoperative period. We noticed that cystoid macular edema was most common in Group A (ACIOL) patients (25%). In other two groups, it was lesser (15.62% in sutured PCIOL and 20.5% in glued PCIOL). There were five patients (15.62%) in Group B (sutured PCIOL) who had IOL decentration which was probably due to suture erosion and inadequate suture tying with sclera. The lens may rest in an unpredictable position with tilting of lens commonly inducing significant astigmatism and spherical aberration, which leads to reduction in best = corrected VA in sutured PCIOL group. The result of this study was comparable with the study done by Donaldson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Since the introduction of glued IOL procedure, the frequent complications of secondary IOL implantation such as secondary glaucoma, cystoid macular edema, or bullous keratopathy are minimized. Another important advantage of this technique is the prevention of suture-related complications such as suture erosion, suture knot exposure, or dislocation of IOL after suture disintegration or broken suture. IOL explantation in malpositioned PCIOL is totally removed as the same IOL can be repositioned with this method.</p><p>The limitations of this study were as follows: Analysis of only nonfoldable PMMA IOLs was done and the postoperative outcomes of other IOLs such as different types of foldable IOL need to be reported. Longer follow-up of patients might be required to confirm the long-term outcome of the study. This study did not have any control group to compare the visual outcome and complications of each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It can be concluded that fibrin glue-assisted PCIOL implantation provides better visual outcome with minimal complications in eyes with deficient capsular support. It is also evident from our study that gain in best-corrected VA in ACIOL group is poor. It is mainly because of postoperative complications which encountered were cystoids macular edema, secondary glaucoma, and pupil decentration in late follow-up. However, further studies including larger number of patients, more stringent criteria, and longer follow-up are warranted.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
