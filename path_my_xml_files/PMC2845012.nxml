Therefore, it has been hypothesized that a reduction to near-normal levels of A1C in patients with type 2 diabetes would reduce the risk of these adverse outcomes. Three large randomized controlled clinical trials testing this hypothesis in individuals with longstanding type 2 diabetes reported their main results in the past 2 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>The Data Safety Monitoring Board of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial discontinued the intensive glycemia arm because of an increase in all-cause mortality in the intensive glycemia arm compared with the standard glycemia arm. The finding of excess mortality in the intensive arm of the ACCORD trial has led to controversy about implementation of intensive glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Adding to the controversy were results of the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) and Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), demonstrating that although there was no significant reduction in the primary end point of CVD events, there was no increase in mortality with the intensive glycemia arm compared with the standard glycemia arm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), which has raised questions about reasons for these discrepancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>A critical question relates to the applicability and generalizability of the conclusions of the ACCORD trial to the broader population or to specific subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, prespecified subgroup analyses in ACCORD did suggest a significant benefit of intensive glycemic control on CVD events in those participants with lower A1C at entry or absence of CVD event by history, but there was no suggestion of a differential effect on mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). However, these observations are based on only a few subgroup analyses at the time of the primary publication. The effect on mortality of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment may have been modified by other possible characteristics of patients at entry. We have therefore carried out exploratory post hoc analyses of the effects of intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in ACCORD participants categorized by various baseline characteristics on all-cause mortality at the time of discontinuation of the intensive glycemia treatment of ACCORD, with the goal to determine if particular subgroups at higher or lower risk from the intensive intervention can be identified.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>ACCORD is a multicenter randomized clinical trial testing the effect of very tight control of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes compared with standard therapy on a composite outcome of CVD death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke. The factorally designed trial is also testing effects of intensive blood pressure control compared with standard (the Blood Pressure trial) and use of fenofibrate plus statin compared with placebo plus statin (the Lipid trial).</p><p>The treatment goal for the intensive arm was an A1C of &#x0003c;6%, whereas the treatment goal for the standard arm was A1C of 7&#x02013;7.9%, with the expectation that the mean A1C for the standard arm would be &#x0223c;7.5%. The mean duration of the trial was expected to be 5 years, but the intensive glycemia arm of the study was discontinued on 5 February 2008 because of excess mortality in the intensive group, and all participants were transitioned to the standard glycemia treatment protocol. Complete details of the study design and conduct have been previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The dataset for the current analyses is the same as that for the 2008 main results paper, which includes all randomized participants from enrollment until 10 December 2007, an average trial follow-up of 3.5 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Subgroup definitions are indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>; baseline characteristics to define the subgroups were divided into four categories: <italic>1</italic>) demographic and anthropometric characteristics, <italic>2</italic>) medical history characteristics, <italic>3</italic>) medication use, and <italic>4</italic>) laboratory variables. Analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat comparisons between the intensive glycemia and standard groups on the mortality rate within each subgroup as defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> above (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Analyses were conducted at the ACCORD coordinating center using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis was used to examine the risk of all-cause mortality by glycemia arm within each subgroup. A test of the interaction between the baseline variable and treatment arm was done to assess homogeneity of the treatment effect across levels of subgroups, i.e., to determine if effects on mortality of intensive versus standard glycemia treatments differed between the subgroup categories. All analyses were adjusted for the study stratification factors: <italic>1</italic>) history of CVD (except for the analysis of CVD variables), <italic>2</italic>) assignment to the Lipid or Blood Pressure trial (each trial had different eligibility criteria), <italic>3</italic>) assignment to the Lipid trial and randomized to fenofibrate, and <italic>4</italic>) assignment to the Blood Pressure trial and randomized to the intensive blood pressure intervention. Where possible, categorical variables were also assessed as continuous variables to determine if the results differed from the categorical analysis. Multiple Cox regression analyses were performed to determine if any observed trends persist after adjusting for multiple baseline characteristics. Because these were exploratory analyses, no <italic>P</italic> value adjustment was made for multiple comparisons.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline variables</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Demographics</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medical history</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Medications</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lab tests</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, race/ethnicity, sex, lives alone, clinical network, BMI, waist circumference, education, year randomization</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Prior CVD event, prior coronary heart failure, diabetes duration, history of neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, retinal laser/surgery, visual acuity, smoking, depression, blood pressure, electrocardiogram</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sulfonylureas, metformin, thiazolidinediones, any insulin HCTZ, ACE inhibitors, &#x003b2;-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, fibrates, statins, aspirin, antidepressants</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">A1C, LDL, HDL, triglyceride, serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate (modified diet renal disease), urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Demographics: age (&#x0003c;65, 65&#x02013;69, 70&#x02013;74, &#x02265;75 years), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, white, black, or other), lives alone (vs. with others), clinical center network (7 CCNs), BMI (&#x0003c;30, 30&#x02013;34, &#x02265;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), waist circumference (&#x0003c;96.7, 96.7&#x02013;106.6, 106.7&#x02013;116, &#x02265;116.1 cm), education (&#x0003c;high school, high-school graduate, attended some college or technical school, college graduate), year of randomization into ACCORD (2001&#x02013;2005).

Importantly, no differential effect of intensive versus standard treatment on mortality was found in subgroups defined by variables anticipated to have such an interaction: age, duration of diabetes, previous history of CVD disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figs. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Nevertheless, we did find that the intensive treatment had a higher effect on mortality in subgroups defined by three baseline clinical variables: A1C &#x02265;8.5% (interaction <italic>P</italic> = 0.044), aspirin use (interaction <italic>P</italic> = 0.03), and self-reported history of neuropathy/nerve problems (interaction <italic>P</italic> = 0.0008). However, because of the multiple comparisons and the post hoc nature of these analyses, the interaction <italic>P</italic> values for A1C and aspirin use should only be considered suggestive. A marginal differential effect also was found in subgroups with higher BMI and higher waist circumference at baseline.</p><p>Consistent with the prevailing epidemiologic evidence of the relationship between glycemic control and mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), the increase in mortality in the intensive arm was observed among those participants with higher (&#x02265;8.5%) compared with lower (&#x0003c;8.5%) A1C at baseline. This effect was evident when A1C was examined as a categorical variable but was seen to a lesser extent when we examined A1C as a continuous variable. The spline plot of HRs across levels of baseline A1C imply an increasingly higher risk with higher baseline A1C in the intensive arm, but not in the standard arm. Individuals with higher A1C at baseline may represent individuals with more difficult disease to manage and/or individuals who may adhere less to therapy. Whether individuals at highest risk ultimately achieved or failed to achieve more intensive treatment targets will require additional analysis.</p><p>Baseline participant report of neuropathy/nerve problems defined a subgroup in which the intensive approach for glycemia treatment had a differential effect on mortality, with a highly significant <italic>P</italic> value of 0.0008. Peripheral neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes, and excess mortality has been related to diminished peripheral sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), foot ulceration, and history of lower-extremity amputation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Yet in our cohort, neither MNSI-documented peripheral neuropathy nor history of amputation was associated with a differential effect on mortality from intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment (although very few participants with an amputation entered the study). The discrepancy suggests the two methods of detecting neuropathy may identify different populations. Indeed, the MNSI detected peripheral neuropathy in 4,357 participants in contrast to 2,737 participants who reported a history of neuropathy, of whom 61% had also an MNSI score indicative of neuropathy. The discordance among various indexes of neuropathy in their strength for predicting outcomes (symptoms versus physical findings) was also apparent in the DIAD study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), where a significant relation to CVD outcomes was found with one symptom (numbness) and one sign (&#x0201c;absent sensation&#x0201d;), but it was borderline for a different symptom (pain) and had no relation to yet another symptom (tingling) and two physical signs (absent vibration, absent reflex). The discrepancy does not diminish the possible importance of neuropathy as a predictor for worse outcomes from intensive glycemia treatment, or even as an etiologic agent of CVD outcomes or mortality; this issue deserves further study.</p><p>Lastly, there was a differential effect on mortality of intensive compared with standard treatment by use of aspirin at baseline. Although aspirin use is recommended for patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the evidence supporting its benefit is now being reconsidered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Recent clinical trials including or limited to those with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) have not shown a significant reduction in either CVD mortality or overall mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, although these studies often included populations considered to be at lower risk of CVD disease than the population recruited for the ACCORD trial. A possible explanation could be that aspirin use is merely a proxy for those at higher risk of CVD disease, although we did not see an increased risk among those with a history of CVD disease at baseline.</p><p>There are a number of important limitations to the analyses conducted for this article. First, we cannot exclude the possibility that the findings of significant interactions are due to chance alone. For a set of 38 independent variables, we would expect to find <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 for at least 1.9 variables by chance alone, suggesting the results for A1C and aspirin use should be interpreted with caution, since <italic>P</italic> values were very close to the 0.05 level. Nonetheless, self-report of neuropathy had a very strong statistical significance. Data from other sources will be required for confirmation of the findings presented. Many of the baseline characteristics were self-reported by participants; although a certain amount of misclassification may be expected, we would not expect this to differ by study arm. Finally, these analyses should be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating, since the subgroups were not defined a priori and ACCORD was not powered to look at specific subgroups&#x02014;nor was the study powered for an analysis of mortality, since the prespecified primary outcome was the rate of major CVD events.</p><p>In summary, we have identified three baseline characteristics that defined subgroups in which there was a differential effect on mortality of the intensive compared with standard glycemia treatment in ACCORD: A1C &#x02265;8.5%, self-reported history of neuropathy, and aspirin use at study entry. The interactions in the A1C and aspirin use were of marginal significance and can only be considered suggestive and will require additional study. Of note is that the most significant association found was with self-report of neuropathy. Importantly, other baseline characteristics that were hypothesized to identify subgroups with differential effects on mortality by treatment arm did not have such interaction, including increasing age, duration of diabetes, and history of CVD disease. Further analysis of the role of neuropathy on mortality in type 2 diabetes is warranted. The ACCORD study group is currently performing additional analyses to define the possible role of autonomic neuropathy&#x02014;as well as other factors&#x02014;in the outcomes observed.</p></sec>
