In a 9-week longitudinal study, undergraduate students, all taking a psychology statistics course, were randomly assigned to a control condition or a values-affirmation manipulation intended to improve numeracy. By the final week in the course, the numeracy intervention (statistics-course enrollment combined with values affirmation) enhanced objective numeracy, subjective numeracy, and two decision-related outcomes (financial literacy and health-related behaviors). It also showed positive indirect-only effects on financial outcomes and a series of STEM-related outcomes (course grades, intentions to take more math-intensive courses, later math-intensive courses taken based on academic transcripts). All decision and STEM-related outcome effects were mediated by the changes in objective and/or subjective numeracy and demonstrated similar and robust enhancements. Improvements to abstract numeric reasoning can improve everyday outcomes.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000077</institution-id><institution>Division of Social and Economic Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1155924, 1558230</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>National Science Foundation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nsf.gov/">https://www.nsf.gov/</ext-link>) provided support through grants SES-1155924 and -1558230.

Twenty-nine percent of American adults (about 68 million) are estimated to have only rudimentary math skills, and less than 10% of Americans (about 21 million adults) are thought able to understand complex numeric information [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Federal and other programs often target mathematics as one important part of Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) education that will lead to better jobs, innovation, improved economy, and greater global leadership. Some educators, however, have questioned whether training beyond basic arithmetic skills is necessary for everyone. Hacker [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], for example, opined &#x0201c;Think of math as a huge boulder we make everyone pull, without assessing what all this pain achieves.&#x0201d; In the present paper, we specifically examined whether improving math skills (numeracy) within a statistics course can justify this pain through its impacts on decision outcomes that people experience.</p><p>Improving numeracy is considered important based on its correlations with the quality of decision processes and outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Higher numeracy, for example, has been associated with better health outcomes (superior control of stroke risk and diabetes, lower Body Mass Index [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). More numerate individuals also do better financially by having more adequate retirement savings, avoiding predatory loans, and paying credit cards in full [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]; numeracy also may be an important underlying factor in financial literacy [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Of course, numeracy could be simply an indicator of education or socioeconomic status so that those variables predict better health and financial outcomes rather than numeracy itself. Indeed, prior research [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] has found that education predicts better cognitive skills (including numeracy), higher socioeconomic status, more health-related knowledge, and taking more health-protective behaviors. However, in their study, structural equation modeling indicated that numeracy and other cognitive abilities, and not wealth or health-related knowledge, mediated education&#x02019;s effects on health-protective behaviors. Furthermore, in a second study conducted in a population from the Peruvian Highlands, results indicated that numeracy was a unique predictor of a health-protective behavior even after accounting for measures of education, other cognitive abilities, and confounding factors [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Also unclear is whether these findings are due to objective numeracy (defined as the ability to comprehend and use probabilistic and other mathematical concepts) or subjective numeracy (defined as self-assessed ability and preferences for numbers). Past research often used these constructs interchangeably, and they are positively associated [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Objective numeracy, however, has been linked with superior processing and use of numeric information in judgments and decisions independent of general intelligence [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], making it a likely cause of decision quality. Independent of objective numeracy, greater subjective numeracy, on the other hand, has been associated with having more motivation, confidence (belief in one&#x02019;s ability), and positive emotions to numbers, all of which may lead to greater engagement with numbers [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Consistent with engaging more with numbers, individuals with higher vs. lower subjective numeracy, but not objective numeracy, were willing to pay more for (highly numeric) genetic screening results [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, subjective numeracy may also be important to health and financial outcomes that require persevering with numeric information over time [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We tested the potentially separable effects of objective and subjective numeracy.</p><p>Here, we report a psychology statistics classroom study that tested the effectiveness of an intervention intended to improve both numeracies and thereby enhance decision outcomes. We also examined the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness in improving STEM-related outcomes. Such statistics courses should improve aspects of numeracy including arithmetic and probabilistic reasoning, through practicing related skills on homework and exams. Lehman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], for example, argued &#x0201c;that psychology and medicine improve statistical and methodological reasoning about a wide range of problems because both fields teach their students how to think about uncertain events, in part through instruction in statistics&#x0201d; (p953, [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). In the present statistics course, students describe populations and samples using descriptive means, statistical intervals, correlation coefficients, and graphics. They compare and test by detecting differences between statistical populations or reference values using simple hypothesis tests such as t-tests. They predict and explain data using regression. Many of these tests they learn to calculate by hand, and all of this practice should improve their numeracy skills. In fact, Lehman and Nisbett [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] found that different undergraduate training produced different changes in reasoning from the first to the fourth year of university enrollment. Specifically, psychology undergraduates improved considerably in statistical and methodological reasoning but not in conditional reasoning whereas Natural Science and Humanities students demonstrated opposite effects. These undergraduate majors did not differ in changes to nonnumeric verbal reasoning. In related research, taking a statistics course improved one aspect of decision making (use of the law of large numbers [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]).</p><p>However, taking math courses, including the present statistics course, involves difficult concepts and negative feedback, which can pressure students considerably (depending on how well student learning is supported), reduce their self-efficacy, and interfere with learning [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, the challenge of such courses for improving numeracy is the potential stress of taking the course. This stress can potentially decrease perceived numeric ability and interfere with improvements to objective numeric ability [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, past research has shown that objective numeracy and everyday math anxiety have opposing effects, with greater math anxiety inhibiting confidence and accuracy in calculations and risk interpretations whereas greater objective numeracy improves them [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The possibility of stress harming the development of numeracy was particularly likely in the current research because this statistics course: (a) is required for all psychology majors and (b) must be passed with at least a C- before enrolling in major requirements.</p><p>A theoretically motivated psychological intervention, called values affirmation [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in which people reflect on core values, can focus people on long-term goals over immediate pressures [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and increase acceptance of counter-attitudinal thoughts [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. As a result, it may increase or protect beliefs in numeric ability and attitudes towards numbers, and ultimately boost performance [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to self-affirmation theory, when people are able to affirm valued aspects of their self-concepts (e.g., by writing about important values), they are reminded of positive aspects of their identities that act as psychological resources for dealing with threats to the self-concept even in unrelated domains [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In educational settings like the one studied in the present research, threats to valued self-concepts (e.g., feeling that one is smart or capable) are chronic [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and they can escalate over the semester (e.g., due to stress [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), interfering more and more with learning. In particular, students must master early material to learn increasingly difficult concepts, but stress and anxiety about performance can cause poor performance which further increases stress and anxiety and further interferes with learning. Conversely, good performance may improve students&#x02019; self-confidence; it can change appraisals about failure so that they are perceived as isolated or temporary events or even as opportunities for improvement which could promote future good performance [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. As a result, seemingly small manipulations can have oversize effects if administered strategically because of their self-reinforcing and recursive effects [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. For example, values-affirmation exercises can protect against anxiety and stress about performance [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], prevent poor performance from reducing feelings of academic belongingness [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], reduce rumination about academic failure [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and buffer against declines in academic self-confidence and perceived academic belongingness [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], all of which ultimately could lead to improved learning, especially in challenging courses. Indeed, lab studies demonstrate that such affirmations can improve performance in difficult topics (e.g., physics [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]), and their effects can persist over multiple school years [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we used such a values-affirmation manipulation conducted within a college statistics course to experimentally alter numeracy and test its impacts on decision outcomes. Based on prior literature, we expected that a values-affirmation manipulation administered at the beginning of the semester would stave off a recursive cycle of experienced threat from the course and improve development of objective numeracy skills [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. We also expected improvements to or protection of self-perceptions about ability and attitudes towards numeric information (i.e., subjective numeracy) because of documented protective effects of values-affirmation on perceived ability to succeed at school [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our primary hypothesis concerned the intervention&#x02019;s possible snowball effects; we expected the increased numeracy to improve the quality of financial literacy, financial outcomes, and health-related behaviors. Such a result would be a generalization of values-affirmation effects not tested previously. Of key interest, it would also support the importance of learning abstract numeric skills and the previously-untested causal relation between numeracy and decision outcomes. In addition, we examined effects on STEM-related outcomes (e.g., statistics course grades, future math-course intentions). Although affirmation can reduce stereotype-threat-induced gender gaps in performance, females must be a minority group for stereotype-threat effects to occur [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Because females are in the majority in required psychology courses like the present one, we did not hypothesize stereotype-threat effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki.

The subjective-numeracy scale has subscales that represent the first two of these components (perceived ability and number preferences, respectively), allowing us to explore how far affirmation&#x02019;s effects extended over the time course of the present study.

Supporting learning in a statistics course through an affirmation intervention produced positive, albeit small, differences over time for subjective and objective numeracy and generalized to the seemingly unrelated domains of financial literacy and health-related behaviors. The results illustrate how a social psychological approach can be leveraged to improve abstract numeric reasoning and important societal problems in turn. The results held eight weeks after the initial intervention. A further snowball effect may encourage longer term improvements in health and finances [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>The generalizability of the intervention&#x02019;s effects to financial literacy and health-related behaviors occurred despite abstract mathematical knowledge being difficult to acquire and especially difficult to transfer successfully to novel situations [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The values-affirmation intervention was intended to alter students&#x02019; perceptions of the statistics-class setting as one in which their values were taken seriously and therefore in which they could succeed. However, its effects appeared to generalize considerably beyond the intervention&#x02019;s setting, first, to the present study&#x02019;s mediators, objective and subjective numeracy, which were closely related to the course content, and, second, to financial literacy and health-related behaviors, which have been correlated with numeracy in past studies. Science literacy, also measured with a test but unrelated to numeracy, was unaffected by the intervention. These comparisons suggest greater generalization of the intervention to related than unrelated contexts. At the same time, the differential intervention effects on perceived efficacy vs. number preferences suggest that the intervention may affect performance efficacy while leaving unaffected how much participants like the topic; related research leaves open the possibility that number preferences too may change with more experience and time [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p><p>The SEM analyses further revealed positive and robust effects of improving numeracy across qualitatively different decision and STEM-related outcomes (e.g., an objective test, future courses taken, and self-reported outcomes). For STEM-related and financial outcomes, however, the lack of total effects from the intervention leads us to correlational conclusions: Greater numeracy was associated with superior STEM-related and financial outcomes and may encourage individuals to take other math or statistics courses, to start careers in STEM disciplines, and to achieve better financial outcomes. The intervention&#x02019;s causal effect on financial literacy further supports this latter statement. Overall, the robust SEM results suggest that a continued search for causal effects with financial and STEM-related outcomes may ultimately prove fruitful.</p><p>The better-fitting SEM models also indicated that the intervention improved subjective numeracy through its improvements to objective numeracy. Given past research on the relation of values affirmation to stress reduction [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], we might have expected the opposite (although similar results to the present ones emerged in Peters &#x00026; Bjalkebring [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). However, these data do not preclude an interactive model in which values affirmation initially reduced the stress of taking the course and improved subjective numeracy earlier (when we did not measure it) and then these improvements led to further reciprocity between objective and subjective numeracy later in the term.</p><p>The results also were consistent with the notion that both objective and subjective numeracy matter to decision outcomes, but operate through different psychological processes [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Objective numeracy was the proximal cause of the decision-outcome effects eight weeks after the initial manipulation (with subjective numeracy also mattering to financial literacy); subjective numeracy was the more proximal cause of improvements to STEM-related outcomes. It may be that mathematical operations and risk recognition (linked with objective numeracy) are most critical to health-related behaviors and financial outcomes whereas motivation, effort, and confidence with numbers (linked with subjective numeracy) are more critical to STEM-related outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>For health-related behaviors, for example, we know from past literature that more objectively numerate individuals tend to take on more health-protective behaviors than the less numerate [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. This link may be due to the highly numerate using relevant objective probabilities more in their choices [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] whereas the less objectively numerate rely on other heuristic processes such as the use of information frames, mood states, narrative information, and other irrelevant incidental sources of affect (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). It may be that intervention participants in the present study were more likely to consider, for example, the statistical odds of pregnancy and ill effects from not exercising when making decisions about sex and exercise-related health-protective behaviors. Control participants, who did not improve in objective numeracy, may have relied more instead on the joy of sex and avoidance of the pain of exercise, for example, to make their decisions. Because many of the health-related behaviors are common and changeable in a short time period, it is certainly possible that health-behavior changes could have emerged during this time period if numeracy began to improve early enough among the self-affirmed and/or to decline early enough in the control condition. We do not have direct evidence for these conjectures, however, and more research is needed.</p><p>We also do not have a definitive explanation for why we primarily showed protective effects on outcomes. In general, &#x0201c;self-affirmation theory proposes that people are motivated to protect their view of themselves as good, moral, and efficacious&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, p279], suggesting a protective effect for subjective numeracy in particular. Such protective effects are not uncommon in this literature. For example, values-affirmation interventions have prevented declines in academic performance [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and perceived academic potential and belongingness [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. It may be that college and other students, immediately prior to finals week (the present study&#x02019;s Time 2), were worn down, stressed, and less motivated, leading them to question their abilities more, perform less well, and choose healthy behaviors less often. The intervention may have reduced such effects as in past research [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. For financial literacy items, our overall effect was protective, but intervention participants did improve on two items. Although we cannot be sure of the explanation without further studies, we believe that affirmation reduced defensiveness to the numeracy-related material in these items and better allowed participants to make calculations, retrieve number-related knowledge, conduct numeric comparisons, and use logical inferences with number-related materials.</p><p>Although we believe that these protective effects were due to values-affirmation preventing declines that ordinarily take place over the course of the academic term and immediately prior to finals week), one could also reasonably attribute control-participant declines to reduced conscientiousness, general stress reactions, or some other unidentified more global response to the values-affirmation manipulation [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] in completing measures at Time 2. If that were the case, one would expect worse performance and evidence of less effort from the control group across all measures rather than only for numeracy-related measures. If the effects were due instead to values-affirmation in a statistics course as a numeracy intervention, however, we would expect that control participants would put less effort than intervention participants into numeracy-related tasks, but similar effort into non-numeracy-related tasks.</p><p>We tested these alternative explanations in three ways (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180674.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>). First, the values-affirmation manipulation did not influence performance on science literacy, a measure unrelated to numeracy. Second and at Time 2, we found that control participants spent less time on the symbolic-arithmetic portion of the ONS measure than did intervention participants (response times were not measured for the traditional numeracy items), but no difference existed between groups for time spent answering the science literacy questions. Finally, we examined the number of words participants wrote in response to an open-ended prompt about the purpose of the study at the end of the academic term (Time 2). If control participants were less conscientious overall, it seems likely that they would have written fewer words or skipped the question altogether. Instead, we found that control and intervention participants wrote the same number of words on average. Taken together, these results across several different possible measures of conscientiousness suggest that values-affirmation vs. control was associated with greater motivation on numeracy-related tasks; the data did not support control participants simply putting less effort into all tasks.</p><p>The intervention&#x02019;s effects instead could have been due to practice effects (e.g., for objective numeracy), but ONS scores improved in the intervention condition with a null effect in the control condition. The lack of intervention effects on science-literacy scores, which also could have shown practice effects, further softened possible practice-effect concerns.</p><p>The intervention did have an unexpected negative partial effect on Time-2 financial outcomes after controlling for the intervention&#x02019;s positive numeracy-mediated effect and Time-1 financial outcomes; this result may indicate a missing mediator [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. For example, affirming one&#x02019;s values may have improved financial outcomes through its positive numeracy effects while simultaneously reducing perceived financial stress, making these college students less careful than they might otherwise be about their finances.</p><p>The inconsistency between the results for financial outcomes and financial literacy may be explained by the fact that they measure different constructs. Financial outcomes do include knowledge, but it is knowledge about one&#x02019;s own financial situation, whereas the financial literacy items tested knowledge of general financial principles (as well as calculations and comparisons between numbers). It may be that greater financial literacy ultimately will lead (at a later time) to better financial outcomes among these student participants.</p><p>The intervention produced relatively small effects for financial literacy and health-related behaviors and no total effects for financial or STEM outcomes; it would be helpful to understand how to increase these effect sizes. One possibility is through better measurement. For health-related behaviors and financial outcomes, in particular, insufficient time may have passed to detect much change (e.g., in starting up a savings or emergency fund). In addition, some items were predicated by &#x0201c;in the past year&#x0201d;, so that reported negative outcomes may have preceded the manipulation (we had planned to assess intervention effects one and two years after the statistics course, but were unable to recruit sufficient participants; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180674.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>). Second, we may be able to increase the manipulation&#x02019;s strength. Our exploratory SNS analyses revealed that the intervention improved perceived ability, but not attitudes towards using numbers and perhaps not subjective norms [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Future research should examine whether a values-affirmation manipulation has stronger effects when used in combination with an attitude and/or norm intervention. Alternatively, combining a values-affirmation manipulation with a numeracy intervention more focused than taking a required statistics course may improve effects.</p><p>The present study did not replicate prior results demonstrating that females who held negative gender stereotypes about science or math experienced better outcomes following values affirmation [28, 38, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180674.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>]. However, the present results and 75% female sample are consistent with past research showing that classrooms comprised mostly of women minimize stereotype-threat effects [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The intervention&#x02019;s effects also were not stronger for individuals who had higher Time-1 trait math anxiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0180674.s001">S1 Supporting Information</xref>) although this finding was limited by our measure which focused on past reactions rather than future expectations. The math anxiety measure we chose may have been too focused on past reactions (e.g., &#x0201c;I have usually been at ease during math tests&#x0201d;). In hindsight, we should have chosen a measure focused on current feelings and their projections onto future expectations (e.g., the everyday math anxiety scale, [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>])</p><p>In addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that the present effects are limited in their generalizability because of our use of undergraduate psychology students. Although our psychology students are not known for having high math skills and interest in taking this required statistics course, more educated samples are more numerate than the population at large [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Values-affirmation effects, however, are usually stronger among vulnerable populations (e.g., first-generation college students [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], women [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], or minorities [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and have been found in secondary educational settings [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and with poor community members [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Given that the sample was predominately female, our results also may be particularly applicable to female populations. Because women tend to have lower financial literacy [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and lower numeracy (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]) than men, our results suggest that future research should examine whether numeracy interventions could reduce the gender gap in financial literacy.</p><p>The results do replicate prior results that math education can fail to produce desired outcomes unless conducted in a supportive environment [<xref rid="pone.0180674.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0180674.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the current sample, only affirmed students showed the expected benefits of the statistics course. In contrast, the control group&#x02019;s objective numeracy remained unchanged over the academic term, and they became less confident in their numerical abilities.</p><p>Taking math and statistics courses has long been considered important for STEM-related careers and national outcomes. Less attention has been paid, however, to the ubiquity of numerical information in health and financial decisions (e.g., mortgages, credit card debt, medical-treatment options). Based on the present data, improving math skills will also directly and/or indirectly improve decision outcomes in these areas.
