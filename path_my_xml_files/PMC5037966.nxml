Periosteum is a biological graft that fulfils the major prerequisites for cartilage repair.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> It contains pluripotential stem cells that are capable of differentiating into bone and cartilage. Besides superior cellularity, periosteum serves as its own scaffold, providing attachment sites and growth factors. For the repair of major osteochondral defects, osteoperiosteal grafts have been used successfully in the past.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> However, the use of a cancellous bone graft may present additional complications to the procedure and produces graft site morbidity.

In our <italic>in vivo</italic> rabbit experiment, porous TM scaffolds promoted excellent bone regeneration and integration of the construct into the adjacent tissue. Neo-cartilage formation from periosteum supported by the metal scaffold was promising. Wherever we found a healthy layer of neo-cartilage it was well bonded to the underlying subchondral bone. The overall mean histological score for TMPG was 13.4. This is in line with our present study with a mean histological score of 12.7 for the TMPG group. However, biochemical and histological analysis in the present study revealed that the TM and TMPG treatment groups resulted in a regenerate that was inferior compared with healthy controls (AC). This was somewhat expected but there were no gross differences between the TM and TMPG treatment groups. Although periosteum has established chondrogenic potential and is a compatible partner of TM,<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> neo-cartilage formation after TMPG treatment performed less well than expected especially when being compared with the histological score yield after treatment with TM alone. Thus, the high quality neo-cartilage obtained by optimised chondrogenic culture conditions <italic>in vitro</italic> could not be reproduced <italic>in vivo</italic> in this sheep study.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Moreover, the defects that were left untreated performed almost identically to the implant groups.

Our defects (8 mm diameter, 13 mm depth) were even larger than those in our previous sheep model (6 mm diameter, 12 mm depth) and it is generally recognised that empty critical-sized defects such as those in our model do not heal properly.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bibr34-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="bibr39-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> One reason for this divergence could be the accidentally inconsistent depth of the created defects. As for the untreated defects, the interpretation of the findings remains uncertain.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is clear that the novel design of a TMPG biocomposite allowed for secure implant fixation and fast integration within three months. This could potentially enable early weight-bearing and progressive rehabilitation protocols for treated patients in the future. Also, TMPG composites were kept in a culture medium containing transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;1 (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 prior to implantation in order to enhance cambium layer cellularity and chondrogenic potential of aged periosteum to levels comparable with younger individuals, thereby rejuvenating aged periosteum.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> However, this design failed to reconstitute large osteochondral defects in a large animal model. Possible reasons are the implantation method of the biocomposite that were press fitted using a hammer after having sutured the periosteal flap onto the TM cylinder. This may have caused damage to the cambium layer of the periosteum as discussed previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In order to avoid this it might have been better if we had sutured the periosteal flap onto the TM cylinder after the metal was implanted. Moreover, the method of creating the defects - either using a drill<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> or a core cutter<sup><xref rid="bibr42-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> - potentially caused bone necrosis.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2046-3758.59.BJR-2016-0070.R1" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Other critical factors are unfavourable biomechanical properties of the implant including high stiffness and low elasticity that might prevent cartilage formation.
