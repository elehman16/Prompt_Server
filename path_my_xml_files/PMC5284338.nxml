<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> which has led to restricted treatment access for patients with RA in several regions.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref></p><p>A number of biologics used to treat RA&#x02014;including originator infliximab (Remicade), hereafter referred to as the reference product (RP)&#x02014;have reached or are approaching patent expiry in many countries. As a consequence, follow-on biologics (also termed &#x02018;biosimilars&#x02019;) are being developed for the treatment of RA. A biosimilar can be defined as a &#x02018;biotherapeutic product that is similar in terms of quality, safety, and efficacy to an already licensed reference biotherapeutic product&#x02019;.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In order to gain approval, it is usually necessary to show that a biosimilar is highly similar to the RP in physicochemical and biological terms. In addition, clinical studies are generally needed to establish statistical equivalence in pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy and to characterise biosimilar safety.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Since the first approval of a biosimilar by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2006, a number of these agents, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factors and erythropoietins, have become available in Europe. Indeed, the range of therapeutic areas now covered by approved biosimilars is wide and includes cancer, anaemia, neutropenia and diabetes.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Data for these EMA-approved biosimilars consistently show that they provide comparable efficacy and safety relative to their RPs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;23</xref> Recently, CT-P13 (Remsima, Inflectra)&#x02014;a biosimilar of infliximab RP&#x02014;became the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar to be approved in Europe for use in all indications held by the infliximab RP.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> All major physicochemical characteristics and in vitro biological activities of CT-P13 and the RP, including affinity for both soluble and transmembrane forms of TNF, are highly comparable.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Approval of CT-P13 was partly based on findings from two 54-week, multinational, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group studies, which compared CT-P13 and RP in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and RA Programme evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in AS patients (PLANETAS) and Programme evaLuating the Autoimmune disease iNvEstigational drug cT-p13 in RA patients (PLANETRA)). These studies demonstrated that CT-P13 and RP are highly comparable in terms of PK, efficacy, immunogenicity and safety in both RA and AS.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;29</xref> However, an important unanswered question for prescribing physicians is whether it is possible to switch from RP to CT-P13 in patients with RA without any detrimental effects on safety and efficacy.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>Here, we report the findings from an open-label extension of the PLANETRA study. There were two main aims of the extension study: (1) to investigate the efficacy and safety of switching to CT-P13 in patients previously treated with RP for 54&#x02005;weeks in PLANETRA (hereafter named the &#x02018;switch group&#x02019;) and (2) to investigate the longer-term efficacy and safety of extended CT-P13 treatment over 2&#x02005;years in patients previously treated with CT-P13 in PLANETRA (the &#x02018;maintenance group&#x02019;). To facilitate understanding of the data, the results for the maintenance and switch groups are described both for the main (weeks 0&#x02013;54) and the extension (weeks 54&#x02013;102) studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Full details of the methods of the 54-week, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group PLANETRA study have been reported previously,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

Eligible patients did not respond adequately to &#x02265;3&#x02005;months of treatment with methotrexate (MTX) and received a stable MTX dose (12.5&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week) for &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks before screening. Patients who had completed the main 54-week PLANETRA study were offered the opportunity to enter the extension study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01571219) for another 1&#x02005;year. Those who did not sign a new informed consent for the extension study were excluded. Some of the relevant Ministries of Health (MoH) and ethics committees (ECs) did not approve the extension study, mainly due to the fact that data from the PLANETRA study were not available at the time of EC evaluation. Thus, patients from affected institutions were also excluded.</p><p>Additional eligibility criteria applied for this extension study included no major protocol violations in the main study and no new therapy for RA in the extension study.

In the main study, patients received nine infusions of CT-P13 (CELLTRION, Incheon, Republic of Korea) or the infliximab RP (Janssen Biotech, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA). After study treatment in PLANETRA, eligible patients could choose to continue in the extension study. However, patients and physicians continued to be blinded to the treatment that the patient had received during the main study. All patients participating in and completing this extension study received six infusions of CT-P13 from week 62 to week 102. During the whole study period, CT-P13 was administered via 2 h intravenous infusion at a fixed dose of 3&#x02005;mg/kg. At the discretion of the investigator, antihistamines were provided 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min prior to infusion of CT-P13. MTX (12.5&#x02013;25&#x02005;mg/week; oral or parenteral) and folic acid (&#x02265;5&#x02005;mg/week; oral) were coadministered to all patients throughout the main and extension study periods.

Importantly, in the switch group, no notable differences in ACR response rates were observed between week 54 (ie, the last RP treatment) and week 102 (ie, 48&#x02005;weeks after the last RP infusion). Patients in the maintenance group of this extension study received CT-P13 for a total of 102&#x02005;weeks. In this cohort, the responses to CT-P13 observed in the main study were sustained during the extension study. In the main parallel-group phase of PLANETRA,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> ACR responses were broadly comparable with those observed in previous randomised studies of RP up to 54&#x02005;weeks.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31&#x02013;33</xref> The multinational Anti-TNF Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy (ATTRACT) was the pivotal study of MTX plus either RP or placebo in patients with RA. Eligibility criteria for that study were similar to those for PLANETRA. A comparison of the 102-week data presented here with data from the same treatment duration of ATTRACT confirms that ACR response rates in the former were at least comparable with those in ATTRACT (if not higher).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> These data support the long-term efficacy of CT-P13 in patients with RA. Further efficacy endpoints&#x02014;including DAS28-CRP, DAS28-ESR and EULAR-CRP or EULAR-ESR responses&#x02014;were also maintained from week 54 to 102 in the switch group and were comparable between the maintenance and switch groups at weeks 78 and 102. In addition, the proportion of patients with remission by ACR/EULAR criteria, CDAI, DAS28 and DAS28 low disease activity was also comparable between the two treatment groups during the whole study period. Together, this suggests that there was no detrimental impact on efficacy of switching from RP to CT-P13 in patients with RA. Sensitivity analyses supported the sustained efficacy and comparability observed between the two groups. A multiple analysis approach, using LOCF and NRI methods, reported similar results, both in the maintenance group and in the switch group. Analyses of the main study ITT population and the extension study ITT population using the LOCF approach showed comparable and sustained outcomes throughout the 2-year study period. When analysed using the NRI approach, response rates at week 78 and week 102 in the main study ITT population were lower than when the LOCF approach was used. However, response rates were similar in both groups regardless of approach. Variations in response rates that occurred according to the analysis method were caused by the fact that some responders in the main study did not participate in the extension study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2015208786F1">figure 1</xref>). In order to further understand the influence of non-participants in the extension study, patient demographics at baseline, disease characteristics at baseline and week 54 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> B) and ACR20 responses according to ADA status at week 54 (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix</xref> I) were further analysed for this population. The results support the comparability between CT-P13 and RP groups, even for non-participants.</p><p>CT-P13 was well tolerated during the extension study and displayed a long-term safety profile consistent with that of infliximab RP.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> There was no noticeable difference in the safety profile before and after switching<italic>.</italic> After week 54 of the main study, the incidence of TEAEs, drug-related TEAEs or SAEs was similar between the maintenance and switch groups. The incidence of all potential infusion-related reactions did not increase when patients previously treated with RP were switched to CT-P13. During the extension study, 11 (6.9%) patients in the maintenance group and 4 (2.8%) patients in the switch group experienced infusion-related reactions. Infusion-related reactions were reported for 8 (5.0%) patients in the maintenance group and 13 (9.1%) patients in the switch group in the main study (ie, before the switch). Most of these events were of mild to moderate severity.</p><p>In terms of immunogenicity, the proportion of patients with ADAs remained stable and did not increase between weeks 54 and 102 in either group, although only qualitative analysis of ADA data was performed. In a similarly designed extension of the PLANETAS study, the proportion of patients with AS with ADAs also did not increase consistently.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In the PLANETRA extension study, the ADA rate was comparable between the maintenance and switch groups at 102&#x02005;weeks. The proportion of patients with sustained ADAs during the entire study period was also highly similar between groups. Similarly, in the PLANETAS extension study, the number of patients with AS with sustained ADAs was also similar between maintenance and switch groups. These data indicate no detrimental effect on immunogenicity when changing from RP to CT-P13, at least for the first six infusions. There was no analysis for IgG4.</p><p>Concomitant use of MTX has been shown to reduce the immunogenicity of infliximab.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In PLANETRA, MTX was coadministered throughout the study. Given that the initial and most recent doses of MTX were similar between the maintenance and switch groups (initial dose: 15.47 vs 15.51&#x02005;mg/week; most recent dose: 15.52 vs 15.40&#x02005;mg/week), it can be assumed that the effect of MTX on the development of ADAs was also similar between both groups. ADAs to infliximab are associated with a reduced clinical response to this drug, as well as to infusion-related reactions and other unwanted effects.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Compared with ADA-negative patients, ADA-positive patients in our study had lower ACR20 response rates and higher levels of CRP and ESR. Such trends were comparable in both the maintenance and switch groups. All of the patients reporting infusion-related reactions were ADA positive in both groups. These results suggest that the effects of switching from RP to CT-P13 did not influence the impact of ADAs.</p><p>The findings from the PLANETRA extension study indicate that there are no harmful effects on efficacy, safety or immunogenicity associated with switching from RP to CT-P13 in patients with RA. Similarly, no detrimental effects of switching were observed in an extension of the PLANETAS study performed in patients with AS.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The current results are also aligned with those observed in switching studies with other biosimilars that have been approved by the EMA, which has stringent guidelines relating to the regulation of these types of agents. Switching data from a number of randomised and non-randomised trials consistently show that detrimental effects of switching between reference biologics and their EMA-approved biosimilars are unlikely to happen.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40&#x02013;45</xref></p><p>The current extension study was not formally designed to evaluate the non-inferiority or equivalence of switching to CT-P13 from RP versus continual CT-P13 treatment. In this respect, a randomised, double-blind, phase IV study has been initiated in Norway (&#x02018;NOR-SWITCH&#x02019;; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02148640) to formally examine the switchability of CT-P13 in a variety of indications. Additionally, a comprehensive pharmacovigilance programme by the manufacturers of CT-P13 is also ongoing. These postmarketing surveillance and registry studies will monitor the safety of CT-P13 in patients with AS, RA and other inflammatory diseases who have switched from RP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This multinational, open-label extension study demonstrated that in patients with RA receiving MTX, switching from RP to CT-P13 was not associated with any detrimental effects on efficacy, immunogenicity or safety.
