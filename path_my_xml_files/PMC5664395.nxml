B-cell lymphoma. A subcutaneous formulation of rituximab is expected to simplify
and shorten drug preparation and administration, and to reduce treatment burden.
MabEase (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier:
01649856</italic>) examined efficacy, safety and patient satisfaction with
subcutaneous rituximab plus chemotherapy in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients
with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Patients were randomized 2:1 to subcutaneous
rituximab (intravenous 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycle 1; subcutaneous 1,400 mg
cycles 2&#x02013;8) or intravenous rituximab (375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> cycles
1&#x02013;8) plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone
every 14 or 21 days. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed complete
response/unconfirmed complete response. Secondary endpoints included safety,
treatment satisfaction (Cancer Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire and
Rituximab Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire), time savings, and
survival. Of 576 randomized patients, 572 (378 subcutaneous; 194 intravenous)
received treatment. End of induction complete response/unconfirmed complete
response rates were 50.6% (subcutaneous) and 42.4%
(intravenous). After a median 35 months, median overall, event-free and
progression-free survivals were not reached. Grade &#x02265;3 adverse events
(subcutaneous 58.3%; intravenous 54.3%) and
administration-related adverse events (both groups 21%) were similar
between arms. Injection-site reactions were more common with subcutaneous
injections (5.7% <italic>versus</italic> 0%, respectively).
Rituximab Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire scores for &#x02018;impact
on activities of daily living&#x02019;, &#x02018;convenience&#x02019;, and
&#x02018;satisfaction&#x02019; were improved with subcutaneous
<italic>versus</italic> intravenous injections; Cancer Therapy Satisfaction
Questionnaire scores were similar between arms. Median administration time (6
minutes <italic>vs</italic>. 2.6 to 3.0 hours), chair/bed and overall hospital
times were shorter with subcutaneous <italic>versus</italic> intravenous
rituximab. Overall, subcutaneous and intravenous rituximab had similar efficacy
and safety, with improved patient satisfaction and time savings.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intravenous (IV) rituximab plus chemotherapy is standard treatment for diffuse large
B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and follicular lymphoma (FL)<sup><xref rid="b1-1021913" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-1021913" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> on the basis of improved efficacy <italic>versus</italic>

addition to the primary treatment goal of optimizing patient outcomes, such as
response rate, progression-free and overall survival, simplifying treatment and
reducing treatment burden are also important aims for patients and healthcare
providers. Subcutaneous (SC) dosing has the potential to simplify administration,
reduce the treatment burden for patients, and reduce resource utilization at the
treatment facility.<sup><xref rid="b9-1021913" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-1021913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>To address these needs in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a SC formulation
of rituximab has been developed. Two studies using a pharmacokinetic and clinical
bridging approach, SABRINA and SparkThera, have demonstrated pharmacokinetic
non-inferiority for rituximab SC compared with the IV formulation in patients with
FL.<sup><xref rid="b14-1021913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-1021913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In SABRINA, when given in
a three-weekly dosing schedule as first-line treatment, geometric mean rituximab
trough concentrations at cycle 7 were 83.13 mg/mL for rituximab IV and 134.58 mg/mL
for rituximab SC, with comparable efficacy and safety between
formulations.<sup><xref rid="b14-1021913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-1021913" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In addition, the phase Ib
SAWYER study demonstrated pharmacokinetic non-inferiority and similar safety
profiles for rituximab SC and IV (both with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide) in
first-line chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.<sup><xref rid="b17-1021913" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-1021913" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The accumulating clinical data, along with the established

the authorization of rituximab SC for patients with NHL, and rituximab SC has
subsequently been approved in Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of DLBCL and
FL.<sup><xref rid="b21-1021913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b23-1021913" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The SC formulation takes

rituximab IV,<sup><xref rid="b19-1021913" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b21-1021913" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and studies have confirmed
that this new presentation offers improved patient convenience and healthcare
resource savings over the IV form.<sup><xref rid="b13-1021913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b24-1021913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Herein we report the final analysis of the MabEase study in patients with previously
untreated CD20<sup>+</sup> DLBCL, an aggressive form of NHL that is treated with
curative intent. The objectives of MabEase were to examine the efficacy and safety
of rituximab SC <italic>versus</italic> the IV formulation as part of a rituximab
plus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) regimen.
Patient satisfaction with treatment was also assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>MabEase (<italic><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier:

study. The study was conducted in line with International Conference on
Harmonisation E6 guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and the Declaration of
Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by independent ethics committees at
each center. The first patient was enrolled on 22 August 2012, and the data
cut-off for the current analysis was 18 September 2016. All patients provided
written informed consent. Additional methodological details are provided in the

according to age (&#x0003c;60 or &#x02265;60 years), IPI risk category (low,
low-intermediate, high-intermediate, high), and chemotherapy regimen (CHOP-14,
CHOP-21).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>All patients were scheduled to receive eight cycles of rituximab in accordance

received six to eight cycles of CHOP chemotherapy every 14 (CHOP-14) or 21
(CHOP-21) days (see the <italic>Online Supplementary Appendix</italic>). The
planned CHOP regimen for each patient was chosen by the center prior to
randomization. However, patients scheduled to receive eight cycles of CHOP who
achieved a complete response (CR)/unconfirmed complete response (CRu) after
cycle 4 could be reduced to two additional rituximab plus CHOP cycles (for a
total of six CHOP cycles), followed by two rituximab monotherapy cycles (for a
total of eight rituximab cycles). Patients randomized to rituximab SC received
rituximab IV 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day one of cycle 1, then rituximab SC 1,400
mg on day one of the subsequent seven cycles (eight rituximab doses in total).
Patients randomized to the IV arm received rituximab 375 mg/m<sup>2</sup> on day
one of each cycle. All patients received rituximab IV during cycle 1 in order to
allow appropriate intervention in the event of an administration-related
reaction (ARR).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed CR/CRu rate according to Cheson

Satisfaction Questionnaire (CTSQ) and Rituximab Administration Satisfaction
Questionnaire (RASQ) and time savings; namely rituximab administration time,
chair/bed time, and hospital time. Other secondary endpoints were
progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival (EFS), disease-free
survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). The end of the study was defined as
the last patient visit in the follow-up period when all patients had been
followed for at least 24 months after their last dose of study treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>This was a descriptive study designed to exclude major differences in efficacy
between treatment arms as measured by CR/CRu rates. There was no formal
statistical hypothesis for treatment comparison. The calculated sample size (600
patients) was based on the primary endpoint, and no power calculation was
performed for PFS.</p><p>The final analysis was performed in the ITT population when the last patient had
completed at least 24 months of follow up after the EOI, or when one of the
following had been documented for all randomized patients: disease recurrence,
withdrawal from study, loss to follow up or death, or whichever occurred

discontinued rituximab treatment because of AEs (SC, 30
[8.1%]; IV, 19 [9.4%]), the most
common of which were infections and infestations (2.4% and 2.5%
of patients in the SC and IV groups, respectively; all treatment cycles). When
cycle 1 was excluded, discontinuation rates were 7.9% for SC and
5.3% for IV rituximab; infection and infestation rates were 2.4%
(SC) and 1.1% (IV). More SC patients (138
[37.4%]) had an interruption/delay in their rituximab
treatment due to AEs when compared with the IV arm (56
[27.6%]; safety population, all cycles). The most common
reasons (&#x0003e;2% of patients) were neutropenia (SC, 34

13 [3.5%]; IV, 1 [0.5%]),
pneumonia (SC, 8 [2.2%]; IV, 6

blood cell count decreased (SC, 10 [2.7%]; IV, 3

patients in the SC group (8.7%) and 14 in the IV group (6.9%).
The main causes were infections and infestations (SC, 14
[3.8%]; IV, 4 [2.0%]), cardiac
disorders (SC, 4 [1.4%]; IV, 4

efficacy and safety between rituximab SC and IV treatment arms in newly diagnosed
DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP. The primary endpoint results indicated similar
efficacy of the rituximab SC and IV formulations in our overall study
population.</p><p>We note that patient demographics in MabEase differed from those in many key trials
of R-CHOP in DLBCL patients. For example, the patient population in the MabThera
International Trial group (MInT) study was younger (18&#x02013;60 years), with low
IPI risk scores,<sup><xref rid="b4-1021913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> whereas
the populations in the LNH98.5<sup><xref rid="b3-1021913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> LNH03-6B,<sup><xref rid="b26-1021913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and rituximab with CHOP over age 60 years
(RICOVER-60)<sup><xref rid="b8-1021913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>
studies were older (60&#x02013;80 years). However, we suggest that comparisons of
outcomes with these studies, although indirect, are valid and informative once
demographic differences are taken into consideration.</p><p>Overall, previous trials of R-CHOP regimens including rituximab IV reported CR/CRu
rates ranging from 58% to 86% in patients with previously untreated
DLBCL.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-1021913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b26-1021913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-1021913" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The
CR/CRu rates in our study (SC, 50.6%; IV, 42.4%) were lower, which
may relate to the number of patients in the ITT population who did not complete the
planned course of treatment. The MabEase ITT population included all patients who
completed a baseline assessment and at least one on-treatment efficacy assessment,
with the first efficacy assessment conducted at interim staging at the end of cycle
4. However, approximately 18% of patients discontinued study treatment
before the end of cycle 8, predominantly because of AEs. For SC and IV patients who
completed all eight cycles of induction, CR/CRu rates were 57% and
47%, respectively. In addition, distinguishing PR from CRu using a CT scan
alone is difficult. Current criteria recommend using PET scans where possible in
order to better delineate disease extent and treatment response in DLBCL.<sup><xref rid="b28-1021913" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> However, due to limited
PET availability, the MabEase study protocol prespecified the use of CT scans only
for all tumor assessments. This may also have contributed to the apparently low CR
rate. Another limitation was the lack of centralized radiologic review. For these
aforementioned reasons the CR rates in MabEase should be interpreted with caution.
Despite the lower CR rate, the overall response rate in our study (CR/CRu plus PR;
approximately 80%) was similar to observations in previous
studies.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-1021913" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b26-1021913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Some trends towards higher CR/CRu rates were seen with SC treatment in some
subgroups, but these did not translate into improvements in PFS or EFS, with a small
number of subgroups showing increased rates of progression, relapse or death, or
increased event rates. We note that these analyses were exploratory only, however,
and that patient numbers in the subgroups were too small to permit any conclusions
to be drawn. In particular, very few patients (approximately 10%) received
CHOP-14 in MabEase, and it is therefore not possible to draw meaningful comparisons
with response rates in the CHOP-21 or overall populations. Survival results overall
were similar for both formulations in the ITT population.</p><p>In MabEase, similar safety profiles were observed in the SC and IV arms. There were
no new safety signals, and the rate of treatment-related deaths was comparable with
rates reported in other studies.<sup><xref rid="b3-1021913" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-1021913" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b26-1021913" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> ARRs with rituximab have
been well characterized in previous studies, particularly during cycle 1.<sup><xref rid="b29-1021913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> To minimize ARR risk,
rituximab was infused at a low initial rate, which was then increased incrementally.
All patients received rituximab IV during cycle 1. Consistent with the reported
SparkThera (phase Ib) and SABRINA (phase III) studies,<sup><xref rid="b14-1021913" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-1021913" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> we observed a higher rate of ARRs with rituximab SC
<italic>versus</italic> IV. As expected, injection site reactions were more
common with SC than with IV treatment, but these were mostly mild/moderate (&#x0003c;
grade 3) and manageable.</p><p>The most frequent SAE in this study was FN (SC, 11.7%; IV 6.4%),
although there was no difference between groups in rates of treatment
discontinuation due to AEs or infections. FN and grade 3 neutropenia were more
frequently reported in the rituximab SC arm, and we do not have a comprehensive
explanation for this observation. However, in DLBCL studies with rituximab dose
intensification, and thus higher rituximab serum levels, more neutropenia and/or FN
were also reported.<sup><xref rid="b30-1021913" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-1021913" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Compared with other
studies in DLBCL, the overall incidence of FN in our study (9.9%) was
similar to that reported by Cunningham <italic>et al</italic>. among patients
receiving the CHOP-21 regimen (11%),<sup><xref rid="b27-1021913" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> and to specific analysis of FN among the
DLBCL cohort of the PrefMab crossover phase IIIb study in which patients with DLBCL
or FL received rituximab SC and IV in different sequences (9.4%; data not
reported by Rummel <italic>et al</italic>.).<sup><xref rid="b24-1021913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Analysis of patient subgroups showed a
trend towards higher incidence of AEs and SAEs in patients with low BSA. These
effects were not significant, however, and no significant interaction effect was
found for AEs of grade &#x02265;3 or SAEs for any of the covariates (BSA, age, or
sex).</p><p>CTSQ results showed that patients had similar levels of satisfaction with the R-CHOP
treatment when used with either SC or IV rituximab, which is consistent with CTSQ
data obtained in the PrefMab study.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> However, RASQ data suggested that most rituximab SC
patients, given the option, preferred to have the SC injection over the IV infusion;
again this finding reiterates the preference for rituximab SC expressed by
80.7% of patients in PrefMab.<sup><xref rid="b24-1021913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Consistent with our findings, in PrefMab, rituximab SC
scored more highly for satisfaction with therapy (87.5% <italic>vs</italic>.
75.0% for IV), impact on activities of daily living and convenience of
therapy (both 83.3% <italic>vs</italic>. 58.3%).<sup><xref rid="b24-1021913" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Of note, the CTSQ was
designed for use in a wide range of cancer types and stages.<sup><xref rid="b32-1021913" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> In contrast, the RASQ was
developed specifically for the assessment of patients&#x02019; perceptions of the
impact of treatment administration route.<sup><xref rid="b33-1021913" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup></p><p>The use of rituximab SC resulted in substantial savings in clinic time. These
findings concur with a time and motion analysis based on data collected within the
MabCute study<sup><xref rid="b34-1021913" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> in
patients with indolent NHL, which evaluated aspects of SC and IV administration of
rituximab in real-world clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="b13-1021913" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Reductions in chair time could potentially
reduce waiting lists, increase the efficiency of oncology units, and increase the
availability of appointments. In addition, the healthcare practitioner time gained
could be deployed in other activities. Cost minimization data from The Netherlands
also indicate the potential for cost savings with rituximab SC when compared with IV
dosing.<sup><xref rid="b35-1021913" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although
reductions in clinic time could also reduce the opportunity for healthcare
professionals to provide patient support, the RASQ findings indicated that patients
felt that this factor did not compromise their treatment, and that they had
sufficient time to discuss their treatment with their healthcare providers.</p><p>In conclusion, the MabEase study showed no major differences between the efficacy of
rituximab SC and IV therapy in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with DLBCL. Overall,
safety was similar between arms but with a higher incidence of FN and injection site
reactions in the rituximab SC arm. The higher RASQ scores in the rituximab SC arm
suggest that patient satisfaction, convenience, and effect on daily living were
improved with rituximab SC compared with IV. Attempts to improve care for patients
with DLBCL, including short treatment intervals, consolidation with high-dose
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation and replacement of rituximab
with the type II CD20 antibody obinutuzumab, have so far been
unsuccessful.<sup><xref rid="b29-1021913" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b36-1021913" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38-1021913" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Combined with previous evidence, the
results of this study provide support for the use of rituximab SC in this
setting.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-1021913"><p>Check the online version for the most updated information on this article, online
