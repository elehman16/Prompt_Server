Several web-based interventions for MDD have shown to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, it is not known whether web-based interventions, when used as adjunctive treatment tools to regular psychotherapy, have an additional effect compared to regular psychotherapy for depression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a currently recruiting pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) that compares regular psychotherapy <italic>plus</italic> a web-based depression program (&#x0201c;deprexis&#x0201d;) with a control condition exclusively receiving regular psychotherapy. Adults with a depressive disorder (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;800) will be recruited in routine secondary care from therapists over the course of their initial sessions and will then be randomized within therapists to one of the two conditions. The primary outcome is depressive symptoms measured with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at three months post randomization. Secondary outcomes include changes on various indicators such as anxiety, somatic symptoms and quality of life. All outcomes are again assessed at the secondary endpoint six months post randomization.

Several meta-analysis have shown that web-based self-help interventions can contribute to depressive symptom reduction and there is considerable support for the use of the Internet for delivering evidence-based psychotherapy for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, several studies suggest that web-based self-help interventions without support seem to result in more modest outcomes and considerably higher dropout rates than treatments including regular web-based support from therapists or technically qualified persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>There is growing knowledge about the effects of web-based interventions. However, research on combining web-based technologies with traditional face-to-face therapy, i.e., blended treatments, is sparse. Importantly, the term <italic>blended treatment</italic> includes any possible combination of regular face-to-face treatments and web-based interventions. For instance, treatment components of a web-delivered intervention may be integrated intensively and used during the face-to-face treatment, or, as in the current study, may rather be used as an adjunctive intervention. Since research on blended treatments is scarce, it remains to a large extent an open question <italic>if</italic> and <italic>how</italic> web-based interventions can be combined meaningfully with traditional forms of psychotherapy and whether this may have an incremental effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>So far, only a few studies have investigated combinations of regular face-to-face therapy and web-based adjunctive tools in mental disorders. For example, there are promising results regarding symptomatology and acceptability for (palmtop-) computer-assisted psychotherapies in different anxiety disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, in a study in which 77 individuals seeking treatment for substance dependence were randomly assigned to regular face-to-face psychotherapy or regular face-to-face psychotherapy with biweekly access to a computer-based training in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), participants in the blended condition submitted significantly more drug-negative urine specimens and tended to have longer continuous periods of abstinence during treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Moreover, a 6-month follow-up showed significantly better durability of effects of the combined treatment over regular treatment for both self-report and urinalysis data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These results were replicated in a larger randomized clinical trial in a more homogeneous clinical population, i.e., cocaine-dependent individuals maintained on methadone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Regarding MDD and combined treatments, research is very sparse. For example, Wright and colleagues conducted an open trial of a computer-assisted psychotherapeutic treatment in a sample consisting predominantly of patients suffering from depression. Results indicated a high rate of patient acceptance of this form of treatment, and scores of symptom severity as well as the mean score on a measure of cognitive therapy knowledge were significantly improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subsequently, Wright and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] conducted a RCT comparing a conventional face-to-face cognitive therapy (CT), a wait-list, and computer-assisted cognitive therapy with reduced therapist contact in patients suffering from a MDD. Results indicated that the combined condition was more effective than the wait-list condition and equally effective as conventional CT. These effects were maintained over a 6-month period. Furthermore, computer-assisted cognitive therapy showed more robust effects, relative to being wait-listed, than standard cognitive therapy in reducing measures of cognitive distortion and in improving knowledge about cognitive therapy.</p><p>Recently, Mansson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] conducted a proof-of-concept study on the effectiveness of a blended form of psychotherapy in a mixed anxious-depressed sample. The adjunctive web-based platform was to be used at home and in the clinical setting where treatment was provided. The main part of the platform consisted mainly of material that would have been presented on paper or verbally in a face-to-face session. Additionally, the platform comprised some basic components of CBT, such as scheduling sessions, keeping an agenda, and setting goals. Results indicated that this blended treatment had a positive effect across anxious and depressive symptom measures as well as on a quality of life measure in a mixed sample of 15 patients suffering from MDD and/or anxiety disorders. Additionally, patients as well as therapists rated the treatment mostly favorably. Positive patients&#x02019; feedback included, for example: memory support and learning, potential to gain an overview of the treatment process, positive implications for homework assignments, promotion of a sense of autonomy and responsibility.</p><p>The literature cited above indicates that combining traditional face-to-face psychotherapy and web-based tools may be a promising venue. A possible explanation for these results is highlighted by a recent review, which concludes that patients&#x02019; treatment adherence may be improved through new technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Potential benefits of blending treatments could for example be a greater reduction of depressive symptoms or more cost-efficacious treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, there could also be some serious downsides of combining conventional face-to-face treatments and new technologies. For example, a recent randomized controlled study showed that appointment reminder via SMS did not lead to higher appointment attendance as expected and, more importantly, that more client dropped out in the reminder condition compared to the no reminder condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Finally, to our knowledge there is no study that investigates how the blending of treatments affects important process variables such as the therapeutic alliance.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective and research questions</title><p>The main objective of the present study is to further investigate combined treatment approaches for MDD by evaluating an empirically validated web-based treatment (<italic>deprexis;</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]) as an adjunctive tool in regular psychotherapeutic treatment in comparison with traditional psychotherapy in a sample of depressed outpatients by means of a pragmatic RCT in routine care. Therefore, our main hypothesis is that the combined treatment (TAU plus Deprexis) is more effective than regular psychotherapeutic treatment (TAU) alone.</p><p>Additionally, during a 6-month period we intend to test on an exploratory basis how helpful patients as well as therapists rate the combined treatment and whether the combination is associated with increased efficiency (i.e., reduction of number of sessions) or with negative side effects (e.g., lower quality of the therapeutic alliance, increased drop-out rate).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p>A two-armed randomized pragmatic RCT is currently being conducted to compare regular face-to-face psychotherapeutic treatment with a combined treatment, i.e., face-to-face psychotherapeutic treatment <italic>plus</italic> a web-based adjunctive treatment tool (<italic>deprexis</italic>).

A more comprehensive description of the program can be found in Meyer and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Communication between the participant and <italic>deprexis</italic> takes place over simulated online-dialogues in which the user reacts to the content by clicking on multiple-choice answers, e.g., in order to express doubts, to confirm particular contents, or to request further information. Text units are illustrated with drawings, pictures and audio clips. The modules can be accessed repeatedly during the intervention interval. Depending on the reading speed of the participants the completion of a module takes between 10 and 60&#x000a0;minutes.</p><p>Furthermore, <italic>deprexis</italic> includes short questionnaires for the assessment of current mood, which offers the possibility to visually inspect the mood trajectory over the course of therapy. Additionally, the program provides the user with printable summaries and work sheets. Optionally, the user receives daily short text messages to remind him or her to use the program and reiterate program content.</p><p>Therapists can support participants with the program use following clinical judgment and discuss progress with them during face-to-face sessions. For this purpose, therapists will be introduced to the content of the program and the &#x0201c;therapist cockpit&#x0201d; in a three-hour workshop. In the therapist cockpit, therapists can track participants&#x02019; program use and symptomatic progress. In the workshops, therapists are informed that the program can be regarded as an adjunctive tool that need not influence the content of their face-to-face sessions. For continuous support, participating therapists can contact the program developer and owner (GAIA AG, Hamburg) by phone or email as required.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Control group: Psychotherapy without Deprexis</title><p>Patients in the control group receive regular psychotherapy, i.e., usually weekly one-hour sessions, according to the clinical judgment of the therapists.

At an &#x003b1; error level of .05 (two-tailed), a statistical power (1-Beta) of .80, and a correlation between pre- and post-measurements found in our earlier studies, we need to include 800 participants. This sample size calculation is conservative and is based on a current meta-analysis in which a mean effect of <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.28 for online depression programs was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since in the current study participants in both conditions will receive psychotherapy, a significant reduction of depressive symptoms can also be expected in the control condition. Therefore, a relatively small effect size between conditions, i.e., depression level after three months between <italic>deprexis</italic> plus psychotherapy vs. psychotherapy is expected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>Primary outcome is depressive symptoms assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory, second edition (BDI-II).

The WAI-short (WAI-S) is a 12-item self-report measure of Working Alliance. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale, with higher scores indicating higher alliance. The WAI-S is scored into three subscales measuring Task, Goal and Bond. The Task and Goal scales are intended to measure agreement between the client and therapist with regard to Tasks and Goals of the treatment. The Bond subscale aims to measure the empathic bond between the client and the therapist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Other measurements</title><p>Patients are self-reporting a number of demographic variables including sex, marital status, level of education.

Even though there is ample evidence for the efficiency and effectiveness of (guided) Internet-based interventions as well as for conventional psychotherapeutic treatments for depression, there are various strengths and limitations for both forms of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we will examine the effectiveness of psychotherapy plus a web-based online depression program (<italic>deprexis</italic>) versus traditional psychotherapy in routine care. We expect that depression levels of participants in the intervention group will be significantly lower after three months and after six months compared to the control group. Additionally, we will gain valuable experiences in combining an online psychological intervention with routine psychotherapeutic care.</p><p>A major strength of this study is that to the best of our knowledge, it will be the first study that tests whether an adjunctive web-based treatment tool in psychotherapy for depression can be successfully integrated in routine care and whether the combination will show additional effects compared to a regular psychotherapy for depression.</p><p>There are important limitations in the present study that should be mentioned: First, we adopted a crossed therapist design, i.e., a given therapist delivers the control as well as the experimental condition. This design is associated with potential drawbacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] but was necessary to choose in order to be able to run the study in routine care. In order to adjust for the potential downsides of this design, in the analyses we will control for therapist allegiance. Second, we will not have standardized assessments of depression diagnosis but rely solely on clinical diagnoses of experienced, licensed psychotherapists plus an online self-report diagnostic assessment. Third, in the present study, we will use <italic>deprexis</italic> as the only adjunctive web-based intervention tool. Therefore, generalizability of the results to other web-based interventions will be restricted.</p><p>In addition to the main analysis described in the methods section, our study will be able to address a number of other important research questions, some of which have not been addressed before. For example, we will be able to assess whether an adjunctive web-based treatment affects working alliance scores. Furthermore, we will assess attitudes towards blended psychological interventions from the patients&#x02019; as well as the therapists&#x02019; perspective.</p><p>If leading to a larger improvement, using effective web-based programs such as deprexis as an adjunctive treatment tool could be an interesting option to consider in future mental health care. Additionally, this study will also give first impressions whether blending face-to-face psychotherapy with a web-based adjunct will have negative side effects, i.e., symptom deterioration or decrease of the patient rated quality of the therapeutic alliance. In general, results of this study will provide an informative basis whether a combination of traditional face-to-face psychotherapy and web-based depression program is feasible and whether it is more effective compared to regular psychotherapeutic treatment in depressed outpatients in routine care.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p>Currently recruiting (N<sub>current</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28 as of 800).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests, with the following exception: BM is employed full-time as research director at Gaia AG, the company that developed and owns the <italic>deprexis</italic> program.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>BM, KS, AM and TB contributed to the study design.
