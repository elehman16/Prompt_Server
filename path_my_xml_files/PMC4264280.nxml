One of the most critical stages of women's lives is menopause.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Menopause is the cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular function, which is a recognized physiological event in women's lives. In addition to hormonal changes particularly reduction of estrogen levels with biological, psychological and social changes,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] a woman who has not experienced menstrual period within at least 12 months retrospectively is deemed to have entered the phase of menopause and the postmenopausal period starts from this moment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Depending on the disorder of ovarian function and therefore, lack of estrogen in the postmenopausal period, symptoms such as hot flashes, irritability, sleeping disorders, fatigue, anxiety and loss of concentration are observed in the early period. Risk of coronary artery disease and incidence rate of osteoporosis increase due to loss of protective effects of estrogen in the later period. These symptoms in the postmenopausal period affect the quality of life of women adversely. If we assume menopause age as beginning at 50, women spend one-third of their lives with the pathological changes they are exposed to in the postmenopausal period.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Earlier, the World Health Organization had reported that by 2003 there would be 1.2 billion women at and over age of 50. Therefore, although the menopause seems like a natural process, it is a period that must definitely be followed and treated.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] One of the aims of health for all in the 21st century is the improvement of the quality of life.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>As a physiological event, menopause has complications that influence women's quality of life. Several measures such as hormone therapy and non-pharmacological therapies are recommended to reduce menopausal symptoms and improve quality of life in this period.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Hormonal replacement treatment (HRT) is used as a standard therapy in menopausal treatment. The effect of exercise in preventing the postmenopausal symptoms as another aspect of treatment is widely accepted today. Postmenopausal symptoms can be prevented significantly by encouraging the women over middle age to gain the habit of exercising regularly.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Prior research has showed that postmenopausal women living in cities are more sedentary. Due to unbalanced and single type nourishment, weight gain is a common phenomenon in those living in rural areas. The weight increase, which depends on age, inactivity and hormone drugs used in menopause, is minimized by regular exercise and the burning of excess calories.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>In the literature, there are studies that research the effects of exercise on muscle strength, bone density and on the postmenopausal symptoms in the women in postmenopausal period.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In addition, the studies in which the effects of exercises on quality of life is researched, is insufficient.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In accordance, the objective of our study was to conduct an exercise program of 6 weeks and determine the changes on physical fitness levels and quality of life on postmenopausal women.</p><p>Our study is aimed to determine the effects of exercise on quality of life with a controlled exercise program of 8 weeks appropriate to the postmenopausal period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study included 80 volunteers in the postmenopausal period who received HRT.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of this study were:</p><p>

</p><p>This study was approved by Ethics Committee of Iran University of Medical Sciences.</p><p>Information about this study was provided to the subjects. Before being accepted into the study, each subject signed an informed consent form and obtained written permission from their physician. The researcher introduced the questionnaire to subjects and explained the material cover. It was explained to them that, if they preferred not to continue, they could withdraw from the study any time. After these explanations, the researchers gave the women the questionnaire.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized experimental trial with a control group. Postmenopausal women were randomly allocated by means of a random number table to one of two groups. Forty women in the first group were included into the 8-week aerobic exercise program and 40 women in the second group formed the non-exercise control group. The women in second group continued to take HRT and were not included in any exercise program.</p><p>Demographic characteristics were recorded. Quality of life was evaluated after 8 weeks in both groups.</p><p>Quality of life was evaluated by using the Nottingham Health profile (NPH). The NPH consisted of 38 yes/no items about health systems. Six different sub-sections of NPH included different numbers of questions with different scoring (physical mobility,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] pain,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] sleep,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] energy,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] social isolation[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and emotional reactions[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]). Each sub-section's maximum cumulative score total should be 100 (worst health) and minimum 0 (best health). There was no summary score.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The subjects were included in the exercise program for 8-week period with the frequency of 5 times a week. The program started with warming-up exercises consisting of stretching exercises and the 5-min low-intensity walking; warming-up exercises were followed by a program starting with 20 min and increasing up to 40 min at the end of 8 weeks. This program included the exercise detailed below: Bicycle for lower extremity endurance training for 5 to 15 min; exercise on the step board for lower extremity endurance for 2 to 6 min; posture exercises across a mirror for neck and back muscles (10 times); strengthening exercises with isoflex bands; free weights for back and abdominal muscles, pectoral, scapular muscles, and for upper-lower extremity muscles; balance exercise with trampoline for balance training; and flexibility exercise for pectoral, hamstring, gastro-cnemius-soleus, and back muscles.</p><p>The exercise program was completed with cooling exercises consisting of 5-min low-intensity walk on the treadmill. The exercise program with sub-maximal intensity was applied to the cases and a Borg scale was used in determining the intensity of the exercise. Exercise intensity was regulated by progressively increasing the repeating number, duration and endurance amounts of the exercises with the Borg scale follow-up.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 14.0.

The quality of life worsens in the postmenopausal period as a result of the physical, psychological and social problems that start with menopause. It is emphasized in many studies that in order to achieve the best results from HRT, this therapy should be combined with an exercise program.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] There are many studies indicating the negative effects of postmenopausal symptoms on quality of life. Luis Cobero, the President of Spain Gynecology and Obstetrics Association, had explained that the life qualities of postmenopausal women improve not only with HRT, but also with modifications in their diets, modifications in lifestyles, and regular physical activity.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>G&#x000fc;zeloglu applied NHP in order to establish the effects of osteoporosis in 50 postmenopausal women and reported that quality of life impairment increased with the duration of postmenopausal period. G&#x000fc;zeloglu emphasized that the reliability of NHP scale was rather high, and it could be used to evaluate the life quality of postmenopausal women.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>One intervention study concluded that fitness level and quality of life of postmenopausal women could be improved by a regular controlled exercise program of six weeks.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Elavsky found that physical activity and menopausal symptoms were related to physical self-worth and positive effect, and in turn, greater levels of physical self-worth and positive effect were associated with higher levels of menopause-related quality of life.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>We also used NHP to evaluate the quality of life. It was found that life quality improved for all the sub-items of NHP in exercise group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We concluded that quality of life could be improved with regular and controlled exercise of 8 weeks in postmenopausal women. When it is considered that our cases were not geriatric, our study has the properties of a protective treatment for these cases. The long-term effects of exercise on quality of life of our cases can be evaluated provided that the habit of exercising can be achieved by these individuals as a lifestyle. Studies that contain the data from this same group in subsequent years will be necessary for such an evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge financial support for this study by Iran University of Medical Sciences &#x00026; Health Services.
