A total of 63 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to clozapine group or risperidone group using computer-generated random number tables. Eight patients were lost to follow up.

Sanz-Fuentenebro and colleagues<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> compared clozapine with risperidone in patients with first-episode psychosis and suggested that clozapine might have a slightly superior efficacy initially in the treatment of first-episode treatment naive patients with schizophrenia. No published data are available from India. Hence, the current study was planned to compare effectiveness and safety of clozapine and risperidone in a group of treatment-naive, first-episode patients with schizophrenia.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>It was a comparative, open-label, prospective pilot study with intent to treat analysis. The patients were allocated to either of the group on the basis of computer-generated random table number. The patients were followed up for six months after initiation of treatment. Patients were inducted from out- and inpatients both attending the department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh, a tertiary care teaching hospital of north India. Patients with the diagnosis of schizophrenia as per the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) criteria<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, who gave informed written consent, and fulfilled inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study from December 2010 to June 2011, and the study was completed in January 2012. The consecutive patients of first-episode, treatment-naive schizophrenia, between the age group of 18 and 40 years, were included in the study. Patients having history of seizure disorder, heart conduction defects, history of agranulocytosis or total leucocyte counts (TLC) &#x0003c;3500/mm<sup>3</sup> and diabetes mellitus, neurological disorders, head injury, movement disorder, lactating or pregnant women, patients with comorbid substance dependence except nicotine and patients with subnormal intelligence were excluded from the study. The patients were allocated to either of the group on the basis of computer-generated random table number. The dosages of the respective drugs were kept in therapeutic range of 200-600 mg/day and 4-8 mg/day for clozapine and risperidone, respectively.</p><p>Clozapine was started at the dose of 12.5 mg and risperidone at 2 mg/day and efforts were made to reach an adequate dose in all the patients within one month of starting the treatment, and after reaching this dose, patients were observed for a period of four weeks<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. At the end of four weeks after achieving the adequate dose, if the response was not adequate [&#x0003c; 50% reduction in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)], then in these patients the dose of the respective drug was further increased depending on the serum levels of the concerned drug and attempt was made to bring the serum levels of both the drugs within therapeutic range. The effective levels for clozapine were taken as 200-300 &#x003bc;g/l<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and risperidone as 20-60 &#x003bc;g/l<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. However, those who did not respond to clozapine dose could be adjusted to reach a plasma level between 350 and 500 &#x003bc;g/l as per the Maudsley prescribing guidelines<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Patients who showed response to the drugs were continued as per the assessment schedule at one, two, four and at six months. Concomitant medications such as benzodiazepines for restlessness and sleep disturbances, anticholinergic drugs for extrapyramidal side effects and clonidine and amitriptyline for sialorrhoea were permitted wherever required and doses of such medications were documented in both the groups. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of patients were recorded in the prescribed proforma designed for the study.</p><p>TLC, differential leucocyte count, platelet count and absolute neutrophil counts were measured on weekly basis for initial 18 wk as per the Maudsley prescribing guidelines<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> for patients receiving clozapine and thereafter monthly. Measurements of body mass index, lipid profile, fasting blood sugar and serum drug levels were done at one, two, four and six months. The drug levels were measured by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography technique<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, and blood samples (3-5 ml) were collected into vacuum tubes in the morning, before the administration of morning dose. Besides these assessments, patients were on regular follow up after every two weeks, for six months.

All these scales were used in the morning before administration of morning dose. Patients were asked to bring the empty strips of medicines in both the groups during every follow up visit.</p><p>The confidentiality of the information obtained was maintained and the principles enunciated in the ICMR's ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human cases were adhered to<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.

The results showed that both clozapine and risperidone fared equally well in terms of reducing the positive symptoms whereas clozapine was significantly superior to risperidone in reduction of negative symptoms at each assessment.</p><p>Earlier studies carried out on clozapine versus typical antipsychotics did not find benefit of clozapine over conventional antipsychotics in patients of first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Girgis <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> studied 160 individuals with treatment-naive, first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder who were randomized to clozapine or chlorpromazine treatment for up to two years and reported no significant differences in the effectiveness of two drugs. However, the adherence to clozapine was better than chlorpromazine (26 vs. 10%, <italic>P</italic>=0.01). Woerner <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> while studying 34 cases of first episode of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder concluded that there was no benefit of clozapine over conventional antipsychotics for acute treatment of the first episode.</p><p>The Cochrane schizophrenia group performed a meta-analysis to compare several commonly used second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs, risperidone, olanzapine, clozapine, amisulpride and quetiapine) agents to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of these drugs in patients with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychoses<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, and the results showed that among the SGAs, no drug was better than the other. Since many patients included in the meta-analysis were on low or very low doses of clozapine, several had an upper limit of 400 mg/day and five studies used dosages under 210 mg/day; it could be possible that many patients did not receive therapeutic levels of clozapine resulting in poor outcome as compared to the present study. In a study by McEvoy <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 91 patients who discontinued treatment with olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone because of inadequate efficacy, were randomly assigned to open-label treatment with clozapine (n=49) or blinded treatment with another newer atypical antipsychotic not previously received. The results showed that the Negative Syndrome Scale and total scores decreased more in patients treated with clozapine than in patients treated with quetiapine or risperidone, and treatment discontinuation for any reason was significantly longer for clozapine.</p><p>In other studies, clozapine has been found to be effective in resolution of positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia patients and the average daily dose in these studies was between 523 and 600 mg/day<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. However, in our study, the mean dose of clozapine at six months was 289.28 mg/day.</p><p>In another study<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 30 patients of schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to receive clozapine or risperidone and the results showed that patients on clozapine adhered to their original treatment for a longer period than patients on risperidone. In our study also, only 6.6 per cent patients dropped out during six months of the study, and none was due to adverse effects of the drug. The high retention rate (93.4 %), for six months suggested better treatment adherence in clozapine group. The retention rate in case of risperidone during the same follow up period was 82.82 per cent as six patients dropped out within six months. One patient dropped out due to acute dystonia in first two weeks, another patient had akathisia and restlessness, three patients had extrapyramidal side effects and one patient dropped out due to unknown reason and shifted to another hospital.</p><p>Robinson <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> stated that neurological adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs was the main reason of treatment non-adherence and even relapse. Minzenberg <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> have argued that while the use of adjunctive anticholinergic medications can improve the tolerability of extrapyramidal symptoms, these agents are often associated with adverse cognitive effects and peripheral anticholinergic effects. In our study, on comparison between the two groups on total score on GASS, clozapine was superior to risperidone. On the metabolic parameters, patients in clozapine group had significant weight gain than the risperidone. This is in accordance with the findings reported in other studies<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>.</p><p>The present study had certain limitations. The sample size was low; being an open-label study, blinding could not be done; placebo arm could not be included due to ethical considerations. In addition, a follow up duration of six months may not be sufficient to interpret metabolic side effects of the drugs. Further, suicidality which is an important variable, could not be measured. The study had several strengths such as randomized sample, first-episode, treatment-naive schizophrenia patients, comparable baseline sociodemographic profile as well as psychopathology score, repeated assessments and follow ups.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study showed that clozapine was a better choice than risperidone in terms of efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of treatment-naive, first-episode schizophrenia. In view of these findings and no reports of leucopenia and agranulocytopenia, clozapine may have the potential to be the first-choice antipsychotic which would reduce the failure rates, along with the improvement in quality of life. Further studies on large samples need to be done to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold><italic>Conflicts of Interest:</italic></bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>R&#x000f6;ssler</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Salize</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>van Os</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Riecher-R&#x000f6;ssler</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Size of burden of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders</article-title><source>Eur Neuropsychopharmacol</source><year>2005</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>399</fpage><lpage>409</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15925493</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Van Kanmen</surname><given-names>DP</given-names></name><name><surname>Marder</surname><given-names>SR</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Sadock</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Sadock</surname><given-names>VA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Serotonin-dopamine antagonists</article-title><source>Kaplan &#x00026; Sadock's comprehensive textbook of psychiatry</source><year>2000</year><volume>2</volume><edition>8th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincot Williams &#x00026; Wilkins</publisher-name><fpage>2914</fpage><lpage>38</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kane</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Honigfeld</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Singer</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Meltzer</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clozapine for the treatment-resistant schizophrenic.
